Marine Corps marathon I Want to see where David I'm director finishes in the ... because\nAh they're a thousand possible points and thousands of people were playing mid term is over you your ... name in there somewhere but in any event the um again I Want to walk people through I think Arizona's a blow out first of all David ... has collapsed and there isn't much of a governor's campaign dah du she's going to win by more than double digits\nSecondly the early voting is our plus ten are plus ten\nThat is not necessarily going to hold up I cannot imagine a Republican voter voting for Christian cinema over Martha McSally like you might for example in a in West Virginia right maybe they like Joe mansion 'cause they've known Joe for a hundred years but\nA Republican voter in Arizona David ... is not going to vote for Christians cinema agree or disagree\nNo look I disagree I think it's very possible that you're going to find a moderate Republican woman in the Phoenix suburbs it's been a book of course the cinema as a register her complaint against Donald Trump I think it's very possible so\nThat we did a great I I think that is the most beltway the invention checking I talked about this pot and I talked about\nThis last week the invention in the beltway mind of a moderate Republican woman who is going to throw away their vote on a senator because they don't like Donald Trump I mean have you met such a plan\nYes I Know lots of that list sounds to me like the argument that there weren't such people that were gonna vote for Donald Trump because he was crazy and set up a bunch of weird things I've you\nKnow but it's completely different from that argument if the argument is I I haven't seen anyone yet and\nMaybe a report their name and we can get them on the air of a moderate Republican woman who is going to vote against Martha mix Sally the first female combat pilot because she doesn't like Donald Trump it doesn't make any sense it's irrational\nIt makes it makes it yeah we'll vote is not always what everybody thinks is rational but these sorts of things happen all the time they'll look I think Martha McSally\nA very likely could when I Am just saying that it is not incredulous that there are Republican women out there or some people they consider themselves Republicans that usually votes Republican for Congress that are going to go into the booth\nVote for Doug do see because they didn't Garcia is completely out a way but that went on a federal issue they're going to take a different mindset into the booth and they're going to say to themselves but I'm going to vote this way on this race I think it's possible\nI think I I think we see this all the time we're on on federal or state or federal issues voters make different calculations\nAnd so I just said don't rule it out and when you have polling it's anywhere from you know a few points this way to a few points that way it indicates that there's a close race but I think Martha McSally very well could win I like the crowds and it might have had a horrible few weeks\nAnd so I'm not going to be surprised when Sally wait let me just\nTell you ain't gonna win by ... which he wins by more than five points favorite director let's look back at this conversation because there is a close it isn't even close that's why I I have a problem with I don't know Manhattan audio late\nI don't think that's just do women have media elite look I talked to people in Arizona no race ... ... known excel you want her to win and they are the ones telling me this is a close race they're the ones that are not tell any do big blowout everybody's getting this wrong so\nSo not blow out five percent plus and I talked to the Republican pollsters that you talk to and and and when I see an NBC poll that is a hundred percent off I think to myself the media is trying to resuscitate a dead impact\nNot what happens that's not what happens it's just that a lot of these public pollsters don't know how to poll individual states I see this in West Virginia I see this in Nevada is specially Nevada all the time it's knowing\nJoined by Lani ... David and\nDance that they tell us over institution always someone what am I go to analysts as we get close to an election which is a week out line here look at the numbers I'm very very very optimistic about the Republicans in the Senate and I'm not resigned are losing their houses I was a month ago what say you\nYou I'm In exactly the same place as you are I think Republicans look very very good in the Senate\nFight this is something that we always thought\nWould happen as we got closer to the race that some of these races would settle out and I think we're seeing that for sure\nYou know the house is really a toss up I I think it's one of those things where it's very very difficult to predict exactly what the margin is going to be but I think Republicans are going to be competitive coming into the stretch right here on the house side but the Senate does look very good question about it\nNow what are the things that are that I Want to always report objective way my audience NBC embarrassed put out a full this morning that shows Kristin cinema up five points over Martha McSally now I have seen the internal polling from a Republican pollsters in Arizona the early voting was tense plots are\nThey use a five plus our model for the electorate and Martha McSally wins by five and a half percent under that model and so they're under estimating the actual Republican turnout and I do not believe Arizona is going to vote for radical and you know Arizona pretty well what do you think\n[laughter] right so I think there's a few factors you're the first of all absolutely the data I've seen as well from Arizona suggest that the early vote has come in a head of pace for Republicans in other words if you compare early vote in ... in two thousand any team versus early vote in two thousand sixteen\nUh things are looking favorable in two thousand Eighteen even as opposed to twenty sixteen cycle which was a ... which was a good cycle for Republicans in Arizona the second point is is just the fact that it just ...\nI I mean not only is this someone who has seen fit to\nCriticize Arizona and Arizona ends\nBut someone who's record is is really from the far left\nAnd I think when people really sit down and they think about what the choices are you've got Martha ... decorated combat veteran somebody who has represent the people of Arizona well\nVersus someone like his cinema who who's record is really quite out of touch\nI tend to think that even the late breaking voters will settle in favor of Martha McSally\nDon't get me wrong it's going to be a close race I think five is a little bit dramatic of a margin from Sally I think she when she with more in that two to three point range but I just have a very difficult time seeing the people of Arizona voting for care to send them some of his so fundamentally is out of touch with the value of the people at Arizona\nLonnie I don't know if you've played our mid term madness game yet but I'm hoping that you will go over to ... dot com and play because I well I I I I Believe the margin of victory the people have to pick the winners and twenty five race but they also have to pick margin of victory\nAnd I'm going to do plus for for Martha McSally which we have you know under one one to three and plus for\nA margin of victory and I think it's going to be so much easier than people believe ... but that there is a built in desire in the media\nI mean deeply ingrained almost subconscious to make racist competitive when they are not when they hit the wall and it sort of like Todd Akin hitting the wall in St Louis Christmas to them is the Democrats Todd Akin she just absolutely ran her boss right into our offer the Grand Canyon cliff and and there is no way\nTo recover from that psychotic and talking about voluntary rape um six years ago and you just can't come back from that\nLet me talk to them about the meta thing that's going on here Democrats were panicked or a week ago because the cabin on fact Israel and by the way it continues to be real ah people were disgusted by what they did to Brett Kavanaugh\nAlong comes the crazy bomber David French calls him a super fan I call him a deranged psychopath oceans Thirteen would be bombs and they were bombs to targets and then comes the neo Nazi Trump hating massacre of Pittsburgh Jews\nI think Democrats are hoping that the jar to the country will somehow jar the election and Catherine Rampell writes in the Washington Post saying this is almost ... to me\nThe White House says it's unfair to blame President Trump for our poisonous increasingly violent political atmosphere and you know what their rights Trump isn't to blame his entire party is because it never had the reckoning it needed after the twenty sixteen election\nNow I Believe she sincere and I believe most of the elite media believes that but I think that absolutely is repulsive to the ordinary American what do you think ...\nI I not only is it is it repulsive but it it it just defies reason this notion that somehow\nBecause you've got Republicans that have tried to work together with President Trump in advancing an agenda for the American people that somehow\nOr because they bear responsibility for what is clearly fundamentally the responsibility of arranged a man who set pipe bombs through the through the u._s. mail\nA and and and a and a person filled with hatred who\n... them committed in my mind and I forgive all act and so I look this is part of the media narrative you get it you understand it at some point it was always going to get here how is it that that folks in the media are going to figure out a way to try and blame Republicans to turn the election\nAnd I think you're I think you're seeing that now\nThe question is whether it's going to work or not and I'm just I'm I'm not sure that will uh I I mean I see the narrative out there I see a lot of people trying to make this case uh but I but I just don't see it I think at the end of the day it's election particularly on the house side\nIt's just going to be a whole lot closer than people think and you know we'll see what the outcome is but I I I I just think the American people are going to come back to the fundamentals here which are strong economy\nA lot of accomplishment that Republicans can rest their record on ... and you get a lot of Democrats running that are fundamentally out of touch\nAnd and I also believe always in the fundamental common sense of the American voter they realize if they don't like Donald Trump voting for example for Chris and send them a is not the response\nYou empower the responsible Republican Senate led by Mitch McConnell you don't empower radical left us\nAnd I think there is um a I'll call it the bounce back in fact people notice when they use aspirin for example in their nasal congestion the more you use it the worse it gets\nThe more you use crazy rhetoric the crazier gets ... off with Jake Tapper last night's among Sanders David Urban onset as well\nGive a listen to this cutting number six I have to\nTo agree with ... I think you know the fact that at one of the things that ... really launched his presidential run on and talking about Islamic radicals radicalization\nAnd this president has radicalized so many more people than I'd say that's not bad I mean the way he talks the wasteful waste is that says it is the way that stop\nRight there that was David Urban looking just amazed and perplexed as I did now she later apologized they stopped the show they let her come back and do it clean up on Iowa will be button on gay when you get stuff like that you realize the Democrats are enhanced\n[noise] yeah I mean this is the problem with with where we are now is that you know look we can all have a discussion about whether we would we could like the president\nAt times to today take a different taught I think that's entirely appropriate critique but\nFor some reason I think people on the left believe that it allows them to to say things that are completely ridiculous and by the way she thought the only one thing you know things like this notion of somehow a you know we ... we had a pair of what's happening\nWith his lot Islamic terrorism abroad to some of what we see here\nThe act you're despicable make no mistake but trying to draw these comparisons trying to to use these parallels to attack the president of the Republican Party is it is just off fake and I have to say I do think it is a function of the time we find ourselves in\nIs that it's rhetoric become acceptable\nWhen we play for you or Marsha Blackburn had a rally yesterday but she began when a moment of silence for the victims in Pittsburgh this is what happened cut number eight times [laughter]\nA radical\nLeftist interrupted a moment of silence for a for victims to do that and Marsha Blackburn was done she took to Twitter last night I think Tennessee will be revolted by this is why I think that\nThat crazy woman who did that are destroyed Phil Bredesen any chance of his coming back because it's it's scary it's actually kind of their unhinged\n[laughter] yeah I mean in in in that race in particular Phil Bredesen was already cooked you know if if he could be any more cooked after that I you know I mean he certainly is yeah I think I think I think\nPeople see that and they want it does is it makes clear for them what what the face of liberalism like it makes clear to them what the alternative is and it and it is scary look I think people people like checks and balances in general we seen this over and over again in American politics\nYou can call limit of electrical at eleven Seventy two I suggest going to Andrew anti dot com after a couple of questions\nThere'll be right back to yesterday I got slammed again down two hundred and forty five points the NASDAQ down a hundred and Seventeen and free market it's alright again there will be as off twenty than ... than fifty four and the Dow is off another two hundred and Seventy seven the correction continues\nI'll be right back America say turn Andrew and Todd dot com during the break into your your child [noise]\n\nCheese\nIs [noise] [noise]\nYou're in the middle of a nonstop action packed information let's see she was Jewish coming right back [noise]\nI hear your for home advisor dot com I thinking about all those old projects you didn't work out over the summer you just never got around to doing\nI Know I Am there are a whole bunch of inches but never got replaced I didn't waste any time on that because I knew eventually I just got a home advisor dot com and tell them what I needed there really is no job to bigger too small and currently right now in the process of hiring a professional from ... to come and work on the bench is\nAll it takes a few quick questions in your match with the best probes in your area for the job I was able to read review check a male ability for pros in my area it really is so simple with home advisors project costs guide you can also check what\nOther paid workers similar job junior area so you know you're getting a fair price no matter what whole project you're thinking about putting in a new carpet installing new windows even something big like a bathroom overall even fixing those hinges on your book shelves like me home advisor makes it easier finding hire the best pros and you're buying great prose not ahead of your jobs you can kick back\nAnd relax go home advisor dot com or download the free out to get started on your next project that's home advisor dot\nCom that is just a shoo shoo shoo [noise]\nIf you're advisor or to insurance rap is recommending an annuity or you're considering purchasing any retirement products and you should always get a second opinion makes sure your decisions appropriately man cost effective for your personal retirement situation called us energy grew before\nYou move your four O. one K.
