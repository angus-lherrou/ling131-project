by David I'm drunk or of the Washington Examiner you also see him on CNN David Early voting begins in Tennessee next week next week in Tennessee you just bought his story Marsha Blackburn got a big town ... because of the cabinet firings why\nWell because it sort of awake and they leave the Republican vote but the more than that\nEspecially in Tennessee with the bread is any kind of a unicorn Democrat who Republicans really do like Tennessee and really did have a record of senses and is it it it\nIt sort of brought out in the election which is if you're voting for bread and your ability or possibly a Democratic Senate so Marsha Blackburn had I had a hard time\nMaking that case a for all sorts of reasons and the camera is you're just basically make the case or and it helps and it's the work to it and the partisanship that we would expect to see in a presidential election\nAnd that's what it's been such a big deal in the Senate races which are taking place in with a look at states like Trump\nAnd that's why it in such a problem for Senate Democrats and why it has probably taken it set it off the table for them so they just you know with does it does the atmosphere\nAnd about ten days or so revert back to the need for what the term cycle has been and I would lose that from happening simply because\nSeen it before and twenty six to eight at the Access Hollywood tape and mid October and three weeks later Trump wins the election so I don't like to make blanket predictions but right now this is why it's looking really good for black or in Tennessee and Republicans in others than it is\nYeah I think when you're able to make the argument that a vote for ... is a vote for Schumer is a vote for Dianne Feinstein is a vote for Cory Booker is a vote for Sheldon Whitehouse and it's ... ... is a vote for Mazie Hirono that it's very easy to remind people\nThat for thirty days it's hard to do that for a year but it's very easy to do that for thirty days and I don't think it's just Tennessee I think North Dakota is locked up\nI think Donald he's having trouble Holly had a big surge and now we have a hurricane down in Florida Rick Scott is going to be all over doing the Rick Scott thing is very good at this I think it's going to help him to am I missing any places where it's helping well look\nI I'm helping Ted Cruz in Texas it's helping Republican Senate candidates anywhere where the state is inclined to vote or a Republican\nBut where you know for atmosphere reasons and for candidate believes in the states will flirting with Democrats and I look I was in Indiana and North Dakota in August that on and I thought those two candidates\nAre those two Democratic it's almost Donnelly and and I can't afford it trouble the dollar has been hanging around the high camp I think it's been behind and if they just really is a duck punch a Dali those and hanging around the ... theory should help on\nA create some distance we'll see if it does I'm Jon Tester in Montana the other one who had managed to\nWhen he's always a very good candidate to sway people underestimate him he had kept distance between him and Rosendale an outlaw Neal is caught him and I think that this has helped so anywhere where the playing field is designed to elect Republicans I'm an intellect and easily especially I think this is going to help\nIn swing states like Florida I think it's an open question the atmosphere are still generally favor Democrats and this is a state that swings with the wind is one of the reasons why I think when you look in Ohio and Pennsylvania the Senate races are still off the table\nYou know then it is eight or a lead allegation the Democrats were using this as a talking point but the mob rule it's not as I was angry about that before I was I was shocked when they broke through the barricades at the Supreme Court the videos of the anti Obama in Portland went viral yesterday I just think people have had it\nWith the intimidation politics of the ... really had just had it and are going to vote Republican as a rebuke to that more than they were going to vote against Donald Trump for his occasional cruelty and his bowling the China shop stuff they're really angry at those politics on the hill or am I right am I wrong\nWell I think it depends on where the voters are I think you're right where the voters are inclined to vote Republican and where the partisanship is designed that way I think you still have a lot of house district and you have some of these swing states where the president still going to dominate\nAnd and I think that you know for for for Democrats that the danger in this thing lasting is that they lose the ads they have had with independence or what the Republicans and President Trump and said you all partisan and we've had enough of you I mean that's just been the view\nAnd it's replaced by looking at a Democrats and saying basically there's no difference between you and them so maybe I'll vote for him maybe I'll maybe I'll vote for Republicans\nMaybe I stay home and that and that's that's the danger for Democrats I don't think that in a midterm cycle I'm\nThat we've gotten this far along that the the the apple carts than it would be completely\nReverse and you're just going to have the review\nSwitch the other way but I think it's going to\nInclude model um the battlefield\nAnd it could reduce the number of seats Democrats to pick up possibly enough but they don't win the house majority or they end up winning house majority but by just a few seats\nTwenty five closest races in
