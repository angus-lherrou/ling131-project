five five six four five three deer phone calls here's Len Len thanks for hanging out with us how are you\nI might find good good you know we keep saying that uh the FBI does not come to conclusions they just record the activities of the accused however with told me when a investigating Hillary\nA came out with this big announcement that they come to the conclusion that there was no no no prosecutor would bring charges against her go\nTo a good point I mean it's you know it is I mean we have to remember that but this amounts to as a as a seven background check this is not the kind of\nFBI investigation or special Bob Mueller as special counsel dragging on and on and carrying on for this is a background investigation and this was interviewing people putting in a report what they said finally if there's any cooperation looking at the corroborating witnesses talking to them and put it in a report it given it to the Senate Judiciary committee that's all it is\nAnd and that's I'm not going to be satisfied anybody as we progress as I think but maybe it will be enough for some senators to vote yes including a couple of Democrats crushed welcome how are you crush\nI'm doing well my\nPoint I wanted to bring up was a personal one where my mom was sexually assaulted in the worst matter and I won't use the word you can imagine what I'm Talking about or and or almost put a put away and murdered and um she she had something with me the other day about Dr Ford that really made a lot of sense she said\nThe testimony where she talks about going into the supermarket to say hello to um the accuser or one of the accuses that would never happen\nThat would never happen my mother couldn't even go into a shopping mall for years and could not what she had to face the accuser in court and and in a line up\nWas shared your she's not going to say Hi to the guy in a grocery store not going to say Hi to the guy had written about it why would you\nDid you hear the Lindsey Graham line about the the woman who claimed that she witnessed gang rapes going on at ten parties after the first one do you think you'd go back nine more times\nYou got if you're watching my ideas\nYeah lots of ... lots of questions on very reluctant to question the credibility of an accuser only because I'm mindful that and I said there's a million times there are lots of women who've been abused and sexually assaulted they had no corroborate should and they were utterly alone\nThey lost their jobs they've lost their careers you've heard the stories and uh\nYou know you can't read these stories and hear about some of these accounts\nEven yesterday Jeff Flake was at some event in Boston we are going to play some video and audio from that but uh that's why I think Jeff Flake is a is a no he's playing to the media does play into his Democrat friends and there were a bunch of people standing in the front rows of whatever event he was at in Boston holding up signs saying I was a sexual assault survivor\nOr I'm a survivor or something like that and and honest to goodness I I I I feel great compassion for anybody who has been assaulted who's been attacked to has been um victimized and they got nowhere to go uh\nAnd and they work maybe in a in a ... that happened in the workplace and had a powerful man who did this to them and they got nowhere to go um in in but the problem is it's a double edged sword\nNow you you have a woman coming forward late in the game because of the Democrats the eleventh hour making ...\nAccusation that has been countered by the passionate fiery response of of Brett Kavanaugh that makes people think that's exactly what I was like if I were falsely accused pat your next up on the calendar she'll get a lot of trying to get as

five percent said no they shouldn't have delay the way they should have voted right away and I was shocked I mean in my opinion is the best candidate we've had for Supreme Court in my lifetime based on his record\nBased on the fact he knows the government based on his judicial history this guy is a class by himself\nA reason to them and the Democrats terrible were flailing Dan is because they know how qualified he is it simply about judicial philosophy I watch Chris Coons this morning the Democrat who's now joined at the hip with Jeff Flake and\nThere's something going on the road and

return address leading them to believe it came from the sailor whose name has not yet been disclosed but they are on it and uh\nI'm confident that law enforcement will get to a conclusion of this but I Want to get in and this is reminiscent to me of when the board Bernie Sanders supporter gunned down Steve skull eastern tried to kill a bunch of Republican congressmen\nOn that baseball feel this is what's so dangerous about the get in your face strategy and this is what is one of the shameful aspects of the way the Democrats had been behaving through this whole judge Kavanaugh process through the political\nBattles that we're fighting with Maxine Waters and Iraq Obama and other leading Democrats encourage people to fight and get into one another's faces and\nScream and yell and corner people on elevators and chase them out of restaurants there is a dangerous dangerous aspect\nTo that if you're responsible ended his wrecked listens and it it really is is is vital for the Democrats

hoping and praying that that frustration and that anger and that rage is going to be\nIs going to absolutely translate to a red wave on November six I really feel I I don't know what's gonna

there are reports that the FBI could wrap up the capital investigation by today that of course isn't going to be sufficient for the Democrats are going to play a game and they've been playing a

place to buy a I'd like\nTo build the world to give the world a coke in perfect ... you know but who should watch savannah Guthrie\nExposed with Chris Coons and the fallacy of the Democrats wanting an FBI investigation seventh background check show that they can decide whether or not Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed to the U.S Supreme Court\nOur getting ... getting that latter Eighteen year old or Seventeen year old Kevin wrote about his age we don't give me a break and they've I think what it is that's really what we're getting into that really fair if it really valid that collection for find what\nMust have anti when Dr Ford came forward um with what President Trump despite described as a credible and compelling testimony ah I thought and\nUh my friend Jeff I thought that that deserves a brief a weeklong further investigation to show the victims of sexual assault in this country that we take that seriously and it's worth investigating I Do think whether or not\nUm he testified truthfully to the committee is a question before us I'm the FBI isn't going to reach conclusions they are going to deliver facts from further questioning and then when the Senate are going to have to make an ultimate decision I'm On a Democrat I think it was important we work together to accomplish that yeah\nDefinitely I mean ... they were already going to vote against hatch cabin I
