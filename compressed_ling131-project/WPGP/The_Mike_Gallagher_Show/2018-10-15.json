stall asked the president about\nThis uh the possibility that the Saudi Arabians that the Saudis rather killed a Washington Post journalist in the embassy in Turkey the guy was seen going in and he'd been a critic of the king and the Saudi hierarchy and a key\nWent into the embassy and was never seen coming out now there's a report that he actually recorded his own killing on his apple watch\nSomething about the way the old watches connected to the cloud and he had a recording going and the authorities the uh figured out a way to get it off the cloud it's just awful and the president was very very strong in condemning\nOr the possibility that he was that this man was murdered years ... number one this is of audio and video courtesy of CBS is sixty minutes and gravy ...\nHow everybody what to take care you know that there's a lot to say there's a lot at stake and [noise]\nMaybe especially sell because this man was a reporter\nTo something you'll be surprised me say that if something really terrible and disgusting about that if that were the case so we're gonna have to say we're going to get to the bottom of it and then we'll be severe punishment\nI mean he's very strong and in his condemnation has very forceful denunciation of what could possibly be the Saudis I'm Marie and this guy in their embassy but the\nBottom line here is that the ... the president cannot get a break from the media and we get that we understand that I liked watching the CNN or the sixty minutes interview last night because frankly I kept saying to myself\nAnd this was a a point I made this morning with a with a buddy of mine if you've been in a coma and you woke up yesterday just in time to watch the sixty minutes interview you think wow this guy's a breath of fresh air to the American people really electric I like this\nLook at the issue of climate change\nPeople on the left are so worried about the condition of the planet and I shouldn't say people on the left a lot of us are worried we're not oblivious just because some of his happened to be conservative doesn't mean\nWe're we want the planet to be harmed by any man made the\nFormula now\n... you look at the condition I mean anecdotally pollution rates are so low um smog in Los Angeles things of the past you see things that are ... definitely changing emission standards are so high right now we're careful as a culture\nAbout what we put it into the air and the water we really are way more than we used to be is it enough well people get\nApoplectic about climate change used to be called global warming now they changed the climate change and the president's address last night to Leslie stall sort of suggested the way\nI Believe most normal Americans feel on this difficult subject yeah things might be changing they'll change back\nThey too hot it's too cold it's jus mild has to drive to wet that's what the climate does what the president and the president acknowledged last night on sixty minutes\nThat you know maybe it's not a hoax it's not necessarily a hoax he's just not sure that managed to blame\nFor climate change and furthermore he said it's going to all change back was his when he said and again this to me is what normal people kind of think this is the way people talk this is the way people feel most of us aren't activists\nMost of us aren't extreme on one side or the other and there's a lot of extremists in the climate change controversy let's listen to gather to what the president said cut number two again from this uh really extensive\nPretty comprehensive chat that the president had with Leslie stall of sixty minutes\nAnd you still think that climate change is a hoax [noise] but I think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um\nI don't want to give trends and trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put at a disadvantage I Wish you can go to Greenland\nI watch this huge chunks of ice just falling into the ocean or anything to the level and a you don't know whether or not that could have happened with or without man you don't know we hear scientists your scientific now advises us that disagree with that you know I I was thinking\nMight have his hat now I've seen the hurricane situations I change my mind that really is climate change and I thought what an impact\nWhat an ... I'm not denying climate change but it could very well go back you know we're talking about that is they say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than what we just had with like all those tests that they say when they say that and the ... what about the scientists say it's worse than ever\nUh [noise] you have to show me the scientist because they have a very big political agenda us like campaign finance is also has a political agenda\n... he he talks like normal people talk frankly he talks like we talk he thinks like we think\nThere are scientists who are divided on this subject there's no settled science here he is right for every scientist who will tell you the United states of America is creating them contributing to the demise of the planet and the polar bears aren't going to have any ice in ten years\nYou can find another scientist says no no\nNot true there's all these different patterns and it's there's no direct attribution or proof that man is contributing to the destruction of the planet that's rhetoric and that's hyperbole I'm not a scientist I don't know the answer I don't I don't I don't pretend to I'm just telling you there is a debate there's an ongoing debate\nAnd it's okay to acknowledge that there's ongoing debate yeah the climate is changing their hurricanes it's wet it's dry it's hot it's cold you know I mean\nAll this stuff that has thrown I bought a thrown out by people who worship at the altar of climate change is refuted and again I don't know what site is right\nThe president doesn't either he's just not sure man is causing climate change so those are the kinds of things that this president says that are refreshing that are appealing the\nRasmussen daily tracking presidential poll came out today he's he's holding steady
