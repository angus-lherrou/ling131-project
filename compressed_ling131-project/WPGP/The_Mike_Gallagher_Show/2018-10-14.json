{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WPGP", "content": "Roy again another we're to talk to about re purpose in your financial strategy and that's the third or just fine okay we're going to talk about Jimmy Fallon says I saw that Web MD is being sold over three point eight billion\nOwner said he was getting tired but Web MD said it could be either be go oh you were ... ... purchasing\nJust as Web MD is talking about their your financial strategy think about what you're up against right now but can you walk into your favorite of\nThe park bench or you walk into your favorite sporting goods store and there's an item that you worry or a biker or a ... lot of motorcycle guy just a few riding the bike trails you get a good bike or you've been looking at this by going on and on the floor there forever and it's expensive it's a couple of thousand dollars\nYou know or you know walking their pay for that at all time high are you going away for that\nBy going to do was right now the market is at an all time high when I look at the market it scares me as to where it is\nRelative to where it probably will be in a year or two if that doesn't go against your grade if it if it's not what you've heard if you were raised her differently you don't buy into the market when it's at a high you buy in when the markets that will lower time is scares me that some of these people were throwing so much money into the more specially\nThe money that they're going to be determined there'll be determined they need for income in retirement\nWell and and this isn't to insult anybody is listening but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that the market is overpriced and at some point reality is going to be priced back in\nThe if you're close to retirement and you're being told to be conservative by putting all the money into bonds you bond funds be very careful with that orange or traded on the stock market they are not fixed instruments the way that we look at it truly was fixed ... should be\nRe think that strategy and that's what we're talking about in this segment refurbishing your financial strategy in return\nYeah and re purpose could mean a couple of different things that you know you're asking yourself\nWhat should I Do read purpose might be okay look I'm not going to go out and leave the market or you know we've seen a doubt on twenty two thousand essentially here from a low of sixty seven hundred folks back in March of two thousand nine those are ridiculous type growth numbers in a short period of time\nRelatively speaking so I'm not saying that all you need to go out and employ the ostrich strategy where you're just going to throw your head and the sad\nUm you know and I'm trying to get through this whole statement that now wondering if I have ... 'cause I Am tired from a night but I ... I had a chance at all it is\nAs I as I struggle through this you know I I think of the fact that who really could get burned\nThose passive type investors that the ...\nPull that have real that rely on the index fund the numbers don't lie if you're a long long term investor your Fifteen or twenty year investor you're passive strategy you just owning maybe three core index funds low cost set it and forget it that's probably going to work\nBut when you make that change and say look I'm a retirement investor I'm now on a fixed income I now have a shorter time horizon than I had when I started investing and the markets at an all time high\nThose are the things that you can't be holding and just sitting on and hoping are going to work out maybe you need to employ an active strategy you know maybe you need to move into even though the costs might go up temporarily you might need to consider look I might need a money manager who has a more conservative bent\nA and certainly unbiased and saying that because that's what we do here at the synergy group but maybe building a portfolio that can stay in the market but kind of\nSo that if you wake up in the morning and someone is through a a bomb and did the New York city and I you know I hate to use that and I don't say slovenly but\nUh you know the fact of the matter is if that happened then your money is already planned in terms of how it will be moved around rather than just sitting in some type of passive investment so you need to rethink and re purpose your financial strategy for the times that we live on and is that we live in here and it's time\nTo look at diversification in a broader sense there'll be on just stocks and bonds\nThat you pointed out the key issue and bonds especially and mutual funds you might need to rethink moving to individual bonds instead of one finds or international bonds or or more high yield bond that sometimes with\nCary higher risk but you have to look at this environment and you might need to get rid of bonds altogether this is where the folks that say look let's throw annuities in the garbage because they lock your money up because they're too confusing are really dealing in my opinion a disservice to their clients because not everybody needs an annuity\nBut uh nobody could be a great bond replacement for providing that five six percent type of guaranteed predictable income with principle protection when we're talking about the sex type of options that can't be provided and areas that it used to be able to be provided so\nI mean I don't know if you're sitting out there and saying look I'm On the right track or not but I Will tell you that you probably need some fresh ideas\nHow to allocate your assets because it is different now in retirement than it used to be and trying to figure out this figure this out on your own is difficult so we're here\nEight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three eight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three if nothing else\nThat down have a cup of coffee to figure out the steps that you can take the choices that you can make that put these improvements in place that you can kind of get a where you need to be and half protection um and and we can show you how to re purpose\nThe best part is is you make the decision we don't pressure we just give you the information eight hundred\nThree to one Seventy nine sixty three\nYeah I think it's important to restate that our philosophy our retirement philosophy that we've used with clients goes well beyond just stocks and bonds like you were saying Jay there's so many other\nInvestment options out there that ad predictability especially when it comes to this income planning peace and if you do want some fresh ideas on how to allocate your assets\nCertainly you are open to advice that his tailored specifically for you so if you're retired or retiring within the next ten years give us a call request to visit with our team eight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three you need to get your\nIncome retirement plan review today and that includes a risk analysis on your current position that includes the analysis on your current positions as well because you want to make sure that you reduce these an arrest in retirement as well as bill debt income plan that you cannot outlay\nI Want to go back to which I was talking about just the ... to go in and just talking about the changing rules the retirement and financial planning in general that's one of the things that we bring to the great discussion and the return of my classes that we can duck\nAnd if you're out there saying how can I be better prepared for retirement\nInvest two or three evenings with us in one of those retirement class was there'll be a pit there'll be a community college there'll be a Penn State will be scattered throughout the geography but what a wonderful way to get a better understanding of all the rules are changed and what you might be doing\nThe day or to make sure that your retirement even if it's two or three years from now a little bit better\nSee those classes listed on the Web site at synergy group Inc dot com and again you can bumper on the website a little bit but what are the events that you'll see where we're going to be a ... or workshop or the classes and invest some time in yourself\nTo make sure that retirements as good as it can be ... and it shouldn't just be dad that comes should be mom and dad that come sitting there because as a team you're going to walk through retirement you're going to talk about Social Security decisions required to them distribution decisions charitable decisions gifting decisions as a team\nYou should take the time as a team to learn the\nFolks you've been listening to locks on your retirement today we've discussed the three keys to everlasting income let me remind you what those are will do a quick\nRecap the three keys to everlasting income number one income diversification\nNumber you know your number what your retirement income number needs to be and finally re purpose in your investment strategy\nNot doing the same type of investing that you did that guy duty retirement now you need to make it last and and distributed over your lifetime let me say this J I think there might be one more key to everlasting income and that would be working with the right he\nYeah I mean I think that's big you know working with a team\nWho puts your interests first you know who works under that has to do share a standard who uh is going to look at the whole market place not a group of proprietary products that are sitting up on a shelf but an independent uh advisor who acts as a fiduciary are and who works with the entire marketplace\nIt doesn't take a product off the shelf unless the client after reviewing it says take the product of the show\nI mean I I think that somebody that is focused on retirement and and I say that that you know our focus is on retirement by looking at the clients that we serve\nOr not because we've gone to school for a special license uh it's because that's where we spend our days that's where we spend our time or helping people\nJust like you were listening out there who are concerned about running out of money who are concerned that the markets over inflated who are concerned that the bank or basically pays them you know a bag of peanuts the hold their money at that those are those are big issues those are real issues and we have real solutions and big solutions\nTo help fix them so again you know knowing that there is a group that is what you're looking for out there a group of advisors who are committed to you\nI'm and dealing with this retirement issue and the challenges that you're concerned with you've just got to take the first step eight hundred three to one\nSeventy nine sixty three no pressure know costs that just the conversation to figure out maybe what you could do different let you go home and think about that and if you want to follow up on it you'll take that next step but it's not your get great information\nAnd to me it's kind of the gold standard of probiotic and you need to remember many people are taking probiotics\nBecause the gut Flora is a mess from not being able to digest the food so the probiotic is a band aid and it's never going to really give the help they're looking for until they get on pancreatic enzymes\nPep sin and detain hydro chloride so now there is sure they can digest the food\nAnd they stop dumping rotting food into the G I tracked argue with me yes yes I Am\nGood okay well I Hope that helps you I Know this is a confusing subject to a lot of people and\nSome people think the most important thing is how many billion colony forming units they have and it could be important\nBut we cannot tell reliably how many of those organisms will come back to life and it has a great deal to do with your own GI tracked so Byman as bad they don't come back to life well\nOkay All right but if they care I can find\n\nWelcome to house line right back to you every Saturday at this same time your doctor by my shelf THC

they get an idea of what's going on\nAnd much much more cue and labs dot com\nAnd don't forget every day we come to you got a special and a little bit of teaching and today we're gonna talk about hair skin and nails\nAnd you know as we age often we're having trouble with our hair skin or nails and often all it's available to us is some kind of college and product\nWhen we're already over eating protein [laughter] so that doesn't make any sense as an answer what we really need is something that gives them missing ingredient and the missing ingredient is soluble lies form of carrot and\nThen we derived that from shapes role it's got some really great studies showing that it's an important structural protein and that it really delivers the goods it effectively ship ports skin moisture\nElasticity in contact with us as well as overall hair and nail health in spring wow\nAnd you know most products as I said earlier or from chicken college and well\nLittle if any help because we're already getting so much protein as a nation typically most people need to\nCut down because they're not doing enough physical activity to ...\nTo um deserve or for the body to use that much protein in you know as we age the skin sins or the hair and nails have increasing difficulty in getting this carrot and the need and that's because it's got to go through the liver\nAnd you guys are reading too much of those refined oils\nAnd that's the thing we want to really get a lid on that supposedly heart healthy olive oil coconut oil all look and of course canola oil and the\nAnd the other oils anytime they press on oil you got a problem so our goal is to cut those down at the same time you support the hair skin ills and\nJust won five hundred milligrams capsule per day is going to be all you need if you're under a hundred or two hundred pounds and if you're over two hundred pounds you got to use it leads to capsules and if you're in a hurry to a good idea to use to capsules for maybe a month or so and then cut back to one capsule and so of course\nOur hair skin and nails there's going to be on special today so you'll buy to get twenty five percent off each and we're going to cover many other things that you can do\nTo support the skin including dealing with blemishes non cystic acme so uh we'll cover more of that right now we're going to go and begin answering your nutrition and health related questions\nLet's go to Delia in Oregon and she's got some questions about heavy metal go right ahead Delia\nYes I'd like to um find out what you have to win the heavy ... from the body\nHeavy metals that there's three steps to dealing with heavy metals the first step is to stop being exposed the best you can\nAnd that one of my favorite things to do that is a calcium aluminum silly Kate clay unlike the players that are out there typically they're mostly sodium\nThis guy can trap up to Ninety eight percent of all the weird things that can be in food from insecticides pesticides all manner of junk and so we called this I'm dragging plans LAX\nAnd you would take to cap shows an empty it into a cup with about six eight ounces of water and you want to drink that while you eat your main meal and what this does is it transits the intestinal track\nAnd it traps all of these guys that normally\nWould attach to calcium bonding sites\nAll the toxins it never leaves the intestine\nIt's just the ideal first step when you're detox seeing the body okay the next step is to do mild things don't remember I said zero you got to stop exposure so for you Delia that could mean\nIn that you um have silver filling in your mouth you have children feelings\nThat you had them removed okay so now you have white stuff right okay well the whites that sadly excrete aluminum so you still have a problem so the clay is going to be very helpful there\nAnd also will want to do something to minimize your exposure there what I Would recommend is that you leave those feelings in place\nAnd you have them carries died stained every six months when you have your teeth cleaned and the ones that fail you want to replace them with low fusing ceramic so you'll need to look around in your area\nTo find someone who can do this work you can always call a cure a practitioner usually they work with a dentist and they'll be able to tell you you can also look in the yellow pages and for a dentist who says he has a machine called sheer act\nC. E. R. E. C. where they're able to mail a block of low fusing ceramic literally identical to your own tooth\nChair side so with only a single in as the decision\nThey can replace a an in lay on late or crown and that is twenty first century dentistry so we need to deal with that our next favorite thing for promoting the health of the body in detoxification would be Mehdi ...\nThat is a very gentle\nForm of ... instead of being full garrick\nFor ... and it really seems to be a wonderful a help in what you would want is to just maybe take one for a day so that it's mild and very easy it doesn't push too hard on the body\nAnd there are even stronger things but if we were to use those I think what you should do is be visiting with a cure a practitioner because they can test you and make sure it's not too much for you and make sure that you have the right dose\nBe to get a roller ph paper and I don't know what state your kidneys or in whether you get like swelling or any pain or any your show I\nKnow I'm In good health\nKidneys are good okay but then you had to be able to jump on the edge trail and you should also be able to take about four\nOr bone and joins support these are for sick bone and for a few ferocious um has has all the players that the body needs\nSo our goal of course is to get the first morning you were in ph into the Green Zone\nExploit four to seven point out now the three sad the tour is number one kidney number to Paris arid most common answer ferrets arid we can usually get it done with a couple of ... ... if you'd kidneys are good we won't even go there\nThen we'll start checking every three days and see if we can move this ph usually when you're severely honesty a product\nYou ph will actually showed blew a which means uh the body is producing ammonia the mineral status is so poor so so what happens is in within a couple of days it crashes down to orange around five\nAnd then it starts working its way up\nAnd if we don't have any infection anywhere it works its way up beautifully\nIf we have infection will get closed and it'll balance in and now it won't hold and there you might have gum infection you might have the dead twos you may have some other problem\nAnd if that's the case you by all means get to a cure a person they'll test you they'll be able to help the dentist tell them exactly what do they will be able to tell them whether it's dead or it's just infected they'll be able to tell the gum or what area of the gums if it's not all of them\nSo they can help you accelerate youth through this process is before you start breaking everything\nRight and ... and see what most people don't understand about bone\nIs the life essence is the bone you know the scriptures say the life is in the blood that is true but the blood has come from the bone [laughter]\nSo I I totally understand okay excellent okay how are cut doctor French able to shed but okay\nLet's go to William and are being California or Texas\nOr in Irving, Texas I'm Sorry and he's got a friend who's livers pretty down the road of ways here and a ... is well you know there's certainly a big limit to what nutrition can do and all however\nHaving said that there may also be a scarred trauma or injury that is the dating the healthy energy flow delivers so it's getting next to nothing of the nutrition it\nMay need how old is your friend and how much did they way they male or female\nOr male here it is a approaching late late fifties probably early sixties okay and ... or ... or the right side of it is quite distended uh and uh that's fine I think it is good I don't have the same situation when he was a when he was around that age\nSure and matter of fact he told me what his position told him I see and then I Would just I Know well they make a he was he did a lot of a hard hard drugs\nAs saying well you certainly would not be hurt by trying something like liver support and ah if you know how much does the guy way do you\nKnow a hundred hundred and ... one of the same one sixty five and one of the long there\nSo I Would probably want to use about six for meal\nAnd see if this isn't a big help but you know a lot of times the abdominal this tension is nothing more than ... years of not being able to digest the food so if he got on some of them died just maybe it takes two of those when he eats a meal at the start of the meal on the end of the meal\nHe would take me it'd be for a detain ... now he's digesting or like you did in his twenties\nSo delivers not happening to endure rotting food and that along with delivers support might help him it's certainly worth a try to see if it'll give them a little better quality of life\nOkay but I Believe have been a matter of a doctor and already met had the diagnosis but I wanted to call you if there was something that we can do\nWell and even ... even if he does he's still got to do something to help the or to help deliver and it's not going to be a drug [laughter] okay I understand

forty seven that's eight hundred three Seventy thirty four\nForty seven All right let's go right to the phones let's go to Robert in California and he's had poor circulation his hands and feet since childhood\nAre you there Robert Yes sir how old a man or even how much do you weigh\nI'm forty three years old way what is it\nOK well lots of times they hands and feet are cold because of the adrenal glands you're not producing a an ideal amount of adrenaline that's one thing it's possible that you've had a circulation issue\nThat is possible but it's unlikely so first thing we would look at\nWould be what do we need to do to promote the best adrenal function and so there you know there's a laundry list of things these drills need\nBut in particular a number one they want a about half your weight you know says of water so if you're a hundred and fifty eight let's call it a hundred and sixty you'd need about eight ounces of water per day how you doing on getting that Robert\nExcellent good okay then the next issue is a little bit of salt and here we would like air dried sea salt or even better yet or pinks all which is\nHow to stop for the last few years\nOkay I'm a ... that I wouldn't be my favorite SALT I would ever do you go to an air dried sea salt\nUm and what you want to do is break a sweat from time to time so you can taste the frustration at the upper outer part of your arm it should taste slightly salty if so salt is perfect\nOkay next issue is in the course since childhood I don't think there's any problem with iron because you are normally this problem develops over the years as a result of eating white flour in white sugar\nAnd so if you've had this from since you were a little kid then I'm not thinking that we've got to worry about iron so let's move on and then we go to be vitamins now\nYou could be in trouble here if you were a bit of the sugar hall lake as a child did you eat a lot of sweets as a kitten\nA latch not okay do you know if you were breast fed to term I I was much faster so at least twelve months yes or no good\nSo you should be able to make me the item inch or I ...\nIt's a good show a then the next guy is five hours is straight sleep and how do you do with that you're sleeping good\nShops even excellent Marshall okay good well\nThen it you know all these things sound really good to me when you wake up in the morning in bed or the feet and hands still cold yes\nThey are very good right then let's go to circulation\nSo circulation the number one thing you would try at first just to see if it's an issue is you can go on to something called circular gold\nThis promotes micro circulation throughout the body and that your body weight I Would just go to for for a meal and just see if in two or three days you have a difference for your hands and feet if you do\nThen I'm going to recommend that you go on the biofuel diet\nAnd use strictly follow it so there's no oil nothing that says occasional rarely you don't eat any of those things for at least thirty days and see if\nIt now promotes a better circulation to their hands and feet if it does then it's the food that's doing this to you and it sounds like that's the case 'cause it sounds like you've got all the all the things the adrenal is need you could fry\n... be and see if it does any good for you maybe one or two teaspoons per day and just see\nIf that benefits you at all and when you wake up from sleep you feel rested\nYes sir I've been in a better\nOkay well if that's true in all the adrenal things except maybe the ...\nShould be good in it that would rule out the adrenaline was in my mind so [noise] um get a copy of the battlefield diet what I Would do is just be very strict for thirty days and see if it changes the game as it\nDoes then while since childhood then I Would agree that the something or some issue with circulation and I get to work on it as quick as you can\nOkay thank you sir\nYou will come by now right this is back about Marshall pitch to this is helpful and live and don't miss that is really great specials it's your chance that if you're struggling with any issues with your hair skin or nails and you want\nWhat's really the issue and that is the uh boosting the soluble lives carrot and we've got the forum and there was some great studies to show\nThat this is important structural protein can really promote great healthy hair skin nails you know it effectively supports moisture elasticity income pack is\nFor the here the skin and the nails and the strength of the hills as well uh I think you're going to just love what happens at about age fifty or so\nYour skin's about half the thickness that it was before and of course the people with the best skin on earth would be Asians and of course African Americans\nThan the rest of it as a skin is just not that sick and dance and as we get older a little help like this might be just what you need and unfortunately most of the other products out there or college or\nFrom chicken necks or something like this and we already have so much protein affect you guys need to cut down protein that it's unlikely that that's going to be a big help but the carrot and\nThere's a really lean to the issue of our gall bladder and to help with the gall bladder and we see is after each forty just about everybody needs support for the gall bladder\nSo you want to jump on today is really great special dark hair skin and nails\nYou just need one cap so if you're you know under two hundred pounds over two hundred pounds I Would use to capsules if the issue is a really big deal start out with two gap chills even if you're a hundred pounds and cut down a after about a month or so and I think you'll just love what happens there\nWell let's give an example if you have a million dollars invested and you're paying your financial advisor one percent that's ten thousand dollars per year if you're paying your financial advisor one percent\nAnd you're paying mutual fund fees of one percent that twenty thousand dollars per year so if you're working with\nThat financial professional for ten years with those investments you've paid two hundred thousand dollars over that twenty year period of time wow yeah\nNow the thing about it is is if you're in one of the types of accounts that go up and down with the market when the market's up you pay the fees and one of the market's down your pay the fees now I've had people ask me if they can only pay me when the markets I Can't really figured idea but no you can't do that legally\nAnd then I also I Do the analysis with each person that comes to see me and when I look at some of those investments there are ... that are very expensive real estate investment trust variable annuities that are very expensive\nTo those fees can be five to eight percent every single year like goodness that Korea\nWas one of my clients recently and his name is ray that's on his real name but I asked him how he felt about the ... he was paying we looked up to the city had in his mutual funds and in is variable annuity and he was really shocked at how much he was paying so he was paying a very large dollar amount\nAnd you did have a lot of quite a bit of money but he had no idea how much he was painting the\nSo we use the Andrews retirement GPS\nSo that we could re allocate in such a way that he not only had lower fees but he also had greater value he now had me working with him as his financial advisor to make sure that the money he had worked so hard to save was not going to run out before the end of his life\nAnd he also wanted to make sure that he was going to take care of his wife and he wasn't even sure how some of the things were structured to take care of her when he was gone\nThrough the Anders retirement GPS we saved you've re over ten thousand dollars per year in these\nNow what would that mean to you if I were to give you a check for ten thousand dollars right now what would you do with it would you do something that's really meaningful would you do something that's really fun but would you maybe take that trip to Europe that you've been thinking about for a long time but didn't really know if you could afford it\nThis is what the Andrews retirement GPS does for you it Mary's up the different worlds of financial advisor in into one integrated document that just makes sense\nIt shows you what you're paying fees and whether it's worth it or not and while it's going through that it's also showing you how to put together that income plant tax wise health wise state why make sure that you leave a legacy\nIf you don't know how much your pain and fees\nCalming and will set up a time to talk\nMy number is eight hundred Seventy five to nine eight eight you can call her click buy website is ... ... for a lot of people actually come to me through my website just click contact you to set up a time to talk or you can call me eight hundred seven to five to nine eight eight\nBath you talk with people thinking about retirement or who are already retired you do this every day how where are they are the impact of these costs in these fees and the value of their assets\nWell maybe not as aware as they should be and that's really unfortunate you know I don't think that I Need to know all of the details of how my internal combustion engine works in my car that's just not something that I'm good at nor should I Try to be good at\nBut I think that you need to have a good enough understanding of your investments to use all the safety features like my headlights and my GPS and my I got one of those beep beep beep things that tells me if I'm not in the center of the road anymore maybe really conscious of driving carefully\nWell the Andrews retirement GPS exposes all of that it makes you understand what your fees are so that you can get the most value from them so if you're paying a financial advisor\nAnd you don't know how much you're paying them and on top of that you're not getting advice on other parts of your plan like baby how should you take your Social Security and having a long term tax plan if you're not getting that value for your fees that you're paying you should seek another opinion\nIndeed and because this can really really add up I Want to ask you why so many people know so little about how the people who are helping them manage their money or actually compensated bat\nYou know I think it's more than one thing I think some people just don't want to confront their financial advisors and I to me I don't think it's confrontational I'm very open when somebody asked me how much I get paid or what their pain and fees are how something works I'm very open to discussing that\nBut a lot of people just don't want to have that conversation with their advisor maybe they've been with them for a long time maybe it's a friend of the family maybe they just don't think there's any fees there well let me tell you even if you've got all your money in your four one K. and they give you that little notice every year that says it costs twenty nine Ninety five to manage it [laughter]\nWell that's the only one of the fees they have to understand that there's a lot of different bees some of those fees are disclosing the prospect is if you read the perspective\nBut a lot of them are not in that perspective so it's about knowing about all this ... not just the ones that you can see\nNow hopefully our discussion today will help you to open up your eyes and take some action\nBecause as the long run it could be the difference between you running out of money or your spouse running out of money that's a big deal\nTo present on a million dollar portfolios twenty thousand dollars per year it's not unusual that I see that level of cost and people are just so shocked when I point out\nHow much they are paying it's really important that you make your money last because people are living longer now I'm not

where you have these where you'd be better off using the product that has no fees and it's also got better features like maybe some additional safety\nI'm going to make sure that you know about that product so that you can make an informed decision\nNow my client re he was not opposed to paying for something that he get good value from ray drives the Mercedes he paid more money for that car\nRather than buying say a camera because he wanted that luxury feel but he knew about the cost for that and he understood what he was paying for\nNow the re has been working with me he has more reasonable fees and he has a sensible income plan for retirement\nHe knows his wife is going to be okay if something happens to him we have offices in Robinson and south point both of them are really easy and convenient to get to write off of Seventy nine\nThey both have abundance free easy parking\nIf you wouldn't find out what your fees are and if you want to make sure that you're getting that

with the founder and president of network visors that Andrews and we're glad you're with us on the program today here the phone number if you have questions for bats\nEight hundred seven to five twenty nine eighty eight that's the number to call again eight hundred seven two by two nine eight eight great website as well as bath Andrews that info\nAt bat you're giving us some of the first key to maximize the value of our retirement dollars you said a look carefully at those costs and the fees associated with your investments what's another key well key number\nTwo is to look at the costs associated with your financial advisor\nOr the financial advisors that you might be considering working with so if you are working with someone right now are looking for someone make sure you ask them how they charge you want to make sure you understand the fee structure of what they charge you personally and also the the structure of any investments that they recommend\nNow with that said I don't think that's a great way to start a relationship you got to start based on trust but you want to make sure that before you buy that you understand all the fees there's not really straightforward and transparent as a lot of people would really like\nIt so what do you mean though by transparent that well by transparent\nI mean a financial professional or a financial professional from that will spell out in the English language so you can understand how much and for what they charge their clients\nNow you do want your advisory for him to stay in business so it's okay that they make money from you but you want to make sure that you get the appropriate value for what you're paying\nFinancial and insurance professional are paid in a variety of ways so you just really need to understand what's coming out of your pocket and going into the advisers pocket\nThat can you give us just a quick overview some of the different ways financial professionals are compensated\nYeah so some bill you foreign and your feet and it might be called a financial planning feet it might be five hundred thousand dollars up front or it might be every single year\nSome advisors get paid a commission and so the commission especially the upfront commission is the what I call no service model [laughter]\nSo they get paid once when you put your money in why should they ever keep in contact with you over time so I just liked that model but it's a model that's out there and there are some products that I use it I don't have a choice I have to use the up front commission\nAnd then there is the ongoing fees as part of your investment so it could be called a management fee could be called an advisory fee\nAnd those generally actually show on your statement so you want to ask your financial advisor what you are paying them now I've been working with race or raise them electrician so he understands that how the light switch works and everything and we are electricity comes from all that stuff\nI just don't understand how to turn the light switch on and off now rate asked me if I Would tell him how much I got paid and I certainly I Will tell you how much I get paid for every single thing in your portfolio\nAnd they said kind of a funny thing he said you know the advice that I was working with last year\nHe was telling me that he goes on all these trips and he gets these incentives that all about and I said well All right here's the deal\nSometimes financial advisors can get incentives like really nice trips like you know I've heard of them going to Europe and to African safari isn't really fancy things like that\nI think that's a terrible incentive for a financial advisor here's another incentive that some advisory firms get they'll get more money if they so one product then another product and I think that's really a conflict of interest\nSo what you're really looking for in a financial advisor somebody that's willing to disclose everything that they may not just what they get paid for the check that you write them for that in your financial planning fee\nIt's amazing how many fees you can uncover by calling the company that's a little game I play called let's call the company\nSo my electrician client ray and I sat down with his wife and me in the room and we got on the phone with his investment carrier not the financial advisor the eight hundred number of the clients service number\nAnd we said OK tell us what the fees for this tell us what the fees for that tell us what the fees for the third thing\nAnd are there any more these on top of that and so that's how we dug up all of the fees that he was\nPaying and we use that to put it into the Andrews retirement GPS now here's another way that you can lose a lot of your money\nOne big tax mistake can wipe out all the savings that you get by using discount or low cost the I see this with people that either buy and sell their own stocks or that use those low cost vanguard fund I see it all the time\nThey're saving money and fees but they make a big huge mistake now are electrician ray and his wife they were going to make a really big tax mistake now I'm uniquely\nQualified to give tax advice I Am a CPA in addition to being a CSP certified financial professional\nAnd so I said great you know here's how the tax code work and if you do it a little bit differently you're going to save a tremendous amount of money\nI'll say it again one big tax mistake can wipe out all the hard work that you do by investing by yourself or by using the discount firms\nDo you want to learn what the fees are in your savings do to make sure that you keep as much of it as you can avoid those big mistakes\nIf you have at least two hundred thousand dollars to invest called me right now we're alive we'll take the call the number is eight hundred Seventy five to nine eight eight K. get ready to write down here it is again eight hundred seven to five to nine eight ...\nThat's when we're talking
