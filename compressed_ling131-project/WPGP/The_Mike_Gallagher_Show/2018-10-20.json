people do it or they're firing 'em um is there a legal\nActually you can take on that\nYet there is an American really really great I mean make sure that they are they they allow you the option to use the map\nSecond of all you can claim a legal exempt a a a religious exemption on that\nAnd that's been used all across the country and they really can't the night in fact this last week in Ontario, Canada there was another group of nurses who actually won their battle um it's within the ... the Ontario or the um\nThe Ontario nurses association is when a second decision on wearing a of that being vaccinated are wearing a mask and they are they for it so that they um they don't have to get the vaccine and so there are more lawsuits all across the country that are actually taking place has actually been to in the U.S\nThat have already they've all the help with the authority law\nAnd they had to give people the option of taking a flu shot or wearing a map and\nAnd those ... those hospitals\nI actually getting paid to to from the government my understanding in order to get a Ninety percent compliance rate on vaccinations that that is correct the bats like\nOur caller may run out of time and there's so much more than the cover and we didn't get to it before he picked us or other color I Believe is ... son or who\nCalled back and um would you explain that was actually the ingredients that are are in these various vaccinations\nSure um you know everybody ... remembers mercury and Merkley it out of most of the ...\nYou know not all of them as a matter of fact and just do it too but not for the back side of that that fall from the the question from the previous caller if you are absolutely forced to get a flu shot I mean if you have no other options and that can be somehow hospital system it can be um the military\nOne of the things that you really should request and it's you can say okay if you have to force me if I'm forced to do that against my will but I Am ... I Am requiring you to give me a mercury free flu shot so that you need to ask for that because the multi dose flu shots when you can get it the the at the ... that\nMostly that they get to a gift to people in the military health care workers or the multi dose flu shots that they'll have twenty five micrograms of mercury per does so you can request\nAnd actually require legally require them to give you a a a milk crate for flu shot\nAnd there are other vaccines are\nThey they have different names and mercury so so even if you read the list of ingredients you may not see the word mercury\nWell you'll see the words nearest fall\nOr you'll see ... you know and that so by mirrors solid is is up it it has it is the ... is the compound that has ... in it\nAnd so um but you want to get it for preservative free flu shot but what they've done that say as they every move the the mercury from the vaccines that they have loaded them up the aluminum\nAnd now that if a child gets every that mean that is required that is recommended\nBy a one year of age they will have 'em\nAlmost five thousand micrograms of aluminum injected into their body and there's more and more coming out about the toxic effect to the brain into the bone marrow\nAbout aluminum and children cannot be talks to aluminum until they are at least two years of age because it take until two years of age for their kidneys they're going they're low filtration rate how well they're that they\nCan filter stuff and how well they're gall bladder an accident\nAnd get rid of stuff that doesn't fully\nFunction and so they're almost two years of age that by that but they've been fully loaded by all of the recommended vaccines\nAnd so there's tons there's lots and lots of but if you get every single vaccine that is recommended from birth until Eighteen years of age will have almost almost twelve thousand micrograms of aluminum injected into the body\nAnd by Dr Chris shot and Dr ... please stop a report that they are the two aluminum gurus known all around the world\nThey know they they go into great detail to say that there is a very big difference in the way the body handles ingested aluminum versus the way the body handled injected aluminum and it should be injected aluminum through the vaccine is that's really pervasive\nThe by digesting that we have a a built in protective measure to some degree that's bypassed by injection Dr temp and he was going to take this color or ... or again I Know she has a lot of questions with her little\nLittle ones but I Will um yeah I had a U.S on the high wind turbine county\nI've hello I'll I won't I'll make their sort of tumor questions I'm going back to infections I'm Glad you call them that because it implies that short term rather than long term disease but going back on that could write so she can track to hand foot in mouth disease which of course does not have a\nA vaccine for it which is fine um we just kind of quarantine ourselves and she waited out it wasn't fun but she was fine my other concern and then it wasn't that and again and it wasn't and oh my God God Forbid right she got it right right you know what she handled it better my husband and I got it too she handled it ten times better than we did\nSo I'm as he can I don't know if we needed and you're not [laughter] and I and I'm\nNot right and she she waited it out or we just wait it out so anyhow I'm back to another and section that's close to home\nWhen I was in college um I did um contract whooping cough I did get the vaccine again afterwards ahead as a kid that they told me at war off right well in college you know you you share things with friends and you and I can check that well I Will tell you it was one of the most it was it the most terrible thing I've ever had dealt with and I cannot imagine infant dealing with that\nSo when I was pregnant they did asked me if you like whooping cough and I said no\nI'm I thought through my breast milk through her being in me that I already had the antibiotic not only from the vaccine apparently that I got then but also the fact that I had to infection um but we have to ask the bigger picture where again we're ready we're ...\nWe're running out of touch and go what's his what's the question there that's the question\nIf she if she gets it sorry if she gets it um is there measures like you like I said it's from the get or do you know here's\nThe hot when it's not now wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait you're getting really really really kind of geared up here let's just calm down a little second okay\nBecause protests this is only a deadly illness meaning that has an increased risk of a really serious complications and children under three months of age and the main reason for that because they're trachea there windpipe is small and the ... and they get exhausted and become the hydrated from the car\nSo the older you get the less severe it is the second part is is that you can have\nThe they they is now estimated by by Dr cherries work at it but he has the obligation that there's somewhere between eight hundred thousand and three million cases of protests\nThat go undiagnosed every year because people can just have a simple cough it pre scripted costs it lasts a long time but just because a somebody can have a severe coughing it could last for a long time doesn't mean that every single person will get it in fact I Know that\nI'm In my ... in ... in my office practice I had a family and I think it's really short at eight children I start six children the two old district completely that neither the two middle or partially vaccinated and the two\nPeople are living longer than they ever have before but therein lies another risk\nYou know if you're healthy when you enter retirement how long should you plan on living and it's important because that's also the amount of time you have to ensure that your retirement assets are going to last let me give you an example if you plan to retire at sixty eight sixty it's very possible your retirement could last three decades or more\nSo how do you go back determining whether you have enough money to finance a thirty year retirement\nIt's a lot to think about one strategy to consider involves a multi step process first determine how much money you plan or need to stand month by month and compute how those monthly amounts may rise or fall over time with inflation and we're going to talk about that as well\nSecondly come up with any any allies with draw amount that you're going to need each and every month to supplement your fix sources of income and determine or express that as a percentage against how much you've saved so let me give an example let's say any two thousand a month over and above your fixed expenses\nThat's coming in from Social Security or pension two thousand a month\nTwelve months that's twenty four thousand a year not divide that into the amount of money you save and determine\nWhat type of withdrawal percentages that out of your total savings and you really want to come within a comfortable range you know what we consider comfortable ranges media three to four percent withdrawal right on the high side\nBut that's the very first step in and I want to talk just a second mark about longevity but some of the things we may not think about and talk about when it comes to longevity\nAnd these statistics are pretty startling eighty percent of men die married eighty percent of women\nDie widowed and if you really think about that when we're talking about a longevity we also have to talk about survivor income\nMost of the time under normal circumstances and statistics women are going to be left\nCarrying the burden after their spouse has passed away and do we have enough income for that surviving spouse so we really have to play on not only for you know if you are married for both spouses being alive but you also have to plan for that surviving spouses well\nAnd really the point of that story even for you is that al is going to wear you out [laughter]\nOr you know that right if it really is I mean longevity because of the fact that women outlive man that's the numbers eighty percent of men die married in eighty percent of women die widowed because women typically outlive men that's kinda how it works ... women's average age right now might be eighty seven eighty eight men's eighty four or that area\nSo we are living longer than any generation before us even how can we then make our money last as long as we do\nWell marked to start you have to have some money saved more for some people than others\nIt all depends on the plan that you've crafted if you have crafted the plan it all we believe everybody needs a plan but you need to consider factors like your health your life expectancy earlier desired standard of living near future expenses and that's\nWhat helps determine what that nest egg needs to be saved and I think the media does a disservice you see\nCommercials for I think it's a ... year voyage\nAnd everybody has a big giant floating number above their heads for some people it's two million for some people it's nine hundred thousand dollars and may not be the case for every couple we've retired folks with two hundred thousand dollars of assets saved because they had the income factor solve for and they didn't need that two hundred thousand dollars to spend\nOther clients need for five million dollars just based on their lifestyle\nAnd if you're concerned that maybe you haven't done a good enough job saving\nIt might be time to consider bumping up contributions to ... remember there's a catch up provision for those of us who are fifty year over\nWhich can result in an additional six thousand dollars annually into their four O. one K. or an additional extra thousand dollars into an IRA but remember we say this all the time retirements all about income you know how much spend all income you'll have each and every month when you retire and what would happen to your situation if you're a blessed with good health and a long life\nWould what she said be able to provide you enough income to last for twenty or maybe even Thirty years\nYou would benefit from having these answers in an important and Alice is we call it your retirement blueprint in court and I would love to be able to

we go all these risk and then be multiplied we're going to face some quite often maybe during our retirement so if the next risk would be the risk of inflation and again the longer we go\nThe more opportunity that in place you could impact our retirement I Would imagine that\nIs right mark and the fact is inflation is much greater risk in retirement than it ever was while we're working really think about it during our working lives than actual career progression of raises and bonuses and generally making more money as the years go by helped to really naturally offset inflation\nHowever in retirement we're no longer earning a paycheck instead it's more likely you are creating your own paycheck from your retirement assets and you may have a Social Security or a pension check and while some pensions might have some cost of living adjustments and Social Security does occasionally give those living adjustments\nMost likely they want offset the effects of inflation\nSo then I guess so

cream\nAnd I used to by half gallon of ice cream and sometimes inflation can be hidden because sometimes the price of the product has increased the packaging decreases marketed mentioned before cereal boxes you open up a cereal box and you wonder why twenty five percent of the boxes that say\nWell that's because maybe they're not increasing the price but they're decreasing the amount of goods being sold and inflation is a real thing so there's ways to offset inflation there are products and strategies out there that have built and inflation adjustment factors you can use Stockton equities the stock market is a great hedge against inflation\nAt the problem with that is there's a risk so you don't want all your money invested in the market you can also if you need a structured income\nBut lately we've been utilizing annuities that have some income rider features that can increase that income guaranteed from that account on an annual e adjusted basis you got to be careful with someone

Nathan Lane with accurate solutions group Kurt is the c._e._o. of accurate solutions group started the company in Nineteen Ninety four even lane is an associate advisor with current and the team and accurate solutions grew by mark Elliott glad you're with us and\nSo they were talking about some risk that we all could might face in retirement and maybe a different level certainly we've talked about longevity risk we're living longer than ever before\nWe've talked about inflation the longer we live more impact than inflation will have you know if you need five thousand dollars to retire today what are you gonna need in ten years in Twenty years probably is going to be more than that five thousand dollar number so do you have\nIncreasing income built into your retirement plan\nWhat about long term care what if you need to go to a nursing home or something like that we're talking seven to ten thousand dollars a month have you plan for that healthcare costs we know they're going up so all of that as well we've talked about before and this next risk his kind of crazy because it's really what we're doing to our self Ethan what are we talking about\nWell this next risk is harder to identify but it might even be harder to control and that's the risk that you bring upon yourself\nThrough a motion decision making for quite some time people have really been studying the effect of behavior on financial decision making\nAnd you may already know we've done some shows focusing solely on people who make decisions emotionally\nWhether it's a good decision or a bad decision so the next ... is the emotional and irrational behavior that could negatively impact you really to make it simple and while there are many more will describe to investor behaviors that you should try to avoid\nOne is confirmation bias and this one's pretty simple people tend to justify their decisions by asking other people what they think about those decisions and we tend to gravitate towards others who just simply agree with our own decisions and we push anybody away who disagrees\nYeah I hate to talk politics on the show but the bottom line is if you're a very conservative individual maybe or a Fox News watcher and lesser if you are more on the liberal side maybe watch MSNBC or CNN and why would that be because we have up by us and the bias is we want to listen and hear people who can from\nWhat we believe in what our thoughts are\nAnd the same goes for let's say a mutual fund that you buy and invest in through somebody and you'll look to find someone else who made that the same decision to make yourself feel more confident in what you just did but there's another one called anchoring and people tend to anchor their decisions or investments that they believe in or have had\nPast success with regardless of what the outlook might say about that investment\nPerfect example is GE stock she's been a great company but in two thousand Seventeen the stock lost over fifty percent of its value but some people are anchored to their G. stock that would never sell if they fall in love with it and possibly they could make more money elsewhere with even less risk\nAnd we've seen that happen personally we have some clients who have larger positions and GE and why would someone do GE has been the darling on Wall street for so many years when it comes to pay dividends and consistently raising that the evidence a lot of clients held onto larger positions and GE start because it was a good source of cash flow\nWell last year genes lost all that money on that individual stock\nAnd people are still holding that\nAnchor just kept thinking that she is just always going to be what it was in the past it may be but it may not\nAnd it's really crazy to think that the last fifty percent of its value in twenty Seventeen when everything seemed to be going up and up and up it's a challenge when it comes to investing in the market you don't really know what's going to happen that number one mutual fund and twenty Seventeen might be number six twenty Eighteen and number thirty and twenty Nineteen so things go up it's like a bell curve\nSo it's really challenging and angry is pretty easy I think pay my grandad Kurt left me the stock\nI've got to keep it that's what he wanted no he didn't really want you to keep that stock he wanted that stock to help you with your life it wasn't really the stock itself so\nThat tiger that's pretty simple and confirmation bias I I think we all have people that we like to tell us what we want to hear that's where it comes to be very important for those that we have to hear what we don't want to hear at times so let's say this area right here because of what comes to the emotional world\nThis is where Kurt hew and Ethan and the team in ... group can kinda be that sounding board if you will you can help us and tell us things that we don't really want to hear but we need to hear maybe it's some degree what kind of quality should we look for when we're trying to find someone like you and your team but accurate solutions group to help guide us in his retirement path\nWell there's so many different things on let me focus on a few first and foremost make sure your investment advisor follows a fiduciary standard and I know that word may not mean something to some of the others that may\nNot someone who follows a fiduciary standard is legally required by their registration and trade and to put the client's interest over and above the interest of that individual word the firm and that's extremely important when it comes to making investment decision so\nJust like you had mentioned mark sometimes we tell people things they don't want to hear because we are following the fiduciary standard\nSo first and foremost make sure on the investment side they follow for this show standard\nSecondly make sure they're licensed more selling the concentration of retirement planning so there's two types of advisors you have accumulation advisors in retirement plan or someone who is helping you grow your assets when you're twenty or twenty five the whole way through maybe fifty or fifty five\nOr markets the last risk we'll talk about today and it's perhaps the most detrimental of all and you said at first the sequence of return raskin we saved it for the last discussion for the dedicated listeners and when you're dealing with your investment portfolio especially as you're approaching retirement\nMarket risk is a huge deal markets cycle they always have and they always will\nAnd we're currently in the ten year of a major bull market right and that's significant because the average bull market last about fifty seven months and while you can control when you choose to retire\nBut you can't control is what the market does on that timeline are you going to retire at the beginning of a bull market or in the middle or possibly the end\nAnd what impact will the market have on your investments that carry market risk\nHow any potential loss affect your retirement income sequence rescue is all about what happens in the first few years of your retirement regarding the market and the sequence of those returns that your accounts might experience\nNow certainly if we're going to retire say in Nineteen Ninety nine we'd think well that was great the markets were doing well but the next thing we do have the dot com bubble bursting if we're retiring in two thousand and eight not a great time to be retired and we're retired in two thousand twelve much better word a Bull Run at that point so\nI think this is the challenge of markets in sequence of returns rest that makes it a little bit more confusing I think to myself and I'm sure some of our listeners can you give me an example\nOf what secrets of returns risk is like\nYeah and I had an example written out about two brothers and retiring three years apart but I thought it might be a little bit hard to explain on the radio show today so let me just do it this way let's say that you retire and you have a million dollar portfolio and that portfolio is made up\nOf individual stocks but let's just say that the average stock prices a hundred dollars a share hundred dollars a share first stock\nAnd let's say you need two thousand dollars a month and then come from that portfolio so each and every month in that example you are selling twenty shares of stock to generate that two thousand dollars a month let's say that the market goes up and it does really well right and your portfolio goes up and your numbers of shares increase\nAnd you still need two thousand a month now you're not selling twenty shares anymore let's say that that stopped doubled in price the two hundred dollars and I only selling ten chairs for that same amount of monthly income well that is a good situation because you retired and they blew market with mark a gallon\nNow let's say the opposite happens and you retire at the end of that bull market or even in a recession let's say you need the same two thousand a month same example each share price was price that hundred dollars a share and you're selling twenty shares your income well now all of this and the shares get down in value from a hundred dollars a share\nTo fifty dollars a share\nThat you're saying to yourself all that's bad because I still need that two thousand a month when now you're having to sell forties shares because each one is only price to fifty dollars to generate that same two thousand a month\nThat is what's called sequence of return risk retiring early on at the end of a bull market or the beginning of a bear market can literally deplete your savings ten or Fifteen Years sooner than it would have\nAnd that can all be avoided but the problem is you have to know that risk exists in the first place\nI Would encourage him if you've never done a stress test on your existing portfolio that's one of the things we do an accurate solutions were part of our retirement blueprint process is we will literally stress test your existing portfolio to show you the amount of risk you're currently assuming when's the best time to find out\nHow much risk you're assuming well when things are going well we've had some recent voluntarily lately but we're still in the throes of bull market\nAnd at some point we don't know why we don't have that crystal ball were not prognosticators we don't know when it's going to end\nBut the best time to find out how much riskier assuming when things are still going well if you would like us to undertake that stress to send your portfolio there's no cost there's no obligation to simply give myself give our team a call it for one to\nFive one five thirty three fifty five again it's for one to five one five thirty three fifty five\nGlad you're with us today for your retirement blueprint with ... with accurate solutions group and I also said you can also go to the website to find out more A. S. G. retire dot com AS Judy retire dot com and we're talking about retirement risks today\nAnd you know even when we head into retirement I think a lot of people think my taxes will be lower because I'm not getting a paycheck anymore I'm not going to spend as much and I guess that would be true for you to sit on the couch and watch TV or read a book about if you have a list of things you want to do you might actually spend a little bit more especially early on and retirement\nSo in your experience and Kurds experience of working with retirees 'cause that's what ... groups does do your clients tend to spend more and retirement or less in retirement than they did while they're working\nFor mark is our favorite phrase it depends it really does it depends on the individual at one thing that it does depend on as you know are they naturally savers we've seen people heading into retirement that are just naturally savers they save a thousand dollars a month\nAnd they might just continued doing that because that's who they are they're natural spenders that might just continuing retirement as well\nAnd what we tell individuals who come into the office for complimentary consultation is that who you have been for the last Thirty years is not gonna change just because you're in retirement so if you are thrifty and you're more costs\nAnd you make sure that with what you have coming in you don't spend more than that and that's how you're going to be in retirement\nIf you're a little bit more easy and you like to spend money and you like to go on vacation and that sort of thing that's really who you're going to continue to be in retirement and typically mark when we look at it is the first ten years all the time and look at the first ten years is you're ... years that's when you typically will spend because you're active you can go you can travel you can do the things you want to do\nThe next ten years or what we call your slow down in the last ten years might be you know ... years but the bottom line is you've got to plan for Thirty years and typically your behavior prior to retirement is going to the continued behavior into and through retirement\nAnd there's different expenses in retirement\nThat you may not have like work related costs maybe you go out for lunch every single day or a lotta times you might not do that in retirement you don't have to maintain potentially a business wardrobe or have those same commuting costs and if you paid off your home or any other debts those line items will also go away from your budget\nHowever you might face higher taxes in retirement you have are in these required minimum distributions named might movie in the higher tax bracket potentially tax rates could also rise in the future given our nation's current that situation\nAnd we've definitely talked about the potential health care costs you have to plan for so there are things that could do that every time I think a lot and your spending habits are basically going to stay the same you know if you have Thirty years and the behavior it's hard to break that behavior\nAnd you know you mentioned the go go years this logo years the no go years and they go go years is when you want to do those bucket list items you've always dreamed of doing it my tier lately\nAnd so the lawyers it's about income this logo years now maybe you're in your eighties maybe now it's about ... by you know I could still do those things but I don't really want to do those things\nAnd now maybe it's about long term care and health care then you get into the no go years where you can't physically do all of those things that you did as you started retirement now it's about insurance where are you going to do with your money who you know leave it to an all of that\nSo the problem is though with all of that is you can't wait\nTill you get into those logo years to plan for a long term care and health care needs you can't wait until you get into your eighties and nineties to go okay I guess I Need some insurance so I can leave stuff behind you can't wait for all of that your retirement blueprint as something that starts before you even gotten into retirement\nAnd proud of world I mean you bring up such a great point because planning is in advance of reacting is at the time when you're planning for retirement literally we have some individuals who are eight years away for retirement we put a plan in place where you monitor the plan we help them make the decisions each and every year\nSo that when they do retire it's literally a flip a switch they know what's going to take place that you have a plan in place and they're ready for those ... years and that's really what it's all about\nWhere one of the few firms out there that's going to encourage you through our dreams casting what we walk or individuals are trying to figure out what your purpose in your vision is we're going to encourage you and help the structure of plan\nThat's going to allow you when you first retire when you're healthy when your grandkids do love the there at that age where they want to do things when you were going to encourage you to spend during your ... years 'cause

your wife's involvement and some other folks ... how this whole formulated\nYeah so as I mentioned earlier so really I I started bachelor Larry a mentor in my life when I was Seventeen started bringing us around great leaders from our church and he would say hey you guys should take these leaders out to breakfast out the coffee and just pound them with questions and ask them to become a mentor in your life so I did that every month I Would take out a leader and I'd ask them questions\nAnd ask them to mentor me and I did that for about ten years\nAnd after about ten years of doing that and my peers started saying wow you got to spend time with this leader and that leader I Wish I could and I always tell them what you could have you ever asked and most likely ... more often that they had and so I I thought his opportunity I started a podcast where I Would record my interviews with leaders and that turned into all the leadership podcast\nAnd then really two years later started to get around this vision and make Pittsburgh famous for God\nAnd I and I said I've got to be a part of that and that was the founder ... carpenter he he kind of sad that vision and I said read I I'm I'm burning with vision and passion for for making Pittsburgh famous forgot how do I do that and he just encourage me\nStarted gathering people and see what the Holy Spirit die so my wife made me put

was called learning to lead\nAnd so I was I was automatically put in that accountability and we launched in July of two thousand fourteen started doing would hold me to say I haven't started gathered

I'm a huge um actual fan and I agree with this definition that leadership is influenced nothing more nothing less and so I Believe if you ... if you're influencing people you're a leader so you may be a stay at home mom but you have an influence over your family\nUm so I Believe there's all different types of leaders but yeah in general I just believe leadership is letting the people around you in are the people following you better off because of your leadership that's how I define it\nOne of the things personal relationship to at least from the way you're talking about it because if you look management can just be kind of over ruling telling people what to do you can do that good you can do that bad it can have aspects of leadership to it but it sounds to me like you're this thing with with your mentor it all started with grabbing someone else and bringing them along yeah and so it is that influenced thought\nYeah I mean at the end of the day all we care about is you people are becoming yes we can you accomplish goes yes we care that you you know get promoted get pay increases and all of that but at the end of the day if you're not becoming a better husband better father about their mother a better worker or then we're failing you know we believe in all the leadership\nAnd they'll free leadership again then it's just not business right it's it's all those aspects you mentioned and for those in in the world to about being a better leader a church correct\nYeah yeah every sector society could benefit from what we offered healthy\nI like that that's very well you should write to do All right we are in Studio for our special leadership forum Bismarck I'm your host Mike Howard our guest is Doug Smith of el free leadership he's the founder and also light of life\nUh ministries he's manager outreach and major gifts let's let's spin the light of life curfew for a second you tell me again how long you've been there and what does your your daily job entail there\nYeah so I've been on sat there for six years I've had various roles throughout that six year term right now and the manager of major gifts and outreach\nMajor gifts is just what it sounds like I'm In fundraising never never wanted to be in fundraising never thought I Would be in fundraising ah but was a volunteer coordinator for about a year and my boss gave me said we think you're really good with people we think you'd be great at fundraising\nLet's give it a shot so they threw me and I had no clue what I was doing in and out and really all open raising as this building relationships and so I Am good at that and so I've been building relationships with our donors in partners ever since and that's going pretty well and then outreach is our church partnerships ... yep our donation center of our volunteers and that's kind of my ... at this point\nSo you were a founder of health readership you're involved with light of life ministries your church you're a you're a busy guy a but then as we talked about you've also get into running so tell us a little bit about how the marathon running and hold that how will that came about and how does it help you with both of those things you're involved with not to mention what\nYeah uh so I grew up I was always the heavy kid I broke I broke a hundred pounds in second grade two hundred pounds and fifth grade um was really has always struggled with my weight ocean with my self image\nAnd I always wanted to get in shape or just never knew how to when I was Eighteen I started running I thought that would be a great way to lose weight and um so I just started running up and to the point where I can run five miles and then my mentor later Betancourt came to me and he said have a bucket let's go running a marathon by the time I'm forty\nI what are you what do you think about doing that with me you should ran the other direction so or the time I was ... I still am but I Love goal setting and I love like at less than so I said yeah my bucket list I Want to run a marathon um and he said hey we can do the Chicago Marathon and spend a weekend together reading through first and second Timothy as a mentor meant the relationship\nAnd let's just take this whole journey together and we did and I got the runner's high the runners bug so to speak and have been running ever since\nAnd before we get on the air we were talking a little bit about that mentorship in the book you read I'm guessing first and second Timothy because of the relationship of polling Timothy and how that kind of work or would that was that with Larry where did that concept come from if if that comes to mind\nYeah it's actually interesting so very had a mentor and when he was in college and he was young leader and his mentor did the exact same thing they took on a retreat together as a mentor meant to even read the book of freshmen second Timothy\nAnd uh it was just left a lasting impact on his life in that we can definitely did that for me as well and in my ... I'm Still have a great relationship with Larry I consider him a friend and mentor today and I'm just so grateful that there's people that intentionally invested in others\nWhere we could almost do another whole shown that concept I'm so interested in fascinated that and I would guess you know his father son that might be a good thing to do huh\nYeah yeah I think that'd be great a lot of ways he actually was a spiritual father to me\nYou know I think we all have a lot of those in our lives hopefully if you have a uh we're we're paying attention to who the lord is bringing into our lives you're listening to a special leadership forum biz Bergen your host like Howard we're in Studio ... with Doug Smith of el three leadership he's the founder and editor they'll three leadership dot org\nAnd he's also with light of life ministries as manager of outreach and major gifts Douglas talk a little bit about the website what people can find out there with you know we we realize that people get on the radio or they're hearing it especially if they're on their phone or on their computer no let's go check that out what are they going to see their adultery leadership\nIf you're listening out that I Would just encourage you to show up we always say that we believe you're one relationship away from changing your destiny and you don't know what you're missing out on her what God wanted to do at the things that you don't show up to and so what if I wanted to connect you with a relationship to literally changed your business trajectory forever\nWhat if you got to connect with one of our speakers and you ended up working for their company you just don't know what God will do\nA by simply showing up and so I I have we have hundreds of leaders that have come and connected and had great things happened in ... and as a result we have plenty of testimony is on our website\nAnd we'll be putting more video content out there as well um but I Would just encourage you show up and watch all God does\nThat's great and you can find out that under lease el free leadership dot org under the events correct yeah\nYeah they keep those they're posted quite quickly one thing we didn't get into and we got about another minute and a half or so here on the show talked to me about a reading books were big into that obviously being the types of stations that we are here at Salem Media group but I Know John ... big for you on that tell us to tell us quickly about that influence\n... drum access my hero I'm so in Rome and decides faith comes by hearing and ... and having heard the word of God it doesn't saying have heard so it's something we need to continually night doing anything that would have gotten better as I Believe it's the same thing with leadership growth or whatever you want to grow and you need resources continually put on you and so\nI remember Larry enemy a John ...
