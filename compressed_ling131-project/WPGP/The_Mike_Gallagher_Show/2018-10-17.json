should be the way that's the way most decent Americans should feel Lindsey Graham started by saying he's a\nFighter remember she has said awful things about him nobody ever notice is that nobody ever remembers when he call somebody a name may have shed plenty about him\nPreviously\nAnd that's what people mean about a fighter here's a here's our Ari Fleischer he was on Fox News ... believe that this was cut number eight or here's Ari Fleischer\nSaying that how Trump hurts himself when he calls a porn star like Stormy Daniels a name like horse race ears cut aid from Fox News and brave you\nKnow center this is where the president does his own worst enemy he's in the middle of a victory and he takes it down a few not just by engaging and that kind of unnecessary rhetoric doesn't need to call anybody horse face you just don't do that when you're the president or reminds me in some ways of the way they put out about Mika Brzezinski\n[laughter] you know it's just the president ... are so hard he often hits himself\nAnd that's something he's been actually pretty disappointed that for the last eight to ten twelve months and here is again returning to that type of mistaken over Kuwait I Wish she went in case like that just diminishes what it is a proper victory a set of hitting home runs that headed up\nNow I don't say there's debris disparaging about our our Fleischer I think he's a nice man I met him a few times and ah he served of course in the Bush administration\nI'm so he's a an establishment guy he knows the establishment world very well\nBut don't you find it fascinating and again I don't mean there's just respectfully towards Ari Fleischer\nBut isn't it isn't an intriguing to listen to a hundred and that's what ... is now he's like ... like me and he's ... he's a guy with an opinion we all have some of them have some of us have platforms whether it's already a appearing on Fox News\nOr meet with the radio show we're we're we're basically just guys and gals Republicans\nSo we are we're not we're not really that we're not certainly elected leadership we're not on the government we can impact people I guess I suppose it's fair to say we can change hearts and minds\nBut in the scheme of things we're certainly not as well certainly not as important as the leader of the free world don't you find it fascinating that Ari Fleischer\nThinks he can tell\nThis phenomenally successful president\nHow he's making mistakes in\nOther words those who writes or who opine\nCan sit on the sidelines and say oh you're making a mistake you're wrong here for doing that well should I wouldn't call a woman or space I admit it I'm not like Donald Trump I don't have this kind of personality\nFrankly most of us don't the guy I keep\nCalling him as a ... call him the beach forget name and the the the limousine that drives that he drives around in the stretch Cadillac limousine called the beach that's the secret service nickname\nHe's the beach\nBut here's rule is kind of simple\nYou come after me I'm going to go back after you temple I don't care if you're a woman I don't care if you're a man I don't care if you're a gold star family\nI don't care if your Mother Teresa I can see him going Mother Teresa a name if she said something derogatory about him every\nBody he attach\nEverybody he calls a name everybody he disparage is has disparaged him first\nAri Fleischer knows that Lindsey Graham knows that\nThat's what Senator Graham and when he started out the clip I don't know if we have do we have the but Lindsey Graham touch somewhere guys I just saw kind of rushing around in the hotel room was mourning up here in Florida on on TV religious that he's a fighter he's a\nBut he ... he shouldn't do this you shouldn't say that when he's the president or we're not going to accept the fact\nThat he's not going to do things that traditional past presidents have done meanwhile oh I don't know there's a couple of pieces of news you might find interesting if you're worried about the president calling a porn star a horse race\nThe U.S is back on top of the most competitive country in the world regaining the number one spot for the first time since two thousand and eight it's an it's the index produced by the world Economic Forum America climbed up one place in the rankings of a hundred and forty countries\nWere now ahead of Singapore Germany Switzerland in Japan we are the most we have the most competitive economy in the world\nAnd the fact of the matter is it is likely due to all the economic policies the tariffs that are starting to pay off more good news about the tariffs\n... terrorists are controversial we can have\nDebate I get it All right to have the dialogue but United States steel Corp workers or about to get the biggest wage increase in at least six years under a new deal negotiated with the company and according to Reuters\nThat's a sign that the games from President Trump's clamp down on foreign imports are starting to trickle down and the impact American workers soul he cares about American workers\nSo he cares about American companies solely cares about Americans wow what a what a novel idea on an American president worried about American workers\nOh wow I I it's been a long time since we've seen that it seems wages were frozen in the last contract with US Steel Pittsburgh based company Trump's trade policy coupled with a strong economy has sent domestic steel prices shoring\nHelping US Steel posed a near sixty percent increase in pre tax brackets in the June quarter now the left they hate that they hate companies making money but he'd companies passion that profit on to their workers\nBut normal Americans normal people appreciate the fact that the thousands and thousands of US Steel Corp workers who are about to get the biggest wage increase they'd gotten in six years are thrilled with that news\nAnd guess what that's due to that's due to\nPresident Trump's economic policies including the tariffs including international trade including domestic policies that are making a huge difference so while the media\nGets all hyperbolic and hysterical about something like the president\nCounter punching a porn star who he defeated incidentally in the courts remember this week and the reason there's been such an animal is is a court of a federal judge ruled that Stormy

one\nHas to do with something in the culture to culture pieces of to culture stories I Want to share with you I watch the counters last night the reason I watched it because I'm a lot of people didn't watch it I don't know if the ratings are out yet last can you check the overnight and see what the news is about ABC's re boot of the Roseanne show\nUh they they fired her for her tweet about\nValerie Jarrett I wasn't gonna watch and then I read somewhere that she didn't want anything bad to happen to the show because she wanted her friends and the people she had worked with for many years to be okay so what was it like Roseanne herself was calling for any kind of a boycott of the show and I was interested to see how it how it was actually it was very good\nIt was Roseanne without Roseanne but it was the same vibe it was it was really a good good after show\nAnd it dealt with the fictional death of Roseanne Connors the character dying of an opioid\nOr she died of a prescription medication overdose which is a very real story line for many people in this great country of ours and I happened to be a big fan of Laurie Metcalf the character actress who plays your sister Jackie\nThe day encounters played by John Goodman I I think he's a tremendous character actor and they put they put out very very powerful performances and you know we're going to see how it plays out\nUh again I watched it only because I didn't think that it was um something that she she wanted to show to to succeed even though she's obviously very upset\nAbout being fired and for good cause one tweet\nHave you heard Bill Maher lately seen Chelsea Handler lately what about Cathy Griffin you go down the list of people who say the most horrific things about conservatives about Christians about Donald Trump about Republicans\nThat's all fine Roseanne one offensive tweet and she's done now what's interesting is and I've got the argument on tape we're gonna play a little bit of it I
