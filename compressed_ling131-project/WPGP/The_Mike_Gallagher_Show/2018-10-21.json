{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WPGP", "content": "Yeah they've endured a lot of market changes and these are folks who aren't that the young boxer we're trying to make a name for themselves they have already shown their metal and they're saying these things about what's going on in the market\nYeah and and um when I'm Talking about Stockman and Stockman talks about the market hitting an inflection point and he uses the term and I quote as the market is whistling past the graveyard\nTrading at twenty six times earning a twenty six times earnings at the top of the business cycle ten years um it's it's almost a record all time in terms of works trading\nAnd he's saying now that you know in the theory that earnings have rebounded and we'll go even higher he believed up to complete illusion I mean his comments came out when we talked about back in March and and although we are talking about now are these tariffs then at that time there were the steel tariffs that\nThat a President Trump was talking about but you look at the tax cuts you look at\nEverything going in line and certainly that added some fuel\nTo the market but he's looking at the issue that okay these tax cuts were good to put some an infusion end of the market\nBut he's saying and using this term drifting he said drifting past the graveyard is he saying that we are kind of like the Titanic here as a Titanic got closer they knew that kind of pushing the engines faster that you know with the iceberg warnings and things that are out there\nAnd he's saying that hey we're not looking out for an iceberg or he called it that burg and that Bert ... E. B. T. D. E. B. T. said that's what is in front of us\nAnd and folks you know no one's really talking about the deficit or things along that line but when interest rates go up the amount of that that's out there the interest it'll have to be paid on that that is it's almost insurmountable\nAnd he's referring to the after effect we haven't used this term quantitative easing in a long time but the Federal Reserve has been unwinding\nThe quantitative easing this fourteen trillion dollar financial crisis era trade dumping money into the economy\nAnd there's going to be what he calls a massive yield shock to offset as NPR earnings and an almost all of the effect of the tax cut he believes will be ... done so in plain English what does that mean basically means um do something about your retirement portfolio before what he says happens as\nYour debt service is going to strangle your ability to just by normal goods and services and when you're in retirement that is a ...\nYour deal than when you're working right what that says to me folks are must take it down to another level is the income you're going to rely on for retirement make sure you have a plan for that make sure it's as secure as possible many of our colleagues can't build that will show you how to build that income plant\nSecondly I Do believe that passes management index fund investing good disciplined investing over Fifteen year periods or longer is the most productive way to invest but what we're hearing from Schiller\nFrom Stockman from buffet really lends itself to more active than proactive management because volatility is increasing and not to get better games but to reduce your volatility\nAnd people don't have that Fifteen your timeline any longer for growth\nThat's right so it's telling me more we should be considering shifts to active management too conservative portfolio managers or moderate or moderately conservative managers not just what the advisor says one way to tell okay how moderate or how conservative really am I\nHow much would I lose a lot of these things come to fruition\nGet that stress tests get data now says we've been offering all throughout the show and this is the last time the offer to mention it on this program here today eight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three say I want to stress test I Want to know in the face of all these warnings\nFrom all these are economists from these mines that are out there that see what's beneath the surface I Want to know what I stand to lose if things go bad and when I I Want to know what I can do about it doesn't mean that you'll make changes\nBut boy you should know what changes to make if you consider them take us up on that no cost of obligation to get that review eight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three do it now folks before the market dramatically changes because eventually it will\nAnd you'll say boy I listen to that show and I should have at least understood where I where I stand and I should have gotten that stress tests don't work also show does that take that step because it doesn't cost you anything but your time\nAnd a phone call the eight hundred three to one Seventy\nNine sixty three bucks on me remind you that we have a website and on our website or lots of resources for you to take advantage of their some educational articles on there\nThere are other radio shows

style\nWe do lots of college uh adult non credit courses at local colleges and other facilities you need to get the information from these things to help you build a good solid retirement plan that

really good use of your time\nRight one of the things we talk about our some of these solutions for addressing market risk in the last one I just want to touch on real briefly is to address market risk and again thank you for listening to locks on your retirement or\nTalking about this role one hundred and it's been a roll of San that's been around for a long time basically it's a role to show what percentage of your assets you should have in growth and what percentage you should have more conservative and helps you choose the investment products that are available out there based on your age and then you factor in risk tolerance from there\nNow we've adapted this role to the role of one pet because people are living longer so no matter what number you use one hundred and ten or one hundred if you're fifty five years old you take your age and subtract it from that number so what's the role of one hundred it would be forty five\nJust the role of one ten it would be fifty five\nAnd that number that you get there at the maximum amount that you should have been invested in anything affected by the markets remember bonds fit into that equation it's a simple rule it's a powerful role but if you say the market crashes and you lose thirty percent of your money if you had six hundred thousand in the market you can lose a hundred and eighty thousand where you're down to four twenty\nIf you use the role of one hundred you would only have two hundred and Seventy thousand exposed which would cut your losses basically in half\nYou would have effectively forty five percent less market risk in your portfolio so a great role to at least use it a starting point to mitigate\nRisk exactly I'm Glad you said starting point because their folks out there who take this ruling applied to everything like it's gospel\nThis is something that we teach about in our college classes that it's a good rule that it is certainly a starting point\nBecause you have to figure out what am I going to do with the other fifty five percent what am I going to do with that to save money than that is not exposed to the market\nWhile we talked about it I'll show long hair folks it's it's finding opportunities in other types of investments that were not appropriate for you while you were building your house while you're in that accumulation phase\nBut now that you're heading into retirement\nYou certainly need to look at investments that are going to give you income predictability and also be safe from the market volatility that they're going to keep you protected\nFrom any types of a market crashes that we've been talking about all show law we've kinda ripped through this last segment here lots and lots of information for you we\nSuggest you go to our website at synergy

that\nAre of course the bladder the urinary tract the prostate in the lungs all have in common mucus membranes\nAnd you're going to see very quickly that support across the board may be the vitamin D three that you need because there's been so much discovery there as to what's going on\nAnd we're going to get into that in just a little bit but let's start with the bladder and the urinary tract and many times\nPeople are getting up at night here in ... to kind of disturbs sleep and it's not terrible but it's aggravating\nAnd you don't feel as rested in the morning and it starts fairly innocuous Lee whether you're male or female\nAnd often all the body needs is a little more in the way of ... and while one of the power houses for delivering about five hundred different ... is our pollen the floor\nAnd it's the best source that I've found\nAnd this of course maybe taking two of these three times a day for a few weeks see if it doesn't hit the spot in work perfectly for you or if so great then after about three or four weeks most people can cut down to one or two per day\nAnd that can be just exactly what you need in terms of these ...\nSometimes the bladder you've gone on a long time with this\nAnd uh the bladder is I'm not happy in fact bio films kid form is a thick sticky sugary sex stuck on the mucus membrane like dried music is very hard and the best bet in helping the body\nTo clear this is the active fractions from garlic Alice said and of course that's rich in the ah garlic deciding product so this may be just what you need is to maybe take some ladders support because it's\nEngineered to target nutrients toward the bladder and uh to provide all the broad spectrum of needs for the bladder tissue and then uh maybe taking two or three bladder support right along with two or three garlic aside and support maybe just what you need\nFor the cases where you might have a little bio film\nAnd of course he's ... films if they do form and they form when we leave the problem go for a long time that's when we really want to and get help with the bio film and of course they can be formed by almost any age so\nBladder support meddling with garlic aside and can be a big help there and this is shifting gears going from the simplest help to a more sophisticated support for\nThe bladder in the urine or attract so today will am an special pollen deplore Earl aside and\nSo just give a buzz to our or to line eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven\nLet's go right to the phones ... about Marshall PHD this has helped line live let's go to one in Miami and he's got a question about magnesium is linked to blood pressure go ahead and one\n... thank you I was going you because\nA year and a half ago um I was string for an hour and then\nI I like to do indoor sports and while extreme I developed into my check and make a long story short I could go to the hospital\nAnd to get them by ... and then after many cats are discovered that I had I the crash at that time I watch them there actually I mean it's not a strap and strength y and Z list sport I haven't read anything about my niece you might get annoying thing about it and I I\nThey come in that case you might look I can make it a catchy medication the question that I had it how do I know um if it would be so why is it that have high blood pressure like I got kind of like to have it today because I was singing like when I look at my cash no way to show when like me she let her\nKnow it won't and the reason is that a blood test for magnesium are pretty much useless\nBecause I'm magnesium is held in the blood by adrenaline and in my opinion it's unlikely that the magnesium was the problem\nOr it's more likely that you sweat very heavily you depleted salt you ate food that may have had bugs in it\nAnd it got carte blanche to the circulatory tree that's the most common phenomena that links as two issues with blood pressure's so could it be magnesium yeah but it'd be real hard to tell\nYou could go in a good drug store a noun stick your arm in there and see what your blood pressure is no cause no obligation\nTo get an idea of where you are now\nWhat I see over and over again with athletes like you is you sweat very heavily and you're not paying attention to salt now most Americans in my opinion eat too much salt but athletes especially enduring sadly anybody doing anything and Durant\nOften deplete salt so the way you can test this one\nIs when you break a sweat you'll reach over to the upper outer part of your arm\nAnd taste the perspiration it should tea you taste slightly salty not anybody else you if it doesn't you need to take a teaspoon of salt like air dried sea salt or better yet a pink so\nFor two or three days until you break the sweat and you can taste it then I Would cut back and I monitor that so I always have a slightly salty taste\nNow you have plenty of hydrogen Laura casket and no little bug can get past your stomach okay\nNow if you're still want to support healthy blood pressure and when you go and check your blood pressure you may want to go on something like cardio PJ how old are you how much the way\nAnd their unrelenting is slow but unrelenting nutrients can slow them down but nothing did stop soon as you want to get a mud back then get rid of him to do\nThat you visit someone who knows puree just give a bus tour where the line\nAnd they can give you the number of someone and uh they can also help you with today's special or prostate support and our quantum tomato which is really a great tasting player on the block\nJust give us ... eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven minutes eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven let's go right back to the phones here let's go to\nLive in Milwaukee and she's just did\nSome immune issues and vision issues that have been since you started having these ah immunity issues are what\nAre you there Lynn yes I Am how old women are you how much do you weigh\n... pounds\nOkay well the first thing you want to know is the main reason your immune system's crap that you can visit with things you had as a child is because you can't just your food so\nLet me just say I I think I've seen every day I stay a week in my life schedule around your radio program and outrage thing is I forget you know and I had not been trying\nKilling a girl and I\nLike you know the health care old or younger\nIn my class for like four years ever sang on getting anything to say I got ph green forever but um catch me several months now\nAnd I'm feeling great and then I stopped taking ... addict fun because if it came out well I have firsthand account for ... dairy\nSo I Can't take safer or um that\nFight on a problem not a problem so I sat and I think that's why I get sick when I sat getting my faith I addict program for addicts\nWho are you what are you taking for that just using the edges than they'd still\nPay two or three guy well I guess ...\nYou know show today and I'm falling buy off the guy and good action after access diet and exercise every morning [noise] and um\nYou know I'm getting perfectly and then one day I was perfect and like in your column machine Hogan now and I've had for eight weeks\nTo get a let me come to that limit let's let's stick with the immune system because I'm obviously the three is a major player they're making sure but also a holding the morning you're in ph what's going on with that\nI'm holding a fix for seven oh check it every day for a long line kind of it's\nOkay and then it's not possible for you to have you had so something's wrong you're holding that ph with ammonia or something like that\nI Would double the amount of minerals and see if the ph crashes down to five if it does then you know you've been using ammonia it above the earth and you've got a problem with that to the gum problem some\nSome chronic issue somewhere you gotta find that's holding the immune system and they show old burgers like the one you've experienced can re surface again\nYou see the idea can now let's go back to the double vision\nNow if indeed we're making ammonia then we're going to have all kinds of problems with sensory perception and of course the vision is going to be one of the biggies so um my immediate suspicion\nIs that something is\nSeverely irritating the optic nerve\nSo but we need to do is get you on\nWell first of all you should be on I support it because everybody needs that but that's not what we need to hear what we need here is nerves support so you'll get on something called new support your very small woman so\nTo pre meal will be plenty you should see some some help\nAlmost immediately within three four days you should also see that that your pitches a false ph so there's some rotten tooth or something we got to find and get rid of\nOK okay to care for you to come by [noise]\nAll right you guys will be right back [noise]\n[noise]\nAre you prepared for the upcoming season stuck up on immune support you can really count on one thing nutrition ... had three key players for optimal immune support\nUnprofessional garlic complex is a broad spectrum formula featuring follow the garlic extracted with high concentrated amount of our immune support is he lied source ultra quality olive leaf extract containing a minimum concentration of twenty percent only wrote him\nIn point the vitamin C. is an all natural plant source phone nutrient vitamin C.\nWithout synthetic is where the guy said each are bike to get the third one free don't we make sure you've got immune support ready when you need it most ... eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven that eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven for business\nOnline at ... dot com that few N. L. E. D. S. dot com\nRight this is Dr ... helpline live and\nUh I Do want to cover one last the aspect of today's subject and that has been to discuss the prostate urine or attract but also of course we wanted to touch on the lungs and the lungs are our giant mucus membranes that of course\nThe actually in Chinese medicine the backup to your large intestine show when we're not that adjusting well\nWe can expect jump to be dumped into the lungs and all manner of problems can arise with the lungs\nAnd in almost every case what we have to start with is to improve digestion when we promote the best health the digestion\nWe can greatly reduce the load on the lungs when we get vitamin D levels to the ideal maybe sixty to a hundred ... leader in the blood just about no one who's wearing clothing has a really ideal vitamin D three level\nAnd it's been shown to be involved in\nLiterally all of the immune compounds the body makes it's been shown to be very critical to the intestinal lining\nThe integrity of the money to the health of the lungs and so much more so than jumping on R D three gold and maybe using six to ten drops in the day if you're under forty usually can absorb this really well\nIf you're over forty than it might be a good idea to put those six to ten drops into a half ounces of water and they had two or three of four drops of Lima name that's an essential oil of orange mixed it really good and now it takes the D. three to tiny tiny little\nDots and it makes it really is in most advisor to it makes it really easy for you to absorb it and get its maximum help for the intestines and for the lungs\nThan another wonderful thing that can be done is dragging the Clintons LAX\nBecause of the extraordinary ability for the\n... to bind to a wide variety of toxins and the G. I. track and it can trap these toxins in about keep them there keep them from hitting the bloodstream and hitting the lungs and then they can be ex greeted not ribs or by the body said today\nWe'll have our Detroit ego hold on special you buy one get the second one fifty percent off\nAlso have our dragon Clinton's LAX give above the store or the line eight hundred three Seventy five\nThirty four forty seven minutes eight hundred three Seventy thirty or forty seven All right this is Dr Bob Marshall pitch the this has helped my live or answering your\nNutrition and health related colds who reaches toll free triple eight five\nEighty Seventy five Seventy Sixers go right back to the phones let's go to Richard in Boulder, Colorado and he's bloating and wants to track down the source of is intestinal gas so you there Richard\nYes I Am doctor for taking my call\nYou will come hold a man or even how much do you weigh\nForty three about one Seventy eight\nThe odds are that the intestinal gas now is from either the gall bladder or your stomach is not able to produce enough hydro caloric asset and those are the two culprits normally with intestinal gas does the gas you have to have an older\nThey all need vitamin D three\nAnd boy you want to jump on that it's inexpensive it's convenient and just about no one on earth is vitamin D sufficient as soon as we put clothes on it's hard for all of us to have ideal levels of the three and that means that it's going to be tougher\nFor us to have the best bones metabolism because the three is needed that it's going to be tougher for us to have the best immune response because it's literally every aspect of the immune system depends on vitamin D three\nAnd that's not enough all the mucus membranes depend on it from the lungs all the way through to the intestines and the prostate\nThey all depend on vitamin D three so be sure\nThat you get on R D three gold and if you're over forty forty a rover you oughta ed Lyman with it so that you can be sure it's fully in most of an easy to absorb and that guy will help across the board for the bladder the prostate the lungs everybody\nBut do remember the lungs are your back up to the large intestine\nAnd the two ways that literally everybody in America dies is one they don't have enough minerals\nAnd two they can't digest it absorbed their food so somewhere around age thirty it's a really good idea to begin supporting your digestive system so you don't have to deal with a crash when you're forty or fifty or sixty so\nTo do that you'd get on her quantum digest and are the teen hydro chloride and if you want to slow the aging you dad the HDL activate her as well\nAnd if you'd call it a little line they're going to help you with all that so don't miss out on it\nAnd if you want more support for the prostate we've got our prostate support your getting up at night we've courts have our pollen floor\nAll of these will be on special to help you and if you need maximum bladder support you'd get on a lot of support right along with our garlic side so that you can promote the best health of that mucus membrane area\nAnd of course are one of ... great tasting you can

thirty four forty seven eight hundred three Seventy\nOr eighty four forty seven let's go right back to the phones let's go to Carmen in\nPasadena and she's ... hair from the back of her head are you there Carmine yes yes how old women are you and how much do you weigh s\nS. s my sister who is looking to get back on his head\nOkay how old is your sister and how much leeway in eighty one hundred and fifty K.\nWell two things number one is going to be digestion is she on digestive enzymes no well there's no way she is digesting your meal every time she eats the food's rotting\nSo what she needs to do is get on the quantum died just or something like it will give her pancreatic enzymes in ... two of those at the start of the meal in the end of the meal about maybe for the pain ...\nAnd now there's no more rotting food step one or ...\nAnd step to uh the hair loss if the back those patching laws of hair is almost Fisher linked to the adrenal so you want to get adrenal support and she would need to take about six of those at breakfast\nAnd she would yes yes and use that\nI think that's yes and use that Andrew months and during that I might not a ... when it got so long it will only at breakfast okay\nOkay now she's got to you got to check whether it'd be sure she sleeps five straight hours or more he does you got to make sure good then you're going to make sure she has enough water which would be a half or waiting ounces of water so Seventy five ounces per day and she had to build up to that if she done getting enough\nIs she can increase eight ounces of day once a week until she gets the water you got to double check salt\nIf she eats all whole food not doesn't buy any processed food\nThen she may need a little air dried she saw or better yet are pink so that they're dried sees all with the volcanic trace elements added to it so he needs to cover all of these issues\nIf she worries a lot about something she may need some extra fee and all these things will bring her back to the center\nFor the adrenal function okay what about holidays in Florida ... that would be if she has to get up at night tier innate like for no reason now gets ... and she gets up once at night well that's not good yeah then ... would be\nBut for a maybe do capsules a at breakfast and shit and usually after about two three weeks you'll see that the body is then able to use it

N.\nF. O. a bath pensions at least in the traditional sense I Know those are a lot less common these days and there is this worry out there that lingers amongst a lot of us that Social Security it's not that strong and my dry up\nDoes anything on your list here any of your assets that you brought to us today do any of those things account for shortfalls that we might experiences were trying to find our retirement yeah\nActually I'm really glad you brought this up because this is a really big one sources that provide guaranteed income streams during retirement so we've talked about pensions and Social Security so fewer and fewer pensions out there\nAnd we also talked about the fact that Social Security is not designed to cover all of your retirement living expenses so people really need an additional guaranteed source of retirement income\nSo I was actually working with Brady and Hannah recently and they were sixty two years old and they needed two thousand dollars every single month to supplement their Social Security and so we needed to come up with a mechanism to cover that on a guaranteed bases\nAnd so one of their options\nLet's use bonds bonds are not very very uh conducive for income right now and another one of the options was using a\nNew contract and Brittany looked at me and he said oh man I've heard some bad things about annuities and I said yeah Brady I have to\nYou here's the interesting thing I agree with all that bad press that's out there about annuity contracts there's about a thousand of them in Pennsylvania and I only use about three to five of 'em because there's so many bad features out there\nSo few are interested in making sure that you can supplement your Social Security with additional manmade pension or self made pension make sure you give me a call an annuity can be a good way to convert lump sum that you've been building up inside a retirement account into a guaranteed income stream\nHow readily available bat the are these in Atlanta new any mechanism\nWell not nearly as available if people would like the investment options with ... and other retirement savings through your employer man they're very limited\nThere's only very few of them that will allow you to convert that lump sum into a stream of income so I'll give you one example if you happen to have TI a craft\nThrough a college or university they will let you do that but that's one of the very few examples\nAnd so if you have a four O. one K. what you can do is you can roll it over and then you can invest however you want so that you're going from very limited investment options into the whole world of investment options\nAnd annuities might be suitable for part of that money I wouldn't say put all of your money into their\nSo she is another thing that's really important now when I was talking with Brady and Hannah\nBrady is an engineer and he's working for a pretty big engineering company and at the age of sixty two without being retired he said well I won't be able to do that for another five or six years until I retire\nAnd said well Brady what if the market tanked between now and then we just recently seen a big example of that he said yeah I've been very worried about my four oh one K. and I said Brady overall are you at a game and he said yes even though it's give it a little bit of that back in the last couple of weeks\nAnd I said do you what a lock that Kenyan Brady said yes\nAnd I said here's the deal Brady you are over the age of fifty nine and a half\nAnd you're still working but you can still roll out the bulk of that for all and K into your own IRA\n... he says no kidding and so we ended up rolling out the bulk of the money out of Brady for all and K while he was still working now almost all plans allow this not all of them so ask me if you don't know if your plans allows allows that\nAnd we also left Brady is planned open so that he could continue making tax deductible contributions and getting matching contributions Brady said wow I thought it was captive in this ... all these years\nIf you have a four O. one K. or a four three B or another work related retirement plan almost all of those plans allow that if you don't know if your plan does ask me if you would like to look at finding a way to supplement your Social Security with income that you can't outlive\nAnd making that work in conjunction with their Social Security strategy that you and your spouse can't outlive it protects your spouse\nCalled me right now we're alive and we will answer the phone number is eight hundred

[noise]\nAnd I are so have you with us today for the networks financial our we were able to sit down with my national educator and nine time New York times\nBest selling author David ... he weighs in on the market volatility we saw this month remember this is the largest drop we've seen on Wall street since February why does it mean for you as you get closer to retirement let's listen in in here from David\nOctober tenth saw the worst day for the down since February\nA big drop in popular tech stocks put any impact will sell off in motion so what does this mean for you your finances and most importantly your retirement David by a well known financial educator is here to make sense of what's happening on Wall street and David been featured on Fox CBS\nCNBC the today show and Oprah\nDavid been out there in teaching America about money for more than two decades he's nine time New York times best selling author\nOf books including smart couples finished rich and smart women finished rich and today he's co founder of ag wealth management one of America's fastest growing our eye gaze David wealth and we are thrilled to have you with us today\nWell Meghan it's great to be with you even though you know it's a little ugly in the markets still great to be with you so thanks for having me on the show\nLet's not about that and eight hundred plus point drop or the Dow Jones we know that rarely happens due to just one event so set the stage for us here what sparked a sell off\n... well it's a handful of things first of all and it's it's really taken place over three or four days so we were over a thousand pointed down on the Dow in a handful days here and this is scaring people and and so the question becomes all is there anything specific that's going on and I'll give you a handful\nThe first thing is that rates are going up and you even heard the president talked about this well let's break it down what does that mean when you hear rates are going up and that is raising rates the fed the actually been raising rates really since two thousand team but\nMost recently the fed raises rates on the money that things can land they call it the Federal Reserve fund rate ... record happened in September and\nWhen those rates went up a couple of things happened first of all the costs to borrow money goes up right so you're going to borrow money for a home if you're going to refinance your home if you're going to buy a car and you're going to finance that car or you're going to use credit cards for that matter anything where where you're borrowing money\nThe cost to borrow that money is now going up\nAnd that's ... ... spoke some market right because if you're\nHome maybe people will buy the buy less homes or they'll refinance or home last so they'll buy less cars or they'll shop less when it costs more to borrow money the markets can spoof that consumers will slow down on their spending and so that's the first thing it's really been a story about\nThe fed and rate going up now we have to put down a little bit in the context because\nLet's be honest rates have been really really really really low like you know we've had historically low rates for well over ten years and those historical rate which the fed put in place after our great recession\nWe're successful that's what got the economy going again and that's why we are right now enjoying what is the longest bull market in history so\nYou have to put that in perspective um and they're all some other things are happening their influence in the stock market which is as rates have gone up the tenure treasury the rates have gone up on that right now so right now the three or the ten year treasuries over three point one five to as I speak\nThat means if you go and buy a ten year treasury are going to get a rate of\nThree point one five to ... percent and that's the highest rates we've seen on tenure treasuries and like seven years so that's also a very interesting thing to tap and then there's the fact that the tech market hasn't way like it's right let me see that\nWe've seen a sell off in tech stocks particularly tech stocks though I'm like Amazon and Facebook and that's not all related interest rates there's been some data breaches\nWith companies involved like Amazon a potentially data breach and Facebook had a recent data breach so there's been some salt in these tech stocks but again making putting that in perspective it's been the tech stocks have been driving the market higher\nCompany and we call him saying companies like Facebook and Amazon and Netflix and Google use ... tech companies\nHave been absolutely on fire in terms of growing and they've been the stocks been driving the market hires the fact they pulled down a little bit um it's not that surprising it was probably about time for us to see tech stocks pull back\nI think the third thing that we know is affecting the market is actually the global markets that trade wars um\nAll this talk of trade war with China is having an impact and it's been really having an impact globally the global markets have been really down compared to like the U.S economy has just been on fire we have been absolutely crushing it we've had the best stock market in the world um\nAnd so we you know us pulling back a little bit compared to what's happening abroad um there's really been a lot less like abroad the global markets but down emerging marked down\nAnd we've just been doing great so I think it was sort of time for the U.S market maybe a little bit of a breather to an almost a recognize things are slowing down globally\nPartially because of the fear of these trade wars with John\nSince several components leading to this precipitous drop on Wall street even I Want to go back to those rising rate I Know that they can sell trouble for the overall economy but aren't higher interest rates really liberal retirees\nWill you know you're exactly right they are good for retirees especially retirees by the way we'll pay down their debt right which is something I've talked about for Twenty years the fastest\nWay to to reach retirement early is to pay your debt off so if you reached retirement and you and you don't have a mortgage payment you don't have a car loan\nAnd you're probably not using credit cards to borrow money if if you're doing one retirement than the good news about race going higher\nIs that the rates on your money market and your checking account and CDs and again treasuries are going higher and if the most retirees live off of the income that their retirement money produces", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "21"}
