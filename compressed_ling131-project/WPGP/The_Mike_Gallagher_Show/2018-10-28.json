{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WPGP", "content": "Be in your four one K. there's something called net on realized appreciation or any way\nAnd this could be a big help to people that have four one K. is retirement savings plans\nWhere you hold a high percentage are a lot of employers stock and as you know that employers stock it's always something that you should look at\nSome times we found people that have sixty Seventy eighty Ninety a hundred percent of their retirement plans an employer stock which is not a good idea folks\nYet is not asset allocation edits fine instead of not diversification but let's say you find yourself with a lot of company stock in your four one K. so let's let's say that you worked for Westinghouse\nFor all these years and you had\nA while if this stock even exist anymore but if you had Westinghouse stock in your Westinghouse savings plan or if you worked for Proctor and gamble\nAnd you had eight hundred thousand in your four one K. and five hundred thousand is in Proctor and gamble stock or taking advantage of this net and realized appreciation is there is a cost basis that you paid for that company stock that the company\nKeeps track of how much money did you point out of your own sweat equity into that stock it's called your costs basis\nSo in my example you have eight hundred thousand and four O. one K.\nFive hundred thousand of it is in the stock of the company you work for three hundred thousand that just called mutual funds\nOr that five hundred thousand dollars of company stock let's say that you have a certain amount invested into that obviously you look at it and say All right what do I have invested in it and let's say that you pay fifty thousand dollars into that stock over the years and it grew to five hundred thousand\nSo in a normal situation then you have four hundred and fifty thousand dollars of capital gains if that account was not in an hour\nIf it were not in in Iraq so or four one K. correct so if you were able to if I were to tell you that wasn't that unreal realized appreciation it's hard to say that well\nAnyway it's easier to say no or all out there that are on like I said needing unlimited assets if you take that\nAnd you you have the ability to roll that to an after tax the cap and you say wait if I wrote to an after tax account I'm going to have to pay taxes on five hundred thousand dollars and the answer to that is no not or if it's done properly under the end you a provision you only ordinary income tax on your costs basis which in my example was fifty thousand dollars\nThe other four hundred and fifty thousand dollars when\nOld when the stock is sold will be taxes a capital gain not as ordinary income tax rates and if you're in a high bracket you might go from thirty thirty five percent taxation on that money down to Fifteen which is what long term gains are for a lot of individuals and retirement and you might not end up paying much capital gains tax that all\nDepending on your income so there are there provisions there now\nI've just looked at this with the client recently where it made no sense to take advantage because them paying any ordinary income tax even on their costs basis now\nAt a thirty seven percent rate they will be in a twelve percent tax bracket when they retire which is lower than the capital gains rate that they would pay depending on their income what all end up getting out of retirement so it may or may not make sense at that time but it did not make sense to use it but there are some pitfalls folks\nIf you just attempt to do this there are rules you have to pay that ordinary income tax you have to roll out there were the entire amount of the four one K. before the end of the calendar year et cetera et cetera so like we talked about earlier with rollovers in sixty day rollovers\nTaking advantage of net ... appreciation is a science and it's something that you should call us if you have company stock\nIn your four one K. call us today eight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three that's eight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three and let us give you the advice I we have a CPA in house that can examine every personal situation right here in our building\nAnd tell you if it makes sense to do that and boy that could be a huge tax savings for many of you listening\nAnd a lot of your advisors are are not talking to you about it because they they are not familiar with it they're they don't do retirement and they don't focus in areas like this\nOh and folks it's that simple you know there's a lot of advisors in brokers that want to help you invest your money and believe it or not that's the easy part [laughter]\nYou might be chuckling right now with the market going up and down the way it is but yeah that is the easy part\nNot trying to turn your life savings into a paycheck that last while also protecting that savings for market volatility is the challenge remember the only way to really figure this out is to get information edge to sit down with someone who does this\nDay in day out he's learning the strategies that move you from a retirement savings plan into a retirement income plan and we've got lots of opportunities for you to do that coming up during this next month of November\nWe've got retirement classes at community college south campus in West ... we've got retirement classes at community college boys up in Monroeville we've got workshops in the waterfront down in ah west homestead in hopes that area\nSo you've got lots of opportunities for you to increase your knowledge base there is no obligation when you come to these things there's a small cost for the college classes that just covers the room run on the cost of materials\nBut folks your retirement is just too important to leave it to chance find out how you could have a solid retirement income plant\nEight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three where you go to our website click on the events tab and you'll find out how to sign up for those classes again that synergy group Inc dot com asked why and he or gee why the word group I. N. C. dot com\nSo obviously building a retirement plan where your paycheck is recreated building a plan where your assets are protected these things are so important and we always say it's not just what you make it's what you keep and\nThat brings us into the discussion about taxes and we talk about Tom Barrett the CPA that works with us here and he's a huge help and an asset to our clients uh we are trained in terms of helping looking at the tax situation but that's what he does and that's why we have them integrated\nInto our practice and I always tell people look taxes are there is the the old cliche you know the only thing certain our\nDeath and taxes and and that's one of the benefits of building these accounts and accumulating tax deferred retirement savings it's tax deferred that's a huge deal while you're saving but guess what when you get to retirement it's taxable and you need to find some efficient strategies\nThat's right and you also you want to pay the small amount of taxes possible absolutely so I think of crazy stories you know having for young kids so here's how my mind works at there's this for whatever reason this cultural phenomenon that you have to go to a pumpkin patch every year you know ... I mean this is talk in patches\nInteresting even when the kids are older you still have to do this when they're gone you still have to do this if you have a young at heart wife like guide\nOr grandkids right or yeah or whatever that is that is an interesting phenomenon you go out and this muddy field and there's a bunch of punk and they're not attached to the vines anymore they're just kind of sitting there staged by you know by the former but the the reason I bring up the pumpkin patch is we had our kids out after our soccer games this weekend we had the kids out of the pumpkin patch\nAnd were walking around and the kids are saying they'll look at this one and cold and picks up a rotten pumpkin and you know throws a debris altruism chaos there but eventually they find the perfect pumpkins and we put it in this thing was Vegas I got thirty some pound pumpkin wow and we put it onto the one of those wheelbarrow carts if you remember those and\nWe willed it up to the ah we were out to transform actually I'm Harrison city and we build it up to the register\nAnd there was a sign that the register and folks there is a point so stay with me here or decided to register said you have to pay taxes on your pumpkins\nUnless you tell us your going to eat your pumpkin I'm Serious about this and it's at the white pumpkins are inevitable so you have to pay tax on them so the point was is if you say I'm going to eat the pumpkin you don't pay tax on the punk\nIf you don't say you're going to eat it then it's taxable the interesting thing is it that makes me think about retirement because there are some things that you get to pick\nWhen you pay taxes you get to make the choice just like I had the choice to say you know what we're going to carve this bumped in order to make a Jack o lantern we're going to take those seeds are going to eat the seat so we will be part of the punk and\nSo by telling now they say seven percent on my pumpkin Its Food and I told the truth because we will lead to said to my wife and I tried to make a pile of some of the filling but the like and the story here to understand that there's some things are certain investments are certain decisions you can make where you have to tell\nYour plan or should be telling you whether or not you're going to eat the pumpkin you know so whether or not when what choices you have in limiting or controlling your taxation is the same decision I had when the kids and I were up there making that decision at the pumpkin patch and\nRemember that you know remember that you have that freedom but again advisors a lotta times focus on selling and selling and we need to step back and we need to focus on reducing taxes and building income plans and building retirement plans and because we only do retirement this energy group that's what we think about so\nLet us help you decide uh when you pay taxes by structuring your plant properly and making sure that taxes are integrated into your retired\nAbsolutely you know folks that difference here at the synergy group is we specialize in not only retirement planning but relationships we care about you you're not just a client you're not just another number you know it's just another set of accounts you or someone that we care deeply about and your success is our success\nEight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three\nYeah I Do have a some pain in my lower back or like ... feet\nWell that doesn't necessarily mean is an interference field there the pain and you're back in ... feet in my estimation the most common thing is that you're not getting enough minerals\nSo you can get a roller ph paper and you can test your first morning urine ph you tear off a little piece pass it through the stream and it

little bit less than three court and unfortunately a by not getting that water it's very very hard on the kidney\nThe other problems for the kidneys are really it shares this with the brain is getting

Julie\nHi that's about ... I'm like oh\nYou're welcome how old woman or even how much the way\nI Am thirty and then we went twelve\nVery very young to have this sort of problem it was it spawned by an injury to blow a fall or what\nI Know it's too much computer and you know I Try to switch to different mouth but I've already got the information going on trying to treat it naturally and I don't want to take all the fed said\nWell the first thing you need to know is that it's almost sure that you've got an interference field the scar trauma or blow maybe you fell horn on that risk as a small child or\nAdolescent and that's what's blocking in building this problem in other words the other side is just mind but you're not using the same [noise]\nUh I don't believe that moving your mouse will ever do it I'm you know twice your age and I moved that males for a million times but I Will tell you\nThat I grew up in New York where are pastime was fighting and my wrists were amounts I must've done or how many many mud packs on both of my wrist to get them to show their pain free and that they work the way this supposed to\nBut you could do the same thing instead of hitting something or someone by falling down and I'd be looking hard at that and especially when it's only one hand and the other hand seems to be pretty good and I think you're right though that a surgery in cortisone shots\nIs going to treat your symptom yeah you need to get to the cause so a couple of things that you can take that promote healthy inflammatory response one of them is bone and joint\nAnd at your body's eyes maybe three per meal will be plenty and then a vegetarian ... called the J to hundred\nAnd taking maybe ten of those at your main meal you can choose them spit out the absolutely tastes good but you would be taking it with you know food that had protein\nLike beans and rice or whatever else you're eating okay and that ought to make a big difference reducing foods that are pro inflammatory like eliminating eggs eliminating\nPoultry and restrict being written meat to may be a red meat or fish to know more than once per day\nAnd also barrier to restrict dairy 'cause all of those are pro inflammatory\nOh I get to know if they think I eat way too much of all of that\nWill and you just uh it's time for you to love that body a little bit better and make some changes and I think that by making those changes the worst guy in town is gonna be ... next runner up his poultry and the Knicks runner up is very\nSo those guys give them a Ninety day holiday I think you may have a new lease on life\nOkay thank you I'll Try that they could take care of by now All right\nThis is talk about Marshall PHD this has helped mine live and we get near the end of the broadcast guys so if you're on the line and I don't get to you just stay there will catch up here\nAnd I just want to do a quick recap of today's great specials in addition to our the age eight two hundred directly how the brain but of course the J helps the newer than\nThe kidneys and so much more are quantum Roseberry drone one of the best any accidents on the planet\nAnd does so much more or in the aging so that's on special and of course we also

and this is for the folks who\nWill only take one bill and you could give him maybe five or six capsules of this\nDevalue the bonds go down what about inflation that's another wrists so that's the risk that you your your portfolio is not going to keep up with increases in the cost of living so it's the risk that you're purchasing power will decline that means\nThat the same money doesn't buy as much there's risk with any investment choice\nIncluding the choice not to make a decision not to make a change or not to invest it all\nThat's why we net worth advisors maintain a diverse collection of investment we've got a little bit of everything that's available but we want to help you choose to specific investments that will help balance the risk as you retire and as your investments provide growth and protection\nSo bad you know that feels I have to be honest it feels like a balancing act almost like you're you know spinning plates in the era one falls it's going to crash your retirement strategy is there a way to feel just perhaps a little more confident about your your approach to retirement\nYes absolutely it is a balancing act and that's why you need to work with the right professional and you've got to have a plan so I Can't tell you how many times I've talked with my husband about doing different things maybe it was just planning a vacation or a camping trip\nAnd when we planted out ahead of time we did much much better so we're talking about your retirement savings here we're talking about the money that you have saved all of your working lives thinks about think about how many years\nYou were to save all that money and what it means if you don't have it\nNow we want to make sure that we focus on retirement income strategies in our discussion today\nSo we want to make sure that when you're choosing somebody to specifically giving you guidance and advice on retirement planning you want to make sure that if somebody qualified to give you advice now I'm a CSP certified financial planner\nAnd I'm also a CPA so I'm qualified to put that tax advice into my written plans for my clients I Am working with Tony in Indiana and they came into my office last week and I thought about them as I was getting ready for today's show\nThey're both age sixty two and they're ready to retire\nAnd I wanted to have a lot less risk than Tony in fact and it was really shocked when I showed her the analysis of how much she could really lose in her retirement portfolio\nThey could stand to lose a third of their savings neither one of them knew about that most people don't know how much risk they have\nAnd so I said what would it do to your ability to be retired if you didn't have thirty percent of your savings are you thinking about this right now are you thinking oh my goodness how much risk do I have in my portfolio am I going to make the wrong decision because I don't have a plan\nCall me my number's eight hundred seven to five to nine a witness or financial advisors focused specifically on retirement income planning\nWhether you're getting ready to retire like Annan Tony or whether you're already retired and you're drawing from your savings\nWere alive we'll answer the phone I'm going to give you the number twice or write it down the number's eight hundred seven to five to nine eight eight don't wait don't procrastinate call me an eight hundred seven to five to nine eight eight\nBats website if you haven't checked this out this is a tremendous\nResource for you and it's just chock full of great information upcoming seminars are listed here you can find out more about bats\nAnd her team so simply go to Beth Andrews dot info it's bath Andrews dot I. N. F. O. you know that when we're keeping these risks in mind that you're talking about\nHow we figure out how much risk we already have in our own strategy well I use\nThe Andrews retirement GPS to determine if you're on track for for part of it\nAnd then I also use a team of CF piece to do a weighted average analysis which gives you a risk score so what you get is a score for what you've got in your investments and then I also make sure that my clients walk through a risk questionnaire\nThat gives them a score for what they can actually tolerate it's amazing how many times those two numbers are really far apart so for many of my clients it helps to visualize the impact\nOf different market conditions so if we have another recession like we had in two thousand and we had again in two thousand and eight what does that do to your lifestyle if you are retired\nSo that's all your assets to gather categorize like that that might show a different story than what you thought those quarterly statements are showing right\nYeah that's exactly right when you add it all up think about that stack of statements that is not a plan\nHaving money and your four one K. all by itself that's not a plan I had somebody come to me and say yeah best I've been working with this financial advisor for a few years and he said we're just going to roll over the four oh one K. into an IRA and draw down\nThat is not a plant and that could be a recipe for disaster\nSo when you add up everything that you have sometimes people find out they've got a lot more money in one area like large cap stocks and they thought because they've been plowing money into their four one K. for a long time and quite frankly large dogs have done really really well\nThis is called overlap and it might be where you have all your money in one category or maybe all your money in one stock cars you might own five or six different mutual funds that have a lot of money in one stock and said that can be really really dangerous\nSo when I was working with Annan Tony recently we went through the Andrews retirement GPS and it showed them that they each had different risk profiles and it was averse to risk Tony was okay with some risk maybe not as much risk because they had\nBut now we had a starting point we knew exactly what we needed to do we needed to get to where each of them were comfortable and we needed to get to where it made sense for them to be able to draw retirement income from the savings that they had\nNo family had a lot of longevity in it she was pretty confident she was going to live well into her nineties and Tony family didn't so and I had a discussion about how risk is especially important\nConcerning women because women live longer we have to make sure that we preserve our savings\nFor a much much longer time your health and your wells are connected there's no question about that\nNow Tony is a veteran so he's one of my heroes he did twenty five years in the coast guard he knew the risks in his job and he accepted debt\nAnd on the other hand stayed home and raised three children she was her job was to keep those children safe and she wanted to keep her money safe as well we worked out a good sense of bold plan for them using the Andrews retirement GPS\nNow and Tony are meeting with me in my office in South point\nIt is right off of Seventy nine it's easy to find

network with bats Andrews that she's been helping\nPeople here in our community for the past Twenty years to plan for successful retirement she loved the chance to help you as well you can call her today if you'd like to set a visit and one of her office is\nThe main office in South point and she has an additional office and Robin said here's that phone number\nEight hundred Seventy five to nine eight eight the number to call again it's eight hundred Seventy five twenty nine eighty eight and her website bath Andrews dot in oh we're talking today about risk and we've discussed the importance of diversifying across asset classes which is\nProbably the number one way to limit risking your portfolio how else can we protect against the weak spots that might be lurking in our strategy well\nAs you said since the beginning of the show today is very important to have a plan and so part of your overall retirement plan should not only have that pie chart that diversification of assets that also should have some different accounts with different tax treatment\nNow I'll give you some examples of that I've got clients who needed to take a tremendous amount of money out of their Iowa re\nIn order to purchase a second home and we did some planning on that and we found out that they were going to have a very big tax bill and it was going to bump 'em up to tax bracket so what we decided to do is to spread that out over time instead of taking it in any one year\nSo they use just strategy that you involved getting a loan for the second house now I Know having debt is an emotional issue especially in retirement\nBut when we looked at the amount of money that they would need to pay on taxes to take that money out of their IRA and put it down in a lump sum it just wasn't worth it\nKeep in mind when you take big lump sum is out of your IRA you'd have to pay tax on the amount you take out and then you have to pay tax on the tax and so on\nIn order to get that money out so by the time we grow stood up and that was a big tax bill that they really wanted to avoid they wanted to avoid going up into\nOne or two higher income tax bracket now another thing that you can do is managed capital gains\nSome of my clients take the stocks that they have that had big capital gains on them and instead of giving cash to their church they gift stuck to the church and guess what the church doesn't pay\nTaxes on the games you can do that with any qualified charity so it's just a way to manage taxes and have that tax diversity as well as to have diversity among different types of stocks large stocks and small stuff\nNow have that flexibility other times people just want to do day to day normal things like buying a car and so Megan if we're planning on buying a car and the next year we wanted to come out of that tax free account right\nIn deed found me tax I liked that word tax rate okay so that's how he and tax diversification how can that help protect your assets from certain risks out there well having\nDifferent tax treatments and the different buckets of your retirement strategy gives you options now sometimes people have the opposite of spending money in large sums like buying a car or buying that second vacation home sometimes people don't have that option like in the in the instance of having a big medical expense\nOr if you have to take withdrawals to pay loans just because you want to get to retirement and not have any loan\nSo setting yourself up so that you have options gives you flexibility whether it's a good situation or a bad situation one of the situations that I can think of that happens frequently in that our our friends Tony An ana we're worried about is what if one person passes away early\nSo if you think about that Tony has a little bit of the veterans pension but most of their their income comes from Social Security\nNow is Tony does pass away before Anna she's going to be in a situation where she needs to make up the lost income from losing his Social Security by taking money out of their IRAs that means they higher tax situation for Anna\nNow you want to make sure that you meet with somebody that's qualified to give huge tax advice now I'm a CPA\nAnd I'm also a C. F. P. so I'm qualified to give tax advice on your account as well if you're only getting investment advice if you only sit down with your financial advisor and they're not telling you what the best way to take\nSocial Security is and how to smooth out your taxes and give yourself tax options in the future that's not overall comprehensive advice\nThe plan shorter let you see the future so you can plan for unexpected health expenses or the sudden death of a spouse now we ended up with Tony and and we ended up purchasing some life insurance\nAnd it wasn't really convinced set of Tony was gone that she would have enough money to stay in her current house she lives really close or children and she's expecting their first grandchild coming up really soon\nSo one of her biggest fears was having to leave the lifestyle that she's got\nShe wants to stay in her house and spend time with her grandchild to we ended up putting some life insurance into the mix as well life insurance is tax free as well why not put your your plan and your savings in the hands of a genuine financial professional\nSomeone whose license to give tax in other advice as well as just investment advice call me an eight hundred Seventy five to nine eight eight don't wait don't procrastinate if you call me right now we're live and we will answer the phone\nIf you have at least two hundred thousand dollars save for retirement call me right now at eight hundred Seventy five to nine eight eight\nAnd you can reach back on line as well at best Andrews that info you can learn more about the Andrews retirement GPS and her upcoming dinner workshop again here's that website it's bath Andrews dot info", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "28"}
