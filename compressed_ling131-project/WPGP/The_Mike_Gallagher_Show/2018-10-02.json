writes Dr Ford has been manipulated by the Democrats who hid her letter making uncorroborated accusations against Kavanaugh for over a month dragged her into the national limelight and urge to avoid meeting with the Senate Republicans have members at one Point New rights\nFord said she couldn't meet because she was afraid to fly\nAlthough it was revealed at Thursday's Judiciary Committee hearing that she has flown numerous times for vacations Ford was put through all of this even though she could not remembering what House the alleged gathering an assault on her took place or when it occurred at the same time no one's you said was present has core operator her story\nHer testimony was emotionally compelling it's clear that something happened to her\nNewt Gingrich rights but she knows as a

Brian shelter who is a Trump hater and a a huge huge media cheerleader for all things on the left\nHates Fox News hates conservatives and he's supposed to be there I guess their media critic\nHere's a Jeff Greenfield said Brian shelter over the weekend on CNN in what was I think an epic ethic taped out of the network that is now in a distant third place in the cable news ratings wars\nHave to say this quite bluntly new CNN anchor when I looked at CNN hour after hour after hour icy panels rather than work forty exchanging opinions the overwhelming majority would on this network I regard as quite critical hospital for ... now that may be justified\nA fascinating\nAnd he went on and so that was a much longer piece about how there's not a whole lot he says it may be these folks have concluded on I'm sure why that click click click the way it where where did but here's what he said\nWell let me read the whole close as we don't have the full video clip but I Apologize for that he said I have to say this to a CNN anchor when I look at CNN hour after hour I she panels rather than the reporting exchanging opinions the majority of which are on this network I regard as quite

are hostile to Trump that may be justified it made me these folks have included in the way that Trump has to be have that they deserve this pushback\nWhat you've described these two different universes has only been accelerate I've said this over and over again if you have a shred of fairness you ask yourself how can a CNN not have one\nSingle personality even mildly pro Trump you ever think about that CNN says they're nice people CNN says there objective like Fox News they've got opinion shows\nIt got news people Wolf Blitzer you're supposed to be a news guy go down the list John

trash the president of the United states period panel after panel and\nI I guess the proof is in deporting because Fox News channel last week\nThey've posted numbers for Sean Hannity show on Fox

they're going to be by the hallmark channel Nickelodeon the cartoon network\nI Know world trash fiction riveted by the cabin on process but you know what the Dow is that\nDow was up to a hundred

angry Americans who are shorter fueling this week the turn of events on friday was enough to drive even the most calm level headed versus a little bit bonkers me let me start before we talk about\nThe ah reversal by Jeff Flake his change of heart after he was confronted by a pair of activists shut the senators only elevator\nThe morning [noise] let me give you some good news let me give you some reason to stay optimistic to stay upbeat\nUm the Dow Jones industrial average rose to hundred points today um investors are cheering the news of Canada joining a trade deal with the United states and Mexico [noise]\nUm [noise] the impending collapse of NASA NAFTA ...\nShaw rights over hot air dot com it's not quite a big as big a deal as a Brexit but it certainly had President Trump's critics quite exercise over it\nNow however it looks like everyone can go back about their normal business after months of stalling and preening Canada's prime minister Justin Trudeau\nCame back to the table at the eleventh hour and\nAgreed to join the U.S and Mexico in this deal last minute trade deal reforming NAFTA just what the president wanted huge victory and as a Peter Navarro put\nThe president has put together the best performance on the economy and trade of any president in modern history that's not high purple\nAnd it matters because it affects every single one of us it affects every one of our bank accounts and it affects every one of our retirements are four one K. is our paychecks\nHere's a Peter Navarro this is a ... number one again just two minutes of good news in a sea of bad news 'cause there's nothing really good about the Kavanaugh store nothing\nAll we can do is hope and pray\nThat\nThe senators come to their senses the cabinet gets confirmed\nAnd it's crucial because this involves way more than just one man has a lot more to do\nThere's a lot more at stake than just Brett Kavanaugh will get into that and just a couple of moments as well but I Want you to see the White House trade advisors on Fox News over the weekend it's just cut number one here is the way Peter Navarro describes what President Trump has done with our economy and trade\nPresident Donald Trump has very quietly been putting together the best performance on the economy and trade of any president in modern history [noise]\nAnd ah it's it's really truly extraordinary and I think quietly\nBecause the media has under report in both the actions we poking and the results and exhibit a in this last week the United nations\nWere president ... traded a groundbreaking with South Korea open negotiation with ... and work with our allies in Japan and Europe to issue strong statement against the behavior of China\nNow now if you need any proof for about a corrupt news media all you have to do is acknowledge what Peter Navarro says about the way the media has under reported all of this huge news it's the Trump keeps winning I Know Trump haters\nHate to hear that I Know it makes you crazy to hear that\nIt's a fat he keeps winning he's not pulling the Dow out of his ear okay he's not making up the unemployment numbers this is not a tweet from the president at midnight these are facts\nAnd um [noise]\nIt's part of why they're threatened by um it's part of why the left is so desperately trying to stop Brett Kavanaugh they figured this will be a major defeat for the president it will be incidentally if Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed\nLet's start with one of the big takeaways of the last few days one of the biggest takeaways is watching this stunning\nUm crowing by leftists and activists and progressive over the weekend on social media about how getting in people's faces screaming at them ... them cornering people like Jeff Flake\nEffect change this is why we do it\nThat's what makes Ana Marie Cox all these other folks got on social media this is why we get a new faces because it works Jeff Flake caving and Jeff Flake changing his mind after he was berated by the activists\nIn the elevator and they are activists I don't know if they were sexually assaulted and if they were my heart goes out to them as my heart goes out to any victim of sexual assault the Christian plus the Ford was sexually assaulted by heart goes after\nAnd as the president said her testimony was compelling what makes this\nAn fulfilling for everybody is the fact that judge Kavanaugh's testimony was compelling as well\nIf you are wrongly accused of such a horrific thing I Would think you'd react with the world watching precisely the way he did without a doubt\nAnd so we are left with a he said she said here's a major takeaway if Kavanaugh gets derailed and the confirmation fails it's open season on every Republican in public office\nIs a good they're going to because they believe that getting in somebody's face and shrieking and screaming and berating somebody in public works that's what Senator Jeff flake gave them on friday\nHe has to know it can't be a stupid man\nAnd a word about Jeff Flake before we open up our phone lines and we dive into all of this here on a Monday as we get ready wrap it up for what's going to be undoubtedly a very tough week worried about Jeff Flake raging about him is as productive as complaining about the whether he is who he is\nHe admitted on sixty minutes last night shockingly but he would have never changed his mind the way he did friday if he were up for reelection\nHe told the world if I had any accountability here I'd never do this he thinks that's a good thing he he thought that was good to tell Scott Kelly of CBS and sixty minutes but if I had been up for reelection I would've never partnered with\nChris Coons from Delaware my buddy and I would've never started the day saying I'm a firm yes\nAnd then with all the drama and the hub lean and the dramatic entrance into the chambers and sitting there and saying\nWell I Want this or additional seventh FBI background check I wouldn't have done that if I was up

Len Len thanks for hanging out with us how are you\nMight find good good you know we keep saying that uh the FBI does not come to conclusions they just record the activities of the accused however with told me when a investigating Hillary\nA came out with this big announcement that they'd come to the conclusion that there was no no no prosecutor would bring charges against her go\nTo a good point I mean it's you know it is I mean we have to remember is that what this amounts to as a as a seventh background check this is not the kind of\nFBI investigation or special Bob Mueller as special counsel dragging on and on and carrying on for this is a background investigation this was interviewing people putting in a report what they said\nFind that there's any cooperation looking at the corroborating witnesses talking to them and putting it into reporting given it to the Senate Judiciary committee that's all it is um and and that's I'm\nNot going to be satisfied anybody as we progress is I think but maybe it will be enough for some senators to vote yes including a couple of Democrats crushed welcome how are you crush\nI'm doing well my point I wanted to bring up was a personal one where my mom was sexually assaulted in the worst matter and I won't use the word you can imagine what I'm Talking about or\nAnd or almost put a put away and murdered and um she she had something with me the other day about Dr Ford that really made a lot of sense she said the testimony where she talks about going into the supermarket to say hello to the accuser or one of the accuses that would never happen\nThat would never happen my mother couldn't even go into a shopping mall for years and could not when she had to face the accuser in court and an ally to\nShare your she's not going to say Hi to the guy in a grocery not going to say that they had read about it why would you\nDid you hear the Lindsey Graham line about the the woman who claimed that she witnessed gang rapes going on at ten parties\nAfter the first one do you think you'd go back nine more times you gotta if you're watching my ideas yeah\nLots of ... lots of questions on very reluctant to question the credibility of accuser only because I'm mindful that and I said there's a million times there are lots of women who've been abused and sexually assaulted they had no corroborate should and they were utterly alone\nThey lost their jobs they've lost their careers we've heard the stories and uh you know you can't read these stories and hear about some of these accounts\nEven yesterday Jeff Flake was at some event in Boston and we're going to play some video and audio from that but that is why I think Jeff Flake as a as a no he's playing to the media is playing to his Democratic friends and there were a bunch of people standing in the front rows of whatever event he was out in Boston holding up signs saying I was a sexual assault\nSurvivor or I'm a survivor or something like that and and honest to goodness I I I I feel great compassion for anybody who has been assaulted who's been attacked to has been um victimized and they got nowhere to go uh\nAnd and they were maybe in a in a they happened in the workplace and they had a powerful man who did this to them and they got nowhere to go um in in but the problem is it's a double edged sword\nNow you you have a woman coming forward late in the game because of the Democrats the eleventh hour making ...\nAccusation that has been countered by the passionate fiery response of of Brett Kavanaugh that makes people think that's exactly what I Would sound like if I were falsely accused pack your next up on the Mike Gallagher she'll get a lot of trying to get as many calls and as we can do they hide pat welcome how are you\nA quick
