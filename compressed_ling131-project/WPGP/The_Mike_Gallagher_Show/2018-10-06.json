what is it your best interests worker Nathan sit and the team it's safe at accurate solutions gripping that produce Sherry standard\nMeaning it's about you and that's really important as well let's talk about some of the things that may cause us Ethan Ethan to maybe delay our retirement or push it back what would be one thing\nOne of the biggest ones is the stock market downturn at the wrong time a market downturn complicates really every financial situation but when a downturn compromises your retirement income\nThe effect there can be even more devastating and after all we always say at the key to retirement is being able to draw from income from your assets ... every month to cover your living expenses and you need that to last as long as you live\nAnd market trends can be influenced by a lot of forces today we see politics and elections so we see the price of oil global economics interest rates hikes\nIn touch with the Trump tweets and I'm not getting political I'm just saying those I'd ask and drive the market\nThey definitely can and the markets Wilder swings usually stem from uncertainty of what may come next for example we mentioned in the past but look what happened when a lot of the media expected to Hillary Clinton win and then twenty sixteen election and when Donald Trump won the market took quite to dive and it did come back\nAnd we called that maybe the Trump bump but you know they were expecting one thing and geared up for another thing happened but the majority of these news items and markets rings are really not fully understood and and then they do tend to correct themselves out over time is up and it's really all a process and it's not a simple one\nYou don't care what do you think about the stock market since the Trump bump as Ethan foot I mean boy there's no I'm we're never going to have a market downturn and I think Donald ... says the market will only go up while he is president but I mean I suppose I mean how could what market downturn cause us to put off our retirement\nWe literally saw that I mean it's been a while but two thousand eight two thousand nine you know we were in this field we're in this industry and we saw that happened over and over and over again so let me give you a just a typical scenario let's say Mr Smith\nYou know you've done a good job with us for one case said some some good money feels pretty bullish about his retirement prospects\nHe's computer the approximate amount of income he might have that retirement and most of his death pay off\nAnd so on that basis let's say Mr Smith sets the retirement date of January first of the following year now while he's working his four one K. it's been invested into moderately aggressive investments has four one K. is already recovered from two thousand a market crashing over the last eight years he had some pretty good growth\nNow think about this now all of a sudden it happens again in June and market correct just like it did with a with a smoker actually had in February of this year so by the end of the year let's say the Mr Smith four one K. has been reduced by thirty percent\nWell his hope of retiring soon has seemingly dwindled obviously you know in this scenario similar what perspective retirees faced in two thousand they put yourself in the shoes and someone let's say back in two thousand and eight at the beginning of the year they decided hey I'm retiring at the end of this year\nAnd by the end of two thousand and eight they saw thirty percent decline in their investments\nThirty percent that's definitely going to cast some doubt on your ability to retire and even if you think he's doing enough money to retire you may say there's no way I can possibly do this because of the emotional aspect and and why why is that because remember in retirement income is everything\nYou have to be confident that your nest egg is built to generate enough income months and in my town for potentially the next Thirty years and that's not something you can lead to chance\nSo what I Would you know what we always say here is is let accurate solutions group part of our retirement blueprint planning process is a stress test of your existing portfolio now that stress tests looks at two different things\nIt looks at how aggressively or you invested right now so what is your riskier assuming but it also deep into the hidden costs hidden fees that you may not be aware of the best time mark to determine how you're invested is when things are going well and even though this year has been a little bit more volatile sort of\nFlat lining up and down up and down we're still positive for the year that's far last year was a great year in the markets and now is the time to determine how am I invested in my sending more risk than what I should because you don't want to be in Mr Smith shoes and have to delay retirement at the next market correction recession\nForgot stress test all you had to do is call Ethan myself cartoon at for one to five one five thirty three fifty five and again that's for one to five one five thirty three fifty five\nCooking out against the managing partner of accurate solutions group Ethan lane is an associate advisor with accurate solutions by mark Elliott either with us today for your retirement a blueprint\nAnd we're talking about some of the risk some of the challenges that may cause you to have to put off your retirement it certainly market volatility could be one of those and and you know we had another two thousand eight in eighty Ninety percent of your money is in the market and the market drop thirty forty fifty percent that could certainly put off your retirement\nSo there's no question that market volatility can deter your retirement plans\nSo that leads us to this then target who said we'd give 'em the the challenge and then the solution [noise]\nWhat can we do about market volatility then winter planning for our retirement\nAnd I'd love to answer that that first than let's look at some figures from a survey of investors over the age of forty so they think you're not included in a survey conducted by global Atlantic so as the late ... end of last year two thousand and Seventeen this is pretty telling\nThree or four investors to Seventy five percent of investors say they're currently concerned about the stock market correction and two out of three investors who are still working say significant correction would disrupt their retirement plans and the retirement timing\nNow despite this those same investors right now are overweight and socks so why would an investor who can see the finish line known to the downturn could later retirement stay so aggressively invested\nAnd there's generally a couple of reasons to us I mean they simply have a tough time selling fear and they're going to lose out on further games right when everything's going well we want it all\nWhere there's those who think little about investing and aren't as aware of the effects of the downturn retirement asked as they may not know how aggressively they're investing and work with this really comes down to the change in behavior change in attitude\nYou know in retirement the most important thing is not the stock market return it's about making sure your portfolio can go the distance being prepared to weather all the ups and downs and it's really about first and foremost managing risk and looking for a return after that\nThinking about a football analogy let's say we are we're playing the we're in the super bowl and at the end of the third quarter were up by Seventeen points okay\nAnd you know we're told by the coaches just to run the clock when we got to get we got a great and\nMaybe on bell right and three point nine four yards per Carrie let's just run this out even if they score seven ten points were still far enough ahead and we're just going to be cautious and let's get off the field and celebrate we won the Superbowl\nShould we do that or should we allow men to just go there and so I have on the field I'm now sometimes I Would say that that got and slowing it down the field by\nShould we be more cautious because we've already won the game and that's really what this boils down to them\nThe one that game than don't put yourself at risk\nThat certainly makes a lot of sense I mean if the Steelers are going to win the super bowl than at times you've got to let been sling it has no\nTies let's just give the ball and it often less run it and control the clock so it really is the same with retirement if you want the game that you were you you're going to certainly look at retirement differently than those that are maybe a little bit challenge and not really sure if they could retire and they might have to push off their retirement date\nSo the stock market volatility is certainly a real thing the problem is as as Kurt said even is that\nPeople are really in two thousand eight if they weren't close to retirement they thought wow what a great opportunity for me to buy more stuff Allen sale\nBut then if you're at getting close to retirement you know if you're going to retire in two thousand eight that would have been a challenge for some I'm sure so what what are some of the ways that we can help minimize these potential losses from what we've invested you know if we do have another crash\nWell some ways to help reduce risk to your savings from the next market crash and really it's only a matter of time before it happens you should start by taking a look at your entire financial portfolio and make sure that it's diversified amongst multiple asset classes that can help you whether the periods of the high volatility that you were talking about mark\nYou have to make sure that your financial portfolio includes insurance products and investments that are appropriate for your risk profile your stage in life and your overall circumstances pulling it all together into a plan\nAnd the rule of thumb is diversification reduces the chance of will actually hit that panic button and sell when there's been a big decline and part of diversification is to keep that appropriate asset mix rebalance if you really need to\nNow disclosure here as well diversification doesn't guarantee that you're going to make a profit or that you won't lose money but what it can do is it can really help safeguard our portfolios from the effects of dramatic market volatility and one thing that it really does is it helps with emotions you're not becoming reactive to the market\nYou're becoming proactive and why is it all important\nThe main importance hears you shouldn't react to the market you should be proactive and take action before it happens really the best time to look closely at what you've got and look at your retirement plan is right now when things are going well after all it's important to have a retirement strategy that's appropriate\nBut we look first and foremost income we look at all the sources of income was show you how to maximize as a security maximize any ...\nAnd benefit pension how to integrate down if there's a gap between your fixed income sources in your monthly budget\nAnd we saw for that gap we didn't get into investment allocation taxes health care and legacy and in that income phase we build in an inflation adjusted income that you cannot outlive because that's still the number one concern of people today\nIs that many of those assets and we can't just plan for that level income we've got a plan for increasing the whole way into and possibly if you're a blast for Thirty years so my parents' home is about fifty years old and it has gone from sixteen thousand five hundred cost wise to evaluate today about a hundred and eighty thousand\nThat as inflation and you have to protect against it so we are more than happy to help coal her team that for one to\nFive one five thirty three fifty five again it's for

Kirk started the company in Nineteen Ninety four also with us is young decently associate advisory was one year old when\nI decided to leap out on his own and start his own company and now even a big part I can say that Kurt can I\nCan absolutely say that even here here's what I call individuals' 'cause you know ... sometimes someone will come in and they'll season is twenty five and they think well how can he know anything about retirement planning when I'm fifty five\nHere's how I can say that the vast majority consumers out there today if they are really diligent and spending a lot of time they may spend what maybe fifty hours a year looking at investments in reading and retirement planning\nEthan spends about Twenty one hundred hours a year for the last three and a half years so literally has about seven thousand hours of training and retirement planning\nAnd I don't I don't want his head to swallow but at the same time you know I Want people to understand that he may be twenty five but this is what we do day in and day out\nHe said here's a word of advice maybe get that you know cut that part out save it and then go talk to about a little bit of financial bumps if you could work that out that's going to be my ring tone [laughter] exactly you know we're talking about\nSome of the reasons why you may be forced to push back your retirement date certainly market volatility could be one of those you have too much of your money in Wall Street markets go down like that in two thousand eight and all of a sudden you've lost forty fifty percent of your money\nAnd you really never said it in the first place it was just sitting in the market now it's I have always gone that could certainly change a retirement plan and if you're not diversified in the right way and then we're talking across\nA asset classes really it's not just in the market it might be using insurance world the banking world all the different world out there and then inflation certainly can be a factor as well something you said you know I think I can get by on five thousand a month\nBut then eight years into retirement you're now and needing six thousand a month\nAnd you only have five you're short and it's because of inflation what is another area that might cause us courage to push back our retirement date\nWell we've got we've done an entire show on this before and mark but it's fear and uncertainty emotions\nAnd and that is pretty normal soap for every person that we need to ... a little bit over confident about their retirement circumstances we literally made several are just way too worried about even if they really shouldn't be because retirement can be a scary thing and and I think of great clients of ours and Dave and Paula\nWhat takes place as our upbringing or background from when we were raised and born\nHas a direct impact on our stating the way we look in view money and the way they look and view or or preparation and so that David in Palo aimed at a super John they live within our means they have no doubt saved probably three times the amount of money they need to retire on income they desire\nBut it's just been so hard for them to pull that plug in and actually retire\nYeah ... I mean that makes me think a gym sort of a different case\nHe's also done really good job saving and he's going to have a defined benefit pension is going to have Social Security and a single individual so he's not spending a ton of money really got everything solve for but the one thing you didn't have solve was what what the heck am I going to do with all this time in retirement that's what he was most afraid of\nAnd his company actually offered him a buyout to retire early and it was fairly attractive but he turned it down because\nYou know that work was something he enjoys and he's kind of afraid of what's going to happen when he does retire\nI Wish I had the opportunity to Jim had [laughter]\nWe're headed to the links right now I'm Glad you're with us today for your retirement blueprint with Kirk and nobody can eat the mind with ... by mark Elliott\nAnd you know what do you think of that as as you were talking about a Kurd the example you gave your couple eighth and I think it's always interesting when you do people actually have won the game what kind of we're talking about the Steelers won the Superbowl have don't take any risk anymore maybe just run the clock out type things\nIf you have won the game and you there's really you got plenty of income to retire\nBut you're not really confident that you are okay why is that\nYeah well one is just like gym that I mentioned unsure of how spend this time but other people are not sure how to determine how much monthly income their nest they can produce for them really they've never withdrawn from a retirement portfolio they're so used to growing and growing that they don't know where to start\nSwitching from the accumulation mode to the DEA cumulus nation mode is such a big switch that scares a lot of people and it's again not their focus all the years of retirement with income coming in and they just contribute and grow they don't know where to start taking things from especially for those who don't have a pension anymore\nAs forces retirees to address the withdrawal issue really face to face they need to figure out how to maximize Social Security benefits and create that withdraw method from whatever savings that they do have\nYeah and maybe some or risk averse or we don't understand how investments work you know retirees have difficulty tolerating uncertain market conditions Oscar wonder how can I generate enough income from his attempt to keep up with those withdrawals in with inflation\nRetirement income you have to perform a monthly income analysis and that is just simply a nice way of saying a bad word for some people that shouldn't be you need a budget you got to determine the amount of income you need and you got to determine what are your expense is going to be\nHave you determine what your dreams casting is and if you have a vision of what you're going to do retire and with the cost of those things are going to be\nThe guy to make sure you have enough income to cover all the bills and this we encourage people to do that and often times we help them with that because sometimes someone will come in with the budget and they forgot to include says they forgot to include healthcare they forgot\nThat Medicare premiums come out of their their monthly Social Security check so we're more than happy to help in that area but you you got to make sure you know what you need coming in each and every month and that will help you determine have you done an adequate job saving for that\nSort of get that process started to do is give turn eighth and the and the team that accurate solutions river calls for one to five one five thirty three fifty five for one to five one five thirty three fifty five so hurt for retirees are pre retirees who are focused\nOn how much they have put aside the image that was been their focus you'd think that's a good thing to focus on how do they get tripped up\nWell let me give you an example and let's just say Steve Steve is sixty one wants to retire and he's going to receive about twelve\nHundred dollars a month from Social Security at age sixty two so he's already decided he's claiming Social Security sixty two\nNow eight sixty five and three years he will have another thousand a month coming in 'cause he still has a defined benefit pension plan but he can't turn that source of income on two sixty five\nHe's got a good job saving and those guys he's he's accumulated about seven hundred thousand in this war and one case so he's confident he sets his retirement date for age sixty two and he makes an appointment with a financial planner a retirement plan\nAnd when Steve comes in he's expecting to talk about investment strategies 'cause most people in those firms still today push products I hate to say that but all of a sudden they're talking about talking about their mutual funds or stock portfolio their nudey\nBut to his surprise he's asked about his budget\nAnd this is not a discussion of how comfortable are you with risk and why rate of return or you're seeking instead the question posed as how much are you planning to spend each month to live comfortably and retired\nSo Steve is then sent home with the task of figuring out how his fixed in discretionary expenses compose an upon his return is financial professional he\nTells them a seven thousand per month or what I set aside for basic end discretionary expenses so now think of this with twelve hundred from Social Security and a thousand a month pension Steve still needs forty eight hundred per month\nAnd that's not to mention the extra additional income he'll need before that pension kicks in when he turned sixty five\nCents gap is gap between fixed income and what he needs coming in his four thousand eight hundred per month\nThat's right now here's the challenge to pull forty eight hundred per month from seven hundred thousand dollar portfolio after withdrawal rate of eight point two percent now that's not so portable over an extended period of time\nSteve should really have done all this budget in income planning both for setting a from retirement date and really what it boils down to is it's all about having a plan\nAnd nobody plans to fail they just simply fail to plan and it certainly doesn't have to happen almost everybody needs a plane designed to generate the income that they'll need month after month in retirement especially when those paychecks quit hitting the bank you'll want to have your retirement income planned well in place\nYou want to be confident that your retirement portfolios designed to generate enough monthly income to last for the next twenty thirty maybe even forty years but how do you make this happen the first step is to get accustomed retirement blueprint from our team inaccurate solutions grip\nNow for most people this is an eye opener are just a few changes here and there they can make a huge difference down the road in retirement and may even show you some strategies you've never thought of before\nTo get your no obligation retirement blueprint call for one to five one five thirty three fifty five to set aside a visit with Kurt myself and our team in our butler office again that's for one to five one five thirty three fifty five and\nLet me let me just jump in here just for a second 'cause I I Want listeners to understand when you call that number we do have a call center who's going to take that information your partner and information 'cause we actually allow us to have we got it off and allow the staff have weekends are so what will happen is once you call you'll give department\nInformation to our call center and Bobby from our office are director first impressions we'll call you back on Monday she'll schedule what we call your vision and that's where you come into the office and we just discuss your vision for retirement that she'll Bridget the door just sitting there waiting area which is nice and comfortable enough couches and chairs but you also give you a menu\nFor hot and cold drinks you can add anything from hot tea or coffee\nOr the hot chocolate if you want it to you can have anything cold and while she's preparing our our meeting room even will take a quick toward to introduce you to our team our team members are critical for what we do\nBecause we THINK Team approaching that planning process so it's a it's a low key non threatening environment will have an open conversation you'll meet the entire team and we together will decide at the end of that first meeting is there is is there a fix to move forward to Sacramento there's no cost replication to the first meeting\nBut don't hesitate to colleges or one to five one five thirty three fifty five\nWhat should so surely playing that overall retirement strategy you look at it Well Mark Social Security\nBenefits or the foundation for many retirements and like I was talking about my grandfather wasn't as critical for him because he did have the defined benefit pension with Social Security in a savings and they weren't naturally big spenders\nBut today for a lot of people it's much more critical to spend the time to maximize your benefits you know do you claim it's sixty two or sixty six sixty seven maybe Seventy\nYou file a restricted application\nYou retire at sixty five and then wait till your full retirement age\nOr do you even hold off all the way till Seventy and get delayed retirement credits where it grows at eight percent per year that's what the delayed retirement credit is you know have you spent the time sitting down and looking at all those options do you even know what I'm Talking about the you know what a restricted application is\nSocial Security claiming and timing strategist marker critical so let me throw out all over the screen you can and I we don't work for the government we\nDon't work for the Social Security administration but we do a lot of research and analytical tools that can help you get into the nuances of the sense of security that claiming a time of strategies which I Believe there is number five or six thousand pages of rules to Social Security\nAnd let me also say that for those in my ... my belief is for those individuals who are safety you know that's not a magic number I'm just saying around\nMy belief is that Social Security will be there in the form it is too bad it might be some tweaks to the cost of living adjustments and maybe your benefits your taxable and retirement benefits will be there for you so you got to take the time\nTo understand how the timing clean benefits can be tens of thousands of dollars of additional benefits that you're missing out on now for someone who is you can change\nOr Lincoln my grandson just turned six\nAnd the joy two years old you know we have left on the way for those people are younger there's going to have to be some major changes to Social Security\nAnd I would say that I'm going to take it probably is sixty six to ten months because that's why full retirement age which means I can continue to work because you're told me I have to delay my retirement for a long time as well wait we last year at least I could get paid I can work and it's not going to cost my Social Security because people will take\nYou know while I'm gonna keep working but I'm going to take it a sixty two bad as a bad idea\nSmart you are never allowed to retire because for you and your as our house we enjoy you know and we had a caller how color and they wanted to come into that our office here for the vision eating and they had requested mark [noise] to me when Martin Luther advisor\nWe would have fun that's all I [laughter]\nI Would try to figure it out make sure they get a lot every now and again gotta get each of you know wherever you gotta go yeah we've got it's golf ball that's where we do the ... let me on the radio\nFix the golf games All right so let's wrap this up we've got a you know about a man and a half or two left so Kurt how do you want to wrap this up you know there are certainly some challenges which is why we're talking about things that might cause you to delay your retirement\nThere are certainly challenges and sometimes every once in a while they're out of your control but your\nVision how are you going to spend two thousand hours and you know the year they were working now free time one to

sit in with us to talk about the school but also a little bit about a leadership and Douglas I don't think we mentioned how long you've been the c._e._o. they're\nUp this is going to my fourth year fourth year okay I couldn't remember and so I'm sure things have have changed from a legal aspects things you said you were an attorney where you have to deal with but also people in in a leadership aspects I Want to dive into that a little bit maybe give us a little background on\nLeaders that you were under whether it was at school or in other jobs or are involved in the university kind of who helped shaped you what did you learn you shouldn't do should do those type of things just maybe kind of a little bit of a leadership\nBackground with you up you know as I reflect back on people that had the most impact on my life perhaps the leaders in my life um there were many there were many are in you know many of them I read about in biography\nYou know great historic figures and and you study their lives and then the way they handled situations and it's great case study or specific instances when you have to make critical decisions and you have that\nWealth of knowledge of how people in the past to confront of those types of issues of and then people that I encountered I threw my time as in business and in my time as an attorney and one in particular is comes to mind right now was it was a gentleman that was the um what was the\nController of our university I'm Sorry for law firm\nAnd he was retired assistant comment on to the United States Marine corps ... up and just an amazing\nLeader and it wasn't because of the force of his personality or the size of him but he was the way he was able to figure things out yeah and and I watched him in certain situations how he handled the situation that it's\nJust a keen understanding of human nature and how how they how they work in in specific instances with that so uh those\nWere people that actually\nUh I learned from I think probably the most significant one though truly is Jesus Christ so um and he more than any has influence at least the way I manage a Christian university sure university that's committed to really\nBeing a witness to him in the world and in there that's the instruction I think that I turn to time and time again when you come\nInto a position like CEO like that and and you walk in the first day\nWhat is your mind thinking from or what kind of a leader do I need to be here and of course you knew some of the folks you knew a little bit of the culture but you're kind of figure in what I'm seeing her thinking today may not be what's going on a year for years from now how does some of that goes through your mind of where do I need to fit into where they are now where do I need to maybe take them\nYou really have to understand the mission of the university but he I think you have to understand the history as well in order to do that and if I might digress from what was really interesting ... day is president I received an email for about three ... three loves the amazing thing with these loves graduated in Nineteen Seventy\nAnd he was saying I'm writing writing at the request to several universities are you in another country and they want to know more about the people that were instrumental in their formation\nEven churches they were your lumps and he went on to describe them\nOne baptized the founders of university another started a women's college and the third lives in elaborate colony and founded churches and he said to me while you know based upon my research I'm convinced that this significant Christian presence originated with division\nUm the concepts they have well they were students that wins mark how would you like to get that the first day on the job isn't as a reminder where you're headed where's the males universities you know because when I had\nThat and it was like almost like guys speaking to me saying you need to be able to continue this and it ... with respect to ways burglar symbol is lab which are my stance world energy or our model feet locks that there'd be like so let your lights giant men might see a good works glorify your father who is in heaven it isn't\nThat weighs in terms of salvation but as a way to be an effective witness to shove in grace of God\nIn the world and so that's what we focus on I think in terms of leadership there in mission there it's important for the leader of an organization to understand the history and really the mission and to be able to articulate and and and transfer that mission into the hearts of the folks working that organization excellent point history and leader wow\nVery good very good we are talking with Doug leap president of wings Berg university you can find

the family station why don't we start right there tell us about your family can\nDo that well you know actually backing up a little bit family lives it's zipper celebrating Twenty years with word I

standpoint have they been involved with you at all from that or is that just kind of been more you\nWell you know with family business is always a matter that everybody's involved in one way or another whether even down to helping was shipping different things like that so yeah they've every one of them have ah participated with it\nUm we have I'm pursuing you know other things as far as college goes at this point but that doesn't mean that ah there isn't a future for you know a couple of them there for to come on into the business which would be fun\nI can do my dad was a dentist for like forty something years the Norman Rockwell dinners the older gal in for about a week or two I thought about it when I was a kid maybe in fourth grade and it didn't last much longer than that

make sure of what they want to do you know not take the easy route the family business I think can be easy you know failsafe that hey you know it works I can slip right in there but uh I think it's important to really find out what what drives you and what makes you happy\nAnd on the other side of the coin I think there's some folks that get roped into the family business that\nDon't really want
