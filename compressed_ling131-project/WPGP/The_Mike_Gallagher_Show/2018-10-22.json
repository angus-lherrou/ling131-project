entering over there and says\nIt's not as if all hope his last for Republicans indeed I Would point out that it's important to watch the margin of error it's still gives Republicans a decent chance of maintaining control\nAgain remembering that the model gives Democrats about Seventy two percent chance of winning control the house that's among the lower chance is the most models give but it's in the general ballpark he asks\nYou know who else had about a Seventy two percent chance of winning you guessed it Hillary in twenty sixteen\nHe says it's not too difficult to paint a scenario in which the Republicans maintain control of the house maintain control the house rather let's say Republicans when all those seats where they are favored as well as the streets were democratic candidates\nLead by about a point or less in the beginning forecast that would leave Republicans with two hundred and twenty feet\nTo Democrats with two hundred and Fifteen sheets so to ... to rule out to say that there's no no chance in hell that Republicans can control the house it's not it's not really accurate what even CNN says there's a scenario here\nWhere Republicans can keep the house
