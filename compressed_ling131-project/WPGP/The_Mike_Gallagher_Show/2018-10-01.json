there of\nOf Christine Blasey Ford's testimony Newt Gingrich writes a piece for Fox News dot com asking is there even one Democrat\nHas the decency to to to end this just one here's what Newt writes about the testimony and with Dr Ford\nSaid under oath he writes Dr Ford has been manipulated by the Democrats who hid her letter making uncorroborated accusations against Kavanaugh for over a month dragged her into the national limelight and urged her to avoid meeting with the Senate Republican staff members at one Point New rights\nFord said she couldn't meet because she was afraid to fly\nAlthough it was revealed at Thursday's judiciary\nCommittee hearing that she has flown numerous times for vacations Ford was put through all of this even though she could not remembering what House the alleged gathering an assault on her took place or when it occurred at the same time no one she said which president has core operator her story\nHer testimony was emotionally compelling it's clear that something happened to her\nNewt Gingrich rights\nBut she knows as a professional psychology there's the thirty six years after an event people can vividly remember things that didn't actually happen if Kavanaugh he says can be defeated by this kind of manufactured and manipulated evidence free process than what reasonable conservative whatever put his or her name up\nFor some Senate confirmation Newt Gingrich asks the the real question is this are there any Democrats you are disgusted by this process\nOf dishonest character assassination and manipulation or any upset that this was becoming their party's operating pattern are there any Democrats who sense of decency forces them to vote yes for a decent man and brilliant jurist whose entire public career\nHas exemplified honesty sincerity sincerity and patriotism are there any Democrats you understand that a thirty six year old on supported allegation cannot possibly be the standard for blocking a U.S Supreme Court nominee if no Democrat has the courage to vote for decency honesty and a sense of fairness you said\nThen we are truly in deep trouble as a country the focus for the next few days ought to be on the Democrats let us see what kind of a party they have become the answer to Newt Gingrich has question I fear\nIs no there will not be one Democrat who will pull a Jeff Flake not one the Democrats are unified in trying to stop judge Kavanaugh by any means possible it is\nRefreshing it's gratifying does she moments of the mainstream media called out\nAnd boy was a powerful over the weekend on CNN Jeff Greenfield been around for a long time political analyst he was a guest with Brian shelter who was a Trump hater and a a huge huge media cheerleader for all things on the left\nHates Fox News hates conservatives and he's supposed to be there I guess their media critic\nHere's what Jeff Greenfield said Brian shelter over the weekend on CNN in what was I think an epic epic takedown of the network that is now in a distant third place in the cable news ratings wars\nHave to say this quite bluntly new CNN anchor when I looked at CNN hour after hour after hour icy panels rather than reporting exchanging opinions the overwhelming majority of which on this network I regard as quite critical or hospital for ... now that may be justified\nA fascinating\nAnd he went on and so that was a much longer piece about how there's not a whole lot\nSays it may be these folks have concluded on I'm sure why that click click click the way it where where did but here's what he said\nWell let me read the whole close as we don't have the full video clip I Apologize for that he said I have to say this to a CNN anchor when I look at CNN hour after hour su panels rather than the reporting exchanging opinions the majority of which are on this network\nI regard as quite critical or hostile to ... to Trump\nLet me read that again hour after hour is cheap panels rather than reporting exchanging opinions the majority of which on this network I regard as quite critical or hostile to Trump that may be justified it made me these folks have concluded in the way that Trump has behaved that they deserve this pushback\nWhat you've described these two different universes has only been accelerate I've said this over and over again if you have a shred of fairness you\nAsk yourself how can CNN not having one single personality even mildly pro Trump\nYou ever think about that CNN says they're nice people CNN says there\nObjective like Fox News they've got opinion shows that they've got news people Wolf Blitzer you're supposed to be a news guy go down the list John King and all is that how can they not\nHave one person on the entire network who dares to support Donald Trump\nAnd that's what Jeff Greenfield was same day after day hour after hour minute after minute all they do is trashed the president of the United states period panel after panel and\nI I guess the proof is in the pudding because Fox News channel last week\nThey've posted numbers for Sean Hannity show on Fox News\nWere it was nearing six million people\nThat they don't get that in cable news Fox routinely\nBeats the competition handily as they did last week\nCNN for what it's worth\nIs in a distant third they're going to be by the hallmark channel Nickelodeon the cartoon network\nI Know all transfixed and riveted by the cabinet process but you know what the Dow is that\nThe Dow is two hundred points\nTo a hundred points after the announcement of the big trade deal\nLot more is the Mike Gallagher show continues [noise]\nI'm with Stephanie Strauss who's the creative director and illustrator of M. V. P. kids a fascinating project but I'm thrilled to tell you about here on the Mike allergies show Stephanie why are you part of envy the kids and what are you most excited about\nReading news or the

was enough to drive even the most [noise] calm level headed person a little bit bonkers let me let me start before we talk about\nThe ah reversal by Jeff Flake his change of heart after he was confronted by a pair of activists shut the senators only elevator friday MORNING EDITION goodness let me give you some reason to stay optimistic to stay upbeat\nUm the Dow Jones industrial average rose to hundred points today um investors are cheering the news of Canada joining a trade deal with the United states and Mexico [noise]\nUm [noise] the impending collapse of Nash NAFTA\nSuch as Jeff Shaw rights over hot air dot com it's not quite a big as big a deal as a Brexit but it certainly had President Trump's critics quite exercise over it\nNow however it looks like everyone can go back about their normal business after months of stalling and preening Canada's prime minister Justin Trudeau\nCame back to the table at the eleventh hour and\nAgreed to join us in Mexico in this deal last minute trade deal reforming NAFTA just what the president wanted huge victory and there's a Peter Navarro put it\nThe president has put together the best performance on the economy and trade of any president in modern history that's not high purple\nAnd it matters because it affects every single one of us it affects every one of our bank accounts it affects every one of our retirement or or for one case our paychecks\nHere's a Peter Navarro this is a cut number one again just two minutes of good news [noise] you just see of bad news 'cause there's nothing really good about the cabin offshore nothing all we can do is hope and pray that\nThe senators come to their senses the cabinet gets confirmed\nAnd it's crucial because this involves way more than just one man has a lot more to do\nThere's a lot more at stake than just Brett Kavanaugh will get into that and just a couple of moments as well but I Want you to uh see the White House trade advisors on Fox News over the weekend it's just cut number one here is the way Peter Navarro describes what President Trump has done with our economy and trade\nPresident Donald Trump is very quietly been putting together the best performance on the economy in trade of any president in modern history [noise]\nAnd ah it's it's really truly extraordinary and I think quietly because the media has a new report in both the actions we've taken and the results and exhibit a is this last week the United nations where President Trump organist traded a groundbreaking with South Korea\nOpen negotiation with Japan and work with our allies in Japan and Europe the issue strong statement against the behavior of China\nNow now if you need any proof about corrupt news media all you have to do is acknowledge what Peter Navarro says about the way the media has under reported all of\nThis huge news it's a Trump keeps winning I Know Trump haters hate to hear that I Know it makes you crazy to hear that it's a fat he keeps winning he's not pulling the Dow out of his ear okay\nHe's not making up the unemployment numbers this was not a tweet from the president at midnight these are facts and um [noise]\nPart of why they're threatened by him it's part of why the left is so desperately trying to stop Brett Kavanaugh they figured this will be a major defeat for the president it will be incidentally is Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed let's start with one of the big takeaways for the last few days one of the biggest takeaways is\nWatching the stunning\nUm crowing by left is an activist and progress lives over the weekend on social media about how getting in people's faces screaming at them shriek you'd been cornering people like Jeff Flake\nEffect change this is why we do it\nThat's what they should Ana Marie Cox all these other folks got on social media this is why we get a new faces because it works\nJeff Flake caving and Jeff Flake\nChanging his mind after he will be raided by the activists in the elevator and they are active is I don't know if they were sexually assaulted it if they were my heart goes out to them as my heart goes out to any victim of sexual assault the Christian plazas before was sexually assaulted by heart goes after\nAnd as the president said her testimony was compelling what makes this\nAn fulfilling for everybody is the fact that judge Kavanaugh's testimony was compelling as well if you are wrongly accused of such a horrific thing I Would think you'd react with the world watching precisely the way he did\nWithout a doubt\nAnd so we are left with a he said she said here's a major takeaway\nIf Kavanaugh get derailed and the confirmation fails\nIt's open season on every Republican in public office it is a good they are going to because they believe that getting into somebody's space and shrieking and screaming and berating somebody in public works that's what Senator Jeff flake gave them on friday\nHe has to know it can't be a stupid man\nAnd a word about Jeff way before we open up our phone lines and we dive into all of this here on Monday as we get ready wrap it up for what's going to be undoubtedly a very tough week worried about Jeff Flake regime about him used as productive as complaining about the whether he is who he is\nHe admitted on sixty minutes last night shockingly but he would have never changed his mind the way he did friday if he were up\nHe told the world if I had any accountability here I'd never do this he thinks that's a good thing he he thought that was good to tell Scott Kelly of CBS and sixty minutes that if I had been up for reelection I would've never partnered with\nChris Coons from Delaware my buddy and I would have never started the day saying I'm uh\nBerman yes and then with all the drama and the hub lean and the
