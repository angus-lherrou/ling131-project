couple of hours ago NBC News marathon will look at best\nA double digit lead for Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania hardly the first double digit lead for Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania this is the third one we've seen in a week or so Donald Trump Pennsylvania is a big target but all the evidence we have right now says Pennsylvania is still favored to be a democratic state\nActually Eighteen out protesting that don't just won the state [laughter] I Know for Hillary Clinton\nWhat about Ohio we have a brand new part of Ohio Donald Trump doing a little better here but he is still down in Ohio a five point gap so again right now Donald Trump targeting Ohio just like he's targeting Pennsylvania but he's not there right now Clinton still meeting in Ohio\n[laughter] we're in major production right now Donald Trump will oh\nAnother one brand new NBC Marist Poll out of Iowa today again a little bit closer\nBut a four point lead for Hillary Clinton this is supposed to be a light target for Donald Trump he at his convention he'd had chances here he was out there in that for the caucuses early this year he is still trailing in this poll in Iowa closer he could turn it around but again for right now is Donald Trump ahead in Iowa not in this poll\nProjects Donald Trump will win the state of Iowa\nWe don't have new polls today but Wisconsin Michigan these or other state Donald Trump is talked about living with the rust belt strategy we have not seen a poll that puts him ahead nice steak\n[noise] seeing an opportunistic Donald Trump will carry the state of Wisconsin in ... electoral votes track record that's why you're\nGetting the boat and is still on Donald Trump to show that he can do something Mitt Romney in a whole bunch of other Republicans over the last generation or so couldn't do and that is actually when the state that's the first thing that's going wrong for Trump the bigger problem is this still needed a blue states thinks he can flip\nHow about the red state he needs to hold how about the state's Rodney one in twenty twelve the Trump maybe it's just assuming he's been a whole will check this out\nBrand new numbers out of North Carolina North Carolina was Mitt Romney state in twenty twelve well right now in this poll Hillary Clinton has delayed very close certainly Donald Trump could still win it I called a tossup states but we have seen polls putting Hillary Clinton ahead there it is possible\nHillary Clinton could end up flipping North Carolina making it a blue state\nOf another soldier projected as I said it was Carolina thing out of what I say it's only about Trump's Fifteen electoral votes\nTrump's problem no gets a lot worse than North Carolina look at this Georgia new poll seven point lead here for Hillary Clinton not the first poll that we've seen putting or hadn't Georgia this is the state the last democratic\nBack in Nineteen Ninety two again Donald Trump could still take Georgia but Hillary Clinton certainly has a chance to flip Georgia\n[noise] CNN our projects for Donald Trump will carry the state of Georgia [noise]\nBut if Hillary Clinton could sustain the kind we see as we got into it into this race you could see other states that suddenly get crazy things you wouldn't have even imagine like a South Carolina even the taxes they could at least\nBecome competitive and what it would mean doesn't mean Hillary Clinton's going to win all the it means we could have more competitive state than we ever imagined\nYou think with these with South Carolina and Kansas you would think those would be not as likely that likely slash slam dunk slash and guaranteed slashed obviously this is ruby red South Carolina in Kansas but instead they're like read there just lean Republican now South Carolina leans\nRepublican state of South Carolina has gone Republican\nLeans Republican Trump refer Jack Lew in Kansas where the sixth electoral votes\nAnd if those are the top states can do the math associated with all the electoral votes from all the states that they go that way you have to lean Republican and the likely Republican go read and the lean Democrat and likely Democrat and go blue [noise] get signed those out that way\nThen you say that Donald Trump has the best day in the entire world completely out of harm's expectation and he wins tossup states he wins states plus college vote in\nThe days after the when all of the top so it'd be insane because nobody wins all of the top states even if Donald Trump did when all of the top states he was Phyllis\nMuscle too harshly or I Would\nHave been with the best of intentions it's hard\nI mean in terms of what still a toss up there's only five states that are still considered a toss up right now Florida [noise]\nScience fair projects Donald Trump will carry the state of Florida\nIowa projects Donald Trump will win the state of Iowa with a fix electoral votes [noise]\nI think you under estimate the good citizens of Gotham City chief but took a\nPoll Batman

Nineteen Seventy eight Mike Gallagher as ... voice of clarity for millions of Americans\nThose those can often\nWhich is new Democratic Party if\nWe are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the ... started\nThe show known by the most famous man on a plane\nAnd you've been grade Mike and I appreciate it very much you notice I walked over here very quickly\nNow from the relief factor dot coms studio mice yellow\n[noise] but I\nBelieve he is best efforts there has been a lot of victories for the Republicans over the last couple of weeks it's sort of started\nWith the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh despite every effort to stop him to ward him to derail his confirmation it happened\nIt happened and people were just amazed and then of course there have been a lot of economic ... bits of news that keep coming out about\nThe economy is we had a couple of we had a dip in the Dow for a couple of days it bounced back the economy continues to surge shore and they're being political victory\nUm yesterday a judge threw out Stormy Daniels defamation lawsuit against President Trump and had to do with one of his tweets and more and more importantly the judge ordered Stormy Daniels\nYou know the porn lawyer represented by Michael ... to pay President Trump's legal fees Joe real slap in the face\nUm and then came this weird revelation by Senator Elizabeth Warren\nGood she barely has any Native American ancestry in her heritage\nWhich of course has that President Trump into this cascading\nYou know euphoria of mocking and taunting her even more than ever\nTurns out she's got one one thousand and twenty fourth Native American ancestry in her in her blood line and ... most Americans have more Native American ancestry machine does\nIt's been a ton it's been a scam and she has thoroughly embarrassed yourself and\nEverybody's used to be having a field day with well all of these things if you add them up\nIt's ... you know all roads lead to November ... we keep getting closer and closer to a midterm election with victory after victory after a victory for Republicans now I don't know what's gonna happen I don't I don't I have absolutely no crystal ball\nWe should know not to try to make a prediction there are lots of toss ups in the house races and uh we we should have learned we should have learned from September from November of twenty sixteen not to believe the pool we should learn not to\n... and and when I see these this binary choice that is before Americans and a party represented by people like Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal I put them both together\nThis is this is a a lie the bay perpetuated in order to impress people\nIn the ... warns case it was to get advancement at Harvard by calling herself a Native American and Richard Blumenthal case it was to impress people as as as if he was some kind of a war hero it's called stolen valor when you lie about serving your country\nNow again this was represented by the Democratic party\nIt this is a party that is angry and violent I was reading about Tucker Carlson who ah we hope to have on the show next week I I enjoy your show\nJust about every night I don't know trucker in fact all the years I just read as a Fox News contributor my past never I've never really cross paths with Tucker um he's got a new book the number one of the New York times best seller lists\nAnd he said in a in an interview he gave to the national review pod cash this week\nThat show many people curse him out in public when he goes out to dine in restaurants\nBut he can't go out to eat anymore\nHe doesn't go to restaurants he told the national review podcast having someone screaming F you at a restaurant it just ... your ... your meal is if you can't go to restaurants anymore in Washington DC was he because he continually get yelled at\nBy other diners who shout curse words at him now those are\nDemocrats that's the way Democrats are at the end\nI look at a race like the one between Baitullah work in Texas actually Robert ... in Texas and Ted Cruz you gotta you gotta guy on a skateboard bridges are grown up\nA constitutional conservative cannot be a tough call for ... and your story after story north south east and west\nWhere the choice is so easy it's not even a the shouldn't even be a close call now the data stacked against the Republican Party because in off year elections\nThe party in control usually suffers a defeat I don't think that's going to happen this year\nI just don't I think we're going to see some good good\nAnd [laughter]\nIt'd be Elizabeth
