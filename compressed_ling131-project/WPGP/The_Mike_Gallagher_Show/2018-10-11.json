environment so from the outset of the twenty Eighteen cycle when you is going to be very competitive Democrats are very energized they want all out of ... that is that is their\nTheir their overall agenda right now what we're seeing with twenty seven days to go is a resurgence of Republican enthusiasm post a Kavanaugh costs\nMissionaries a daddy is due in large part to Republicans coming back home once who who might have been a little uh disinterested in in the mid term election but are seeing what the Democrats have planned we're already seeing Nancy Pelosi\nAnd other House Democrats are lined up a litany of potential investigations they plan to undertake if they get control the house and we see on a regular basis their candidates talking about issues like\nAbolishing ice undoing the Juppe tax plan and protecting sexual cities if they're able to regain control the house that is what's at stake in this election and I it has a way of turning off independent voters in motivating a

know you had the\nPotential twenty twenty presidential candidates up on stage you know during the judiciary hearings for Brett Kavanaugh you saw the way that they behaved that is going to take on a
