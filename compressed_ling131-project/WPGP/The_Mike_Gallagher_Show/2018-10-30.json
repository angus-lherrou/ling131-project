eleven people it it's just a disgrace um I just don't know how he lives with themselves and how um he can stay in office because he's not representing the people's pets right\nIt's pretty despicable

drugs keep sky rocketing people want to know why I have the cost of the top ten meds\nIncreased over a hundred percent since two thousand eleven why does the whole system just feel downright rigged well there's a big answer there's this there's a very simple answer actually the drug makers spend a lot of money lobby to protect their profits\nBut there's a bigger lobby in America that our

he says we ought to have a secure border\nIf you've got thousands of illegals marching towards our border promising to cross the border illegally\nThe president has every\nEvery bit every bit of a

very in a movie that say about what he learned as an American Jew after the Pittsburgh synagogue attack he writes on this day of all days it needs to be said America has been a blessing for the Jewish people unlike any other blushing given any other people in the history of the world\nOne crime cannot be allowed to overshadow\nThis extraordinary fact he goes on to say my gratitude do America is actually greater today than it was yesterday because of the outpouring of grief and rage\nAnd common humanity we have witnessed\nIn response to the horror in Pittsburgh he's so right we are Americans who writes and we are Jews there is no contradiction between the two when people talk freely and foolishly and noxious Lee about America as having been built on racism\nThere's one simple answer to their liable George Washington's letter to a synagogue in Newport written in August of Seventeen Ninety\nHe wrote the citizens of the United states of America have a right to applaud themselves for having given to mankind examples of it in large and liberal policy a policy worthy of imitation all possess a like liberty of conscience\nAnd immunities of citizenship made the children of the stock of Abraham who dwell in this land continued to merit and enjoy the goodwill of the other inhabitants while everyone shell sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree and there shall be none\nTo make them afraid those are the words of George Washington of course that final phrase was taken from the profit Mica and it was violated in the most obscene way in Pittsburgh on Saturday writes John ...\nBut the story of America is a story of a country that is indeed served as vine and fig tree for the world's most beleaguered people's\nPut George says America took us in by many millions and the

video that we stream that showed the polar bear petty and the dog it turns out it's possible that the polar bear ate the dog and people were traumatized I think we've found a better video so if you love animals\nAnd you want a happy ending to an animal a video I've got one in the wild great white shark meat she'll but it works out okay\nSomebody to give you time to come to the stream at Mike

I'm a citizen of the White House there was an oldie to conduct I call her not good health I mean like I said that I look fellows you\nSo what are what I Hope he's not speak to this show is also believe that we're ready written document you know\nWhat I've been thinking about Selma and I'm Glad you mentioned about about the Jewish people's reaction to to this president one of the great mysteries for me Selma has been to see an American Jews turn on Republicans\nAnd Republicans arguably have such a a healthy respect and and a sacred respect for the state of Israel and yet Democrats are often taking the side of the Palestinians\nAre seemingly understanding this kind of violence and horrible things that Israel has to deal with on a regular basis demonizing and vilified Israel so along comes this Republican president who literally fulfilled his promise of moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem\nAnd how could Jewish Americans not embrace this president\nI suspect many do and I have a hunch that since President Trump fulfilled his promise to do just that with the embassy and acknowledging Jerusalem as the real capital of Israel that\nYou know there are a lot more there's a lot more Jewish support than any other Republican would have gotten oriented because believe me Republican and democratic presidents all made the promise to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and none of them came through until this guy thanks for eight minutes before the hour\nOne open line now eight hundred six five five Mike\nEight hundred six five five six four five three I'm

pleasure meeting you when you're in Columbus six eight ... I'm a non white Jewish eat well our suspicion is that Republicans I think it goes back to when\nOthers were mostly the party at white Anglo saxon Protestants and anti Semitism was fairly common in the in that community but things have changed and out of the folks I Know in the Christian here they are very\nPro pro Israel and they often asked said\nWest in you're asking unfortunately many of\nMy fellow Jews are out are more concerned about progressive politics and they are about us\nLet me ask a rabbi what what are they said about this president considering what he did with the embassy in movie that from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem are people coming around in your community\nThought some of them are there's a lot of ambivalence unfortunately because they focus you know they get they get a lot of their information from the other a mainstream media outlets\nYeah and I hear what that's about it on his style and not as substance\nExactly and that's and that's a downfall rabbi that many people have and that's unfortunate because you know you gotta put your big ... you've got to say what's getting done like Larry Elder always tells a joke about the the two golfers what makes a great golfer\nAnd the one guy says well I like to look at the shoulders of how he addresses the ball and where his his knees are in his hips and what is is\nFollow through that goes on and on with some boring\nExplanation of the other guy says I Want to see where the ball lands and we like the way the ball is landing with this president even though he might not square up his shoulders and address the ball properly alright here we go this is your moment away from politics\nWere building up a lot and I hope you have a chance to check out the video streaming Mike online dot com more and more

town hall dot com\nThe arising or or or state in his belief that next Tuesday seven days from today Democrats blaming normal Americans for nuts\nOr will blow up in their faces at the ballot box I like to weigh Kurt thinks he's a he's a former army colonel so he gets a little blue with this language would always have to be careful Everytime I put them on the show\nBut he he does say that he believes that normal people are going to be furious next week at the lies told and the shenanigans from\nLiberal Democrats are people on the left\nHe says I think on November ... the Democrats are going to get a message back from the people they are shamelessly lying about normal voters\nAre not going to look at what the Democrats are trying to do and say yeah I feel personally responsible for the actions of that Elizabeth Warren channeling fake Indians stripper guy with a kilometer long wrap sheet\nWho told me he would have not done anything nutty if it weren't for Trump\n\nMakes a great point the Democrats are in a pathetic ... and the official media as he puts it the official media is it a frenzy explaining how Donald Trump personally instructed kooky weirdo to Florida to mail pipe bombs do washed up democratic hacks\nAnd that name was garbage being in Pittsburgh via a series of constantly encrypted dog whistles\nMake America great again ... apparently code for male bombs nothing says murder Jews like moving the embassy to Jerusalem and indeed the Iran deal\nAnd yet the Democrats want it both ways the Democrats want to blame Trump for the male bomber and they want to blame Trump for the guy from the synagogue massacre I Wonder who's to blame for\nWhat I saw this morning this happened a couple of days ago at least for shots were fired into the ... county Republican parties office in South Daytona Florida police confirmed\nNo ... no one was injured but the shooting broke the officers front window and cause some damage to the dry wall oh I Know Trump's fault right Trump made somebody fire for shots into the illusion county Republican Party's offices in South Daytona Florida\n[noise]\nUm it's not Trump small it's not a Democrat's fault it's not Elizabeth Warren small that it's not Bernie Sanders fault that that monster tried to assassinate a bunch of Republicans on a baseball field but what\nWe're seeing I think Kurt shorter is right this strategy is not gonna work for Democrats their attempt to blame\nThe normal blame normal Americans they didn't go to work really going to work and in fact\nI suspect Kurt is going to be right now I don't know we don't know what's gonna happen till the morning of the seven will do the night of November sick I'll be in the studios hosting the sale of radio network town hall coverage\nOf the midterm elections on many of these radio stations all over the country we also were scheduled habit or for you up at a town hall dot com and Mike online dot com as well\nWe will see we're going to shake meanwhile the nation mourns collectively we are absolutely in unison and unified in supporting the president who's traveling to Pittsburgh today to pay his respects\nIt's a pretty disgusting to see\nThe mayor of Pittsburgh say he will not appear with the president he clearly doesn't want the president to come to Pittsburgh\nUm and yet the rabbi of the of the synagogue where this took place he told CNN very clearly how he feels I was so appreciative\nAnd so relieved to hear from the the rabbi who was on the scene\nThis is the rabbi who was there who tried to save lives\nAnd or you could hear the CNN reporter sort of trying to to goad him into saying oh you're the president shouldn't come the president shouldn't shouldn't have to end well that's not what the rabbi had to say that is not\nWhat the rabbi who was there had to say at all listen to this\nPresident Trump has talked about coming to Pittsburgh and coming to your synagogue and the aftermath of this do you want him to come [noise]\nThroughout the president of the United states is always welcome I'm\nI'm a citizen he's my president is certainly welcome\nWow I mean I'm a citizen who's the president he's welcome to come because he's giving aid and comfort and he's attending to the needs of people in Pittsburgh who are grieving who are mourning what an what a what a crazy idea that this rabbi has\nYet this is where we are that was up by the way that was a Allison camera over on Fox or on CNN meanwhile there was a rider on CNN who claimed that President Trump has radicalized more people than ISIS\nI Want you to hear this this is a writer named Julia Ioffe off or enough I O F F e\nI guess it's off the Julia off the set on CNN that the president well check this out for yourself but if you don't believe me if you're watching the streaming Mike online dot com you'll see it as well as here this on the radio this is\nCourtesy of CNN and gravy and cutting number one Julie ... off the with her I'm rather novel belief that the president is worse than the the monsters of ISIS\n\nAnd presidential run on a ... a lot of the crowd of radical has a show of president has radicalized so many more people than I could add I mean the way he talks a wasteful\nWaste that is that says it is how the way\nThe way that whole ah allow for the ... that I Know I'm not stuck for ... national asked the way that will ... will have to know I can get any football and tough quitting her ... kind of hard to find a pack of ... than you know\nAnd I I think that we are the pushback on that you tell us about I'm about what I mean as far as over her to say the president faces radicalized more people that ISIS is irresponsible like I was looking at is that true that true based upon what\nHow many I mean how many cats as he got into an inherited ISIS ... have you you know\nI wouldn't say set apart when I say if I had a like Tony I I think what President has far more a quieter ... about an equal hopeful ideology generally when I got to go and and now\nIt's about listen in Jake ... yeah you're right this yesterday when Louis Farrakhan sat next to Bill Clinton the other day where would the outrage\nI mean that that stuns me even even after all we've been subjected to tell me some more about the tone will you please\nI Want to hear the anchors of CNN complaining about President Trump's tone some more when she and then puts a crackpot like her on a panel and\nIt's really for the record she later apologized when she recognized the backlash that she was receiving on social media she she did back up her words a little bit or she backtracked to some degree not much\nBut to some extent she apologized that's a gash on CNN they invited the there was a guy on Fox Business the other day who said that the state department is infiltrated by George Soros Fox fired him because CNN went after\nThat guy 'cause she in and they all do this now I don't know if you've noticed this but on cable news now they're all playing each
