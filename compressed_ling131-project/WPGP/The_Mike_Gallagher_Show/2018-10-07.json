collapses or how that affects your retirement\nHow are you digesting that information was the second quarter GDP report that our economy grew at four point over four percent\nAnd how do you look at good low unemployment numbers and say look I see some good economic fundamentals but this just can't last forever\nHow do you factor that in and make solid investment decisions well how you do is what we've been talking about all the while long you need to be in the market but you also need the income portion that you need for retirement money you're going to count on to pay to provide the paycheck you need that to have more certainty about ballot\nExactly and J I Know you well enough to know that you're not using scare tactics here and that feeling about being pessimistic and doom and gloom its

very own personalized on track retirement review the number is eight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three\nKnow this whole shows have been talking about certain day and that you use is quote a lot that Ben Franklin said it uh the only two things that are truly ...\nIn life or death and taxes and that's why it's important that we talk a little bit here about limiting taxes exposure I Would I be for the taxes are due can I Do that I don't know if the map that out you can figure that out and that's the yeah see\nI mean they're certainties okay so I just want the one before the other yeah\nSo let's just talk about an example strategy about what we do here at synergy group to help people uh with this tax issue and a lot of times it's proper tax planning and I was just sitting down for a couple recently and we were putting an income plan together that was focused on avoiding having them have withdraw that blood bump them up\nInto a higher tax bracket folks you really need to understand these new Trump tax brackets here because there's a lot more wiggle room and things to consider there but if you want to be a little more strategic with your withdraws and a lot of times you need to sit down with a retirement expert and you may consider taking withdraws from a mix of taxable tax deferred and possibly if you\nPut the planning and placed tax free accounts\nAnd being able to manage your income and there's a couple of steps to do that first of all you need to say All right what do we estimate are taxable gross income to be and then you've got to look at your standard deduction itemize all that stuff and figure out what your taxable income would be before you take any money from your accounts\nAnd then second target say look while I Want to stay in the twelve percent tax bracket well to do that somebody falling Mary jointly right now it's about Seventy seven thousand or just above that that you can still generate an income to be able to do it so if you were\nExpected taxable gross income is twenty five thousand\nAnd to stay in the twelve percent bracket is goes up to Seventy seven thousand then we that's our room to be able to withdraw from taxable accounts any money we would want over and above that should come from ... tax free type of accounts and then we can start to organize your income plan\nNot just by the right mix of protected investments in stocks and bonds but also in a tax efficient strategy and\nMost of you are saying what the heck did you just say what we said is that there is a strategy to building an income plan that will also give you the potential to reduce your taxes at the same time\nWith expert or we talk to people once the income is down as the growth position\nThen again if money is in mutual funds manage money currently taxable pieces then again you're doing nothing to mitigate or control your taxes but there is the ability and we use the product which we call it protected gross product that\nGives you the opportunity to make twelve fourteen Eighteen percent of the market as the market goes down and that protects the first Fifteen Percent of a drop\nBut because that is a variable annuity and that's not a dirty word it's a word that we use about two or three products on there'll be two or three that we're comfortable with\nBut this product says that us managing money for five years what's what a good chunk of the liquid piece the mutual fund to manage money a cop with another piece over here this protected growth bees and will do for the taxes on that until you need the money again part of a tax the bird strategy that you were just talking about\nThe last ... a lot of times people will come in and they don't ever spend the money and the money goes out to the kids in the form of beneficiaries talk about a couple attack strategies that might be beneficial to getting money from this generation to the next\nRight I mean somebody it whether it's your family that gets the tax advantage of that tax advantage passes to the next generation a there is some insurance planning that can be done there and many of our listeners would come in and they don't need life insurance they don't necessarily want life insurance and life insurance probably isn't a good deal for them\nBut it's a great deal for their families and the fact that that really is the only asset class right now that truly is tax free or no federal income tax no state income tax no local income tax\nNow inheritance tax uh and if it's structured properly even if it's needed if you need to use a trust the hold it I Would avoid a state tax on\nAn island or eventually one of the first clients that ever trusted you to do their financial planning you put together a very significant life insurance program at their conversation with them to do exactly that take a significant portion of the transferring wealth of the kids without a nickel taxes being paid\nRight and then and those types of examples are over there and again the family didn't need life insurance but where that comes into play ah it's not a gimmick it's not as bad as what life insurance is designed to\nDo its leverage money if you don't need your R and D distributions ... about the government's gonna make you take them out also come in and talk to Terry come in and talk to Jason or myself about how you could officially take those dollars give tax free money your kids and maybe give a significant tax benefit and\nUh the portion over to the charity of your choices well we'll take the IRS out of the picture but boy we can sure do

teaching and blockbuster special to reward you and your family for tuning in\nShaken a joined keep your very best shelf today we're going to talk a little bit about immune help\nAnd this is really a a big deal and um most people are not aware of some of the armamentarium that's available these days\nAh one of the big players on the block that has not been available before is something called nuclear tides and these are the actual building blocks of the cell\nAnd it takes a staggering six billion be\nTo build one cell so once we had a blow an injury uh dramas surgery or even a cold or flu or anything that would damage the tissue we're calling upon our supply of nuclear times well\nOr if you've got some great if you don't you just have to wait for the body to make enough and when this comes to\nA building new tissue it can really be a problem that say you had a surgery and the bodies are going to pack whatever it's got on hand into that cut or wound or injury but if you've got those nuclear tides will uh this can mean helping the body deliver or promote the best possible\nRecovery and function for your body you know nuclear jobs have been around quite a while in Europe is sold under the name on set because they view them is so important to promote best health if you're struggling with any kind of immune issue\nAnd of course in addition to nuclear times ... is another key player that can act like a stand in immune system especially in your intestines because it as human active pre formed immuno glob villains\nAnd of course this is completely different than a nuclear tides and what it is able to do and of course the needs of the time is for\nNuclear diodes are can easily be satisfied there but uh you can reduce as whites shelled demand\nDuring all of this by jumping on a little bit of clause drum really great thing to do but you know one of the big missing links\nWe don't usually have normal levels of vitamin D three\nAnd in the last five six years\nDe three has been shown to be a critical player in the formation of literally all two hundred plus immune compounds at the body mix wow so this is really key player so we produce a product called the three gold and\nUh it's really good they use about probably about sixty drops of this and if you're under forty you can just take the drops straight preferably at your main meals so there's plenty of protein\nAnd that's the escort for the fat of the three\nAnd ... if you're a forty or over then you really should consider putting the D. three and a\nMaybe a half ounces of water and adding a three four drops of an organic lemonade that's essential oil of orange stirred up good you'll see that the limousine is the most effect\nAnd quickly the big droplets the D. three become tiny tiny\nSo now regardless of how your Rob letters performing\nYour body's going to absorb this de three just beautifully\nSo these are to me the ABCs that everybody ought to have around so that when you need them you gotta but deeds tree is one you want to use day in and day out so you don't\nChallenge your immune system or with deficiencies show by all means jump on today's great specials nuclear dodge\n... and our vitamin D tree and even our client\nLyman in nearby to get twenty five percent off each just give a bus to our would align eight hundred three Seventy thirty four\nForty seven eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven then you visited San line queuing labs dot com All right this is back about Marshall PHD this has helped line live or we're going to go to the phones now let's go to Rick\nIn San jose California and he's got some bad dandruff ranch on his chest in armpits and the doctor says she used to build up they're probably right are you there Rick\nYes Sam how old man are you and how much the way\nI Am sixty nine hundred pounds\nCircuit well first thing you want to know is it dangerous is everybody has dandruff but when there's excess sugar going to the scale it intensifies the production of something called see them\nSee them as like a blue and it starts sticking the dandruff that everybody has to get it so it becomes visible\nBut otherwise I'm having to Andrew but you can't see it [laughter] it's microscopic in size okay so so the first thing we have to do is tell you you're getting way too much sugar okay and so this of course is the result of not getting enough starch\nWhen we crave sugar we may have depleted or the vitamins so we can't metabolize starch\nAnd or we don't have storage so they're very simple thing is for you to get a copy of the biofuel diet\nAnd the resource list\nAnd shift gears and lay off meat fish poultry eggs and dairy products\nFor a Ninety Days and after the Ninety Days then you'll have a key usually the foods that are listed there but the ones that said you can have occasionally you don't eat for the first Ninety Days now what this is going to do for you at your age\nIt's going to give you thirty more good years buddy if you're smart\nIf you're a dumbbell you won't follow this it'll kill you in the American food will kill you\nThree Seventy thirty four\nForty seven eight hundred three Seventy thirty four forty seven and you can visit is on line un labs dot com All right let's go right back to this\nOh let's let's go to Beth in New Jersey in her baby's got a little immune issue in the skin was some around bumps and all\nAre you there Beth yeah Hi good how old is your baby she thought she being breastfed\nYeah I mean not completely but I think and again\nWell how long was she completely breastfed\nI'm the first tell us or not\nI'm just so you know the minimum is twelve months the ideal thing is Eighteen to twenty four months so by the introduction of food of course heard adjusted tracts not ready\nSo all manner of weird things can happen so what'd you have to do now is the damage control so number one other than your breast milk she shouldn't be getting any meat fish poultry eggs and dairy products\nOkay that would be number one number two we've got a check to be sure you're getting enough salt so she's getting enough salt so she can make enough hydro cleric acid at her stomach\nTo be able to kill any of the bugs that are in the body and whenever we as his skin problem you always want to think of the intestine something's wrong in the intestine so whatever you're feeding her you want to make sure that none of the foods contain added oils\nOkay so you're going to squeeze out maybe one ... two hundred into her food that's going to be her oil\nBut our goal is of course to ah eliminated anything that she can't digest that might take down the immune system okay\nSo what else can you do you can beef up your milk density by going on the nutritional Hughes flicks\nThese or fifty percent protein they taste really good and if you'll take two to four tablespoons of that a day your milk will become super milk okay and so that's the way we want to try to feed the heck out of her right now rather than regular food okay\nSo do you understand how long it\nWell you have to do it till the the intestine is ready for a whole food roughly around at Eighteen months\nShe like [noise] okay well you're not\nCorrect film they all did not get a full term breastfeeding I suspect you know that's why you got it's a very common problem\nBecause the thing is that they get they they watch it\nYeah I understand but mom you're in charge and you couldn't get the all the food they want as long as it's food that is not does not contain refined oil or meat fish poultry eggs and dairy products\nOkay and so if you get a copy as a biofuel diet you can see substitute foods that tastes really great that they'll love that don't have any of that crap oil added to it and watch the skin just watch what happens it's just like miracle okay\nIt used to me I let my mother never going to go back and back and you know\nYeah you know why don't you go to the food is so much better back then and now the food now is loaded with persistent organic pollutants they get it'd be great name they call it pops right yeah and so if you're not on the same playing field okay\nWhy hearing anything because she just got out ...\n... ... is it it could but you have to remember that\nHer immune system okay I guess we should just take a minute and explain to you with the problem is\nShe the real problem is that the food she's eating her immune system is trying to stop from entry into the body it sees it as alien food and it sees it as a toxin and as a result the body is fighting like heck now any other little thing\nThat comes along can nail her that's the problem so whatever else is around she's going to get until you give her food that can make a strong okay take thank you sound like you're\nAll right you guys were going to take a quick little breaks here and we'll be right back [noise]\n[noise]\nAre you prepared for the upcoming season stuck up on immune

a lot of cholesterol she got a lot of junk in the ... and in the gall bladder itself so you know he doesn't have one little thing blocking he's got an array of stuff blocking it\nSo what he would need to do if he really wanted to do this is number one\nGet on something called gall bladder PG ... about two teaspoons per day and use this for about four months and his best to take it after breakfast that's step one step too would be for him and if it really would like\nLonger better quality of life go on the battlefield diet\nThis is if I had he's doing that that I Would strictly restrict\nRefined oil for at least Ninety two hundred and twenty days and then they can relax a little bit usually and then he can also use something called gall bladder support\nNo gall bladder support is different than gall bladder PGA the gall bladder PG is designed to promote a softening of any debris that's in the ... the gall bladder\nAnd all that support is designed to promote a

really great player to promote a good supply of nuclear tied\nWhich you could use prior to a surgery or a tremendous you know you're gonna have it and following the surgery or injury or whatever you're got using maybe four to six every four hours can make a huge difference\nThe digest will help you to break this down but you can eat too much of it so you know it's better to put the lid on

specials\nTo make sure that you're a little home are still a is ready and that you've got what you need on hand and also I I really think that is special nuclear tides is really a great product to keep on hand\nAnd you know if you don't use these very often if you are really pretty healthy stick them in their ... graders so you get the best lifespan out of them\nAnd be ready when you do have an injury blower needed surgery or something you've got nuclear tides right there and you know cholesterol is kind of that a great thing to have around because I've often used it when I'm getting hired like driving late at night\nYou just take two three four of those and suddenly you notice you're much more alert because what it does is\nIt reduces the need for the body to produce so many white cells and end up mediate ... gives you a little kicking the pants with red cells so you're feeling more alert and in my opinion it's gonna be way healthier for you than slugging down a cup of coffee\nSo these are some of the things that can be really neat uses for nuclear tides and costumes and of course the three is something that everybody needs\nAnd I'd say if you're over fifty it'd be a really good idea to jump on co Q. ten because it's so helpful and it's on special today typically taking about for your main meal\nSo it can work it's very best and we got some really great specials out there by to get twenty five percent off each just give a budget or the line eight hundred\nThree Seventy thirty four forty seven eight hundred three seven days thirty four forty seven\nLet's go right back to the phones let's go to John in Cleveland, Ohio\nAnd he's got questions about a dental bone augmentation All right are you there\nJohn yes I Am and how will demanding you and how much do you weigh sixty nine to ten is this a hundred and ten pounds that's what so what do they want to do they want to\nBuild up an area like right I Want to build up a an area that is ... ... in the ... one of the scientists or it's yeah\nIt's actually a lower lower ...\nOh well that's different usually it occurs in the upper area and that would be normal and you wouldn't mean bone loss but when you're losing when they want bono imitation in the lower jaw now you're into what's called the L. veal or bones\nAnd that bone is very sensitive to boneless so if you need to build that area I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole until you first figure out why you're losing bone\nSo the normally you would get a roller ph paper in check the first morning you're in ph\nNow this is like a dog chasing his tail though because if there is remaining infection in them out no matter what we do you not going to get that message to the Green Zone six four to seven oh\nOr it'll maybe come in and go out\nUm so first you need to be sure there's no\nRaging infection left in the mouth like a dead twos or a pocket of infection from an old extraction something like this\nSo we need to hunt that down and make sure we got rid of that then we've got to work on getting the first morning you're in ph into screens don't know if you were five years old this would be usually a very easy task done\nBut when I have five so neither your eyes so that task could be\nEasy could be hard so first we get the ph paper and we find out where we are no if you're already in the blue zones you're in deep trouble that means you're making ammonia it above the urine and you're really low in minerals\nThen when you start with the something like the coral and the vitamin D D three gold and you start maybe with a half of these ...\nAnd every three days you check yourself and if it if it was blue it should drop down to the of five or ... is very yellow and then then it should build his way back up and sure every three days your jacket as long as it's going up you don't have to increase the girl\nIf it doesn't want to go up you could double the coral and see if it'll start moving let's\nSay well OK then we may have the support Paris a road and the kidney okay so many times we can support the kidney was simply taking five ... your body size like er deejay two hundred\nAnd for the Paris I read you can use the ... is one of the things that works well may be too capsules just once a day\nWith lunch and now see will that move the ph now does it come up okay now if it comes up with the stays in the great let's say it comes up but it won't stay in there or you can't quite get it in them\nOkay there's still some bugs some infection somewhere in the body\nAnd now you're going to need to visit with the queue or a person and all this should be done before you do any kind of bone graft thing okay 'cause if you try any of that is it's not going to work good and you're not going to heal well when they do the other dental work so it's a whole ... thing is going to be bad\nSo you got to give her a practitioner and they can test the teeth and gums and especially the area behind the teeth called retro mole area because so many of us have an infection that sits there most of our live\nFrom the extraction of a impacted wisdom tooth and the ... the residual infection never being dealt with\nSo what we can do they're usually can are located through the cure it practitioners are one of the dentist and has a laser\nLike in in the yeah Glazer who they can crank up the power to maybe three watchers so and disinfect that whole era and you'll be able to see the ph becomes mobile then\nAnd um it might take one or two times to do it but let me tell you your future is riding on is if you don't get through ... going good and you're sixty nine by the time you're eighty nine you won't even be able to walk\nOkay it's not a pleasant prospect that's offered for us as we age\nAnd part of it is or crummy minerals that is food part of it is or overeating oil and part of it is of course desperately needing to be able to digest our food well that's the other thing you gotta do you got to make sure you're on some kind of ... like one of them died just\nSo we're going to talk about having all of your eggs in one basket so getting in to talk with your financial advisor getting over that first step\nAnd then speaking with your advisor about diversifying your your assets not having all your eggs in one basket\nSo bad how is having all your eggs in one basket as you say a risk and how will diversification help well having all your eggs in one basket\nLeaves you extremely vulnerable so if it's all in the market you're very vulnerable to market swings if it's all in cash account you're very vulnerable to things like inflation so to somebody that lives long life like my grandparents\nYour lifestyle goes down and down and down over the years so we want to talk about your savings becoming diversify to supplement your existing retirement income sources like Social Security\nSo yeah Social Security maybe your spouse has Social Security and if you're one of the really lucky ones you have a pension\nYour savings your retirement nest egg can give you income to supplement that because there is no retirement without income so I was talking with John and Betty in my office this week and we talked about having their money in three world\nWere first world is an emergency fund we're going to talk about that later on the show having money aside so that if you have something unexpected happened that you can cover it with your savings and the second bucket it's having an income bucket while you might ask what is it that bucket\nYou might have interest producing savings like CDs or bonds or annuities annuities are great asset to put it inside that income bucket\nAnd you know people hear that word and they think you know oh my gosh I've heard bad things about annuities and I have to\nKeep in mind there's about a thousand annuities out there and we're networks financial advisors only use about five of them so if you're going to use in a new any for income we gotta make sure that you get the right one\nAnd then there's the gross bucket so John and Betty were able to tolerate a little bit of risk but not a lot so they said yeah I bet if we have our income\nCovered we cannot tolerate a little bit of up and down in the market\nDo you have those three worlds covers the income world the banking world and the growth world that's on Wall street if you don't think your assets are properly diversified and you don't know how you're going to be able to cover the income that you need in retirement\nGive us a call right now we are alive and will pick up the phone number is eight hundred seven to five to nine eight eight come right into the office and speak directly with me in a confidential environment or you can sign up for one of our dinner seminars or workshop\nEither way the number is the same here it is right it down it's eight hundred Seventy five to nine eight eight\nWe are so glad you're spending some time with us here on the show this is a net worth financial hour Meghan most alongside bath Andrews that number again to reach out to bat you can tend to visit with her at one of her office locations eight hundred Seventy five\nTo nine eight eight or go on line she has a great website at that the Andrews dot info hell bent how does diversification combat inflation inflation is pretty low these days still right yeah\nEven with really low inflation it creeps up on you so if we think about it inflation doubles the amount of money that we need to spend about every eight teen years so if you're on fixed income like a pension or\nYou're on Social Security and your Social Security goes up but not enough to keep pace with general inflation and especially inflation in the healthcare industry that means more and more money has to come out of your savings every year\nNow inflation does seem really low but if you compare it to say the dividend rate on the S. and P. five hundred\nThat does it end rate is only one point Seventy eight percent as of march two thousand Eighteen so if you're only getting less than two percent and did it and you need to dip into your principal to be able to take out enough to live\nBut that you do want to have a mix correct\nYes so back to market swings eggs in one basket so if your portfolio is a hundred percent stocks whenever this the market goes down you have less money to spend to think about two thousand and eight\nIf you had a million dollars in two thousand and eight and then you came back and looked at your financial statements six months later\nIf your money was all in the stock market all in the S P five hundred now your million dollars only worth five hundred thousand\nThat might not have been a big deal when you were working and saving as much money into your retirement savings as possible but\nIf you're drawing money out now all of a sudden you have half as much to draw from that's a big deal so we need to have diversification we needs to have all the parts of your portfolio that don't move in the same direction\nAnd we will have an overall mix that you are comfortable with the amount of up and down that's the risk the amount that you could possibly lose\nSo we want to know that you have the right assets to generate income and we got to figure out how much income you need so that we can understand the long term benefits of diversify your overall investment mix\nBats that asset allocation does need some attention from time to time and my right oh yeah absolutely you got a check in and rebalance at least once a year or when you experience a major life\nSo that your portfolio is still doing what you want to do\nThose talking with John and Betty and they said there were retiring this year and they said well we don't want to work until Seventy to get the maximum Social Security and I said that's OK\nYou're sixty three right now that seven years of planning that we have to do to get you from when you're done working too when you draw your Social Security so every year we're getting together and we're looking at how the changes in the tax laws are going to affect them during that period of time\nAnd guess what John and they don't have to take a distribution from their retirement accounts at that age\nBut for a tax planning purposes it might make sense so every year we are getting together and were determining where that income rate should be we can get the most effective tax planning for then\nDon't forget the Social Security laws have changed a few times over the years we need to make sure we get back together and go over the laws and make sure that their plan is still current with the way that the Social Security laws are and the tax laws are\nNow that he has a lot of money in some stocks about over a hundred thousand dollars that are not inside of her IRA and she's been very hesitant to cash any of those stocks even though they're too aggressive for her but now that she and John are retired and they're not taking Social Security or require distributions yet\nShe's gonna cash some of those stocks and pay the capital gains at the lower rate hey that's a way for both of them\nIf you have at least two hundred thousand dollars to invest\nAnd you want to get that level of diversification if you want to get year by year tax plan\nCall me an eight hundred Seventy five to nine eight eight we use the net worth retirement

number of advisors are not going to go [noise]\nGlad to have you with us for the networks financial hour Meghan back here when that the Andrews founder and president of network advisors her phone number eight hundred\nSeventy five to nine eight eight again that's eight hundred seven to five twenty nine eighty eight our show today is all about the five major risks to your retirement that I Wonder how you determine exactly how much you should save for retirement\nOh boy that's a great question because there really is no one magic number it's not like you know the commercial where the guys walking around carrying the big number with him you got to figure that out just like there's no one shot that makes everything go away that protects you against everything that can happen in retirement so the magic\nThing is to get a plan get the networks retirement GPS it tells you very clearly just like your GPS does where you're at right now and it tells you step by step what you\nNeed to do to get to retirement and through retirement without running out of money that's the number one thing that people are worried about so when you talk about taking money out of your savings there is a drawl percentage that you can take so if you're thinking about spending say five thousand dollars a month\nAnd your pension covers two thousand of that in your Social Security covers another two thousand dollars of that you need to draw it a thousand dollars a month well let's get together and figure out if your savings can withstand that one thousand dollars a month\nThat is terrific advice because if I Can't I Would imagine you are in trouble so back to a lot of people I'm guessing a withdrawal right between three and five percent that could actually seem pretty low right\nYeah and I get that because you look at the stock market returns and they might be seven percent or eleven percent but the problem with that is it's not sustainable it's not even Steven every year so the prudent man's rule was four percent and\nSo the believe me a lot of economists I've worked on this the guy that did the sharks in my office Roger if it's in Bloomberg\nAll these that all this statistical analysis and looked at a withdrawal raid in ... portfolio over all the different time frames that have existed in marketing history and what they found is that a four percent withdrawal rate they called that the prudent man's rule\nGives you about a Seventy percent chance of not out living your money [laughter]\nYou don't have any Seventy oh see I don't like those odd [laughter]\nMe and another advisor in my office are getting on a plane to go to a conference this week and if that pilot says to us we have a Seventy percent chance of landing safely [laughter] we're not going on that plane good point so here we are talking about all the money\nThat you have saved for your retirement you spent all of your working years thirty thirty five forty years saving and working really really hard and that money now has to carry you through the rest of your retirement years\nIf you have a Seventy percent chance of that being successful are you going to get on that bandwagon I don't know\nSo here's the thing recently so within the last seven years\nRates have been very low and David in rates have been very low and difficult to sustain because companies don't want to make that commitment that they're going to pay out a ... year after year after year and sometimes they don't have to they can cut their dividends so because of lower interest rates and lower dip it in race\nNow the prudent withdraw percentage is three percent\nReally so if you have a million dollars saved up have fun on your thirty thousand dollars a year that's not that much the guess what threw careful planning we can increase the amount\nThat you can draw out of your retirement savings it's all about a probability so we'll show you the probability that she won't run out of money using the networks retirement GPS and a lot of times that probabilities zero or\nThirty percent not good but through some careful planning and some diversification we can increase your probability of never depleting your assets all the way up to Ninety percent Ninety two percent Ninety five percent\nWe can increase the shot that you have that you're not going to outlive your savings that is what the networks retirement GPS is all about\nSo the new rule is three percent withdrawal the old rule was four percent withdrawal through careful planning a lotta times we can get you a five or eighty six percent withdrawal rate\nSo that's a difference between taking out thirty thousand dollars a year from your million in savings to taking out fifty thousand a year or sixty thousand a year\nThat's a huge difference in the lifestyle that you can have and you can take it out with the confidence that no matter what happens in the market the economy or the world that you can have that paycheck that direct deposit into your account\nEvery single year every single decade for the rest of your retirement years\nIf you want to get that security of a paycheck of a direct deposit that you will never outlive make sure you call and set an appointment to talk with me\nWe'll get together in my office in lax confidential atmosphere or if you want to meet me through a seminar or a workshop\nIf you have at least two hundred thousand dollars to invest call me get that security might number's eight hundred Seventy five to nine eight eight don't make mistakes that could bankrupt your entire retirement again my number is eight hundred Seventy five to nine eight eight\nYou can also find that on line you can get a lot more information about her and the team by visiting back to Andrews dot info that's bath Andrew dot I. N. F. O.\nNow bats having a budget that seems incredibly important right especially if you're on limited income as in retirement so how do you defend yourself against oh emergencies that could come your way yeah that is\nReally a good point it's funny many people had into retirement\nAnd forget that emergencies will still happen they're still going to need to buy a car every so often they're still going to have around here flooding [laughter] and maybe some snow or ice damage maybe you're going to have a health issue or a broken angle", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Mike Gallagher Show", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "07"}
