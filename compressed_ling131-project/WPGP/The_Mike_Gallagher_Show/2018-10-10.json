have a dog and I don't care who wins and the cable news wars but it's a Fox News MSNBC cable news world right now she and that is a distant third and you're about to see why\nThey put their face and a guy like Don Lemon who you just as it becomes on glued when a gash rightfully points out that\nDemocrat activists in protesters who ... a U.S senator out of a restaurant or indeed a mop Don Lemon doesn't think that's mob mentality Don Lemon is a Democrat\nPeriod but let's listen to the lady who almost became president ever\nSo close ... close she could she could feel that you could taste\nBut alas she didn't make it across the finish line the American people rejected Hillary Clinton and she still can't quite get over it evidently listen to what she said about Democrats Republicans\nAnd civility this is a cut number eight audio courtesy of CNN\n... not the civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that is why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the ... or the colonel ... ... ... the only thing that the Republican whom to\nRecognize average that strength\nAnd you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell\nReally demeaned the confirmation process\nDid did you hear the lady who would be president just threaten the country does that's what she's doing she's threatening the entire country you better\nUnderstand you're saying you can't be civil with Republicans not until Democrats gained control of the house and the Senate she almost became president\nWith that kind of mindset and of course thankfully the voters sauce or hurt or call them deplorable ... hurt or demean\nMore than half the country with the wave of her hand knows who she is and what she is but you're not going to have a Democrat in today's party condemn Hillary Clinton's comments you're not going to have a Democrat\nCondemn the behavior of these protesters who are hounding Republicans and conservatives in the public space chasing a Fox News channel personality through the subway in New York\nHarassing him trying to get people to to try to incite people against him\nTo know what would happen if these two so called

Daily Beast columnist talking about the behavior of today's Democrats again don't get don't get\nFood or snow covered by labels like antifa or\nFascist ... or even protesters right these are Democrats who are ... hounding and harassing people in public listen to Don Lemon with Daily Beast columnist Matt\nLouis listen very carefully to what a liberal Democrat host like Don Lemon it has to say about this mob behavior from the Democrats\n[noise] is it my behavior no it's not ... ... people who are like that and they're angry about the way the ... the way the country's going and the policy we know that before you jump into okay I make a point I Can't make it even Iraq thing they have\nA you know you're you're making a point are you the moderator or the host or are you are\nGiving a liberal moderator and the host of this will tell you that you're giving up until it gets\nThat I'm like look up the word mob and the dictionary yet I definitely\nLook up the word mob in the dictionary and you should also as a Republican look at the count the times I ever felt and look at the ... or whatever it is you are whatever it is you are look at the constitution of the United states and it gives people the right to protest\nYeah and it doesn't say where you can only do we know man I met please let us\nOkay it's okay if I have a drink so you can do whatever you want and you can leave the show if you want but let me finish I'm not well maybe my point okay well then shut up and let me do it\nAll right thank you very much\nIn the constitution you can protest whenever and wherever you want that doesn't tell you that and you can't do it at a restaurant it doesn't tell you that you can't do it on a football field tell you that you can do it on a cable news show\nYou can do whatever you want them to call people mobs because they are exercising their constitutional right it's just beyond the\nWhat a jerk\nAnd more importantly he reflects an attitude of today's Democratic Party because nobody's condemning\nThat belief that that's not mob behavior to chase them a a husband and wife who just want an evening out to have a dinner out of a restaurant shrieking and screaming at them and cruise ship them no no that's not bad behavior says Don Lemon have you shut up Matt Louis for daring\nI'm doing fine thanks my good\nMy position is is um ... it specially with the comment from Don Lemon day you can protest anywhere any time a this is I say we should take on a stronger position and give them you know it's like fire fight fire with fire and that means less show up at CNN let's start the same\nI Know you might not agree with it all I\nDo because I don't want to I don't want to hear what they are I don't I really don't I I push back on that respects the way I Know how you

will be three a long serving highly recognized Republicans in a primary to become governor\nUm she was popular in there and then she was she actually supporting Rubio in the primary so when she became
