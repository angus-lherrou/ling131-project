girlfriend loves a French fries and pizza but she's a writer she runs about five miles a day you know a ... and unfortunately in my business some sedentary but I Do I I Walk\nA I use a tread climber I stretch I use very light weights but I I Do a lot of reps because I'm also a drummer a lot of people don't know I'm I'm I've been active as a as a professional drummer\nFor forty years you know and I've done some some good gigs that I play with some good musicians and it's very demanding people wouldn't realize how demanding it is to play drums set\nYou know high energy the way are you actually break a sweat like oh my it might have gotten yeah yeah so anyway the opening music to the show I I wrote and performed oh it's fantastic and I want to thank everybody thank you very healthy\nPlanning that means the strategy has to come before the tool and we see so many individuals and so many financial advisors for that matter who are proposing a lot of different tools without even knowing what strategy needs to be accomplished\nYeah and that's really kind of I think the focus of the show and why it's such an important topic is we all need tools that our retirement tool belt the question is why what is what is what is their purpose because that goes back to their retirement strategy and even if the overall strategy for retirement is equivalent to the contractors job what are the tools of retirement\nOr really their equivalent to all the financial vehicles available to meet the needs of the job and this can include banking products insurance products investments and other financial products available to execute that strategy that an investment or financial\nProduct is simply a tool and it's not a strategy nevertheless products like these are frequently marketed as\nA strategy in themselves so don't be misled into thinking that they're anything more than just tools but don't overlook the fact that these tools can help advance your strategic goals and objectives remember a strategy is defined to be the plan developed to show you exactly how you're going to achieve\nYour desire goals and objectives most strategic plans can and should use multiple tools to help you reach those goals and on today's show we'll explore each of these individually but really no matter the tool that you're looking at a retirement that you can feel confident\nAbout starts with a plan a plan that considers how much income you'll need each and every month and there's a bunch of tools out there you know we we told the story about me making lasagna\nOn the show you know I got all the ingredients out and put 'em on the table you know I didn't have all those on your yet\nAll I had were the ingredients it's the same thing with having tools you know stocks mutual funds bonds annuities you have all the tools but how do you know which one's the right one how do you know which ones are appropriate for your strategy and have you even spent the time thinking about a strategy give us a call it an accurate solutions group for one to five\nOne five thirty three fifty five we have someone available to take the call but Bobby we'll give you a call back on Monday she's our director first impression so you can\nHear the smile across the phone so she'll be happy to to get you a call talk to you get to know you a little bit more first on the phone but also then to look for a time to come in for your vision meeting or get some first impressions we'll talk to you and you know we'll we'll show you exactly\nWhere you're headed and determine what strategies and tools are appropriate but you first have to call and again that's for one to five one five thirty three fifty five\nGood for your retirement blueprint with Ethan lane and Kirk and Arctic with accurate solutions by mark Elliott ... of course the managing partner of accurate solutions group of knowledge is one of the nation's top independent financial advisors by senior marketed adviser and today we're talking about tools\nVersus strategies and there's a big difference between the two we need tools at our retirement tool belt but they need to make sense with whatever strategy makes sense for us and our retirement so Ethan and your experience do you feel we have a good grass or a general understanding of the differences between strategies and tools\nWell marked not always now and it's so important to understand the difference as many believe they're following a retirement strategy\nWhen in fact they may not have much more than a handful of those tools were talking about today generally they've purchased are invested in several different sources of income\nBut without much strategy for how the actually utilize the income once they hit retirement and strategies are so important because they can help enhanced long term retirement success as strategy will help you know in advance how your work towards achieving your financial goals\nAnd address problems when they actually come up\nClear strategy should be foreign prior to discussing are implementing the tools the objective here is to develop a strategy that really fits your situation the bass and then apply the tools that help fit that strategy\nYou know current Social Security certainly would be a tool in our retirement tool belt and it's one that we've worked hard to accumulate hopefully and and of course we don't have the ... or even late or mark Elliott Social Security box which is a sad thing that we don't have\nThat for many years we've worked we have our own little Social Security bucks but Social Security certainly is an important financial component for retirees so when we're talking about tools versus strategies how do you see the role of Social Security may be playing in our overall retirement strategy\nOh my goodness it's so critical to that because in in the past it was still an important part of the we have the three legged retirements too in the past we had a little bit of savings we have Social Security and we are defined benefit pension plan\nBecause defined benefits pension plans that sort of gone by the wayside Social Security becomes even more critical so that is absolutely a tool that can formed the largest amount or percentage of their fixed income in retirement and that's why it's super critical mark to really determine how\nDo I maximize those benefits\nEven and I we don't work for the Social Security administration we don't work for the federal government but we can help you develop\nA plan that shows you if your husband and wife over three hundred different timing claiming strategies and shows you how to maximize your strategy and your timing efforts and incorporate that into your retirement blueprint to maximize those benefits\nThere was a lot more to Social Security than just should I file at age sixty two or should I wait till for retirement age which for some might be sixty six or sixty seven or do I take advantage of the delayed retirement credits an even tougher past my full retirement age until the age of Seventy even if someone is is widowed\nIs the worst as a single individual they're our timing strategies that are critical and and Mark I'm not over emphasizing this when I say it can it can literally mean tens of thousands of dollars of extra income throughout someone's lifetime in retirement that's why it's really critical so it is that\nIt is a major tool and it's important that if you have an advisor if you have a farm you're working with and no one has undertaken that time an hour hour and a half to go over and Social Security maxim is Asian analysis we're an accurate solutions that we are more than happy to do that for you\nAnd Kurt is more important than ever to make sure we get Social Security correct and you were talking about the three legged stool and that makes me think of my grandfather who retired from arm co and and he did have all three legs he had Social Security had his own savings but he had the third leg which is the defined benefit pension and today\nThey're taking away that lake so for my grandfather at the time Social Security wasn't as\nCritical because he had all three legs of that story but for today for a lot of people I'd say for most people you have to make sure you're spending time understanding Social Security\nAbsolutely critical in this part of our process that accurate solutions group we put together your retirement blueprint based on your numbers and your timeline part of that process is income planning in a subset of that in complaining of Social Security maxim as Asia now says we would be more than happy to do that\nFor you just give us a call it for one to five one five thirty three fifty five\nWhen you call that number we do have some of them were to take your partner formation and on Monday\nBobby our director first impressions we'll give you a call back you can hear her smell over the phone when you come into the office ... waiting area and she'll provide

Mark Elliott here with the managing partner of accurate ... started the company in Nineteen\nNinety four eight lane is an associate advisor with accurate solutions group and today we're talking about retirement tools and retirement\nStrategies they're not one and the same but they're both very very important what tools do you have depends a lot of what strategies you want for your retirement so current let's move on to retirement strategies because we touched on the retirement tools really in the first half of the show so when you're working with a client how\nDo you know where to begin with building them your clients at accurate solutions group at that customized retirement strategy because this isn't a cookie cutter processes retirement blueprint\nKnowledge really naughty everyone's situation is unique and different in the strategy you choose is going to depend on what your objectives are so earlier mark we talked about needs for income growth safety accessibility and liquidity I'm going to argue that in every retirement plan\nNeal for that I spent about how critical as each one and and how it works out an as an integrated has a different story but here's how those objectives come into play when we sit down with clients I'm going to draw up a plant based on their individual needs an object us we're going to calculate the amount of income they're going to need each and every month\nConsider how much growth their current retirement accounts may need to match or meet that income keeping in mind\nHow these assets are going to need to be liquid and also keeping in mind the clients risk tolerance that is so critical we're going to discuss and implement any tools that will help them achieve this objective such as and here we get into some industry jargon and terminology but it is important\nWe're going to talk about things like fundamental in technical analysis active versus passive investing given in value versus growth investing\nBuying whole strategies all of these areas will need to be addressed to help determine which retirement tools to use and we may encourage inclined to implement where more these this helps to achieve planned diversification band diversification is much different from just asset class diversification\nSo what about another strategy example Ethan let's say that an investor with minimal risk tolerance a monthly income shortfall and then they have the need to have the money last as long as possible health that's probably a lot of people\nYeah exactly and this is it typically fit into the profile someone who is just about to retire getting near to retirement or maybe they're even in the early stages of of retirement planning an investor with a specific income need should take a different approach first they needed to find the amount of income that don't need it\nFor purposes of this example let's just say that they need two thousand dollars a month\nSomeone in this circumstance who also has a minimal risk tolerance might desire conservative investments maybe they'll consider tools like CDs certain types of bonds or maybe annuities if they can generate adequate income by maybe using income flooring or cash flow planning strategies and we've talked about these in past\nShows they'll want to have a plan in place for optimizing their current sources of retirement savings so tools like Social Security benefits distributions from four oh one case IRAs and the light and any money than not position for income can focus more on long term growth\nBut to do this they may employee wanting the strategies previously mentioned that's a lot of ... you know current I Believe in a bucket and strategy and you have to understand what\nEach purpose of the buckets for you know each maybe each bucket has a different tool which is designed for a different purpose you know you have\nTo understand what each tool is designed for ... and if you have tools and you have strategies but you're not sure which tools go with what strategies give us a call and we can understand it it could be hard to pick up the phone actually asked for help especially with something as personal as your retirement but really there's nothing to be afraid of current aren't going to beat you up\nAnd Bobby is not going to bite she's she's she's going to be that smiling face on the ... when she came to come back on Monday\nYeah so there's no reason not to we'd love to give me a second opinion but you do you have to take the first step in that to call and is the weekend so someone is set aside to answer a call but then Bobby director first impressions she will give you a call back\nGet to know you a little bit better and then look for a time for you to come in for what we call your vision meeting and let me walk you through that Bobby will get you all set up she'll get a drink for you either hot or cold drinks actually come out and give you a tour of the office and you'll get to meet our team members because they are critical\nTo our retirement planning to get to see our Information Center where we host information events for clients of the\nFirm but then we'll sit down for an hour we'll have Christmas homemade cookies and that\nCould be for some people the best part they loved those cookies so laugh cookies have some coffee and have a conversation about you and your retirement what are your goals what are the strategies that you need to help accomplish those goals and then eventually if we get to the conversation of what\nTools are appropriate but will determine together which ones are and which ones aren't for you but you do have to give us a call that's for one to five one five thirty three fifty five\nAgain for one to five one five thirty three fifty five\nEven late is an associate advisor with accurate solution drip no longer in the ... game he is now a cat person\nArchie and lucky a new part of the lane family Kirk and of course the managing partner of accurate ... group started a company in Nineteen Ninety four I'm Mark Elliott and we're talking retirement tools versus retirement strategies and now we're talking really more about strategies because I think at the end of the day and most people do have\nYou know whether there was you know their retirement or the wall street broker to help but less accumulate our wealth so that we can retire the problem is if you you're sitting there with somebody that's only about growth and how are they gonna help you when it comes to retirement if you sit down with somebody only in the insurance world where it's about safety and protection which is certainly important\nBut it's not so much about growth and handling the challenges of inflation or that long live\nThere that they really go hand in hand you and eat in a team and accurate solutions group are what is called duly license you work in the securities world the wall street world but you also work in the insurance world and most clients I Would imagine\nNeed a little bit of blending of the two world so the second opinion what kind of qualities or do you think it's important to look for when we're trying to find somebody to help guide us when it comes to our retirement\nAnd that's critical and you're absolutely right in and let's talk with what you mentioned first someone who was duly registered ... license you don't want to deal with someone who's just marketing insurance products out although assurance products ... be inappropriate told her it's not appropriate for all your money\nJust as you don't want to work with someone just in the wall Street Journal because having all your money invested into into retirement although you need that bucket for a long term growth and inflation is not appropriate for\nAll your money is the first and foremost make sure\nThey advisor the firms are working with is independent and they have all the tools in their toolbox to matter what strategy is going to be appropriate for you and then secondly make sure someone has a concentration in retirement plans remember growing or money heading into retirement\nI don't want to make it sound easy but really it's all about growth of just long term growth it's equities you're setting them forget it your dollar cost average but when you had into him through retirement we've got to focus on income planning investment allocation taxed\nPlenty healthcare cleaning lady seeping some made sure someone understands retirement plan it and then also make sure that they're prepared to provide you a strategy based on your needs an objective is not just some stock strategy that they're recommending for most of their clientele and then lastly there's nothing wrong with asking\nHow is your financial professional compensated there's nothing wrong with that here it accurate solutions ... economic investment side we follow a fiduciary\nStandard which means we're required to put your interest by law over and above our interest and then on the insurance side were independent so we are duly registered Billy licensed we have all the tools they win or tool box and you just gotta make sure when you're interviewing\nWhen you're considering that second opinion have those tough questions have this tough conversations and if it's an advisor to hesitant to answer as things were\nAs a red flag and it might be an easy answer for you from that\nHere's what I Would suggest you do and oftentimes we recommend this for one to five one five thirty three fifty five give us a call we have so many answering the phone as Bobby we'll call you back\nConsider coming in for vision meeting but if you're not comfortable with that or maybe it's a little scary for you why don't you ask Bob Schieffer up coming dinner seminars we have a dinner seminars in Newcastle coming up at two tomatoes we have\nUpcoming workshops at Clifford restaurant this mark is a great way for the consumer to see us in a group setting for for our listen to our philosophy and then decide on their own hey I Am comfortable that schedule that vision meeting or less not by either way it puts you in touch with us and here's ask for a four hour\nDescribing the strategies and some of the tools being used for one to five one five thirty three fifty five give that number called body will call you back you can also help on our website a as she retired dot com you can look under our events that you can register that way whereby they can call you back with specific days in times of these events that we love to see their\nFour one to five one five thirty three fifty five to sit down with a team that accurate solution troop there is no cost to there's no obligation there's no pressure is just a visit is what it is it's curtain either don't know anything about you at this point you've heard him on the radio so you have an advantage you know more about them than they do by you and when they're putting your retirement\nBlueprint together there's nothing in it yet\nYou can't just say send me that retirement blueprint 'cause there's nothing in it yet we don't know about you and your hopes and dreams for retirement what's your vision that's where it all starts which is why are the vision meeting could also be looked at his dream casting what is your retirement dreams for one to five one five\nThirty three fifty five ... the managing partner of accurate solution trip started a company in Nineteen Ninety four eat them lane has an associated visor with accurate solutions by mark Elliott glad you're with us and\nYou know we've been talking tools and strategies when it comes to retirement and you can have\nTools but if you don't know what their purposes than what what is their purpose you need to have a strategy in place and you know ... you were just talking about being afraid to share it being independent\nMaybe go back a step and explain the difference between a captive agent or a captive financial advisor versus you and eat that an accurate ... which is independent when you talk about the difference\nYeah there is a big difference so let's give an example of a captive agent a captive advisor let's say you were in the market for a new cell phone and let's say you walk into what are they local apple stores now even if you walk into an apple store and say hey I'm interested in a cell phone what do you think they're going to try and sell you\nProbably going to send you to an iPhone\n... and that's logical right because they're employed by apple there's nothing wrong with that apple has their products and maybe that's not what you were looking for maybe you wonder to natural comparison them all the different cell phones available that because you went to a captive individual someone employed by apple\nThat's what they're going to recommend that product now let's assume you went in to have arising store or an Eighteen the store and you said hand in the market for new self and what do you think they're going to offer you I mean you're going to get that potential Apple iPhone\nYou're going to get the Samsung you're going to get the allergy doesn't\nMatter of the rise and what they're really marketing their service but based on that you can utilize any tool that's available on the market so that's more of an independent individual someone who was not beholden to any one particular company mark and you have more choices and more flexibility\nAnd I think that's that's one of the challenges when they're trying to find somebody to help guide you and retire but and I think you brought this up as well Kurt that really one of the look at the end of the day when you want to talk about your retirement you better be talking to somebody that works that specializes in the retirement planning world which is certainly what accurate solution troop uh the other aspect\nOf that would be the sheriff standard now you talked about that maybe lost touch on that before we wrap up today show\nAnd that's really critical because in the deal out of the department of labor came out of that recently came out with that\nFor the sheer ruling that has since been rolled back by the current administration and whether that's ray is wrong we at access solutions group mark that followed up for this show is standard on the investment side since two thousand and eleven and really what that means that consumers is a lot of people don't know what that word stands for what it means so\nWe're how to the standards where we have to by law\nBut our clients interests over and above our interest being officially means they're obligated under the terms of their professional licensed to always put the best interest of the clients first and foremost above their own interest and as the fur or any of the companies are products or services that we represent\nSo if you had a client command that needed a specific tool for their retirement tool belt and it was the same exact product but one page you an accurate solutions group save five percent for selling that particular tool and the other and there was another one that was a one percent cost you have\nTo sell the one that's in the best interests of the client you sell the one percent about five percent\nAbsolutely correct you know on the on the investment side we don't even get commission or transactions we just heard to feed him manage money and then on the short side we're independent and we represent probably about forty to forty five different companies right now but you're absolutely correct\nWe gotta look at and determine what is the client's best interest and and I always tell people once you get to know that you'll see morally and ethically we always try and follow that standard set but until you get to know is from a legal perspective we are required to follow that standard and that is critical because not every advisor nine every age out there today is following us additional standard\nSo today we been talking about retirement tools versus retirement strategies they might sound like the same thing but they're really not so eaten anything that you'd like to add or review before we wrap up\nToday's program yeah mark I thought this was a really good show to explain the importance of looking at the difference you know a mutual fund is now the strategy\nAn annuity is not a strategy and it doesn't make sense to have talks about the mutual funds or the annuities before you know what strategy you need to you needed income strategy do you need a growth strategy so really doesn't hurt to get a second opinion ... myself or teen we'd love to sit down and spend time with you get to know what your goals are what\nYou want to do in retirement what your purpose will be determined strategies that are appropriate for you and then have a conversation about\nTools so give us a call for one to five one five thirty three fifty five we have somebody there to take your call today I get your information and then Bobby we'll call you back on Monday to schedule your vision meeting in courting myself all sit down with you have that vision meeting get to know you can determine what your

practicing them doing these things and oh no I might be thrust into the whole\nOwnership business management which brings tax issues health care issues all the other stuff that you might not have been thinking about out there in Monroeville\nSure sure so I backing up to dental school it prepares you pretty well for the critical skills you get out and you are really honing their skills you know like I said I had quite a few years in Monroeville to really hone those skills\nI find out what I really like to do as far as procedures go what I needed a little further education on as far as procedures go\nI've got those classes under my belt I was really feeling pretty good as far as my skill set goes and so on then I wanted to be closer to home you know I was travelling quite a distance from McCandless out to them and all of them\nSo as I said start putting my feelers out there and and this whole ownership like I said I always knew that that's what I ultimately wanted to own my own practice\nUp I was pretty sure that I wanted to be a solo practitioner at least for a period of time and uh so when this opportunity presented itself I I really went back and forth I prayed about it I thought is this what I'm supposed to be doing at this point in my career and I thought\nYou know what school didn't necessarily prepare me for business ownership really had a a one semester course on practice management okay that does not prepare you for the real world from practice management\nAnd then I had some really great um great skills that I picked up as far as the business management goes from my boss out Monroeville I mean he's a great businessman I so I picked up tidbits there he was very open with some of the things that worked for him he was in practice for a long time\nSome of the things that worked really great for him and some didn't so I thought you know what if if not now this opportunity this type of opportunity mean never present itself again it was the exact type of practice that I wanted to build\nAnd it was there it was being presented to me I mean it could not have been a clear sign that this is probably what I should be doing\nAnd so so I like I said I took that leap of faith\nAnd ah and have a great team behind me that was that was held up by us [laughter] ah my office manager had been with the practice with mark tribal demand that I bought the practice from she had been there close to Thirty years ago she started with him so\nShe her skill set is unparalleled I really really helped me be able to practice you know work on practicing dentistry while she was still kind of in the management role in the business and then picking up tips from her she's a wealth of knowledge so I really\nReally learn so much in the first I'm Still learning but you know learn so much in his first few months there that now I feel really confident as a business owner\nThat's great you're listening to a special leadership is regarding your host Mike Howard we're in Studio ... with Dr Megan Stockton is\nNow on her own practice in the works for the\nArea and if you listen to you know football baseball or whether it is it seems like when new coaches come in the big clean now they want all there's this is in business sometimes it can be the exact opposite view was that foundational supportive people that are already know how things are going there and especially if you click with them a professionally him personally the why would\nYou change that are absolutely I had a had a meeting one on one with each of the employees actually that uh that was working for Dr ... all at the time and\nRealized very quickly that they are a huge part of the practice and was not the building or the the equipment that I was buying yet that came along with it but it was the goodwill of the patients and the amazing amazing abilities of the employees that were there so I really\nDid not want to change things dramatically cleaning house would would probably have been practiced suicide to be honest it really would have patients\nAre used to coming in and seeing the same faces they're used to having the same woman clean their teeth each time\nA there used to having that same assistant her her praying with them in the beginning of the you know in the beginning of a procedure for some patients I didn't want to change that that's why I bought the practice that I bought a so seven huge me to keep the the team intact\nWill disagree leadership advice or through a little bit so we talk with one of our favorite guru scream deep he talks very much about these one on one conversations leaders need to have in business with employers whatever you've got to keep a poll from the litter student who's on your team and and\nWhat that does is help set up future accountability or if their issues you've got that relationship already established as opposed to just kind of committed letter would still do their thing and you work on patients and you don't really know it sounds like you did a great job [laughter]\nI tried I certainly tried I wanted them to know that I was that I was there for them as well\nOr not just that they're there for me you know they're not there to serve me I I Am there as part of the practice I Am not the practice there is a lot a lot of nuance details that go into running that the day to day operations that I just can't do by myself and it would be foolish to think that I could\nAgain we're talking with Dr Megan Stockton left in the works for the area and a phone number seven to four nine three five zero ... regular website one more time\nYeah stock family dentistry dot com\nVery good okay I've got to ask this question because I think most people love to asks devastate this question maybe we're not maybe more than a funeral director of we've no one knows when did you know I Want to I Want to be a dentist [laughter]\nI get that question a lot and ah I don't have a great answer because it was always in me it sounds arranged reflect that ended or as a as a first grader\nI mean my mom will tell you that as a first grader I was saying that I wanted to be a dentist and never wanted to be a singer and actor you know everything that kids usually get\nWhen it to be the dentist you know and so maybe I was the weird little kid growing up but I never strayed from that uh it it was me I mean it was definitely a God given drive there that I had in me for that uh\nI I joke maybe we read ... bears visit the dentist one too many times or something of the ... guy [laughter] um but but I don't have any family members that were in the business uh so so it it had to have been you know within me I'm just naturally given you know given that drive\nOne of the things that other leaders and entrepreneurs I have an Eighteen year old son that's his thing he doesn't ever want to work for anyone else though he does his his ultimate goal is like you and very quickly to just be running his own things and helping some people room there\nBut was there a time as we as leaders then figure out that there there are tons of doubts creeping tell us how how did you deal with any of that type of thing whether it was getting into dental school getting out of dental school making this decision\nHow did you deal with those kind of head scratching moments\nSure there's their doubts all along the way um I never really had a plan B so in the back of my mind I thought you know what it's I Know I'm going to come through some hard times and you have to pray about some things I'm going to have to just trust that God has has me in his hand\nAnd that's really what got me through it because\nI thought I don't want to have a fallback uh this is what I Want to do I know this is what I Want to do and I know this is what I meant to do\nA this is how I'm going to help people so so it really was kind of just trusting in in God's Plan for me and trusting my own abilities to get through those hard times uh nobody is is without hard times you know in any journey that they take\nAnd so realizing that just because you have a few bumps in the road doesn't mean you're not on the right road I was really just a a confidence um I had to\nHad to rely on on the fact that I knew this was rather supposed to be heading\nUp the screen again you're listening to leadership is burger guest is Dr ... stock family dentistry dot com I Believe you're sort of the website and the food is seven to four nine three five zero one\nSix zero I'm going to come back to the leadership Saddam I Want to swing back into a dentistry and educational a Porsche because I imagine it may have actually been Dr ... years ago there was letting me know some statistics of of how little people are still going to the dentist can we talk about the little where where are things now what\nWhat should parents be thinking about for their kids or adults I can remember when I sat down with\nMy new deal is just a year ago he looked at me and he said do you want to save the ... if you have now or not yeah\nAnd I guess some people don't even know where you have I don't really care I was like yeah especially 'cause it's kind of important in my new wife through you know what to do what we need to do it we can keep everything shorter version or how how do you work through those type of things and where are we today or in general in our country or in our region and dentistry\nAnd I guess one of the other ones as dentistry is one of those more depressed businesses that are the overtime you really the ... I don't see any of that new\nAbout what I Do I Love what I Do I think that it provides me with a great as I said work home life balance\nUm I Am able to be with my daughter ah when when she maybe has you know a middle of the day program at school I can work my schedule around ... you know that more than say an ER physician could ah so I knew\nUm you know I Love medicine in general um I've always loved\nBiology and you know if I wasn't in dentistry I'm sure I Would be in some sort of medicine a field but I just love what dentistry provides for me the satisfaction that I have when you know patient can walk in with a broken front twos and walk out of my office an hour later\nFixed up and smiling you know that instant gratification the\nSmiles I can provide you know internally and externally is really really important to me that problem solver thing you know I don't know that like someone to go from point a to point B in and be a lot happier but yeah yeah and oftentimes see it happen within a matter of an hour or so to speak to that\nPerson out there as we've just got a couple of minutes left here on her leadership is worked with Dr ...\nSpeak to the the the father or mother or whether it's for themselves have got kids you know maybe finances are a little bit of an issue how do they address at him and what should they be thinking about when they begin to look for are they finally decided you're probably better do something about this either because it's really getting better it's not quite there but I Know it's going to get there\nHow do you talk to someone who's considering you know a new to the store go to the dentist for the first time and a long time\nI always say come visit come visit it doesn't even have to be for dental that the you know come into the office meat myself meet the staff or like I said we have a great team\nI'm just come and see is this a place that you're comfortable and I find that most patients are you know we ... we all take the time to really get to know those patients develop those one on one relationships with them and it just makes every procedure every visit that they\nThat they have much more comfortable um as far as parents you know young kids start early if you can\nUh the new recommendations are by the first tooth or the first birthday actually go visit the dentist say if you start early it's that much easier down the line\nEven if it's even if it is already down the line come visit us um I Love meeting new people and I want to make you comfortable so I Try it out and that's that's my biggest thing is tries out\nActually I'm Glad you brought up the age thing too because that's really really important well our guest here on leadership is burger special episode of his work has been Dr Megan

and that type of thing so I Know you are a Family Guy so this is the family station why don't we start right there tell us about family\nCan do that well you know actually backing up a little bit family wise it's liberal celebrating Twenty years with or defend this year I realized that it all started in Nineteen Ninety eight so family yeah so we're a family show we're wasting I may well in the cool thing is I Do feel that way with everybody here so that's that's a lot of fun but\nFor me or my wife and I just celebrated our twenty fifth wedding anniversary this pounds heavier than so that was that was pretty cool milestone to reach\nAnd um and we have um triplets of all things we have two girls and boys are now Twenty one so nobody has to panic too much and we're [laughter] we're you know we're into the college stage now but now I Know more high chairs or a car seats or anything like that\nWe can only do one visit bird just on that [laughter] how do you handle yeah actually I was a crazy time\nNow that's great All right and then now from the business standpoint have they been involved with you at all from that or is that just kind of been more you\nWell you know with family business it's always a matter that everybody's involved in one way or another [laughter] whether even down to helping was shipping and different things like that so yeah they've every one of them have ah participated with it\nUm we have I'm pursuing you know other things as far as college goes at this point but that doesn't mean that a year isn't a future for you know a couple of them there for to come on into the business which would be fun\nMy kid will be my dad was a dentist for like forty some years the Norman Rockwell Dennis the older I mean for about a week or two I thought about it when I was a kid maybe in fourth grade and it didn't last much longer than that [laughter] he loved it when he was very good at it so yeah you kinda gotta still let the kids do uh do their thing and figure out what got called them and their life\nExactly I you know for me you know from a business standpoint\nIt's so important to love your job you know I I see so many people that are locked into careers or jobs that they just don't enjoy and yeah and um you know it's kind of sad because it's so should be something where you go and you just are thrilled each day to show up at work which is the case for me with the jewelry business so\nIt was important to me that they you know make sure of what they want to do you do not take the easy route the family business I think can be easy you know failsafe that hey you know that work second slipped right in there but uh I think it's important to really find out what what drives you and what makes you happy\nIs on the other side of the coin I
