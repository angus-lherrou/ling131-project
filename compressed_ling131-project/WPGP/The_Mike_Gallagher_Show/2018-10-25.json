radio\nOn on a wire\nAnd co writer of the new film indivisible David Evans who joins us here on the Mike Gallagher show Mr Evans is great having the on the program how are you\nMy awesome so great to be with you this morning\nWell I Love having you with us because you know as director and co writer you got a little spin and this game you know this has got to be your baby right\nAbsolutely and it's been a long journey to get here ah where we are on opening weekend for the film the very first movie ever made about a chaplain a it was ... was in a supporting roles in films over the years\nBut this is a true story told about a military chaplain and even someone who is an active duty today are at Fort Bragg so I think people are really what we're going to\nResonate with a spell and uh you know it's a true story told through the eyes of a military chaplains who was lifted and um and you know along deployment and it's really a picture of what our troops go through during these deployments when they come home\nAnd the whole reintegration process of getting to know their husband or wife all over again and the toll it can take on marriage is\nAt the end of the day the relevance of this movie is so so crucial it's one ... one of the things I Love about telling audiences about individual talk about the relevance of this movie during these difficult times we're living through today David\n[noise] yeah you know I think that you know really when you think about less than one percent\nOf the population is directly connected to the military in some way with a spouse who's serving or a son or daughter said the other Ninety nine percent that I think so often we take for granted the dangers that our troops are facing a every day on the battlefield no matter where they're deployed\nA and so you know again when you when you take the journal of a chapel\nAnd his wife and you in a call from that a powerful story of of uh how a marriage is is so I'm\nOften times uh attacks when our troops are deployed you know we hear about the door divorce rates being so high now in our military so we really hope that couples can come out and have a date night and and just go and enjoy a true aspirational story written about a written about our troops\nAnd incidentally want a cash I mean I I didn't know until I went to see the woods I got the screener and watch that you got some heavy weights you got some some real real powerhouse actors and actresses in this bill\nWhere we really do in order to tell a story like this you need ... a lot the performances in a in a meaningful realistic way and Sarah Drew adjusting ruining who some of your listeners will know from a great show team a TV show Grey's Anatomy well we've got other actors there as well come along and support them and\nAnd really pull this off and on meaningful way\nYou know I I Love your story I've been reading about you you you began shooting homemade films at age twelve with your brother on your parents little a little uh Ricky ... camera I always so grateful to two filmmakers who try to go take a different path\nWhen it comes to to telling the story or creating a movie in again with the culture we're up against right now in some of the tough things we're facing um I I got to believe that this is your life's work or providing an alternative to people from some of the junk that we see on the big screen these days\nBut last year\nI guess David we got you know what happened to us that we got a little bit of a technical problem I think um this this I mean there did you got us back I got your back now\nSo I'm Sorry about that David we apologize I we were just talking about the alternative a movie like indivisible which is such a different refreshing change of pace from some of the garbage that that is in Hollywood frankly today and I know this has got to be part of your life's work to provide some inspiration for a change\nRather than some of the depression things we see on the big screen\nThat's right it definitely is and again you know when people go out and watch a movie like this on opening weekend it's really a vote that you're casting for more\nPositive content that you can share with your families on the big screen and uh so often we see movies like this will come along and they last about a week or so and then it's like who are gone but uh when you have a\nTrue story like this first of all it's a story about soldiers that are fighting for freedom it's a well acted well\nProduced Feldman M. we want people to get out of the support that movie on opening weekend us a vote for more movies like this and it's so important and keeping the movie around as long as we can sort of like getting out of supporting it an opening week and it helps everyone who's

Mike\n[noise]\nWe are in the middle of an incredible time [noise]\nThe president tweeted today\nA very big part of the anger we see today is our society is caused by the purposely falls in an accurate reporting of the mainstream media but I refer to as fake news has gotten so bad and hateful but it is beyond description mainstream media much clean up its act fast well the mainstream media\nDoubles down and says this is all his fault these pipe bombs at least suspicious packages that have been sent to prominent Democrat critics of President Trump um we've had a voice of reason in this country lately\nUh last night you know in a room of about a thousand people in Irving, Texas right outside\nDallas we had a an event on stage where Sean Spicer my colleagues Larry Elder Dennis Prager Mark Davis and I\nWere talking about all of these important volatile issues\nAnd I mentioned the name Senator Lindsey Graham at a roar went up\nThe life of which I haven't heard in a long time I know he's feeling the love about everywhere he goes because many of us believe that if we're not for Lindsey Graham's passion\nAnd his heart felt anguish over the way the process of judge Kavanaugh played out he wouldn't be justice justice traveled out today what a what a joy is to bring back to the Mike our new show Senator Lindsey Graham from the Palmetto State of South Carolina Senator Graham want a time to be alive ha\nMike I'm trying to make the guy that won the lottery I dunno areas but I'm trying to find it\nBut he's in your state right I mean ... can I all I Need ten million if you if you get five I'll tell you I could do five or ... you know we'll be All right [laughter] well you know if his\nTrial yet man and I get more and so that's\nA good no kidding I write he'd get fringe group he'd get British troops are going to get one of ice cream Senator Graham ought to do this last last night I mean here we are in Dallas texas and here's hundreds\nAnd hundreds of people roaring their approval for just for your name were so appreciative of your voice and and I I just got to get the Lindsey Graham thirty five thousand feet view\nOf of what the of the time we're living in this investigation is a chance to find these suspicious packages CNN's Jeff Zucker immediately blamed President Trump's what is what a Senator Lindsey Graham say about the last twenty four hours of this very nervous a dangerous time\nWhere you take your frustrations out at the ballot box you support your team are so portrait causes appropriately I don't blame President Trump put this any more than I blame Bernie for the guy who shot\nThe Scalia and tried to kill a bunch of congressman Rosa Bernie supporter but Bernie doesn't support that or this person is obviously sending bombs that critics of the process that that's not the way we do business in America hope ticket caught hope they go to jail and I hope and about Thirteen Days Republican\nWhen at the ballot box because we deserve to get reelected\nAnd that's the answer the only answer we have we got to be the the the we got to have a big boy pants on we cared lay all around and and point fingers of blame the wrong time to do this because frankly Senator Graham seems very clear Republicans have a great deal of momentum heading into November ...\nNo question about it I'm so Kevin Oh I think most people were trying to say to you or to myself when I made them is it thank you for speaking a\nThank you for speaking in a in a fashion that if I were there I Would have said the same thing less than what they were trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh who I've known for Twenty years is destroying his life to keep the seat open\nTo make sure that Democrat could say within twenty twenty they actually said that\nThey play dirty and they lost I'm Glad I called him out I had all I could take a voted for ... now because of what I chose them because I thought they were qualified Thurmond butter pecan spurts or ... or ... to people from South Carolina the game's played differently now\nAnd what they were trying to do to ...\nI Hope there's a backlash at the ballot box\nAnd I hope we pick up seats and they get punished for what they're trying to\nDo you mind if I asked if I go a little personal if you could have known him for a long time and I respect you at all and you know that all the years that that I've been on the radio I said Senator Lindsey Graham is a good and decent man I met you in Washington DC changed it\nEarly in my talk radio career you told me something that stuck with me you said Mike I came to Washington\nNot to say no to everything I Want to get stuff done I Want to get things you cross the finish line there's a belief and I and I hope this doesn't hurt your feelings are a big because I respected admire you and I know you for a long time there is a belief that with your friendship with the late Senator McCain\nYou were shorter restrained a little bit and with his passion if like Lindsey unleashed its Lindsey Graham the way South Carolina south Carolinians have known him for many many years is there any merit to that Senator Graham\nPeople thinking way too hard ah here's the deal or\nIf you know anything about may have tried to be supportive of an independent judiciary our our judiciary needs to be independent of the power to John McCain was my dear friend he voted against ... job was the heart asked when it came to judges [laughter]\nSo the bottom line is I I could have never done to set of mind Kagan what they were doing to Brett Kavanaugh they were misrepresenting his life they trade dot the Ford and there's no doubt in my mind something happened did a report but I don't believe Kevin had anything to do with it\nOr they tried to ruin his family\nAnd they said if you're really innocent or not you asked for this charade continue and that's what I lost it is when Durbin\nAsked cabin out attorney Don McGahn to White House counsel if you really have nothing now I wanted to ask for this to continue they present him guilty not innocent everything that I Believe in as a lawyer a was was basically trampled on\nAnd that push back in his do more complicated than that\nWell we're ... on a nation is grateful for you and your push back many believe I mean as it is it an overreach to say that that that that your voice your speech your passion helped the confirmation occur\nWell here's what I Would say number one I Want to congratulate President Trump for picking Brett Kavanaugh who's the great lake amount of his generation his resume of being a judge was unquestioned is integrity he's just a great guy I think what happened\nIs that I gave voice to those on our side who said enough already runs it always are judges Mike why is it always Clarence Thomas and board\nAnd Alito and now it's cabinet why is it all up to our people right and they wanna they wanna win too badly over there pretty if a Republican had done this a male democratic nominee will be crucified\nOh we'd be ...\nFor these people can you imagine if there is a democratic male nominee a lady from South Carolina dumps demand gives me a letter and I sit on it never shared it with the committee what they need to me I recommended a conservative lawyer never told the lady from South Carolina oh by the way the Democrats would come here to meet you they'd be a\nRiot in the street a crowd of press so\nSo I just got mad I was pissed\nYeah I Know you were an MRI make about it that get test to get so hopefully with [laughter] oh well we know\nHere's here's justice Kevin I mean that battle was more ... and and he's on the Supreme Court and maybe there'll be another conservative on the Supreme Court uh in in over the next few years Senator Lindsey Graham is whether it's let me ask you about the big burning issue I think is the October surprise we've got thousands and thousands\nOf people in what's being described as a migrant caravan\nUm a lot of people are concerned as much as ... as the country is an amateur in love with you right now there are a lot of us should live at a\nPush back a little bit on on the issue of illegal immigration and and you have been at\nThe you've been an interesting I think that it interesting voice and all of this where do you stand right now with these thousands of people who are marching towards the southern border uh and and and frankly I think from a political optics point of view something that is encouraging Republicans and independents people to go to the go to the polls and say\nWe can't have open borders we gotta have sovereignty we got to have a secure border what's your take on the the migrant caravan Senator Graham\nOr between Kevin on the care of and that does that make you want to vote as Republican nothing ever will\nBigger an independent voter I'll hope you will come on our side\nI'm going to be practical when it comes to solving the immigration problem within our country if you've been here for decades and you've got American citizen children uh them will treat you fairly you'll have to learn our language ... find get in the back a lot but I don't want a third wave of our
