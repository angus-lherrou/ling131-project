Stein Rosenstein had him with him on the plane yesterday\nOn air force one now he's certainly capable picking up a phone unlimited president know if something's up with the UN ambassador but what is going on we are standing by and awaiting remarks from the president of the United states are following Nikki Haley's resignation\nLot of people calling in text you got a lot of people on hold never really trusted her\nHeads and I'm going to admit this I've always had a funny feeling in the ... to my stomach about Nikki Haley I've always wondered about her worry it had nothing to does anything to do with the Confederate battle flag that was one part of it but there's just something about her and the way she has\nPerformed in her capacity as UN ambassador that has sort of bothered me\nIt's almost as if she's not hasn't been fully on board and there was speculation that perhaps she's the one who wrote the anonymous article in the New York times again I'm speculating here it's gross rank speculation\nBut perhaps\nShe was anonymous she was part of the deep state and and it was revealed the President Trump and that's the end of that\nThere were a lot of people inside the building who was not on the ... agenda at age ... miles to the national security advisor included but but my I I Know everybody needs to talk about breaking news\nBut this really isn't a big deal of people come and go to the dentist rationed by the Clinton whether it's Reagan this is all powerful that cause these jobs you alive I truly you alive\nAnd uh let's wait and see a\n... for what the reason is for the resignation\nAnd I'm Glad you said that because it's it's easy for all of us who are sort of observers\nTo say how to you because I always instinctively say gosh why would you\nWhy would you leave the White House why would anybody walk away from that job and of course I can look at my own career and I made decisions that people have said why did you do that and it turned out to be a pretty good move for me but\nYou know at the time people will say oh my gosh you're resigning from WABC radio in New York and yeah I took a chance to run into syndication and it worked out the you know you're Twenty years later\nPretty good I mean people make decisions based on things like the the the brutal treatment you get\nWhen you're in that fish bowl and so I I really do get it um and maybe that's what this is it must be something though\nAs Sebastian if if if the two of them are making a joined announcement it has to be something that's positive that's good you know what I mean and and people are going crazy with them on my text line and people calling in saying things like\nMaybe is is is Lindsey Graham going to become attorney general as she got to get some position was\nWe could I things around ... voted down [noise]\nBut how much fun when I Know you're you're getting your your getting to be like the the the crazy in the mainstream you know a little now as a bitter about that so that's ... that's about that's a big insult doctor my and I mean when when the ... goes the chaos in the white I Know it was like hey\nGuys if if the last twenty mom has been pay off I was will say oh yeah no kidding no economy yeah can you look at a border you look at unemployment if it I mean people have to understand the president yeah the president isn't your average\nBureaucrats and he's not even a politician right he's the man who has been round ... successful in the private sector\nWell you talk about chaos Dr ... you're talking about chaos bring me the kind of chaos that results and judge Brett\nKavanaugh now in the hill and I will oh in the hidden\nIn the history of book shop too has there ever been a more perfectly Times Book than your book why we fight defeating America's enemies are no apologies because let's be very blunt here sometimes America's enemies are from within and what we all witnessed over the last few weeks I\nI I Know you had to be as disgusted as the rest of us\nAre totally because I Lived in I've been through it you know all the accusations made against me and the White House and you know we ... we had a saying in the west wing ... when all this stuff was going on you only say slack when you're over the target but but this was disgusting and the interesting thing about my book why we find which of course I wrote\nLong before you have an old was was nominated rice\nIs there's a chapter in about a great American hero of the book is about all the threat America faces and ... the president's going to do about them but then I have these ... stories about or amazing American heroes and the last one is a guy called wicked chambers that most\nAmericans and probably Ninety five percent of millennials that never heard of but Whitaker chambers most of the tunnel before ... was born so just just a little sound bite\nThis is the man who stood up for the truth in the first televised congressional testimony ever in Nineteen forty eight right he stood up to say I was a former communist and I can tell you the comment is our and by the government\nAnd what happened to him the left went crazy\nThey accused him of having an affair they accused him of being called the homosexual they used to being responsible for his brother's death all of it might was a line than it used to live and\nAt the end of the day he won because he stood up to the truth so anybody who said that you guys could buy the treatment jobs have been overseas a guess what the Democrats have been doing it for about seven years mind\nAnd and it's gotten so bad that it's almost at a fever pitch and frankly I'm hoping and praying that Americans remember\nWhat has happened over the last month come November the six because you know there and they are on record you know it and we've seen them promising left and right impeaching Kavanaugh house members threatening and promising an investigation of Brett Kavanaugh they don't want this thing band\nAnd if they get control the house in the Senate We're going to be we're in for a world of hurt\nWe look I've chosen the title of the book for a reason why we fight we now have the will to protect the republic I'm thinking about this for a second do you remember what Harry Reid said\nAbout the lives he said he ... he won didn't level and he doesn't win did he he didn't win by yeah\nWhat we have to face Mike yeah the last ... made a bond with the devil they know that that\nEnds meaning getting power justifies what ever me whether it's lying about Mitt Romney's taxes or whether it's accusing a little boy scout I'm Brett Kavanaugh\nIs a boy scout for the last three years and we've been accused him of being a serial rapist Shangri la ... made women gang yeah\nIt is it pure evil yeah and if if we think\nAre they going to stop because we want this one forget about it\nThey're going to ramp it up you've already seen the article said we have to go even further what's the I mean let's let's remind ourselves who's James ... means is a name that should be in the brain of all Americans James ...\nWell they Bernie Saunders volunteer right ...\n... took an automatic rifle in the dumps a baseball field in Virginia with a list of Republican congressman ... almost ... when the right down the ... when does the riots actually normalized violence so whether it's a chief up\nWhether it's a baseball field in a rifle just as the how should you get when you say ... and ... the me and my lesson from from my vote\nIf you if you buy into that lost a philosophy what eventually lead to we've seen it a law under your leads to the goo lax leads to the desktop because you'll ends justify the means then you'll do what it ... it takes\n[noise] this is why you got to get his book why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies and I'm not kidding you as the as the Kavanaugh bloodbath unfolded I thought\n... Sebastian Gorka is the smartest guy in the universe title his book the way he titled it because it's what dates a primer\nFor later right after November the sex get the book and Dr Sebastian Gorka

score or I'm not I don't have an enemies list I've got friends who uh who who lashed out against the president um\nObviously she accepted a key position within the administration as UN ambassador and ah she has not she's backed off of all of her negative comments about the president when he was running but it's just hard for me to hear people who even\nPortend a support for um for the

everybody that you have to speak to and I I think that ah hopefully we'll get lucky but maybe that won't happen but we're prepared [noise] I wanted to\nDo this because Nikki Haley\nThe United nations has been very special to me she's done an incredible job she is a fantastic person very important that you also is somebody that gets it and she has been in the United nations from the beginning with us from\nAnd work with us on the campaign has been really along kind of very intense and she told me probably six months ago she said you know maybe at the end of the year the end of the two year period for the end of the year I Want to take a little time off of\nBeen a very successful you know governor of South Carolina [noise]\nFor eight years and then she uh\nShe did this and this is possibly the more in tune with\nAnd very dangerous in\n[noise] what she's doing a fantastic job but we've done a fantastic job I gather we've solved a lot of problems one of the process of sound like a lot of problems at the beginning or North Korea was a massive problem\nReally nicely I can speak for\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo is things in the world of nicotine and when they said we're all we're all happy for you in one way\nBe a different capacity to that'd be ... but uh I just want to let you know so at the end of the neck he will be leaving and they will be in constant touch I Know

uh we will miss you or at least we can all the time but we will miss you never know let's say you have done a fantastic\nMuch [noise] well\nI Want to say on her at all I Want to paint\nYou know allowing us to come out and how\nOn it is then an honor in a lifetime you know I that\nBelieve this day and serve\nThe United states on foreign policy now\nDo know that if we think we are going to do something we fall when the president in front of that whether it was it the chemical weapons in Syria whether it was a NATO\nOf whether the ... given amazing they get\nGuessing ten years at the un out one\nThree million and the un by\n... than we got an arms embargo which was a long time\nNorth Korean sanctions\nWere turned on the largest and generation down in a way that we can really work\nAnd the Iran deal bringing attention to the world that every country need to understand you can't overlook all of the bad things they're doing you have to pay them for the ... they are on I think you look at the anti Israel violence and drank encouraged that the president shown in moving the embassy and showing the rest of the world and we\nThings where we want to\nYou know in all of them don't have had made a huge difference in the U.S\nHe went to a strong again and the U.S are drawing in a way that she may call and ask them very proud of and I didn't want to say that it's not just\nFamily in general and the first lady has been nothing but very very kind to me I Can't say enough good things about Jared ... scary in a\nI mean the region after the on the way he can I'm what I've done working

play\nAsked her to come in but\nIt's a great day in the United states and I'm proud to them part of the team now I don't have anything that I'm where I'm going to go I think that um the main thing was

eight years have been pat\nAnd I'm a believer in her mind that I think you have to be down what's enough to know when you start with\nAnd I will say that um if are all in here that are going to ask
