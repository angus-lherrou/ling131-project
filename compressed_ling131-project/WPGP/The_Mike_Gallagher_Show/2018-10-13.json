wasn't benefiting you she said I didn't notice it until I stopped taking it\nI find that with a lot of supplements have they because you know when you start to feel good year you're not thinking about it in the right thing you don't think about it you just keep taking it\nAnd then when you stop and you see how your body reacts being off of that yes than than ...\n... yeah maybe I should come back and I like I said I see that with not only to have oil go with a lot of other points to a particular multi vitamin I Know what this was doing for me time stopped\nThat we need those vitamins we need us minerals you know that's what our body limbs off all we need proteins 'cause everybody needs to ... that it makes derives from the pro teams\nAre absolutely her hair skin nails muscle everything\nAnd so you have actually hemp hemp seeds hemp heartless yeah\nYeah it's a away from the CBD ... part of the plant we have many food items that are very beneficial\nIs you're spending right you know whether you're retired or planning to retire settling on the appropriate rate is is obviously a common concern and the key is being able to allow your income and investment has games to cover those expenses this heavy just thinking about when my grandparents are we talking about this before but\nWhen he's in his parents or grandparents and and your parents are retired life was a little bit easier back then write them and see the rates five six seven eight nine percent it was easier to just allow the earnings off of our money's to help supplement our income in retirement\nThat's the easiest way to make sure your money's going to last them as conservative way is avoiding touching the principal you know when we look at income from Social Security\nAnd supplement that income from Social Security with if you're still blasted defined benefit pension or maybe you have an annuity or some investment income that's the easiest most conservative when let's just use the earnings to supplement my my retirement\nAnd other key to consider is to understand\nThe budget before you retire and this is a big one literally and I'm not exaggerating this probably five percent of the people who come in to see us who were referred or maybe they've kind of come to one of our dinner workshops maybe about five percent of them know\nHow much income they're going to need and retirement and you got to have a handle on that spending plan\nAnd when I say handle I'm Talking about are written plan not just some figures in your head and you think you'll need this much you got to know what your what your fixed income needs are so so you have basic needs like utilities insurance food taxes\nYou also got to figure out that discretionary needs what hobbies and pastimes do you enjoy doing it if you'd like to travel to golf\nWhat's that going to cost us and then you have to also planned for the unpredictable maybe you have to replace all of a hot water heater and they were preparing cracked foundation that maybe someone in the family needs some money all of a sudden because they had an emergency and they're not planned for\nThese are all things you gotta take into consideration and you've got to do that before retirement the worst thing you can do is retire not near what you need coming in and all these things happen and then you find out oh goodness me that you didn't have that\nThey the the income necessary to retire and I'm already retired you don't want to be in that situation so inaccurate solutions group you know what we do mark as we walk individuals through our process which is called your retirement blueprint\nAnd recover five key areas but one of the first things we walk you through is a spending plan determining how much income you have coming in\nHelping you formulate your vision for retirement and determine what the cost of that is on a monthly basis and if there's a gap between your budget\nAnd your income sources will put an income than in place to solve for ... that's the key to retirement remember I've never ever been able to retire someone without income you gotta have the income income gives you your independence and retirement and you have to have a firm handle on how much income need coming in each and every month\nFor one to five one five thirty three fifty five that's our phone number give myself give our team of call will get you into the office root for our vision meeting and we'll begin the process of formulating your budget and retirement for one to five one five thirty three fifty five\nPermanent out against the managing partner of accurate solutions real short of the company back in Nineteen Ninety four I'm Mark Elliott glider with us today for your retirement blueprint easily not with us today on vacation fears on occasion obese and comes back I'll rejuvenated and ready to go as he always is there's no question about that today we're talking about some of the overlooked keys\nTo retirement success are you thinking about some of these things when you hear him you're probably on yeah well I wouldn't have thought of that I mean it's kind of that's why we say they're overlooked keys to retirement success what are some of the things Kurt that we can do to help ensure that our retirement portfolio\nCan generate the income that we need for our retirement\nWell let's look at some rules of thumb because we have to have a a guide or our starting point and there's a rule of thumb you can use that four percent withdrawal rates are basically if you've accumulated a certain amount of money for retirement\nJust take four percent of that each and every year in retirement and that's going to shore maybe about eighty five percent chance that your money's going to last Thirty years but I always caution people there's no guarantee that is not foolproof but it is a reasonable starting point\nThe percentage you choose should be enough to cover your regular expenses and then there's one time items I got a new roof or a big vacation but for larger expenses pre retirees and retires should save a little on an ongoing basis to build an emergency fund\nYou know begin looking at ... at the many options available ways to help fill the gaps I mean there's so many products out there today mark and we've talked about a lot of these and and I get if they don't like to talk about products are show\nBut I mean you have an duties and life insurance for one k.'s and high res traditional Irish ... areas and then you have individual stocks individual bonds you can\nUtilize mutual funds or exchange traded funds you could have treasuries you have real estate investment trust there's so many things out there\nBut the big rule of thumb is starting to four percent and that's a starting point and then it just based on your budget and what your what your vision is in retirement\nYou know and I would imagine that most people come in and sit down with you for the first time ... to maybe they're listening to the show when they go hey I Want to sit down and I want to learn more about where I Am on my road to retirement they have a lot of those things that you just mentioned\nBut they don't really know how to put it all together and where should they pull from at what point send their life to you both from the wrong areas the wrong time that can cause some problems so most people have done a great job accumulating but then they're confused because they never retired for you know really aren't they\nWell absolutely and and so I I sort of equate this to the story about lasagna and and you know trying to figure out on his innocence he has his townhouse as first town trying to figure out how do I make lasagna\nAnd he'll get all the ingredients out the first as to understand what ingredients do I need to have all the ingredients spread out on the counter\nBut then the question becomes with all those ingredients you know the cheeses and the noodles and the sauces and spices does he have his Anya\nAnd he doesn't you know at that point you have to put all those ingredients and the right amount of the ingredients and you have to properly layer that lasagna you have to know how long to cook it\nYou have to understand you know what temperature of the state has to be on there so many things that go into it and and how that equates to to planting a lot of individuals come into our office for that second opinion and we see they have a lot of ingredients they have a lot of stuff out\nBut no one has taken the time to incorporate all those ingredients into lasagna and show them how to make lasagna and maybe they have all the proper ingredients\nMaybe some of those ingredients aren't even the right ones and they need to be replaced with the proper ingredients and that's what you know that's really what plan is all about it's about having a plan in place to helping corporate all those ingredients so that when you pull that out of the oven at the proper time\nYou have that many nice baked pantyhose lasagna and and that's our process mark our process is called your retirement blueprint and that's what we do we help and show you if you have the proper ingredients having corporate all the greediest together so that you can have the confidence clarity an independent you deserve\nHeading into and through hopefully for the last Thirty years of

S. G. retired dot com so we just an accurate solutions group\nAn abbreviated hey S. G. retire\nDot com you can also find out about those dinner seminars at Kurt was talking about\nTypically no cost to attend but you do have to sign up seeding is limited\nAgain the website has that information and a lot more on their check it out a S. G. retire dot com A. S. G. retire dot com\nToday we're talking about overlook keys to having success with your retirement and and it's easy to overlook things there's no question about it because especially we've never retired before it's our first time we don't have to go back and do it a second time we don't have to go back to work so we need to get it right the first time\nThen one of the challenges Kurt is that we are living longer today than any generation before us\nSo we really need to try to figure out how long our retirement might last and then how do we make our money last as long as we do right\nThat's a big deal and why is it such a big deal today versus thirty forty years ago well thirty forty years ago wasn't such a big concern\nBecause back then we had defined benefit pension so when when when my dad retired you know we think about that retirement story and and the three from legs under store Social Security\nDefined benefits pension and a little bit of savings what's happened over the course of the years and we've talked about this on a previous shows mark is that the defined benefit pension plan has been replaced and is being replaced with the four one K.\nThe four one K. it's great it allows you to accumulate money for retirement but what do we do with that money how do we turn them money into income 'cause we got to replace that leg of the stool that's gone and so one of the ways we do that\nIs utilizing the proper tools thirty forty years ago annuities we're not a big tool used in retirement simply because one of the biggest benefits of annuities is guarantee a principal against market lost but also then the income they're designed to paying income and sometimes in income\nThat you can't live through ah through a lifetime income writer said that they become very popular recently because we are now more responsible than ever before\nFor our income in retirement than annuities have a long\nHistory dating back to Seventeen fifty nine in North America sort of as a way to compensate families a Presbyterian minister is basically the wait a minute he works\nIn exchange for premium you find in a new lady and the new to you can either be paying income immediately such as an immediate annuity or it can differ that decision down the road to a certain point and that's the deferred annuity\nBut the bottom line and duties and and the way we utilize them in our practice really for two areas protect your principal against market lost and if we need some structured income in retirement income that we can't live one of the tools we may look to the university\nYou know as you say and do what he started way back in Seventeen fifty nine they are not the same annuity today they were back in the Seventeen hundreds and that's probably the challenge for a you know 'cause we'll ... we'll hear it\nBoy I ate annuities and you should to wait I Love annuities and you should too I mean there's so many people that are on opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to annuities that they sometimes get a bad rap and correct me if I'm wrong but that it seems a bad rap comes from the misunderstanding of what they are\nAnd what they can do for us in our retirement could you you you mentioned immediate annuities where you you pay and all of a sudden you get money in a month or so talk about the immediate deferred annuities the different types that are involved\nYeah and you're absolutely right I think that the misunderstanding is simply because we all have biases and if you've read something ten years ago or twelve years ago about a new disease and it was a negative article that sort of stuck with you\nSolutions group you'd like to find out more about Kurt and the\nTeam you can certainly go to the website a S. G. retire dot com A. S. G. retired dot com you want to find out about the dinner seminars the opportunities to a lesson to current and the team outside of the radio show you've heard him on the radio now you want to see him in person with your peers\nCertainly an opportunity for you to do that all that information more is on the website A. S. G. retire dot com A. S. G. retire dot com or talk today about things to consider in order to retire successfully I don't know if anybody that goes into retirement hoping this is an unsuccessful diamond in our lives and\nSo it certainly we want to be successful in retirement Kurt another question about creating a life plan within that financial retirement plan 'cause we're talking about we need a plan but you need a plan to stay busy what is going to really kind of make you get up out of bed every day and to have you excited about today's events what are the benefits of doing that\nOh and I've seen both sides of this coin people who who really take it seriously and really enjoy your time in ... in the opposite end you know it it's all based on our experience you know clients who created a life plan where the most thoughtful engaged yeah they had a written plan for how they spend their time\nAnd they created a new routine to pull it replaced I work routine and they enjoyed the best talent and had the best fair when stressed that sick or work say goodbye to not having to go to work anymore sounds really really inviting\nBut having a lifestyle with no routine or purpose it isn't any better and this comes from our experience with retirees I've helped individuals and this is not an\nExaggeration I've helped hundreds of families and individuals retire and that's what we see time and he came out and you know the all the options mark and retirement can literally be is unlimited as your imagination\nYou need to ask yourself or identify where your interests lie you know what are you going to do when you retire are you going to still work part time we see that a lot today are you going to volunteer maybe travel the world we see that frequently\nBabysit their grandchildren you know I have Lincoln I have any we have a third on the way we love it but that takes time\nJoining a bowling league play gin rummy with other retire co workers create your own company men or you may be its mission mission or ministry work these can all be part of the plan and they should be part of the plane but\nYou've got a plan for it to have to know what you're ... you want to do what you're gonna do what your vision purpose is going to be prior to retirement\nSo we're talking about overlook keys to retirement success from one of the I think a lot of people just assume heading into retirement I Am going to spend less in retirement my bills won't be as much ... you know that kind of thing my taxes will be lower we kind of get caught up into that that hey oh everything's going to be a little different but it's not going to be as expensive when I get to retirement\nAnd your experience Kurt with your clients you see people spending more in retirement or do they typically spend less than they did when they brought home that paycheck on a continual basis\nBoy I hate to say this is talk about changing the title of the show that the parents but it does\nSome examples if you aren't working you're not going to have the same work related costs maybe you're not eating out as much in in so much cost goes down\nThe maintaining the business wardrobe commuting costs all those different things can get down\nAnd maybe you have paid off your house or other data you've made it a point there hey I Want to get these things paid off before I retired and that's no longer an expense however some expenses may go up in retirement maybe your taxes aren't going to be or maybe\nThey actually going to be higher because of required minimum distributions when you're forced to take out of retirement account even if you don't need to also tax rates can just increase in the future we know with the new Trump tax rates we know they're in effect I Believe through the twenty twenty five but if Congress doesn't act they go back up to where they were\nPrior to that new law there's different health care costs can go up dramatically in retirement we're so used to having employer sponsored health care plans\nAnd they were paying three hundred four hundred a month for our family coverage\nBut in reality once you're no longer working and it's pre Medicare age or maybe we're not spending a thousand or twelve hundred so some costs will absolutely go down other costs will go up and so I hate to say it depends but it really looks at an individual circumstance to determine\nOr are you going to be spending more or less in retirement\nSo really I guess at the end of the day I mean it does depend on what your plan is right I mean it depends on what you want to do day in and day out are you going to be more active are the hobbies you have are they more expensive hobbies you\nCertainly have some people probably like dealing with cars\nAnd boy I've always dreamed of having the sixty three split window Corvette or sixty seven or whatever year was you know those kinda things when you have those kind of dreams and hobbies those can sometimes costs you more if your if your goal is just sit around and read a book and I love to read I could see that this will sit on the couch but you've got to have something to motivate you I Would think\nYou're absolutely right and I just and that's a great example because just two weeks ago we just got a call from a client recently retired\nSixty five Mustang sixty one thousand dollars he's considering buying the Mustang is not having a midlife crisis you just if something is always jumped I've always wanted to do and he wanted to know if his plan allows for that type of an expense and that's an expense that isn't\nA fixed costs on a monthly basis is not discretionary spending that's one of those things where\nHey do I have enough saved over and above what and I need to generate the income\nTo allow for that in in his example it did allow for that\nBut you got to have a plan in place I mean nobody plans to fail they only failed a plan and it doesn't need to happen you know the first step is to get a custom retirement blueprint for one of our team members myself Ethan from our team we have a great team in place that helps us coordinate and and and really develop these plans\nThere is no obligation for that but you have to take a first step and if it causes for one to five one five thirty three fifty five what you make that call body will call you on Monday she'll schedule your vision meeting and we'll show you an income strategy you have that can be the foundation upon\nHow you build your retirement and Allen says it's custom it'll use your numbers your timeline and there's no cost her observation but you have to take that first step and it's simply the call us at for one to five one five thirty three fifty five\nNo costs no obligation no pressure just a fireside chat with Kurt if you will for a long time so I have one\nThirty three fifty five we're heading into that time of the year here not too far away but I Do think we get caught up a little bit in money aspect of retirement we know we have to have income when you know we have to have money to replace those paychecks furniture and all are coming in\nBut we can't forget about living our lives as well and enjoying retirement 'cause that's what it's supposed to be it's not supposed to be drudgery it's supposed to be a great time in our lives anything that you would like to ask before we wrap things up\nWell yeah and I appreciate you saying that

well good well now I have to figure we were going to talk a little bit about leadership ... where were you thinking from that standpoint of okay I'm practicing now I'm doing these things and oh no I might be thrust into the whole\nBusiness management which brings tax issues health care issues all the other stuff that you might not have been thinking about out there in Monroeville\nShort short so I backing up to dental school it prepares you pretty well for the critical skills you get out and you are really honing their skills you know like I said I had\nQuite a few years in Monroeville to really hone those skills I find out what I really liked to do as far as procedures go what I needed a little further education on as far as procedures go\nI got those classes under my belt I was really feeling pretty good as far as my skill set goes and so on then I wanted to be closer to home you know I was travelling quite a distance from McCandless out to dinner with them\nSo as I said started putting my feelers out there\nAnd and this whole ownership like I said I always knew that that's what I ultimately wanted to own my own practice up I was pretty sure that I wanted to be a solo practitioner at least for a period of time\nAnd uh so when this opportunity presented itself I I really went back and forth I prayed about it I thought is this what I'm supposed to be doing at this point in my career and I thought\nYou know what school didn't necessarily prepare me for business ownership but you know we had a a one semester course on practice management okay that does not prepare you for the real world and practice management\nAnd then I had some really great um [noise] great skills that I picked up as far as the business management goes from my boss Monroeville I mean he's a great businessman\nI so I picked up tidbits there he was very open with some of the things that worked for him he was in practice for a long time\nSome of the things that worked really great for him and some that didn't so I thought you know what if if not now this opportunity this type of opportunity mean never present itself again it was the exact type of practice that I wanted to build and it was there it was being presented to me I mean it could not have been a clear sign that this is probably what I should be doing\nAnd so so I like I said I took that leap of faith and ah and have a great team behind me that was but I was going to the U.S [laughter] uh my office manager had been with the practice of mark tribal man that I bought the practice from she had been there close to Thirty years ago she started with him so\nShe her skill set is unparalleled I really really helped me be able to practice you know work on practicing dentistry while she was still kind of in the

very quickly that they are a huge part of the practice it was not the building or the the equipment that I was buying yet that came along with it but it was the good will of the patients and the amazing amazing abilities of the employees that were there\nSo I really did not want to change things dramatically cleaning house would would probably have been practiced suicide to be honest it really would have patients are used to coming in and seeing the same faces they're used to having the same woman clean their teeth each time\nA there used to having that same assistant her her\nPraying with them in the beginning of the you know in the beginning of a procedure for some patients I didn't want to change that that's why I bought the practice that I bought two so that was huge me to keep the the team intact\nWell that's great leadership advice right through it so we talk with one of our favorite guru seem deep he talks very much about these one on one conversations that leaders need to have in business with employers whatever you've got to keep a poll on that and understand who's on your team and and\nWhat that does is help set up future accountability or if their issues you've got that relationship already established as opposed to just kind of coming in the letter would still do their thing and you work on patients and you'll really know it sounds like you did a great index job [laughter]\nI tried I certainly tried I wanted them to know that I was that I was there for them as well\nOr not just that they're there for me you know they're not there to serve me I I Am there as part of the practice I Am not the practice there is a lot a lot of nuance details that go into running that the day to day operations that I just can't do by myself and it would be foolish to think that I could\nAgain we're talking with Dr Megan Stockton is in the works for the area and a phone number seven to four nine three five zero ... regular website one more time\nAt stock family dentistry dot com\nVery good okay I've got to ask this question because I think most people loved the asks dentists this question maybe ... well not maybe more than a funeral director and we will know when did you know I Want to I Want to be a dentist [laughter]\nI get that question a lot and ah I don't have a great answer because it was always in me it sounds those ranged roughly ... as a first grader\nI mean my mom will tell you that as a first grader I was saying that I wanted to be a dentist and never wanted to be a singer and actor you know everything that kids usually get it\nWhen it to be the dentist you know and so maybe I was the weird little kid growing up but I never strayed from that uh it it was in me I mean it was definitely a God given drive there that I had in me for that uh\nI I joke maybe we read ... bears visit the dentist one too many times or something of the ... I wrote a dream is is there you go [laughter] um but but I don't have any family members that were in the business uh so so it it had to have been you know within me I'm just naturally given you know given that drive\nOne of the things that other leaders and entrepreneurs I have an Eighteen year old son that that's his thing he doesn't ever want to work for anyone else though he does his his ultimate goal is like you and very quickly to just be running his own things and helping some people rumors\nBut was there a time as we as leaders them figure out that there there are times have doubts creepy and tell us how how did you deal with any of that type of thing whether it was getting into dental school getting out of dental school making this decision\nHow did you deal with those kind of head scratching moments\nSure there's their doubts all along the way um I never really had a plan B so in the back of my mind I thought you know what it's I Know I'm going to come through some hard times I mean I'm pray about some things I'm going to have to just trust that God has has me in his hands and that's really what got me through it because\nI thought I don't want to have a fallback this is what I Want to do I know this is what I Want to do and I know this is what I meant to do a this is how I'm going to help people so so it really was kind of just\nTrusting in in God's Plan for me and trusting my own abilities to get through those hard times uh nobody is is without hard times you know in any journey that they take and so realizing that\nJust because you have a few bumps in the road doesn't mean you're not on the right road and I was really just a a confidence um I had to\nHad to rely on\nOn the fact that I knew this was rather supposed to be heading\nUp the greater good and you're listening to leadership is burger gift is Dr Megan start dentist and the ... stock family dentistry dot com I Believe you said is the website ... seven to four nine three five zero one\nSix zero I'm going to come back to the leadership Saddam I Want to swing back into a dentistry in educational Porsche because I imagined it may have actually been Dr ... years ago there was letting me know some of the statistics of of how little people are still going to the dentist can we talk about the little where where are things now what\nWhat should parents be thinking about for their kids or adults I can remember when I sat down with\nMy new deal is just a year ago he looked at me and he said do you want to save them out and see if you have now or not yeah\nAnd I guess some people don't mail mail for a year but I don't really care I was like yeah especially 'cause it's kind of important to my wife new wife too so that was do what we need to do it we can keep everything shorter but how do you work through those type of things and where are we today or in general in our country or in our region and dentistry\nI guess one of the other ones as dentistry as one of those more depressed businesses that are the overtime to get really depressed and I don't see any of that new\n[laughter] I Love what I Do I Love what I Do I think that it provides me\nWith a great as I said work home life balance um I Am able to be with my daughter ah when when she maybe has you know a middle of the day program at school I can work my schedule around that you know that more than say in your physician could ah so I knew\nUm you know I Love medicine in general um I've always loved\nBiology and you know if I wasn't in dentistry I'm sure I Would be in some sort of medicine a field but I just love what dentistry provides for me the satisfaction that I have when you know patient can walk in with a broken front twos and walk out of my office an hour later\nFixed up and smiling that instant gratification the smiles I can provide you know internally and externally is really really important\nTo me that problem solver thing in the ... someone to go from point a to point B and and be a lot happier\nBut yeah yeah and oftentimes see it happen within a matter of an hour or so\nTo speak to that person out there as we've just got a couple of minutes left here on our leadership is work with Dr Megan ...\nSpeak to the the the father or mother or whether it's for themselves have got kids you know maybe finances are a little bit of an issue how do they address at him and what should they be thinking about when they begin to look for\nA they finally decide you're probably better do something about this either because it's really getting better it's not quite there but I Know it's going to get there how do you talk to someone who's considering\nYou know a new to the store go to the dentist for the first time in a long time\nI always say come visit come visit it doesn't even have to be for a dental that's it you know come into the office meat myself meet the staff or like I said we have a great team I'm just come and see is this\nA place that you're comfortable and I find that most patients are you know we ... we all take the time to\nReally get to know those patients develop those one on one relationships with them and it just makes every procedure every visit that they that they have much more comfortable um as far as parents you know young kids starting early if you can\nAs the new recommendations are\nBy the first tooth or the first birthday actually go visit the dentist day if you start early it's that much easier down the line\nEven if it's even if it is already down the line come visit us um I Love meeting new people I Want to

is mark held Herman from trinity jewelers on this here leadership is burg mark welcome to Pittsburgh\nWell thank you for having me here I'm very excited this is gonna be a lot of fun\nI've been talking to your account manager or GM saying I Want to get mark in for a leadership in Britain here we finally done [laughter] I Know you're busy yeah\nFoul absolutely but now I'm In a place I'd rather be this is one well\nWe've had a relationship with you for a long time in our general manager Tom has even longer than that and we're just thrilled to have you just want to kind of find out a little bit more about you your family your business and talk a little bit about a leadership and that type of thing so I Know you are a Family Guy so this is a family station why don't we start right there tell us about your family\nCan do that well you know actually backing up a little bit family lives it's as if we're celebrating Twenty years with word I found this year I realized that it all started in Nineteen Ninety eight some are family yeah so we're a family show we're wasting I may well in the whole thing is I Do feel that way of everybody here so that's that's a lot of fun but\nFor me or my wife and I just celebrated our twenty fifth wedding anniversary this pounds heavier and so that was that was pretty cool milestone to reach and um and we have triplets of all things we have two girls and boys are now Twenty one so nobody has to panic too much and we're [laughter]\nWe're you know we're into the college stage now but I Know more high chairs or a car seats or anything like that\nWe can only do one ... just on that [laughter] how to handle with yeah actually I was a crazy time\nThat's great All right and then now from the business standpoint have they been involved with you at all from that or is that just kind of been more you\nWell you know with the family business is always a matter that everybody's involved in one way or another with her even down to helping worshipping different things like that so yeah they've every one of them have participated with it\nUm we have I'm pursuing you know other things as far as college goes at this point but that doesn't mean that ah there isn't a future for you know a couple of them there to come on into the business which would be fun\nI can be my dad was a dentist for like forty some years the Norman Rockwell Dennis the oldest in for about a week or two I thought about it when I was a kid maybe in fourth grade and it didn't last much longer than that [laughter] he loved it when he was very good at it so yeah you gotta gotta still let the kids do uh do their thing and figure out what got to call them in their life\nExactly I you know for me you know from a business standpoint it's so important to love your job you know I I see so many people that are locked into careers or jobs that they just don't enjoy and yeah and um you know it's kind of sad because it's so she'll be something where you go\nAnd you just are thrilled each day to show up at work which is the case for me with the jewelry business so\nIt was important to me that they you know make sure of what they want to do you do not take the easy route the family business I think can be easy if failsafe that hey you know it works I can slip right in there but uh I think it's important to really find out what what drives you and what makes you happy\nAnd on the other side of the coin I think there's some folks that get roped into the family business that\nDon't really want to have anything to do it right exactly I I see that a lot as well it sounds like you've\nGot a good perspective on it we're here with leadership Pittsburgh I'm your host Mike Howard we're with mark held Herman from trinity George work let's take a quick break
