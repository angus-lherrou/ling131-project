gentlemen he's been a never Trump or from day one and of course I've got to try to correct them and everybody laughed but I'm always afraid that in a room full of six hundred people fifty or more thinks he's telling the truth\n[laughter] so I always have to correct you know you you're the one who actually wavered on President Trump in the beginning you're the one who had to come along you're the one we had to win over\nAnd for some they still have it what we haven't won them over rather they still haven't seen the light they still haven't recognized the extraordinary accomplishments of the first twenty months got there to greet pieces I have in front of me one by Fred Barnes over Weekly Standard and the other by John Dempsey\nAbout how Trump has read the Republican Party from the media I Want to start with a few I Want to start with the red Orange Beach over some facts\n'cause I like to argue with knowledge I Want to make sure that his you vote as you encourage your neighbors to vote as you get ready to go to the polls don't believe the lie that somehow rocked Obama\nSets the groundwork for this tremendous economy that we're enjoying right now read Barnes says in his column ... is a must read we're gonna posted it Mike online dot com if you want to read it read Barnes writes rock Obama is a proud man\nAnd it was somewhat in Deering when he too to claim he had created the ground on which Trump's economy was growing the media sided with Obama no surprise\nTrump counter punch no surprise there either if the Democrats that won the election of twenty sixteen Trump said GDP which was about one percent and going down would have been minus four percent instead of up four point two percent Trump tweeted\nHe's referring to ... percent he's referring to the growth rate but the second quarter of twenty Eighteen\nI opened up our beautiful economic engine with regulation in tax cuts are system was choking and would have been made worse still plenty to do read Barnes writes the Weekly Standard Donald Trump is correct\nAbout the condition of the economy and late twenties sixteen it was weakening the shift in economic policy to the right change the direction of growth\nFrom down to match what tax cuts deliver\nAnd tax hikes do not usually Fred Barnes writes about Obama and this lie that Obama is the reason for today's economy and again it spread puts it Obama's proud man\nIt's kind of in theory that he had such a head makes such a silly plane here are some facts of Obama's successor Trump and the Republican Congress reverse Obama's policies\nThe fact is Obama had to struggle so hard to spur the economy and allow it to grow more than two percent a year that was the high watermark the bronco bomb in the last quarter of Obama's presidency growth pitch swept to one point five percent\nIt's obvious what Obama's problem was you had the wrong policies watch of wrong publishing from the day Trump was elected\nWe've had a more real best robust economy\nNearly four million jobs have been at it for a million jobs unemployment is up to the lowest points in nearly a half century Fred Barnes says let's compare what Obama did with Trump\nWhat he's doing Obama raised taxes Trump cut that Obama was a regulatory sell it Trump is passionate about deregulation Obama's clean Power Plan killed the coal industry Trump is reviving\nObama downgraded the role of entrepreneur and free markets in boosting the economy and lauded the wonderful things government does\nObama's biggest biggest breakthrough as we know was the Affordable CARE Act a big step toward a single payer government run health care system Trump got rid of the individual mandate that forced everyone to buy expensive insurance or be fine a big step toward a return to free markets in health care\nBill the entire Obama economic agenda was systematically reverse says economics writers even more\nHis new book Trump ... we've got to get even more in Arthur Laffer labs on the show one of these days presidents loved to tell their retreat in Trump's case\nA White House report issued recently used it as a British version had produced two hundred and eighty nine accomplishments in twenty months we all know Trump exaggerates and brags read Barnes rights but many of the economic gains will impressive\nEspecially the fact the job openings out numbered job seekers for the first time on record being liberal himself Obama relied on liberal economists they let him astray\nAs they did president John Kennedy in the Nineteen sixties they favored higher taxes to they favored increase spending\nThose policies created an economic downturn when Kennedy was smarter than Obama\nSays Brett he finally turned to his Republican treasury secretary she'd Douglas doing who recommended tax cuts JFK grabbed on to them and the result was an economic boom the roaring sixty Reagan's advisors persuaded him the tax cuts championed by Jack Kemp\nWould do far more for the economy the spending cuts\nThey even use JFK's as an example the sweeping tax cuts of Nineteen eighty one brought about years of strong growth known as the Reagan Revolution Trump didn't need to be convinced obviously he and Republicans led by Paul Ryan believed it was time for deep cuts in the corporate tax rate the Obamas school of economists\nAnd commentators embarrassed by Mimi results argued that economic growth was stuck perhaps permanently at two percent annually\nThat met Obama was doing the best any president could do certainly far better the Trump would have done right\nAll kinds of dire predictions Washington Post that Trump could destroy the world economy Jason firemen chairman of Obama's council of economic advisors said Trump's budget assumes three percent annual growth that is extremely unlikely\nWell I'm worried I don't think I get worried because like they're going to be a lot it killed there and families and yeah I'm afraid of like\nThe whole fat it rain out saying with the military there and everywhere I live in a list\nYeah you really have all this thing yeah yeah I I don't I think we're in a different time though Laura I really believe okay
