convicted of second degree murder and sixteen counts of aggravated battery with a firearm in the death of look Kwan McDonalds he is the uh\nThe teenager\nWho was carrying a knife but the video showed the dash cam video showed he was very short of away from the officers when he was shot\nDead the jurors found\nOfficer Van Dyke guilty\nAnd the jurors said they just didn't by the defense of the officer that it was they wanted him to trust his memory not really the dashboard camera video to know what really happened\n[noise] um you know one of the things that strikes me about this a guilty verdict when there is cooperation via a dash cam video or body cam video\nOften a police officer who was guilty of a terrible terrible crime and this was this was a bad shooting this was not he was not defending his life you can see from the video the kid was walking he was high on apparently PCP he was walking away from the officers he had a knife in his hand but they shot him\nOr officer Van Dyke shot him sixteen times\nUm when it happens and there's cooperation officer police officers are always held accountable for their ears accountability and there are consequences for a police officer\nMaking a mistake guess what\nHappens all the time the officer in South Carolina who shot the guy in the back remember that the the gentleman who was fleeing because of a a traffic stop and the guy just stood there and raised a shot him a bunch of times in the back and killed him a kid caught that on tape\nIt was corroborated and now that guys riding in jail officer Jason Van Dyke is going to go to jail for a long time was convicted of second degree murder this happens all the time in America when there is proof an officer\nIs held accountable showed the narrative of the black of the of the protesters and the the football the NFL Miller's that officers always get away with shooting unarmed black man and it's open season I thought\nJust not true and there are times I Am sure when officers try to protect themselves and they do immoral and the illegal things to try to save their own Fannie\nBut frankly\nThe ... should I say breathed a sigh of relief an officer Van Dyke was convicted on friday um this kid and I don't know how it would have\nPlayed out and as I shared with your the video from a week ago when a guy with a knife was lunging at a manager or a security guard rather in a Burger King and midtown Manhattan right across from the Port Authority and I thought you know what if there was a police officer there and this guy was lunging at a cop the way he loves to this security guard right in front of me as I was trying to eat my Walker and\nReading my papers in peace\nThey would have had to shoot this guy\nThat was not the case with a\nWith a look one McDonald an officer Jason Van Dyke\nAnd so at the end of the day the jury seen I think the jury got it right\nAlways hurts when an officer is convicted which you know what there\nHas to be accountability and
