Nineteen Seventy eight Mike Gallagher ... voice of clarity from millions of America goes oh\nWas it was hard even if\nWe are fortunate enough to win back the house and yours is boxing is starting\nTo show owned by the most famous man on the planet\nEven great Mike and I appreciate it very much notice I walked over here very quickly\nNow from the relief factor dot com studio Mike\n[noise] I Want to start the\nHour giving you a reason to smile I saw funny article last night the pointed out that for the thousands of Trump haters who contributed\nTo porn star Stormy Daniels legal Defense Fund to help her with her defamation lawsuit against President Trump you realize a federal district court judge in California ordered Stormy Daniels toupee\nPresident Trump is legal fees\nWhich means that the more than Fifteen thousand people who donated around six hundred thousand dollars to Stormy Daniels legal Defense Fund\nWill likely be responsible for ... paying the president directly as his court costs\nI mean it just it never dawned on them that this could happen it's like it began to shorted the dawn on these boats who tried to uh pay for Stormy Daniels lawsuit they're going to wind up having to their money's going to go directly to President Trump\nSo that's a that's a reason this vile as we start you out I've got a stack of stories right now though about\nThe Democrat train wreck\nThere are so many things that are going wrong with the Democrat Party and as we are less than three weeks away from the mid term election the timing is very interesting because the news media can't can't can't\nYou know they they cannot prevent themselves from from reporting on these\nThese stories there's a lot of news breaking stories Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota you know Kevin Cramer is threatening her ... threatening her seat representative Kevin Cramer is the challenger Heidi Heitkamp is involved in an incredible dramatic scandal\nShe called her campaigns newspaper ad a horrible mistake after finding out\nThat the Heidi Heitkamp other remember this was the senator who was going to the Democrat who's going across the aisle and vote yes for judge Kavanaugh she said until she turned the sound off and saw the video of his angry cheerful\nTestimony and then she decided to vote no well she's got even bigger problems than that if you can believe it or not\nThe campaign incorrectly identify sexual abuse victims who did not want to be identified\nAnd one of those victims is now in fear for her life because she is terrified that her attacker is now going to come after her because she has been exposed\nHeidi Heitkamp is going to lose in North Dakota she's a big trouble she apologized for the ad\nYou should we recently discovered that several of the women's names who were provided to wash did I did not authorized their names to be shared we're we're not sure or we're not survivors of abuse\nEven I deeply regret this mistake we are in the process of issuing a retraction personally apologized to each of the people impacted by this and taking the necessary steps to ensure there's never happens again\nShe told a local radio host in North Dakota this is a very flagrant error and I own it couldn't have come at a worse time for for Heidi Heitkamp\nKevin Cramer is gonna win that battle is Kevin Cramer is going to be the next senator in North Dakota how 'bout more bad news or liberals and Democrats the liberal progressive activist\nGroup American bridge twenty first century announced last night they fired one of their operatives a day after he was arrested

Mexico border\nThreatening to come across the border the president is threatening to send the military\nTo the southern border if this happens\nPresident I mean the Senator Cruz and bail Rourke had a
