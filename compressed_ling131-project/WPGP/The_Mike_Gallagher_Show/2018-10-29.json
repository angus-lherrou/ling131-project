latest rash must have been reports daily presidential tracking poll for today shows the fifty percent of likely us voters approve the president's job performance\nAs we get near to the mid term election the president's approval rating keeps claiming\n\nPresident Brock Obama had a an approval rating on forty four percent on October twenty ninth two thousand and ten\nThat was of course right before a week before his party the Democrats suffered a huge losses in the twenty ten mid term elections this bodes very well for us\nThis ... very well for Republicans and Americans who want the president's agenda to succeed\nThe Democrats want to stop his agenda and they are doing some of the most unimaginable things to try to do so I might give you an example there's a big story a breaking story with the thousands of migrants illegals hate calling the migrants because it sounds so warm and fuzzy doesn't it\nIllegals who were marching towards the southern part border thousands and thousands of\nThe president is warning them you better you're better stop you better turnaround in fact the president even set a tweak\nJust moments ago that says many gang members and some very bad people are mixed into the caravan heading to our southern border please go back\nYou will not be admitted into the United states unless you go through the legal process this is an invasion of our country and our military is waiting for you well that's true the Pentagon\nAccording to a U.S official today will deploy up to five thousand active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border about Twenty one hundred National Guard troops are already fanned out across the border\nAccording to a department of homeland security official who spoke to USA Today on the condition of anonymity there will be five thousand active duty troops more added to the board\nWe don't have a country if we don't have a border without a border\nThere is no United States of America that's just a fact\nNormal Americans understand that I was on stage Saturday with a great courage slicker colonel colonel slicker who wrote a great book about the militant normal you need to get it and courage says it over and over again talks about normal ... having to be in charge\nNormal Americans understand without a border there is no country\nAnd normal Americans are appreciating the president saying I got to send the terms to the border to keep these thousands of illegals who are in this organized caravan from crossing the border and editor in our country illegally turned back\nYou know the Mexico offered them asylum\nThe Mexican government said we will give you a health care we will help you we will we will houses you we will clean clothes you we will help you know we don't want Mexico we want to get into the United states that's the land of opportunity\n\nWithout a border we don't have a country now here's how desperate the left itch Joe Scarborough was one of the worst of the worst he's married to this Mika who is the far left\nAnchor on MSNBC or they're married or I guess they got married to they're going to get married I think they're engaged and the two of them hate the president\nAnd they take him on viciously listening to what Joe ... I Know there's going to make you crazy but I have to play it for Scarborough has figured out a way to tie it all together\nThe synagogue massacre which Americans mourn collectively the invasion of the the migrant caravan\nAnd Trump\nNow you brace yourself when you hear Joe Scarborough and who he blamed\nFor this horrific horrific massacre at the tree of life to the dog in Pittsburgh on Saturday this is audio and video from MSNBC and gravy\nPeople on Fox News at talk about the caravan as if this is a big election issue now it's all I Know there were a thousand miles away [noise] know that the last caravan that they were ... frenzy about actually only brought fourteen or by the end of the care of and they know it's ... yeah [noise]\nAnd there are spreading hatred or across America\nOr and and at the end of the day may ... again inspiring people like miss Pittsburgh mass murder\nCan you ... slip those words sink in this vile disgraceful excuse of a TV commentator blames Fox News and the president\nFor the massacre as if somehow the massacre at the synagogue had something to do with this thousands of illegals who were marching towards our board\nDid you hear Joe Scarborough say it's a lie that this is an election issue oh it's an election issue dummy it's definitely an election issue you may not like that it's an election issue you may prefer that people didn't pay attention\nTo these thousands of migrants marching towards the border but it's most definitely an election issue you saying its ally doesn't make it so\nDespicable and Americans are paying attention all this crap it's happening a week before the most important mid term election of our lifetime\nIf you want to see the left lose its mind complex collective mind you wait and see what happens Tuesday night\nI like her chances [noise] we may wake up Wednesday with the headache we may be disappointed we may be a weed baby sad but you know what\nThere is a very good chance the Republicans are going to win on Tuesday night because you have the the the power to be able to deal with this you have the opportunity\nTo keep the grown ups in charge in Washington DC you have a chance to beat back the Joe Scarborough\nAnd the ... and the shepherd Smith send the folks in the media\nThe the CNNs and the NBC ABC CBS the Washington\nPost Washington Post headline should this headline\nDon't compared Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler he belittles Hitler that's an actual headline in the Washington Post\nAn article about how well really trumps from obviously worse than Adolf Hitler [noise]\nAnd they want to
