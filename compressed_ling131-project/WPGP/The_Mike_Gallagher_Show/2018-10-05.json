do you need to at least the private jet\nGary Go I donate I donate please I we we got listeners joking that the president said Airforce one bring everybody to Washington you don't want to let them all up have a big party well listen we're we're having a party philosophically about the jobs numbers in and of course job creators\nNetwork has been such an integral part\nOf the tax cuts the good news today the ... announced the U.S jobless rate dropped a three point seven percent is it that's the lowest it's been nearly fifty years Elaine\nSuch great news you guys have got to be bouncing off the walls with the job that the job creators network has played with the these tax cuts in with this great news about jobs jobs jobs in America\nFor like a real winters here are that thirty million small business owners that continue to thrive under the economy and the progress but how is that the administration earlier this week I had an op ed on real clear politics\nWhich actually get in on how women are flourishing under the ... and we're seeing more women start businesses and re enter the workforce a new ad by with a mom you know historically childcare has has acted as a barrier for women and a look the workforce and entrepreneurship\nAnd um another a benefit of the tax\nCuts in jobs that you know not only have we reduce tax rates across the board for everyone\nBut we also doubled the child tax credit and that's where the deficit and that's an absolute reduction off your tax bill right and then for those who are at the lower end of the income spectrum\nThere's a fourteen hundred dollar refundable tax credits that natural payout for ... like that and and in many cases that can help offset a lot of your childcare costs on that's a huge benefit\nIt is indeed and and job creators network has been in the in the front ... on the front lines are so many of these important issues I Know that you guys have put on your radar Amazon\nAnd and they're lobbying for a higher minimum wage and seen some of these protests around the country and of course there's a real simple formula that's happening in ... for example in the service industry\nMcDonald's fast food they're they're being confronted with the demand for a higher minimum wage\nMcDonald says you know what were we that that we're not going to make a profit were business to make a profit so you know we'll do find will replace all of these human beings with kiosks and we're seeing this all across the board where companies have to wisely invested in technology\nAnd and you know robots an automated systems and kiosks\nBecause when you're demanding Fifteen Eighteen twenty bucks an hour it doesn't work dealing\nA lake and that is true let me start by saying and I think any company that has the right to pay their employees whatever they want and I applaud Amazon for wanting to pay their employees more money\nFrom where I draw the line is ... but they said that they want to um help increase it and work with legislators and lobby then to increase the federal minimum wage um this what hurt many of our thirty million small businesses out there and certainly\nSeen the impact of that in cities like Washington state in Seattle we own people not only hours and and money that we think businesses closed their doors a you know they just don't have the resources that that kind of way to increase right\nYou're right and I'm Glad you guys are are are ... you're on the case I Love what you're doing let's keep fighting going to tax cuts worked dot com or whenever you listen to to go to tax cuts

guess what boom it's over for judge Kavanaugh\nSo keep it right here on the Mike Gallagher show because you're not going to miss one word of any of this uh\nAnd uh I ...\nI I don't even know where to start you want to start with Susan Collins\nSusan Collins of Maine is been has been viewed as\nThe crucial vote on this well we're going to know today how she's voting on judge Kavanaugh beyond cloture\nDoes this for tomorrow's vote she's announcing today three PM eastern in a speech on the Senate floor how she's going to vote if she is up or down so will know that\nToday if she doesn't know that of course could embolden Lisa Murkowski of Alaska to be you know who knows what Jeff Flake is going to do and this nomination could be derailed\nShe's a yes this could this could portend\nVery favorably this could be a good day so we're not going to know don't believe anybody who protects what's gonna happen\nWe will know today are now people are calling whether we should use air force one I don't want to talk about Airforce one used for senator dangerous wedding here's what he said I think we've got the video queued up for you\nHere's what senator day and said last night with Jan and

a no vote the Republican from Colorado why says the media because after all Colorado was very anti Trump and he's got to get reelected in twenty twenty garbage nonsense he says he's a yes\nVote he's I don't think he's changed his mind but then again any of them good changed your mind we might be surprised\nIn a not a good way maybe we'll you'd be surprised at a at a very positive way meanwhile

[noise]\nAll right so is there a little bit of history being made and you hear in the eyes and you're hearing the nays are the nose and uh I don't want to kind of a drag that out for you because uh what what matters is what they're going to do and were reported it to you but here are the yeses Jeff Flake is he yes this is a cloture vote part one\nThe second part would be tomorrow for the full Senate vote on the confirmation of judge Brett Kavanaugh flake as he asked Collins is the gas and mansion here's a yes which is a big surprise today are\nWell again I I'm ... and I was speculating do shows how good I Am with productions that Heidi Heidi Heitkamp could be a no I mean yes rather because of Heidi Heitkamp votes no she's going to lose her Senate seat in North Dakota she did announce yesterday\nThat she's a no vote which means she's absolutely going to be the former senator from North Dakota she's out\nUm but there you go three of the four key senators voting yes let's get your reaction to all of this one eight hundred six five five Mike\nEight hundred six five five six four or five three great to have you here in the relief factor dot com studios as we are uh watching history unfold right before our very eyes Terry Europe hey Jared welcome aboard what do you think\nLike a guy from New Jersey and I I think a little more of a historical view this short compared to the situation in the civil war thank God the only difference or not killing anybody yet\nNot yet why don't you want to get one of them tried on a baseball field and Virginia remember\nYes absolutely but the reality is that Republicans Republican if they don't understand when you're an hour and you don't lose it and they were very well they don't you\nKnow there's this idea of a civil war is very real to millions and millions of Americans and that's fair um I've talked about this for years and I remember being on the stage of ... of a few months ago with a colleague who sort of rolled his eyes at the at the idea that we are in a cultural war\nWe learn a war we're in a war for our nation shoals ... we're in a battle over what\nHow we want our country to be what we want represented in this country what ... what are what our standards our values our laws are going to be this is a very big presumption here of guilt ... until you can prove you're innocent\nWe have turned American um standards and values and mores honest here by the by the activism or the left and it's frightening you know ... and\nI Am so I I was reading about Ellen DeGeneres announcing this week that she was a sexual assault survivor\nAnd you know that breaks my heart I think she I think she was a a ... if I saw it correctly she was Fifteen and that's horrifying that that helped define it shaped her that trauma that Robin of innocence\nAnd and everybody is pathetic and and an agonizing over such a horrible crime against an innocent defenseless child\nAnd we have had a robust conversation about\nWomen in the workplace being being abused and and treated terribly by powerful men\nBut then this me to thing has extended into the cabinet process where allegations have been made from high school and early college that haven't been able to be corroborate and in this conversation about cabinet I keep hearing the left\nUsed that term you get to speak my troops this is my troops\nAnd honestly at last I'd love to find a caller who can help maybe somebody on the left and I don't mind I Would love to hear from you actually to explain to me what my truth means because my truth may not be the truth\nAnd it seems very clear to me\nThat the pursuit should be up to ... and I\nI don't really understand that we can clear aligned Lance and see if we can get a caller who can help explain to me what it means\nWhen when when some of these um advocates and activists and voices say that Christine Blasey Ford gets to tell her truth truth this is my troops this is her truth or his troops\nWill ... is that is that kind of a a subtle acknowledgement\nThat it may not be the truth\nWhat if Christine Blasey Ford believes with all of her heart the Brett Kavanaugh\nDid it but he didn't I'm just going through a hypothetical process what if\nWhat if it was another boy\nWhat if it was a memory that she has wrong in the way she is recounting this some thirty six years later does that mean you can you can defend a truth that isn't the truth in other words\nIt does hurt truth supersede the truth I\nThink about this was it applies to Brett Kavanaugh if that's the case\nThen a false fluids stands a man has ruined a family is destroyed and reputation is shattered because her truth isn't the truth hypothetically Tim says you can explain it to me how you doing Jim welcome to the gallery show\nThat you uh it it comes from the education system and the philosophy behind that education system and they operate on the philosophical axiom that perception\nIs reality so your your perception of what happened is your reality which you and I know it's not true right as if somebody believes pillow\nOr or seems a pillow as wrong ticket and after Iraq yeah they they quickly learned that perception is not really\nThat that's an interesting way of looking at it so that that but maybe you're right maybe the belief is your perception is reality therefore that stands\nAnd frankly to most Americans that's wrong that's not a normal logical understandable process freaking now on the Mike Gallagher show\nAll right the Senate has voted fifty one to forty nine to advance the Kavanaugh's nomination it was a fifty one to forty nine vote and shockingly to some Lisa Murkowski\nVoted no it was believed at leisure Murkowski could be this was again considered one of the big swing votes one of the undecideds she voted no which of course signal she's going to be a no vote tomorrow in the fall confirmation process\nHowever senators lake Collins and mansion Joe mansion from West Virginia\nCame through and voted yes so you got a fifty one to forty nine vote if you were to lose some how in the next twenty four hours any of those three flake Collins or mentioned say one so you lost one of them let's say\nI don't know Susan Collins decides to join Lisa Murkowski in voting no\nYou still have ... the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh because Mike Pence as the president of the Senate breaks the breaks the tie he cash the deciding vote and uh you would win by one on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh Michelle is reacting to Lisa Murkowski's vote how you doing the show\nFamily Guy 'cause like I was actually turn your radio down for me five before the hour here against fifty one to forty nine the cloture vote go ahead and Michelle\nI check my like Herman as as you know I I left a message on my couch case a cell phone to their vote for that capping off and I um I haven't actually south but I just find it interesting that seat with ... with all these protesters are sexually\nAbused women are the ... to ... and not hear another side of the story she stressed out and I guess being completely brainwashed by all of that which I feel like that's how she voted today I'm really disgusted by it\nIt's a shame it's a real shame and I and I believe again just like Heidi Heitkamp is going to be the former senator from North Dakota Lisa Murkowski is now going to be the former senator from it from a from Alaska she betrayed her voters\nAnd she said no but thankfully we've got enough yes vote so I think we're going to get them across the finish line

cloture vote to advance the Kavanaugh's nomination the cloture vote past fifty one to forty nine\nNow the clock sharks towards this weekend's confirmation if mansion flake and Collins ... with their yes votes and that's not a foregone conclusion\nIt's probable but it is not sure if they do that's the final vote on the confirmation and Brett Kavanaugh will start hearing cases from the bench of the
