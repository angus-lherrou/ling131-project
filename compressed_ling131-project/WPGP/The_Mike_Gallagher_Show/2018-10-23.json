the most famous man on a plan\nAnd you've been great Mike and I appreciate it very much you notice I walked over here very\nQuickly now from the relief factor dot com studio Mike\n[noise] I Know this is\nA little peculiar but I always look for signs for their shelters are for just a midterm election coming along I always looked for some sign\nWent through this twenty sixteen and I remember very distinctly what happened I was looking for a sign that\nTrump was going to win\nAnd it was a if you remember no one gave him a chance I mean it was really silly how what was it Ninety two percent was the likelihood that Hillary was going to win a court in New York Times and I kept looking for a sign I kept saying something's going to come along right before the election but it's going to give me\nHope that he's got a chance of winning the other words if somebody's going to know something that we don't know and if you listen to my show in twenty six team you remember what it was there was a little blurb and the New York post\nReported that Hillary Clinton who was going to have her big victory celebration at the Javits convention center because if it's big glass ceiling you know a woman breaking through the glass ceiling and be elected president of the United states and all of that\nShe had a fireworks display plant they were going to shoot off fireworks along the Hudson River after she claimed her inevitable victory and a couple of days before the election there was a little blurb for the New York post\nThat\nExplains that the Hillary campaign had quietly\nPulled the permits for the fireworks display and cancelled the fireworks display and I read that too you are there I remember saying to you I think this is a sign I'm telling you this is a good sign\nThey know something they know how silly it is to order hundreds of thousands of dollars maybe millions of dollars worth of fireworks and she could lose\n\nThe Hillary campaign know knew she could lose and of course we all know she did here's my little fireworks story two weeks before the midterm election President Trump's approval rating according to a brand new NBC Wall Street Journal poll is out\nIt's the highest level\nThat he's ever had in this poll is forty seven percent and there is a very intriguing aspect to that number President Trump's approval rating before the midterm elections\nIs now officially at a higher level then former President Obama's was ahead of his twenty ten mid term elections in other words\nPresident Trump is now more popular according to a new NBC Wall Street Journal poll that all the rock Obama was at the exact same time of both of their president Xi's\nLet that sink in let that sink in\nI'm going to do something very similar to twenty six gene because frankly there's a lot of objects that are the same there's a lot of the same things at stake this is a crucial election\nWe must hold the house we must hold the Senate and as we see this onslaught of thousands and thousands of migrants\nCrashing through border fences and entering Mexico and threatening to invade the United states as we see this happening unfolding before our very eyes\nI like our chances as we somehow saw Brett Kavanaugh I'd get confirmed\nI like our chances as we see people yelling at a leader McConnell in a restaurant in lieu of all a guy screaming at him and disrupting his meal\nI like our chances as the media goes all in for the Democrats the way they always do\nBig race in Texas Beto O'Rourke and Ted Cruz you got to hear this ABC reporter\nHere's an ABC reporter this isn't an opinion host this isn't a pundit this is a reporter for ABC\nYou got to hear this the reporters name is Paula Ferris\nAnd she's marching around covering beta or work in the final couple of weeks before the election on November the six he of course is trying to unseat Ted Cruz he's the Democrat from El Paso sometimes he rides on a skateboard and this campaign appearance quite an interesting character\nListen to this exchange this is audio cutting number eight this ABC reporter Paula Ferris listen to what she calls beta or work again please remember\nShe's a report a news report\nYou can without interruption and come up that much I Love into thinking well you know there's so many\nThree term congressman from El Paso has certainly captured the entire nation continued wow\nYou're a rock

nickname for Robert Francis O'Rourke\nLike calling me Miguel or me you know sure oh [laughter] [noise]\nI had a sure oh by the way it universal studios Florida yesterday wasn't very good you got to be sugary ah and you wonder why I'm fifty pounds overweight anyway I feel good I liked the chances I like this poll number a lot it's not been widely reported the hill writes about it\nThey talk about the fact that this is a higher approval than than Iraq Obama habit Trump is more popular than let's say give for just a moment if you believe that NBC Wall Street Journal\nPoll\nYou wouldn't believe it from the media coverage but let that sink in that we are now witness gene how president more popular at this stage of his presidency then but rock Obama\nYou'd never get that from ABC NBC CBS you'd never take that you'd never get that take away from what is throated President Trump morning noon and night every hour of every day you would never ever\nHave that take away but it's true it's true

something wrong with calling yourself a nationalist believing in the sovereignty of America\nAccepting the exceptionalism of this country really I what what's the problem with nationalism or ... or call yourself a nationalist Doug we'll start with you how you doing Doug\nHey doing really well Mike places do thank you\nWant her to come up come at this from a little direct little different directions from one of the applications are the results that will happen if the if Trump in America starts poking things on their own interests it'll be seen and the rest of the world\nIn a positive way and for instance my wife and I support or an orphanage in Kenya ends missionaries in Kenya for one of the things they've got to do is focused on their own interests as well\nAnd what global there's a law allows them to do is say hey we can put your interest aside because we're not going to allow cars to come in here we're going to because of global warming up big global ... we're not going to let him instead of focusing on our own people were just going to take this\nMoney that we meet some carbon emission standards and it just it just under cuts the people developing for themselves\nYeah it's a good or a little bit and it's a it's a thoughtful response I mean I Want to go a little bit more to the core of accusing somebody who calls him or herself a nationalist\nA racist or an anti Semite Doug do you think Don Lemon really believes that forest adjusted attempt to to to attack\nAnd and tear down the president at any expense [noise]\nOh yeah I mean absolutely it tempted tearing down because he doesn't realize the application of what are you saying we're working it out and let your dog lemon\nYeah right and it just trying to take us away from some are focusing on America's needs and focusing on other people's needs exactly\nI mean you and and you look at what Germany therefore not focusing on their own people's needs they're focusing on Greece's needs and refugees needs and they're not focusing on their own people\nWell what about I mean what about our military does it do the men and women of the Army Navy air force Marines are they a bunch of national is because they they fight for a defend the United states they're not fighting for Belgium\nThey're not worried about France or they nationalist she died in ... and again very very thoughtful reaction to what he went to the very thoughtless or remarks by Don Lemon he doesn't believe that there's no way that a guy on national television I don't care how biased she is\nBelieves that if you say you're a nationalist you must be a racist\nIt's an attempt you know the old drill the left uses ... you're a racist it's a little bit like you know wait what did you stop beating your wife\nOh you're a racist that is a racist thing to say\nThat's got anti Semitic overtones you know the right the Proud Boys all these different groups they they ... they they gravitate to white nationalism white national that's what John lemons do it he's completely nationalism or be the nationalist with white nationalism\nAnd then before you know what you're into the all right you're into that white supremacy you're you're then you then you then you're more than the neo Nazis skinheads it's a game he place\nIt's a game desperate people play with her out of ideas\nAnd doesn't lemons out of ideas he's got nothing\nThese guys have nothing left and they see a common if you're just joining us\nThere is some big big news employing\nThere is a big news coming out of the Washington Post Dan Balz who

I Wish to have a hard time that word\nAnd by sticking their collective heads and this and\nThe the morning is referring to the poll that came out this week the show's Trump at a forty seven percent approval rating according to the NBC Wall Street Journal poll forty seven percent\nObama was at forty five percent at the same exact stage of his presidency right before the midterms of twenty ten so Trump is according to the NBC\nMore popular than Obama was at this time in Obama's presidency\nHow can this be happening they will whale uncontrollably writes Piers Morgan what the Blake is wrong with people who like him they will how do each other's kale salads this is the end of planet earth they will sob in their normal understated manner\nAll of which will be music to the ears of Trump a man who absolutely rebels and liberal hysteria because he knows it works for him there's this new poll proves the more Trump bashing scream abuse at at about him the boring fires up his base and indeed the ...\nFires up Trump himself after all at its heart the president's street fighting New Yorker who loves a good scrap\nAnd into each time writes Morgan he may deliver the biggest knockout punch of his presidency until recently it was widely assumed the Republicans would lose control the house in the mid term elections\nIt was being depicted as a damning referendum on Trump and historically most presidents like Obama take a whack in the midterms\nBut now he says I'm not so sure in fact I'd say there's a very good chance the Republicans will hang on to the house as well as the Senate and Trump will move on empowered emboldened to what could very well be an even bigger within twenty twenty why is this happening he says\nWell first the U.S mainstream media has become the boy who cried wolf their constant collective outrage over every tiny thing Trump says tweets or does much of a driven by commercial self interest has had the inevitable effective diluting the impact\nOf that outrage barely a week goes by without some supposedly new Trump crisis fueling wall to wall cable news coverage and dire predictions of impeachment or even jail time for Trump yeah within a few days\nEach administrator ... threatening scandal quote unquote dissolves into a giant nothing burger\nHe says I look at Democrats today and I see a party this learn absolutely nothing about how to beat Donald Trump and I see a president who's growing stronger by the day Trump has become a political Godzilla crushing everyone who dares challenge him and bulldoze his way through an agenda that is beginning to pay real dividends then it goes on to list all the accomplishments\nThe tax cuts the regulations the economy North Korea trade war with China Trans Pacific port all the things and he's clamp down hard on illegal immigration\nPiers Morgan says as I write this a caravan of thousands of Central American migrants most of them from Honduras is moving toward the southern border\nThey intend to try to enter the U.S illegally it's hard to think of a more powerful image to vindicate Trump's much criticized demand for a new wall isn't it\nAs he tweeted full efforts are being made to stop the onslaught of illegal aliens from crossing our southern border the caravans or a disgrace to the Democratic party changed the immigration laws\nNow Morgan says he's the president is beginning to really enjoy himself he's exuding an Arab someone who's worked out how Washington works or rather doesn't and how to play the broken highly partisan system to his advantage\nLove him or load him Piers Morgan writes in this terrific piece\nThere is no desire to deny that he's winning once again I can only advise the Democrats to stop their ridiculously self defeating state of perpetual Trump outrage and work out how they're actually going to beat him because right now he writes Trump is kicking your butt\nAnd he does not use the word but he uses another four letter word it's a great piece by Piers Morgan I\nWanted to share it with you here on the Mike Gallagher show want to remind you about our friends with the job creators network you and I know that off year elections are about one thing

I don't want to not have a heart I don't want to\nTurn my back on somebody trying to flee an oppressive nation\nBut every video clip I see a reporter standing by the side of the road with all the
