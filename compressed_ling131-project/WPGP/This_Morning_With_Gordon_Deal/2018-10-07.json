the U.S Supreme Court\nOh I'm getting a full ... heading in that latter Eighteen year old ... wrote about ... [noise] you know give me a break and I think what really what we're getting into that really ... wearing a valid point to find what\nSavannah when Dr Ford came forward um with President Trump to described as a credible and compelling at testimony ah\nThought and um I ... I thought that that deserves a brief a weeklong further investigation to show the victims of sexual assault in this country that we take that seriously and it's worth investigating I Do think whether or not\nUm he testified truthfully to the committee is a question before us the FBI isn't going to reach conclusions they are going to deliver facts from further questioning and then when the Senate are going to have to make an ultimate decision I Am kind of on a Democrat I think it was important we work together to accomplish that yeah\nDefinitely I mean ... and ... they were already kind of how they can catch ... anyway and they voted against tax go ahead and fill out all night and that final oh wait a minute and I think that like what's wrong with that process by having any higher than line

Sunday Morning at eight thirty here on the answer for immediate health visit Cantillano P. G. H. dot com\nTo endorse job attack like\nA renaissance communications you wrote a book called on friend that finding true community in a disconnected culture use a man of faith a\nAt a smart smart guy and I'm very very excited about this\nLike your show how are you my friend\nBut like I'm doing just fine thanks\nGood good let's dive into the reason you wrote the book obviously social media is such an important part of so many people's lives and yet there's there are real perils to be kind of trapped in that social media bubble art peck\nYeah boy aren't there um you know we live and hyper connected world and we seem to be less connected to each other and I never before and so that's the kind of thing I always want to address as to what it is\nThat makes us the kind of people we become right where you know we find 'em just this lack of civility and I've been concerned about this for years about that the climate are personal and corporate civility you know and this this connectedness between families and friends so\nWriting the book was my attempt to address those issues and maybe offer some some really good thoughts and how we might get past that and analyze why we've got this far and things like that so it was fun to do\nWell and I think the reason I was drawn to your message and why I like the book so much the biggest takeaway for me\nIs is a band in Indiana and many of the Internet and and and connect you with people face to face I mean it's been tough for me over the decades that I've done this for a living at least even with a caller that I talked to on this show where there's a name and there's a person and there's a voice\nIt's not really anonymously and yet social media has elevated anonymity to new heights and\nI fear in bold ... really really awful awful online behavior Joe\nOh I don't think there's any doubt today I think we all see that and that's the problem with anonymity it fosters cowardice I think at times and I think it enables us to have a less than best of our nature come out where we can say what we want to say um\nAny kind of vitriol that we want to throw out there and have no accountability so part of the problem\nIs accountability right uh when I face to face with you by and less likely to be that kind of person that if I were disconnected hiding behind this fire wall of him personality as I call it so accountability is an important thing\nUm and I think the problem with the enemy and many of the Internet is that we only become truly him and when we intersect with each other when I see in your eyes your soul when I hear\nYour heartbeat when I hear the pop up belly up your dream I then become more connected with you and I am less likely to be I'm against you when I find out that we are\nReally more alike than we seem to be and so those are the kinds of things I think anonymity breeds on the Internet and leave the elevated it to an art form this ugliness and uh the problem is that many of our young people have a bigger relationship with their cell phones and with a a friend\nAnd that just continues to compound the problem because we're leaning the ladder against or wrong Raul to get to trick community and that's what I Try to deal with and the book\nJob of jak Lee is with us she wrote an friended finding proof community in a disconnected culture because you can get it to the Amazon we have a link posted it might go online dot com or\nTo make it easy for you to order this very very important book Joe what do you believe the takeaways are um in in this new world we're in and this this disconnected culture what should people be doing what should we take to try to to try to break this pattern\nI think first of all and what I tried it mentioned in the book is um [noise] what would you take a step back you know when I'm treasury agents are taught to ah you know what a counterfeit is sure\nThey do look for counterfeit they just get to know what the real thing looks like so well but\nThe counterfeit is so I guess I think because many people live in a counterfeit culture\nThey haven't seen the real thing so our job is to help the looming the real thing to them that will find\nA in their hearts something that says boy that so much better than what I'm doing now and so part of the issue is trying to help people understand what is the genius of what true community is about and the genius of our country which has found it on the knowledge that\nWe find in our motto which as one for many people are but some of them like Britain and all of our bills in coins and the reality of it that is when we understand that\nThe diversity that God has planned in the world while that's much better than just saying that scene uniformity and so\nUnderstanding that we are stronger when we respect our differences we are stronger when we engage with each other to find out what we're really like and so\nThat it's important that we have that can go back to engaging with

the front page of USA Today\nAnd be delivered a message that says every single one of us better be off our butts and voting on November the ... here's the headline above the full confirmation won't end Kavanaugh fight\nIf the Democrats gain power they could try impeachment says USA Today the battle over judge Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd his nomination scream court is unlikely to end with this confirmation vote says this article Democrats said they won't let go of the sexual assault\nAllegations against capital or accusations he lied about them and other issues before the strategies your committee even if he is elevated to the high court if they win control of one or both houses of Congress in November they'll be in a position\nTo continue the fight you need to be more motivation you need anything else wow what a time we're living in\nA what a dark dark cloud that hovers over this great country of ours and we are perhaps a few days away from this historic vote and we're going to see if the smear\nWorked or not\nYou know you probably hear in the news accounts of uh how a friend of Christian ... Ford rather an ex boyfriend I should say\nGave Senate investigators are sworn statement saying he witnessed her coach a friend on how to take a polygraph\nWhich contradicts her sworn testimony from last week a man who claims to be an ex boyfriend of Christians lousy Ford says she has personally witnessed for torture friend [noise] the trauma that allegation was revealed in a letter from Senator Chuck Grassley yesterday\nTo attorneys for Dr Christians lousy forward now there is an update on this now that friend who was allegedly coached by the ex boyfriend has issued a statement her name is Monica McLean she's a retired FBI agent\nAnd friend to forge she issued this statement to news outlets\nI have never had Christine Blasey Ford or anybody else prepare me or provide any other type of resistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam I have to take it at any time\nNow there's more modern ... Monica McLean is evidently the person that the ex boyfriend was reference Jamie and his orange David show\nIf anything this once again confirms\nThe downside of allegations flying around that can't be cooperate in this case it's been refuted pretty pretty quickly\nWithin a day but there's\nDoubt because of course the the ex boyfriends submitted a sworn statement and the statement from Monica McClain who is said to be the woman coached by Dr Ford that's presumably not a sworn David is just a press release or a statement to\nThe media how do you know how how do you know about any of that stuff how do you know what happened thirty six years ago when somebody makes an accusation\nThat may or may not be believe last night the president went on the offensive in Mississippi\nI admit kind of wish you the Senate ... but ... but ah yeah\nBut he said it and at the end of the day he fights he's fighting hard for his nominee\nI Believe we are playing to an audience of just a few senators all I care about is getting judge Kavanaugh confirmed and yes that means playing the game a little bit and having to be\nA diplomatic [laughter] if for the lack of a better word with people like Jeff Flake\nOh we're just like there's going to be on this I don't I just cannot get a read on it I'm like who the how do we know how many of them are going to vote\nWe don't know we don't know ah I watched\nVery intently and interview that Senator Flake and senator Coons gave this morning on the today show\nAnd of course there I keep saying there the new Lewis and Clark and somebody in the chat room with Mike online dot com some smart alec shed Mike is revealing his age by his Lewis and Martin reference well at that side of my it's before my time\nI don't remember the Lewis and and and uh and Martin give me a better duo who's who's a who's a pair the joined if they have these days but that that a\nThe ... the the magic guys here in I'm In Las Vegas but one of them got mauled who who

know the the God rest his soul I mean there had to be a moment we'll hear a poor guy was on that stage with the\nTiger jaws all over him saying what have I thought this was this was this looked like a good idea on paper anyway somebody give me a good example of a of of two people who are traveling around That's Chris Coons and Jeff Flake these days and they are\nGoing around look at us we're nonpartisan we're reaching across the aisle uh we're we're we're saving the world I'd like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony\nI'd like to do the world coke whatever the other day we got to get through this and we've got to win on November ... that's all this is about it's about getting past the finish line\nAnd where we go from here I don't know Senator Mitch McConnell ears cut number one audio courtesy of gravy on NBC saying we will have a vote and it's going to take place this week\nWill be voting\nSo the FBI reportedly center\nAnd we we we all during this week\nOn the cabinet off some of those\nYou know a ... ... the the media role and all of this has been something to watch NBC running the story because somebody wrote a ... a a letter in another sign down below ... no return address making a terrible allegation against judge Kavanaugh\nOf course the New York times embarrassing itself over and over the edge scores of reporters to find a Bob Barr altercation\nWhere\nBrett Kavanaugh's college kids through ice at somebody and that was literally their breath story they're hoping that fits the narrative that he doesn't have the temperament because after all if you get through ice thirty three years ago you must be crazy you must be like a violent madman\n\nThen of course there's the or the next New York times investigation uncovered some kind of tax scheme that they say President Trump's father engaged in threat from Fred Trump the president's dad has been dead for Twenty years and that's what they got\nIs it's all about trying to beat him and ultimately that is the ...\nI think it even goes this battle over judge Kavanaugh is deeper than just stopping the conservative or being on the court is repudiation of Donald Trump\nIt's it's that he is the guy in charge he's the guy who's at the top of the food chain\nAnd there are people who can't get it I was just talking to David liberal\nAnd the whole he's a he was on our show the other days in our studios do it another show and he uh he's such a good guy and he wrote a great book about Jesus and Paul and he kind of has that intersection of faith and politics and David and I were talking about David brought it up because what about these never Trump what's wrong with these guys\nAnd I'm like David ... for I I don't get any more than you do they think we're crazy\nAnd they do they really think that\nSupporting a conservative agenda in the United states of America and twenty Eighteen is crazy because the guy who's implementing the conservative agenda is Donald Trump and they hate him show much they'd rather have I guess anything but a conservative agenda ruled out they don't want\nTo serve it is on the bench they don't want conservatives on the Supreme Court they don't want tax cuts they don't want a secure border I guess they want everything that Hillary Clinton would have delivered\nWhich is kind of crazy when you think about it it's kinda crazy yes\nDonald Trump's aboard a China shop yes she says things in tweets things that are are not um protocol [laughter] it's not business as usual\nAnd of course it's why millions and millions of Americans love him
