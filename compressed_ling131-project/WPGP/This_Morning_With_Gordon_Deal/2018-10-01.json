offered this scanning service that it does um what this means is it simply will scanned the Internet facing system to these where they um the server like the voter registration um databases things like that anything that's on line\nThe tests will do this remote and um and all it's doing is looking to see if you have any um open software vulnerability is better known on top of her own belief that we know about that I'm also have a patch of elbow and it will tell the states\nWhere it's found a vulnerability and I'm able ... scanning they will keep scanning like on a weekly basis on a bi weekly basis to see when the um the customer has that\nPatch that system so they did that to a few states before um the two that I think the election and then they've done that to more states are more

waterproof\nCorrect correct technically you're not supposed to swim with these I Do know people who do and they've come out fine but you know apple will tell you to do that and I'm certainly not telling you to do that I mean the idea is really a Superman and actually I'm you know\nYou drop it in a pot or or you know or you you know by the shore and certainly a big wave comes in if\nIt's that
