[noise]\nAll right so you're a little bit\nOf history being made and you hear in the eyes and you're hearing the nays are the nose and uh I don't want to kind of a drag that out for you because uh what what matters is what they're going to do and were reported it to you but here are the yes as Jeff Flake is he yes this is a cloture vote part one\nThe second part would be tomorrow for the full Senate vote on the confirmation of judge Brett Kavanaugh flake as he asked Collins is the gas\nAnd mansion gives a yes which is a big surprise today are\nWell again I I'm ... and I was like you let him do shows how good I Am with predictions that Heidi Heidi Heitkamp could be a no I mean are yes rather because of Heidi Heitkamp votes no she's going to lose her Senate seat in North Dakota she did announce yesterday\nThat she's a no vote which means she's absolutely going to be the former senator from North Dakota she's out\nUm but there you go three of the four key senators voting yes let's get your reaction to all of this one eight hundred six five five Mike\nEight hundred six five five six four or five three great to have you here in the relief factor dot com studios as we are uh watching history unfold right before our very eyes Terry Europe hey Jared welcome aboard what do you think\n[noise] yeah my ... from New Jersey and I I think a little more of a historical but you know this kind of compare this situation and the civil war thank God the only difference or not killing anybody yet\nNot yet one and I don't want to reality ... one of them tried on a\nBaseball field in Virginia remember\nYes absolutely but the reality is that public Republican if they don't understand when you're a ... hour and you don't lose it and they right All right well what they don't you\nKnow this this idea of a civil war is very real to millions and millions of Americans and that's fair um I've talked about this for years\nAnd I I remember being on the stage of ... of a few months ago with a colleague who sort of rolled his eyes at the at the idea that we are in a cultural war we're in a war we're in a war for our nation shoals ... we're in we're in a battle over what\nHow we want our country to be what we want represented in this country what ... what are what our standards our values our laws are going to be this is a very big presumption here of guilt ... until you can prove you're innocent\nWe have turned American um standards and values and mores honest here by the the by the activism or the left and it's frightening you know ... and\nI I'm so I was reading about the Ellen generous announcing this week that she was a sexual assault survivor\nAnd you know that breaks my heart I think she I think she was a ... if I saw it correctly she was Fifteen and that's horrifying that that helped define and shape her that trauma that robbing of innocence\nAnd and everybody is pathetic and and an agonizing over such a horrible crime against an innocent defenseless child\nAnd we have had a robust conversation about women in the workplace\nBeing being abused and and treated terribly by powerful men\nBut then this me to thing has extended into the Kavanaugh process where allegations have been made from high school and early college that haven't been able to corroborate and in this conversation about cabinet I keep hearing the left\nUsed that term you get to speak my truth this is my truth\nAnd honestly at last I'd love to find the caller who can help maybe somebody on the left and I don't mind I Would love to hear from you actually to explain to me what my truth means because my truth may not\nBe the truth and it seems very clear to me that the pursuit should be of truth\nAnd I I don't really understand it we can clear align Lance and see if we can get a caller who can help explain to me what it means when when when some of these um advocates and activists and voices say that Christine Blasey Ford gets to tell\nHer truth truth this is my truth this is her truth is truth well it is that\nIs that kind of a shuttle acknowledgement that it may not\nBe the truth what if Christine Blasey Ford believes with all of her heart the Brett Kavanaugh did it but he didn't I'm just going through a hypothetical process what if what if it was another boy\nWhat if it was a memories that she has wrong\nIn the way she is recount in this some thirty six years later does that mean you can you can defend\nA truth that isn't the truth in other words it does hurt truth supersede the terms think about this as it applies to Brett Kavanaugh if that's the case\nThen a false fluids fans a man has ruined a family is destroyed and reputation is shattered because her truth isn't the truth hypothetically Tim says you can explain it to me how you doing Jim welcome to the Mike Gallagher show\nThank you uh it it comes from the education system and the philosophy behind that education system and they operate on the doors optical axiom that perception is reality\nSo your your perception of what happened is your reality which you and I know it's not true right as if somebody believes pillow or or seems a pillow as a wrong ticket and after Iraq yeah they they quickly learn that perception is not really\nThat that's an interesting way of looking at it so that that but maybe you're right maybe the belief is your perception is reality therefore that stands\nAnd frankly to most Americans that's wrong that's not a normal logical understandable process\nFreaking now on the Mike Gallagher show All right the Senate has voted fifty one to forty nine to advance the Kavanaugh's nomination it was a fifty one to forty nine vote\nAnd shockingly to some Lisa Murkowski voted no\nIt was believed that Lisa Murkowski could be this was again considered one of the big swing votes one of the undecideds she voted no which of course signal she's going to be a no vote tomorrow in the fall confirmation process however senators flake Collins and mansion Joe mansion from West Virginia\nCame through and voted yes so you got a fifty one to forty nine vote if you were to lose some how in the next twenty four hours any of those three flake Collins or mentioned say one so the last one of them let's say\nI don't know Susan Collins decides to join Lisa Murkowski in voting no\nYou still have ... the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh because Mike Pence as the president of the Senate breaks that breaks the tie he cast the deciding vote and uh you would win by one on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh Michelle is reacting to Lisa Murkowski's vote how you doing the show\n'cause I was actually turn your radio down for me five before the hour here again fifty one to forty nine the cloture vote go ahead Michele\nPilots ... like ... as an actor John ... is a felony phone now to go there for that cap it off and I um I haven't actually I felt that I just find that ... will let all these helicopters they're actually you know\nI think that's where men are the will to wear long life here on the other side of the stories are stressed out I guess completely brainwashed by all of that which I feel like that's how she thought it really just ...\nIt's the same it's a real shame and I and I believe again just like Heidi Heitkamp is going to be the former senator from North Dakota Lisa Murkowski is now going to be the former senator from it from a from Alaska she betrayed her voters\nAnd she said no but thankfully we've got enough yes vote so I think we're going to get them across the finish line [noise]\nComing up your reaction to this historic day will take a lot of calls were streaming up Mike online dot com again the Senate votes fifty one to forty nine to advance the Brett Kavanaugh nomination it's down to the Morrow ... a senator and make it back from his wedding in Montana or time or not stay tuned [noise]\nThere's so much on the ballot on November the six Medicare is on the ballot the government program dedicated to seniors when you pay into your whole life is under attack\nPace this film Mike Gallagher show we got a crucial midterm election coming up November ... we're not going to make America great again was\nRay Gallagher as ... voice of clarity from millions of Americans [laughter] shown owned by the most famous man on the flip\nEven grade Mike and I appreciate it very much notice I walked over here very quickly\nNow from the relief factor dot com studio mice yellow [noise]\n\nI Am by nature are pretty optimistic person I Am cautiously optimistic\nRight now however I Want to warn you that\nDon't believe anybody who says they know how this drama this nightmare frankly over the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh is going to end we don't know what we do know is that\nBrett Kavanaugh survived a crucial vote moments should go in the Senate and senators Jeff Flake Susan Collins\nAnd Joe Manchin from West Virginia Democrat cross the aisle and voted with his Republican colleagues\nAs yes votes perhaps the big shocker was the Republican from Alaska Lisa Murkowski who voted no in the cloture vote to advance the cabin on nomination\nThe cloture vote past fifty one to forty nine\nNow the clock sharks towards this weekend's confirmation if mansion flake and Collins ... with their yes votes and that's not a foregone conclusion\nIt's probable but it is not sure if they do that's the final vote on the confirmation and Brett Kavanaugh will start hearing cases from the bench of the United States Supreme court next week\nUm however both Joe mansion and Susan Collins\nHave suggested that their first vote might not reflect their final vote Susan Collins is being reported is going to come from how she's voting tomorrow this afternoon at three PM eastern time\nSo\nAs of now there's also lots of speculation about Lisa Murkowski possibly voting yes in the end but it doesn't seem like it does not seem particularly\nLikely that she will change your vote from today till tomorrow wow what a day the president has tweeted moments ago he set out a tweet that shows and I quote\nVery proud of the U.S Senate for voting yes to advance the nomination of judge Brett Kavanaugh tissues up this is a battle royale\nUm it's a bloodbath in the middle of all this drama\nComes some very fascinating statistics some data if your data driven you're going to you're going to like to hear some of this news first of all the daily presidential tracking poll you they're strict up from Rasmussen you just picked up again for the president right now\nThe Rasmussen Reports daily presidential tracking poll for friday today\nShows the fifty one percent of likely us voters approve\nOf President Trump's job performance forty eight percent disapprove\nWhere instructors for me but I think this is the highest it's been in Rasmussen says the president took office um it's you know you can say that the majority now for the first time perhaps of likely us voters approve of the job the President Trump is doing\nWhat's remarkable ... what's remarkable about that is to consider how much has been thrown at him for two years the entire\nEnormous machine the Republicans in the swamp the media the Democrats activists Hollywood\nYork I mean they have tried desperately to slow this guy down and to stop him but you know what's not it's you know you you know what's hard for them to swallow\nIt's not work and

three point seven percent\nNineteen sixty nine and of course you hear this stuff and you say ... wonder that the president's approval ratings continue to go up he's doing what he said he was going to do and even the never\nTrump or his you're paying attention Brad Stevens from the New York times he is a fears never Trump\nHe's the kind of conservative the New York times approves of he wrote a piece yesterday that frankly is is is sure to get him fired I I mean I'm I'm not saying that to be\nGloom and doom for him I I don't want to hear anybody getting fired but nonetheless rich Stevens who has written column after column efficient rating President Trump rage yesterday for once I'm grateful for him\nHe says for the first time since Trump entered the political fray I find myself grateful that he's in it I'm reluctant to admitted he wrote I'm astonished to say it\n\nI'm grateful because Trump peasant back down in the face of the slippery Mish hypocrisy and dangerous standard shedding deployed by opponents of Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court I'm grateful he writes because ferocious and even crash opposite as she\nHas its uses in life and never more so than in the face of sly moral bully I'm grateful because he's a big fat hammer fending off a razor sharp dagger wow\nThat's big news that's big news last ... last night the president had him as a big rally in
