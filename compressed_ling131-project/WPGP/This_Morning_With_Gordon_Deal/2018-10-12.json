this morning we'll mortgage rates continue to rise and that's likely not good news for the housing market joining us to talk about interest rates and housing is Laura ... this to the wall Street Journal Laura where we stand in terms of the thirty year fixed rate mortgage\nWhere four point nine percent for a thirty year fixed rate mortgage and certainly what we're hearing on the ground talking to lenders and real estate agents at this point if you want to get below five percent you better have pristine credit and twenty percent doubt I'm increasingly five percent of rapes are becoming the norm\nA year ago at this time the average rate for eight thirty are fixed was just about three point nine percent now four point nine percent that's a full percentage point higher as a bigger difference you're buyers in terms of a monthly mortgage payment is it not\nYeah absolutely you're talking about you know a hundred and fifty dollars for a typical you know two hundred and fifty thousand dollar home but uh and a lot of places in New York California you're talking about an even bigger difference and even bigger I'm more of a blow to the housing market there\nYears ago we saw rates like Eighteen percent that makes five percent sound low but that's not the case for young first time buyers today I guess\nYeah absolutely I think even I'm a I'm a little bit younger I even though I covered with all the time and I know that right to to be a paper than it's hard for you to imagine the environment like that I think most people have grown up certainly as adults\nI'm seeing rates in a three or four percent range and so even though ... than is actually historically pretty normal it's going to feel like I think a a ship for people\nNow the mortgage Bankers Association says there's a pain threshold around six percent do you agree\nYeah I mean I I that's certainly what I've heard that the experts that as a point where we are likely to see the housing market really slow down and I don't think we're going to get there all that than um with that said though I think we are\nObserving that the market is a lot more interest rate a sense of it but it has been in the past\nThat I think one of the reasons is what we just touched on that we have younger people who don't remember rates being left high and I think the second is because we saw a huge run up and prices when rates are low and I and I think a buyer they're already more strength and they often happen in the past\nWe're speaking with Laura ... from the wall Street Journal Laura are the high rates are negative for the refinancing picture\nOh yeah I mean we I mean I don't know who is refinancing their home at this point uh the the average homeowner has a rate of I Want to say it's about three point seven five percent something like that maybe\nAround three point nine but anyway a full percentage point at least below where rates are now I'm so there are no the the odd person out there maybe they had their credit score up or something like that but there's almost nobody any more or less a strong incentive to refinance\nI'm compared to you know the interests that you can pay on a on a payday loan if it's relatively small um I talked to another company called daily pay and they said their fees are more similar to an ATM fee and\nThey max out at three dollars so every time you get your paycheck in advance you pay a three dollar fee um which you know isn't an expensive if you do it all the time but it is much much less than from those interest rates end up being\nMurray as I mentioned in the intro most of us get paid every two weeks some people once a week and some people monthly but why is that generally been a two week paycheck cycle\n[noise] the thing is that actually just a historical precedent um it really there's no technological reason for that I think going into the story I thought you know there must be some tax free then or some\nPayroll reason but there really is and um it's just that companies don't want to pay their employees too often because\nYou know what they have to usually they outsource their payroll to another company and sometime you thought [laughter] I'm their contract with that company depends on how many times they have to go through the payroll so um you know if they're doing it all the time they might get charge more so it's really about you know\nHow your company can facilitate payroll but technically there's no reason why you couldn't get paid every single day\nWe're speaking with market watches Maria lasagna Maria how will the gig economy affects how we are paid\nSo it already is actually um you know who burned left our two companies that compete with each other very um\nYou know strongly for drivers and so one thing that they've both added is the ability to get paid after every ride 'em they worked with a company called green dot to do that and square um and so now that those\nType of getting a condom your workers are used to doing that that has kind of shifted into the you know non ... regular payments cycles um you know\nEvery day workers are now saying we I Know someone that get paid every day or every ride why can't this happen for me so that conversation it's already permitting you know a lot of different companies and it kind of increasing the pressure to pay workers more frequently\nDo you think the rise of the ... payment company will somehow forced traditional companies to change the way they paid in their cycle\nYeah I think we're already seeing some of that you know obviously the demand will have to come from the workers and it's kind of hard to lobby or company to pay you more frequently I think that would unfortunately be hard to do but I think now that this is part of the national conversation a bit more um companies may start to do that though the benefit for their workers\nSome of these companies um are you know that that allow you to outsource both are presenting it as a benefit there saying you know if you want to keep your workers happy if you want to retain them longer pay them more often so we may see it sort of position that way and it could actually make an impact relatively soon\nThanks Maria Maria la money of marketwatch thirty minutes after the hour on this morning Americas first news [noise]\n[noise]\nWith us or a news I'm Rhonda rocks for in the
