are sort of observers\nTo say how do you because I always instinctively say gosh why would you\nWhy would you leave the White House why would anybody walk away from that job and of course\nI can look at my own career and I made decisions that people have said why did you do that and it turned out to be a pretty good move for me but you know at the time people will say oh my gosh you're resigning from WABC radio in New York and yeah I took a chance to run into syndication and it worked out but you know you're Twenty years later\nPretty good I mean people make decisions based on things like the the the brutal treatment you get\nWhen you're in that fish bowl and so I I really do get it um and maybe that's what this is it must be something though as Sebastian if if if the two of them are

like maybe is is is Lindsey Graham going to become attorney general is she going to get some position was that\nWe can I things around ... down [noise]\nAnd I found a fun way I don't know I Know you're getting your getting to be like the the the crazy in the mainstream you know a little\nNow that's a bitter about that so that's the title ... for about ... that's a big insult Dr ... and when when the ... goes the chaos in the white guys if if the last twenty months has been chaos\nI Want will say oh yeah no kidding me look economy you know can you look at the border you look at

successful in the private sector\nWell and you talk about chaos Dr ... you're talking about chaos bring me the kind of chaos that results in judge Brett Kavanaugh now here in the hill who\nOh in the hit\nIn the history of book shop too has there ever been a more perfectly timed book than your book why we fight defeating America's enemies no apologies because let's be very blunt here sometimes America's enemies are from within and what we do it and just over the last few weeks I\nI I Know you had to be as disgusted as the rest of us\nAre totally because I Lived in I mean through it you know all the accusations made against me and the White House and you know we ... we had a saying in in the west wing ... when all this stuff was going on you only take flack when you wrote the targets but but this\nWas disgusting and the interesting thing about my book why we find which of course I wrote long before you have an old was was nominated right is that the chapter in there by the great American heroes of the book is about\nAll the threats America faces and ... the president's going to do about them but then I have these personal stories about or amazing American heroes and the last one\nIs a guy called when it could change the the most\nAmericans and probably Ninety five percent of millennials ... never heard off but we didn't get chambers was the tunnel before ... was born so just just a little sound but\nThis is a man who stood up for the food in the first televised rational testimony\nEver in Nineteen forty eight right he stood up to say I was a former communist and I can tell you who the communist are inside the government and what happened to him\nThe left went crazy they accused him of having an affair they accused him of being a coke and homosexual they used to being responsible for his brother's death all of it my one of the line then I switched to live and\nAt the end of the day he won because he stood up to the truth so anybody who says that he's got them by the treatment judge Kavanaugh received a guess what the Democrats have been doing it for about seven years mind\nAnd and it's gotten so bad that it's almost a fever pitch and I and frankly I'm hoping and praying that Americans remember\nWhat has happened over the last month come November the six because you know there and they are on record you know it and we've seen them promising left and right impeaching Kavanaugh house members threatening and promising an investigation of Brett Kavanaugh they don't want this thing to end\nAnd if they get control the house in the Senate We're going to be worrying for a world of hurt\nWe look I chose the title of the book for a reason why we fight we now have the will to protect the republic I'm thinking about this for second do you remember what
