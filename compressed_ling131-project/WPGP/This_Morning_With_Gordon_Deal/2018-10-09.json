cam video\nOften a police officer who was guilty of a terrible terrible crime and this was this was a bad shooting this was not he was not defending his life you can see from the video the kid was walking he was high on apparently PCP he was walking away from the officers he had a knife in his hand but they shot him\nOr officer Van Dyke shot at sixteen times\nUm when it happens and there's cooperation\nOfficer police officers are always held accountable their ears accountability and there are consequences for a police officer\nMaking a mistake guess what\nHappens all the time the

always get away with shooting unarmed black\nMan and it's open season that's just not true and there are times I Am sure when officers try to protect themselves and they do a immoral and the illegal

Brett\nKavanaugh for a confirmation process in which he faced multiple allegations of sexual misconduct and assault at a ceremonial swearing in yesterday the president said judge Kavanaugh was proven innocent under historic scrutiny\nWhat happened to the cabinet or family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process [noise] our country a man or woman forced to always be presumed innocent fun to less and until proven guilty\nMr Trump ordered the FBI investigation last month after some Republican lawmakers so they were hesitant to confirmed justice Kavanaugh without further examination into the allegations the investigation based brought criticism from Democrats that it wasn't appropriately comprehensive\nAfter the investigation concluded the White House and Republican lawmakers said it didn't corroborate the allegations justice cabinet of course has denied them\nJudge Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court gets chief justice John Roberts a historic opportunity to lead\nA firmly conservative court but it also presents a considerable challenge for chief justice tasked with steering through national political turbulence that threatens to chip away at the courts legitimacy it's a story by Wall Street journal Supreme Court correspondent Brent Kendall Brent what's up here\nJohn Roberts is the man in the middle of the Supreme Court both literally and figuratively or you know he he leads to ... the face of the federal judiciary and now after Justice Kennedy retired way the ideological\nBreakdown works on the court he actually is sandwiched between for people who are more conservative and he is and for people who are on the liberal side of things so here they is part of a five justice conservative bloc [laughter] it's more conservative and Bannon and recent memory\nAnd so he's in a position where the court can do a lot of things that he would like to do with the law\nBut as we say in the story I mean the big challenge for him is Brett Kavanaugh\nComes to this court after this brutal political fight or you know in some inflammatory remarks he made in his second Judiciary Committee parents and the whole process is not to sort of process it reflects terribly well on the court and then to the challenge for that she\nWill be to to try to steer the court through these meaner pretty rough part is sometimes without also just looking like another part if somebody you know\nHow to steer it though 'cause I mean there's a rare you ever see any of the Supreme Court justice was like you know do an interview or or be public so what does that mean to him and steer it\nWell I guess a few things I mean there have been times the cheapest taken different approaches I mean there have been a lot of times where he clearly favors incremental type ruling spent trying to tackle some big hot button issue head on and dealing with every aspect of it you know he'll kind of break it down\nAnd in and take a micro part of that and have the court issued a ruined it doesn't it's not so sweeping so that's one way to to minimize the court troll little bit there have been other times you know an on issues that he really really cares about he's not that interested in doing that to\nYou know that's a calculation he will have to make another another question for the court and airtime in their big cases the court will not be able to avoid the lower courts are split on the proper outcome of some\nBig legal issue the Supreme Court really doesn't have\nA choice but to take it shows a certain things they won't be able to talk about it is a case where the court has almost entirely discretionary docket meaning they can pick and choose which cases they want to hear the you know\nIf if somebody brings a case that tries to overturn roe v Wade for example meet in the court could just say no we're not going to hear that case right now so that may be a way he could try to deal with some of the\nInteresting we're speaking with Wall Street journal Supreme Court correspondent Brent Kendall his piece is called Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle test Supreme Court chief justice talking about John Roberts it's interesting right I mean ah two weeks ago maybe Brett Kavanaugh might be the only justice most people in America could even name\nAnd now all of a sudden the the high court is under this renewed spotlight\nPromoted him when they go through the confirmation process they have some ability for a little while but then that kind of fades [laughter] um but you know it sure does look like like judge justice Kavanaugh will be in a similar but Justice Clarence Thomas who had a similar\nSort of thing and you know and justice Thomas's\nIs probably easily the most recognizable\nMember of the court for the public off the bench and you know the people I expect we'll have long memories of the cabinet proceedings [laughter] just like they did the Thomas proceedings for him now the challenge for him will be just to get back to judge in cases and and seeing if there's you know over time\nAny any way some of it dies down I mean whether some of it dies down may depend of course on how he rules and so you know he has some calculations to make just like the chief justice does I mean if if a new justice Kevin I'm\nTake very bold than says in cases you know they're cutting the strongly conservative direction then you know people are probably on the left are going to criticize him for that if he find ways to moderate and end up for common\nGround with you know with a cross section of people in the court and then
