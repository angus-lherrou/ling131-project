I got the screener and watched it you got some heavy weights you got some some real real powerhouse actors and actresses in this bill\nWhere we really do in order to tell a story like this you need actors who is a lot the performances in a meaningful realistic way and Sarah Drew adjusting Bruni who some of your listeners will know from a great show team a TV show Grey's Anatomy well we've got other actors there as well come along and support them and\nAnd really pull this off and on the way\nYou know I I Love your story I've been reading about you you you began shooting homemade films at age twelve with your brother on your parents little a little a ... camera um I always show grateful to two filmmakers who try to go take a different path\nWhen it comes to to telling a story or creating a movie in again with the culture we're up against right now in some of the tough things we're facing um I I got to believe that this is your life's work or providing an alternative to people from some of the junk that we see a on the big screen these days\nThe last year\nI guess David we got you know what happened\nTo us that we got a little bit of a technical problem I think I'm this is this I mean they're dead you got us back I got your back now so I'm Sorry about that\nDavid we apologize I we were just talking about the alternative a movie like indivisible which is such a different refreshing change of pace from some of the garbage that that is in Hollywood frankly today and I know this has got to be part of your life's work to provide some inspiration for a change rather than some of the depression things we see on the big treat\nRight it definitely is and again you know when people go out and watch a movie like this on opening weekend it's really a vote you're casting for more\nPositive content that you can share with your families on the big screen and uh so often we see movies like this will come along and they last about a week or so and then it's like who are gone but when you have a true story like this first of all it's a story about soldiers that are fighting for\nFreedom is a will act it will\nProduce Feldman M. we want people to get out and support the movie on opening weekend your vote for Moore movie like this and it's so important and keeping the movie around as long as we answer by getting out of supporting it an opening way can help everyone who's working on projects like this to\nThat or to keep pushing to to get their fills out an ...\nCouldn't say better myself even even I even like the the gators instead of theaters you're from Arkansas so I could tell I Love it [laughter] proudly I Love it David David Evans director and co writer of the new film indivisible congratulations on this thing going to fill those everybody as you

South Carolina\nLindsey is back and he's going to join us next we'll talk about the pipe bombs that the rhetoric capital and more stick around you're not gonna want to miss it [noise]\nThere's not a

worked it out at the gym\nNot going to make America great again was never that\nWay I felt like\nWe got a crucial midterm election coming up in November ...\nSince Nineteen Seventy eight ... voice of

been raised Mike and I appreciate it very much notice I walked over here very quickly\nNow from the relief factor dot com studio Mike\n[noise] we are in the middle of an incredible time the president tweeted today\nVery big part of the anger we see today is our society is caused by the purposely falls that an accurate reporting of the mainstream media but I refer to as fake news it has gotten so bad and hateful\nThat it is beyond description mainstream media much clean up its act fast\nWell the mainstream media doubles down and says this is all his fault these pipe bombs at least suspicious packages that have been sent to prominent Democrat critics of President Trump um we had a voice of reason in this country lately\nUh last night you know in a room of about a thousand people in Irving, Texas\nRight outside Dallas we had a an event on stage where Sean Spicer my colleagues Larry Elder Dennis spray gr Mark Davis\nAnd I were talking about all of these important volatile issues\nAnd I mentioned the name Senator Lindsey Graham at a roar went up\nThe lifestyle which I haven't heard in a long time I know he's feeling the love about everywhere he goes because many of us\nBelieve that we're not for Lindsey Graham's passion\nAnd his heart felt anguish over the way the process of judge Kavanaugh played out he wouldn't be justice justice Kavanaugh today what a what a joy is to bring back to the my calendar show Senator Lindsey Graham from the Palmetto State of South Carolina Senator Graham what a time to be alive ha\nAm I Am trying to make the guy that won the lottery I don't know who he is but I'm trying to find it\nBut he's in your state right I mean listen can I all I Need ten million you meet him how you get\nFive I'll take I could do five or seven and you know we'll be All right [laughter] you know if his or\nTry to get mine and I get more and so that's\nA good no kidding I write he'd get fringe groups he get three groups and you don't want a vice current Senator Graham ought to do\nThis last last night I mean here we are in Dallas texas and here's hundreds and hundreds of people roaring their approval for just for your name were so appreciative of your voice and and I I just got to get the Lindsey Graham thirty five thousand feet view\nOf of what the of the time we're living in this investigation is intensifying these suspicious packages CNN's Jeff Zucker immediately blamed President Trump what does what does Senator Lindsey Graham say about the last twenty four hours of this very nervous a dangerous time\nWhere you take your frustrations out at the ballot box to support your team or support your causes appropriately I don't blame President Trump put this any more than I blame Bernie for the guy that shot\nState Scully us and tried to kill a bunch of congressman Rosa Bernie supporter but Bernie doesn't support that or this person is obviously sending bombs that critics at the press that\nThat's not the way we do business in America hope they get caught a hope they go to jail and I hope and about Thirteen Days republic when at the ballot box because we deserve to get reelected\nAnd that's the answer the only answer we have we got to be the the the we got to have a big boy pass on we can't play all around and and point fingers of blame the wrong time to do this because frankly Senator Graham seems very clear Republicans have a great deal of momentum heading into November ...\n[laughter] no question about it I'm so Kevin I think because people were trying to say to you and to myself when I made um is it thank you for speaking a thank you for speaking\nIn a in a fashion that if I were there I Would have said the same thing less than what they were trying to stay to Brett Kavanaugh who I've known for Twenty years is destroying his life to keep the seat open\nTo make sure that Democrat could fill it in twenty twenty they actually said that\nThey play dirty and they lost I'm Glad I called them out I had all I could take out voted for Saddam and Kagan now because how but I chose them but that was I thought they were qualified that are meant to pick in spurts or ... or ... to people from South Carolina the game's played differently now\nAnd what they were trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh all that I Hope there's a backlash at the ballot box and I hope we pick up seats and they get punished for what they're trying to\nDo you mind if I asked if I go a little person with you because of known you for a long time and I respect you at all on you know that all the years that that I've been on the radio I said Senator Lindsey Graham is a good and decent man I met you in Washington DC early in my talk radio career you told me something that stuck with but you said\nMike I came to Washington not to say no to everything I Want to get stuff done I Want to get things across the finish line\nThere's a belief and I and I hope this doesn't hurt your feelings are a big because I respected him argue and I knew for a long time there is a belief that with your friendship with the late Senator McCain\nYou were sort of restrained a little bit and with his passing his like Lindsey unleashed its Lindsey Graham the way South Carolina south Carolinians have known him for many many years is there any merit to that Senator Graham\nNow people are thinking way too hard ah here's the deal or\nIf you know anything about may have tried to being supportive of an independent judiciary our our judiciary needs to be independent of politics John McCain was not dares friend he voted against so tomorrow and cake cameras heart asked when it came to judges [laughter] the the bottom line as\nI can never done to set of mind Kagan what they were doing to Brett Kavanaugh they were misrepresenting his life they trade dot the forward and there's no doubt in my mind something happened did that before but I don't believe Kevin had anything to do with it or they tried to ruin\nHis family\nThey said if you're really innocent or not you asked for this charade continue and that's when I lost it is when Durbin\nAsked Kevin out attorney Don McGahn the White House counsel if you really have nothing now I wanted to ask for this to continue they ... him guilty not innocent everything that I Believe in as a lawyer\nA was was basically trampled on\nAnd I pushed back and it still more complicated than that\nWell we're ... on a nation is grateful for you and your pushback many believe I mean is it is it an overreach to say that that that that your voice your speech your passion helped the confirmation occur\nWell here's what I Would say number one I Want to\nCongratulate President Trump for picking Brett Kavanaugh who's that\nGreat legal mind of his generation has resume of being a judge was unquestioned his integrity he's just a great guy I think what happened is that\nI gave voice to those on our side who said enough already runs it always are judges Mike why is it always Clarence Thomas and pork and Alito and\nNow cabinet why is that all of our people\nRight and they wanna they wanna went too badly over they\nPlay pretty if the Republican had done this to mail democratic nominee will be crucified oh we'd be visited ... for these people can you imagine that there's a democratic male nominee a lady from South Carolina\nAnnounced the main gives me a letter an asset on it never shared it with the committee that they need to me a car recommended a conservative lawyer never told the lady from South Carolina oh by the way the Democrats would come here and meet you there be a\nRiot in the street or without the press so\nSo I just got mad I was pissed\nI Know you were and they make about it that get past the get so hopefully with [laughter] oh well we hope\nHe is he is just as bad but I mean that battle was ... and and he's on the Supreme Court and may there be another conservative on the Supreme Court uh in in the ... over the next few years Senator Lindsey Graham is whether it's let me ask you about the big burning issue that I think is the October surprise we've got thousands and thousands\nOf people in what's being described as a migrant caravan\nUm a lot of people are concerned as much as ... as the country is an amateur in love with you right now there are a lot of us should live as a push back a little bit on on the issue of illegal immigration and and you have been at the you've been an interesting\nEvent it interesting voice in all of this where do you stand right now with these thousands of people who are marching towards the southern border\nUh and and and frankly I think from a political optics point of view something that is encouraging Republicans and independents and people to go to the go to the polls and say\nWe can't have open borders we got to have sovereignty we got to have a secure border what's your take on the the migrant care of and Senator Graham\nOr between Kevin on the care of and if that does that make you want to vote is Republican nothing ever will be if you're an independent voter our hope you will come on our side\nI'm going to be practical when it comes to solving the immigration problem within our country if you've been here for decades and you've got American citizen children or the world trade to fairly you'll have to learn our language pay a fine get in the back of the line but I don't want a third
