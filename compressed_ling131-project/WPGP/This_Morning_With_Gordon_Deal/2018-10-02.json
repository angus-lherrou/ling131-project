talking to and it's much cheaper\nThe FBI expected to go\nOr what have we learned the parameters or or Willie publicly learned the parameters\nWell Mitch McConnell wants to do on the nominee it's weak and so we would expect it and I think in her corner and said that generally and something like this better prepared some sort of summary or some sort of [noise] thing document\nAnd give that to the senator so they wouldn't be able to understand what the FBI founder what their line of inquiry was [laughter] and we'd expect that based on\nLike not wanting to vote in an investigation with that and
