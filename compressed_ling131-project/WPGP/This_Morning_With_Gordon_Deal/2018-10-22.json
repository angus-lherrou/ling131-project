twelve fifty theater [noise]\n\nExclusive story and you need to respect you are listening to America's poorest news this morning for you\nBut what I was walking into Monday in a year where Democrats are considered the favorite to win back control of the house many of the races now tightening or districts where President Trump won modestly in twenty six teams still Republicans say they are becoming more confident that they could have a shot\nAt a pair of Nevada races it's a story by Wall Street journal congressional reporter Christina Peterson Christina explain is\nWhat I was looking at in particular were races that were kind of ignored at the beginning of the cycle and people didn't think would become competitive but in the last\nSort of final stretch here has become closer than\nPeople expect that they would and we're seeing that in particular and a handful of districts where the president won but not by a huge amount so maybe at forty nine percent victory fifty fifty three percent districts you know that he comfortably carried but where\nThere is more room for a Democrat\nTo pick up votes if people have become dissatisfied with the president some\nParts of one of them was like in a in Washington state explain that one\nYet so it's very interesting because a political analysts have had their eyes on two races in Washington state all year and they're the third race that is sort of sneaking up on a lot of people into coming very competitive and that the district currently held by congresswoman Jamie Herrera\nButler [noise] um she has been in office she was elected in two thousand ten and that sort of cruise to victory in recent years but here has a significant challenge or\nHas been out raising her and um came in pretty close to her in the primary in fact the top two Democrats and garnered more votes and congressman butler in Washington state is one of those states where they have a top two primary so [noise] um [noise] the incumbent\nAdvanced as to the highest performing Democrat with a woman named ... she's a political science professor so it's an unusual and waste there in that\nUm this hasn't been considered you know one of the ... district but Carolyn Long campaign just released a poll that had her up by two points um so it looks like you know it's getting to be a pretty tight well\nAll right how about the Long Island New York with uh the incumbent Republican Congressman Peter king\nYeah it was probably a little bit more of a long shot but he has a younger democratic female opponent\nAnd this is the year when it does candidates are attracting a lot of energy and enthusiasm for voters especially female voters um our poll and other polls have shown a gender gap and and it reveals that women\nYeah so that's kind of came up on you know with the news that Prince Harry and Meghan Merkel are expecting their first baby um in making Merkel is thirty seven and I'm you know she's not the only woman who is now having a baby you know in their thirties that's actually becoming more common than having maybe in your twenties\nWow so what's the reason for this\n[noise] [noise] yeah it's about actually switched for the first time ever in twenty sixteen and they're starting to be more women in their thirties at and younger moms I'm tired of the reason for that shift on is that you know women are getting married later in life and another major part of it that teenage pregnancy rates are\nActually down quite a bit um so it kind of the the mix of those two things that are contributing to\nI thought I saw that in your story which basically said like the rate of gene pregnancies from like in Nineteen Seventy or the seventies has been cut in half from then to today about well yes\nYes that's true it's a way way down um and yeah that again the education part really um plays a role and I'm abortions are actually falling as well so it's not just that um you know\nThere are more abortions happening it's um that there's actually a decline in sexual activity I'm at a rise in birth control so it's um you know think including methods like you know having inter eater and devices and things like that so it's you know there's also more methods of birth control that are available for\nSpeaking with marketwatch personal finance reporter Murray Hill ammonia\nShe's written a piece instead of more American women are having babies later and some are still conflicted about it as you mentioned a there was a question or a survey that looked at kind of the best way to get ahead in ... ... your professional life been having babies earlier or later\nRight exactly and um there's you know obviously it's a very controversial topic and um you know\nYou can't always control death and you know every woman's experience is very different but um yeah there have been sort of mixed results on um you know if people should you know quote unquote should have children earlier or later in their career on you know there was one survey that said thirty seven percent of women inside a woman who want to be a top\nExecutive should actually have children earlier about the same amount forty one percent said waiting it's better um and so there's kind of you know two schools of thought on that either that or children earlier when you yourself earlier in your career and then um you know when there are a little bit older you can really you know leaning speak and and really extend your career\nOr you know some people feel that waiting a little bit longer than having a baby when you're a little more established shifts better um but also so much depends on\nYou know what you're competing fraternity policy youth and all those kinda things so um you know obviously it's a very individual decision\nMakes Maria
