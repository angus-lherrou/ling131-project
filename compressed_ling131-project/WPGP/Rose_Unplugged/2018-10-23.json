I'm\nOptimistic than I Am today\nNBC Wall Street Journal released a poll forty seven percent of a of a of a Americans American voters approve of the job President Trump is doing this is his highest

up you know hurt the\nFact of the matter is that the vast majority of illegal immigrants coming here for jobs or simply to take advantage of the system that is a fact regardless of what the journalists tried to spin the bottle let's play identity politics for just a moment okay the progressive\nLove me let's act like Democrats yeah well you know kind of like that like to do that\nOkay I'm a fact of the matter is you and I've talked about this or the civil rights commission has conducted hearings who studies on this issue those microbes as they're called who are coming up here which is truly an invading force on moss\nThe vast majority of them are military age males Ninety percent of them I was looking very closely for the alleged families I didn't see him I don't need to be harsh about the schools are just the facts that journalists seemed to gloss over\nBut as we've shown them civil rights commission these individuals are going to be displacing low skilled American workers and what we found that the commission is that one group\nWill harshly affected by that displacement or lack meals blacks in general a black males and it's profound\nThat forty percent of the decline in the labor force participation rate among blacks were the last couple of decades is attributable to competition\nLow wage competition from illegal immigrants who tend to congregate and compete with lax in many industries that blacks have been historically concentrated switches construction service agriculture so on and so forth when you do the math on it and we have\nWe're talking about nearly one million jobs that blacks have lost due to competition from low wage\nIllegal immigrants and that just do grants but illegal immigrants now\nIf that were to happen in any other circumstance you can just imagine what the outcry would be American citizens were being harmed if we play the game ... on identity politics it is one of the most vulnerable cohorts in America in terms of\nTheir status in society we don't hear anything about that from the politicians who are currently running for office the upcoming election and\nIf you take a look at the Democratic party and there\nAre dependence on the black vote\nWe know that Ninety percent of the black vote traditionally goes to the Democratic candidate for president was saying is true with respect other offices but ... percent\nAnd if you only peel away a couple of percentage points\nOf that group from the Democratic\nParty then they effectively become as competitive as the weak part just a couple of points that's all it takes it doesn't require ten percent or Fifteen Percent and that's why the whole county west German brown who ... who ha ha or caused so much consternation on the left because it was a break\nIn the solid wall that the Democrats ... panda so that's simply you know if they want to get your identity politics this is this is damaging to all of America but particularly those favorite groups of the Democratic\nParty and I would suggest that those favorite groups take a hard look at whether their interests are being protected by progressive\nPeter cursing our is our guest is the is a a commission on the United states commission on civil rights Pete hum you mentioned the wall and your first remark I'm about how fast it would go up if it were those other individuals coming to this country\nAt the wall is is a very interesting point here because correct me if I'm wrong\nEven if we were to build this wall it would not stop what we're seeing right now now it would would stop those who are branching off from the caravan when it gets to our border and rather than going to our point of entry and it's just crossing the river or jumping over a a lame little barbed wire fence you know that we used to consider a barrier for\nUs to stop immigration but if they come that way yeah so what would stop that but all people would have to do is continue to go to the actual portrait point of entry which would be gaps in the wall and say asylum I'm claiming asylum you gotta let me in and you got to lead then let me lose 'cause you're not allowed to entertain me or my family or my children\nWe found that out with the last caravan that came through or else is going to be a political price to pay and a judge to tell you can't do that you gotta let me listen to the continental us and uh yeah I promise I'll come back for my for my asylum hearing which we know they don't do the woman stopped that would it be\n[noise] well it it would I think present\nA a a symbolic barrier or it would make things a little bit more difficult I think that it would now you write that\nPresenting yourself at a quarter century licking silently you seen that happened and again we started this so words can issue\nWithin happens is no more than three to four percent of people with her for their hearing slips guns and disappear into the future of the United states so President Trump is exactly right the laws need to be reformed they have to mourn told you put a wall\nWill have a I Believe to be a significant impact let's just take a look at current events [noise] we had a migration similar to what we're\nWitnessing right now in Europe from Northern Africa in the middle east we had those huge chains of\n... migrants coming across southern Europe into Germany in other places and hungry said no we're not going to do this we're not going to accept this and they\nBuilt a sense like it's better to him something more than a fence something more akin to a wall and everyone to ride it said it was going to be an effective well\nIt went from hundreds of thousands of migrants entering hungry to virtually zero within a year so these barriers work otherwise countries around the world would erecting barriers are they actually work\nAnd it's something that is only part of the toolkit you're white that if\nPeople are going to be presenting a bogus asylum claims that is an issue but I Do think the Detroit valuable walls from\nI and I completely agree I support building the wall I'm just worried about what like I said you know whether it would be effective against asylum claims rather than just the border jumpers are certainly would stop the border jumpers but the asylum claimants will just go to the ports of entry\nRight and do they have to be carrying weapons in order to be considered invading force official to which could uh uh justify the use of troops I don't know there's a lot of gray area there but I think\nThat in the first instance across the United states\nAs the commander in chief needs to do what's necessary to secure the for\nThe border that may not include law enforcement activity but a Detroit ... isn't\nThat it is indeed that Peter thank you so much

think that's what we need to do here\nAnd we this is Democrat play for\nDemocrats aren't saying anything because they want these people and so they can stay in power because they're assuming\nThese refugees are going to vote for them a couple years ago these Democrats well for the wall now all of a sudden because Trump is saying they're quiet\nNo no no we need this war and the American people want this wall if you let the people and put them in detention centers until you can process the mall\nWhile those detention centers are full of that that there's two point to point problem they're number one the detention centers are full from the last caravan\nAnd number two you saw what happened they got federal judges to say you can't separate children from from adults in terms of their detention centers and if you have them together as a family you can only keep them there for X number of days before you have to turn them loose end of the population and that's\nYou know we're turning thousands and thousands of people a\nA loose end of the population where they'll never come back for their actual asylum hearing and they become part of the eleven million twelve million

get ... you know released into the population an added to those numbers so\nAh the wall as a part of the solution but it is not the only solution and uh and I don't know what the answer is other than
