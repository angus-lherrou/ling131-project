Alam in uh in Ohio makes the same point thank you Alan\nAnd let's go to die in Cleveland hello Diane Prager\nHi Hi Denny I'm my comment is about the caravan so and it sounds silly but we um we couldn't look at it as a compliment to President Trump a president he then found that people are making America I just\nThink that's just\nWell it's certainly a complement to America the truth is that it happened on ... under President Obama and the economy was was not good\nYou are right that there was that they know how good things or the United states and how well the unemployment rate is so that they could most likely get a job but\nUh it it's remember ... look what's beyond as compared to ... and Guatemala the American economy is always robust so if these people aren't sitting down with the wall Street Journal and checking out the stock prices that they\nThey know where it's better here is the point though that the key point is that is just should be made every single day why would these people want to replicate the failed societies from which they come\nBy the way I Know again for the left who in their superficial little intellectual bubble think that to say something is a failed societies to engage in racism it has nothing to do with race that is one hundred percent values zero percent race\n\nWhy can't people ask why is America prosper is is is that if you were in

essentially and watching your society just be mired in poverty and corruption why wouldn't you ask the single most obvious question why is America affluent\nThere was no other question anyone in Latin America thinking about the economic situation there are other situations but thinking about economics there is no other question to be asked\nWhy does America work why don't Americans asked that question why does America work but they don't\nInstead the left asks asks why is America so racist Gina phobic and homophobic and Islamophobia\nCould cetera what you what people who care about people as opposed to get just care about anger should be asking is why does it work\nThe question in this question intelligent people fought for people ask you not why didn't the Americans have slaves it's white America abolish slavery\nIt's not why use their poverty in America it's why use there so much affluence in America every question asked is the wrong question\nThat's that's the point that needs to be made something just that just came to my mind I was just reading about the likelihood of Americans of different Americans when I was speaking about Americans complaining on the left\nThere was

saying you shouldn't be up on the news I obviously am I have to be or want to be\nBut ultimately\nTo use the term ultimately the ultimate issues\nAre what matter I mean we have a vision of life today's program today's topic\nIt's so important that I only wonder if I ever devoted a merit to it I mentioned that I mentioned it in passing regularly but I don't know if I've ever devoted to an hour to do you do see one\n\nYou're checking but going back very far and it's an invitation\nAnd that subject is a word that is not easy it's the most important thing and it's not used\nWhich is a a real reason for the problems and troubles of our time in America and in the western world generally it's W. word or the or the\nPeople will know thinking thinking work\nWorth\nAbout how many people even if like say the bill you word no wisdom you know it's you know how bad it is how bad the situation is it the word is boring to most people\nSay to a young person would you like to be wise I think you will get to the response what do you mean would you like wisdom what do you mean\nWould you prefer wisdom or a new iPhone\n[laughter] [laughter] [laughter]\nThe federal really really do it I Would I think that somebody needs to do a poll a with a I I'm not even just a you know under forty\nIf you could have every\nYou could ever knew the newest model Android or the newest model iPhones\nEvery year for the rest of your life or wisdom\nI Wonder what people would vote for but I think most people would say what do you mean that's the point it's not valued\nLet me tell you ... where this is that my whole life it it has been a ... a love I Want to understand what is wisdom understanding of life that is what wisdom is okay it's a it's it's the single word term for understanding of life\nYou can know a great deal and understand and nothing that is why the highly educated are usually the least wise members of our society\nHey because universities teach the opposite of what they teach you to be a fool in my opinion some people escape on harmed but many don't\nAnd secondly because they teach you implicitly from a explicitly that knowledge is what matters rather than wisdom\n\nWalk to what aside from political correctness and the preoccupation and race and gender what does it show that Shakespeare's poster was taken down at the University of Pennsylvania English department\nIt shows a lack of wisdom because he wrote the wisest plays written in the English language but it's not valued\nAll that matters is not wisdom but in this case race and gender so they they dismissed him because he was a white male\nAnd they put up a female I don't know what color\n\nWisdom without wisdom you can't do good\nThis and good is what most concerns me good versus evil you can't be a good person if if you're a fool and the food is the opposite of the white person and those of you who are biblical you oriented build that the word food is used pretty often\nWell let's see fool the food was the person without wisdom doesn't mean a person without compassion so let me talk to you about compassion for a moment wisdom is infinitely more important than compassion in setting social policy\n\nWith me if it's if if you just hear that today it will be very important if if only that sinks in in making political social policy for a society wisdom is infinitely more important than compassion\nCompassion without wisdom is destructive\n\nAnd that's what we have that is what we have in the western world vast amount of compassion or pseudo compassionate doesn't matter even if it's genuine compassion but compassion without wisdom is overly destructive\nSo I feel bad for people I'm not going to get into policies are going to continue the discussion about wisdom but I give you an example here I\nFeel bad for people who don't have as much as others and so we will give them more benefits\nBut the wise person asks what are you doing to that person and to the society by giving them more and more people benefits\nIs it good for society is a different question that's a question of wisdom is it compassionate is not a question that has anything to do with the wisdom\n\nCompassion without wisdom is destructive\n\nAnd we don't produce people with wisdom because wisdom is and talk wisdom isn't soft it isn't taught because it isn't solved\n\nI Believe ultimately that the radical secularization of western society is at the core of the lack of wisdom\n\nWhen I get calls this I have I Know I mentioned before when I get calls year\nFrom let's say twelve or Fifteen year old and the kid talks about important things of life I Am certain that they are in a religious home and in every case that it's turned out to be true\nThe twelve or Fifteen year old if they would even listen to discussions of grave issues like I have on my show even if they even will they would call in about let's save the planet\nThey wouldn't call in about an issue of wisdom\nThey would be worried for people they would be again compassionate without wisdom\n\nThis is the great problem they realized that in college so I have all these professors were very very bright very very male legible on early on wise\nThey didn't understand life\nI fear for a society that this Knoxville you wisdom and that is happening and all of western society\n\nWhen a Prager seven seven six is the number eight seven seven to for three triple seven six\nWisdom will create a much better society than compassion I Love compassion [noise] but you can't make policy um compassion you make policy with wisdom [noise]\nYes indeed you handle the most recently [noise]\nCame for rehabilitation forming when we come back\nPeople without wisdom and that's why I'm On the on the issues that

I\nI don't know a white person who was in kind but I have plenty of kind people who are wise so I'm Glad you called them play be stuck to the topic close you ever since I don't know who you are I only take your calls\nBecause the subject has intrigued me so please understand that's why I wanted to probe so I'm very glad that she stuck to it because it's ... that wisdom cookie or fortune cookie I should\nSay let me give ... was the cookie was wrong type misses not wisdom\nI Wish it were much better society that's why people get confused because a lot of ... people lack wisdom\nAnd they're very appealing kind people are appealing for obvious reasons they should be\nSt Petersburg Florida and ... hello ...

who ordered the three week quick star now only Nineteen Ninety five and go on to order more [noise] let's see if we can get you out of paying to go to relieve factor ...\nThis is a um twelve fifty to answer the following program it's sponsored by Conti law\n\n[noise]\nOn the line there has to change\nWhere we kind of sounds conveniently ... countries are we\nAre focused on a state planning states ministry ration tax planning elder law manners and if you listen to their past few shows\nI've been delving more into the detail but the difference between what a well is in the various types of trust with alcohol trust pets mentoring trust\nIf you didn't tune in to us I'm gonna give you a free free capital flip the differences are\nObviously a well is your legal document which states who gets your assets to get your staff upon your passing and who the executor is the person who's in charge of managing\n\nThe settlement on the state as well as distribution then we have a ... trust which again keep in mind is just the contrast between the party who created it asked me to grant or\nThe party who manages that that's the trustee and who gets it upon your passing that the beneficiary then last shall we ended with disgusting\nTestimony trust which again is a fancy way to say a trust that created in your will so if you didn't listen last week I'm going to continue with the example I gave I have a well\nIn it I named my executive or the person who's going to settle my state and I have two kids and there's various reasons to create a testament to trust in my example\nI said I have two children who are minors I Want them to get my things\nBut I Want to control when they get it and why they get it and how much they get so even though I said upon my death my stuff goes equally between my two kids ...\n\nBut it doesn't go to them immediately\nSo and my example my kids are for they couldn't get my stuff but let's pretend they're Eighteen and they're twins I don't trust them I don't think they should get a large amount or even a little amount at Eighteen\nAnd what this testimony trust does is allow me to put their share their fifty percent into their own trust to grow and be managed by my trustee\nSo they don't use it for things\nThat aren't reasonable and I know I've always given you my story about the Twenty one twenty two year old who went out and bought a Bentley or the kids who go and blow it by taking a trip to Vegas or blow up by I'm investing in something that's silly\nSo there's testimony trust allows me to name a party to act as the trustee so in this instance some of the name my brother less safe so Scott is going to be the trustee to manage and look after the money\nUntil my kids attain the age of distribution so if you remember last week I said my kids wouldn't get any money outright free of trust until\nThey get a third at thirtieth or thirty five and a third of forty that doesn't mean my trust the cannot make distributions or invade that money invade that trust and pay for their education\nPay for any health issues health related expenses maintenance and support those are your typical standards of when the money can be invaded so to speak but the kids my kids won't have direct\nAccess to those fun\nSo let's get into so we discuss the difference between the well which is just an outright but let me let me take a step back what if you pass away without a will you don't have any of this and for whatever reason I always\nPrior to being able to re qualify for Medicaid and this is in the instance that if I'm gone somebody else who's going to help him apply in and re qualified attest to mentor each trust that I created in my will\nThat says upon my passing my husband gets my stuff but he doesn't get it out right he's going to get it in a form of a test of memory trust for his benefit where I name\nA trustee to his trust somebody who's going to be able to take my place and manage and invest and oversee this trust keep\nIn mind testimony ... irrevocably all but that trust what outlined how the trust\nAnd the trust assets will be managed and those circumstances that it will terminate\nSo rather than have my beneficiary get a large sum of money that's the instance with the minor we create the ... trust will allow the trustee to manage and distribute the money\n\nIn my instance this example my husband has cognitive issues and he's on governmental benefits I don't want him to lose those benefits just because I die\n\nSo we'll make sure that we plan ahead and put his share and to this testimony trust\nWhich allows him the best of both worlds it allows him to continue to receive those benefits\nAnd it allows would I leave him to supplement his lifestyle keep in mind governmental benefits only cover so many things certain things they may not cover new hearing aids new glasses\nHair cut clothing what if he needs one of those chairs are chair lift that helps him up and down\nThat governmental benefits may not provide for those expenses and this testimony trust will\nWhat is the person I'm leaving it too has a drug or alcohol problem\nSame holds true what if I'm leaving it to somebody who has terrible money management skills we work with a financial coach who will sit down with that beneficiary and help them or even the parents creating it\nAnd help them come up with a plan to make sure that that money will continue continue to grow can you continue to be there for their benefit\nBut not allow them to fall prey to inheriting a large sum of money and blowing it so we can put a trust together and you're well or in your revoke will trust\nThat is very specific instructions or has very specific conditions or distribution\nTime frames so that this money can be protected for your loved one\nI always say we're controlling it from the grave some people like some people don't but it's an advantage and it's an additional technique in tool that we have\nSo we can make sure we use\nEvery single law allows us to use to provide for your loved ones we can also create\nAnd I talked about this a bit a little bit last week a supplemental special needs trust and this trust is a tool that is designed to help take care of a loved one or a beneficiary obviously your loved one um who has some sort of disability\nOr who may be receiving some sort of Social Security\nSupplemental income so that's a side\n\nAgain maybe they're receiving Medicaid it allows your beneficiary the best of both worlds to have this benefit continue\n\nSo they won't lose benefits be kicked off of their benefits this can be a disabled child or an adult that otherwise would be lost due to being over resourced\nI hear this a lot you know my mom left my kid who has some form of disability money\nIn her well she wanted to help to ... you know make sure that we could take care of\nOf Johnny but she did it in the wrong way she left it to them out right as opposed to in a third party supplemental special needs trust\nI hear this a lot over and over again\nUnfortunately is grandma already passed away in her will is being pro baited it has to go to Johnny outright otherwise he has to just claim as interest in that inherited if he accepts the inheritance then we're gonna have\nTo put together first parties special needs trust which goes against what grandma's plans were\nIf you have a first party trust\n\nIt doesn't allow them to have their cake and eat it to what it does is it stays okay my benefits can continue but upon my death if there's any money left over\n\nAny governmental institution who was giving me benefits during my lifetime is now a creditor\nAnd has a claim and there's a beneficiary of this trust they get paid back first so we have to make sure that even though grandma has good intentions\nTo help with Johnny care upon her passing we have to make sure she's doing it in using the correct\nToll that will allow Johnny the best of both worlds\nSo we have to make sure Johnny is not over resource while at the same time allowing\n\nFor whatever the future holds health matters education any sort of lifestyle payment we have to make sure that we plan\nWe want to make sure they're seen to that their wishes\nNot only does a seat in the person who died their wishes are seen to we want to make sure the beneficiaries taking care of\n\nLastly not lastly but for today's show\nBesides your will passing without a will a revoke ... trust a test of men are each trust again they all have their own places in this state planning world\nWhat about ... irrevocably trust why would we use utilize an asset protection trust that's what we call it\nFor the planning in Medicaid purposes well\nJust hearing the title of it irrevocably you know that it cannot\nBe changed after we've created at once we've put something into that trust so we transfer it into the trust\n\nIt in there the person who created that trust can't touch it they can't change it but if it's created\nIn the right sense if it's created using what the law allows us to maybe\nWe allow that person who created it some control maybe we allow them\nUse of that asset that transferred into that irrevocably trust maybe we name a protector\nTrustee or protector trustees who will help and assist the creator of that trust to get something out of the trust\n\nNow in most instances when irrevocably trust is created were doing so so that the creator can receive income\nFor life that person again is called the grand toward the person created it but the now this is if we're putting money in investment into their trust the grand\nTour is capable of receiving income but keep in mind they cannot invade the principle of that asset upon their passing that principle is paid\nI end the dot com and go under the events tab and see where those are we have classes at the CIA the at the south campus we have classes at the Boise campus of community college\nWe have workshops that are in the waterfront area and again all great informational items that you can tap into so again this energy group Inc dot com website or give us a call to register inquire about what's coming up in your area next\nSo that you can take this next step and reserve you're spot now eight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three and even if you're not ... if you don't say look I don't need to just sign up for a class I Need personalized information I Need it now\nAgain you can schedule that free consultation to get that second opinion and make sure you have the right plan at eight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three\nUnless you're just joining us we're discussing when leaving a job should you take you four one K. with you and we're going to explore the pros and cons of taking your four one K. or a retirement plan of which you where you either change jobs or you finally decide to retire\nWe're also going to tell you how you may find missing money and your four one K. so don't touch that dial stay with us for the entire show\nI think that there is a huge distinction a very important one but two for one k.'s and what they offer and what I or aids can offer now it'll be a lot of ... uh what we talk about here on the program today\nFor one case for oh three bees thrift savings plans if you're a government employee or strictly retirement savings plans\nThey are not and I repeat not retirement income plants\nIf your age fifty you're older you should be preparing for how you're going to turn your retirement savings\nSo this plan that you build up for savings into retirement income and four one K. is another employer savings plans were not designed to do that that's not the goal that they were out there to accomplish they were set up for you to be able to accumulate to be able to save money that's that's why they're called a savings plan\nAnd not a retirement income plant again and if you phrase it another way they are designed to help you get to retirement not through retirement\nYou know what that's a really good point and I think that's a point that a lot of people mess because there used to that\nThey're used to savings that used to looking at return on investment and not how much that investment can yield when it comes to income so you may be wondering what your options are now when you do change jobs and there's actually three choices that you have\nAnd which option is best for you well that depends I mean these are all individual choices and they're custom tailored that's why we offer are on track retirement review service and that points in the right direction you know give you confidence to know that you made the right decision and that you're on the right track so\nLet's get into those three options of what to do with your four one K. when you change jobs and and the first thing that you can do is obviously nothing just leave the money in your own four o one K plan\nAnd you can uh just let it continue to grow and there may be a minimum balance required if you leave your money with your old company\nBut most companies will allow you to do that you know that said there are a few downsides to keeping that four one K. where his\nOne you can no longer contribute to it so it's kind of a dormant account it it's not really going to continue to do what you want us to do and to you're going to have multiple four one K. plans floating around if your new position offers one and you take advantage of that\nPlus if you're old company gets bought or switches four one K. providers now you don't know you're lugging information a year and count number can change it could be a bit of a pain to figure all of that out leading your funds with your previous employers definitely an option but typically the downsides mean that it's not the best option\nYeah absolutely and I mean and there are other options so you look at doing nothing with some kind of eloquently laying out\nNow the second option is if you're working for a new company which I'm assuming if you're not there anymore unless you're retired\nThat the company that you work for now has a new employer plan a new four one K. if they accept rollovers this could be an option especially if you've looked at the marketplace and obviously I think you can understand our advice they were looking at the differences between IRAs and leaving the money in the four oh one K.\nBut if you have to have consolidation if it drives you crazy to have things in multiple places with your retirement savings plan then yes rolling it into your existing plan could be an option now getting you have to look at the fees you have to look at the limitations in terms of what can I invest and but that is certainly an option that's on the table\nNow moving forward from those two I think the third option and this is one that will spend a little bit more time talking back it's\nSport but that's the option to roll up four one K. or that for oh three be to an individual retirement account or an IRA normally it would be a traditional I write so that you're not paying current taxes\nBut this is a great option because I raise can typically have a lot more investment choices and I think that's what I Want to spend time talking about they're both retirement accounts\nYou just get to pick when you pay the taxes that that's what that means you don't pay the taxes and so you have to withdraw the money\nWhich is either going to be when you want to or at least you have to start at that Seventy and a half\nAnd there's a difference there are and the biggest difference or the choices you have to invest your money and Terri let's talk a little bit about why that's important the closer we get to retirement to have more and more choice on how we allocate these dollars and what an IRA might offer over four one K. why is it important to investors\nLoans it's important but let me say this first these are the kinds of things that we talk about when we teach those classes out of ... voice and see see see south and pick Greensburg\nWe spent a lot of time on for one case and we talk about the hidden fees that are in for one case we talk about the limited choices that are available as far as investments go\nAnd we talked about what's really important with that four one K. money I'm going to go back to what you said at the beginning of the shows you a is it's a savings plan not an income plan so when you start getting closer to retirement age or you start looking at preparing a plan for retirement\nThat four O. one K. if it becomes available to you certainly should be rolled into an IRA because the investment choices that you have at that point or almost unlimited right and you start building an income planned for retirement not just the savings plans for retirement so you look at what's out there in the investment world\nAnd you start considering choices that are going to give you the best predictable income stream that you can get remember this is retirement money folks decision saving money decision I'm going to go out and buy a boat or a you know a a retirement home vacation home kind of money because the tax implications are just not attractive\nBut if you're going to take this money and build an income stream or a pension to yourself and you certainly need to step out of the restrictions and the four o one K plan and look at what's available in the marketplace\nAnd let me lay out a a practical reason what he's talking about here and and understanding that when you have a four O. one K. let's talk about the typical options\nSo we look at the investment options in our four one K. and a lot of times we see a bunch of stock funds or will see a large gap in mid cap a small cap probably a balanced fund probably a few international funds maybe one being emerging markets\nAnd we see these target date funds are great Danes lines are twenty twenty twenty Fifteen you know three thousand\nAnd let me say this if you're not familiar with those let me just say this and I mean\nThis in in no disparaging way but there's target date funds are almost like investing for dummies you know you want to set it and forget it right and if you're going to use a target date fund inside your current four one K.\nMy suggestion or and this is just general information use only that target date fund don't go into other funds and that because you're going to have significant over\nYeah there's a ton of overlap there and um I had the honor of working with US News and World Report if you Google my named Jason

together to make changes at fifty nine and a half which is what her plan allows well\nThere was some shakeup in management and she is changing jobs and she's going to land on her feet she's going to
