we have the fact that apparently China has weaponized commercial technology and the and I mean maybe there was an arms race we weren't even part of it ah your choice where do you want to go first about either of these incredibly important stories\nA week and do either one of just arbitrarily pick a shocking\nAll right go ahead what do we what what are the stakes and what are we to be demanding and doing [noise]\n[noise] well the stakes are huge and I think\nYou know where I went to with this you was the context\nOkay and the context is that Trump has done a pretty good job at this point\nOf rebuilding the paradigm the the set of partnerships that we've always used I mean since Camp David accords and the Iranian Revolution that we use to protect our interests and that is a partnership with Egypt Jordan Israel\nSeveral of the Gulf states and off and on Saudi Arabia so yes we need to put pressure on the Saudis and we were to make very clear that we don't like this but this is one of these instances where we got to remember\nYou know we're the friend that liberty everywhere but the custodian only about ... and we have to tend to America's interests and I tell my friends who\nAnd I share this you know who who want human rights to be\nAn object of our policy I Believe in that but I'm the I'm the ... the prospering of human rights around the world hands on the continued security and vitality of\nOf the United states so yes we have to pressure them but I think we also have to understand that right now we're working with them and a lot of areas\nThat do you think that the market collapse as I'm concerned over this the Dow down eight hundred and thirty one point yesterday it's often other two hundred and twenty in the free market there there are some worry that there's a rupture afford\nWell potentially although they are going to ask about the market either get Kudlow or somebody like me I you know I don't know we'll see if this continues um actually I I mean I always these things as kind of a correction until something you know something emerges show different\nAll right let's move over to the fact of the Bloomberg report that the Chinese have been weaponized seeing the commercials say a commercial product stuff that everybody buys they had been weaponized and that would be an arms race in which we were not participants 'cause we don't do that\nYeah and they do this and first of all\nThere's almost no civil military divide\nIn China all the companies all the efforts are are directed towards the end state uh they're producing a lot of the components that are used in information technology communications infrastructure around the world and there's been a concern for a long time about what they may be planting and those components and this is going to get\nThis is going to get bigger as five gee comes along and and and the number of those of those devices and the importance of them got every aspect of life you know multiplies geometric one it's a real challenge and I'm I'm ... glad the administration is focused so much in this national competition is long overdue\nWho has the lead on this\nIt's an interagency thing you and that's part of the problem is\nThat's not good yeah well I understand but we're not organized I mean Trump has a trauma street had to do a lot of things at once one of them has to consider how we organize or the government to deal with this you know it's like\nTrying like when we built the architecture of the Cold War national security policy took a decade right so we got to do it quicker than that I Would say that the commerce trade representative DOD has a lot to say about it because the court they have a lot of these devices it's homeland\nUm it's a whole lot of different

should do it by the way with regard it as Audi I met her dressing that we are seeing them I mean what we need to call 'em out on and we just have to be sensitive to the broader context here I think it's a tremendously good pressure Boyd again she's not just the ...\nWhat they're doing in Hong Kong or what they're doing generally just social credit system they're developing the minute we control the lives of their people\nYeah they're sensitive to that and we should use it as a pressure point that's one area I've not seen a lot out of the Trump Administration yet although other vice

Floridian I Want to begin with Marco Rubio sounds distraught and everything I see from Panama City and I hear from ten they'll air force base is homestead after ... what's\nYour ear and yeah yeah and you know you got to remember this part of the state you know it's interesting it just doesn't get hit\nWith with the mild hurricanes either this is for some reason the way that they turn they either make a you know go slightly south of that area and will you know across the state essentially just north of the ... uh interstate or they fear a little farther to the west it hit where I have family in Pensacola\nI mean this was so odd perhaps the panhandle hidden and to call it basically all I got to understand um it's so this part of Florida see it's it's a double whammy here it's the ... you know one of the most powerful storms in the history\nHey in an area that hasn't been hit very often\nSo it just adds to the devastation because you haven't had the clearing out of trees with smaller storms in the same way you do in other parts of the state so just doubles the impact and then just think it was just the only good news is that it moves fast that's the only good now\nI remember after a homestead the Indians were gonna move spring training camps that ... that was gone that air force base is gone I Wonder if ten Dale isn't done what I'm hearing is true luckily they got all the people out there are thousands of military families ran in the left\nAnd here's here's the thing you and I both know\nWe the the ... the Pentagon thinks there are too many base within the country but there's no political will to close them but if any of them I don't work they get close to what happened to 'em said yup well look I remember a homestead was going to be our new airport you know that was that was another idea to try to you know instead of trying to ... you know try to expand Miami international\nAirport which is some argue too close to downtown as it is right for flight paths and things like that and and you know what it just didn't happen unfortunately home states to to to sort of not\nWasn't was which is too far south for the rest of the population and that's my fear of what's going to happen to Kendall and they're not my fear of what's gonna happen with the beach communities will rebuild\nUm because you know those people are pirates\nAnd and I say that is [laughter] I Know what I mean I just saw it I mean I I you know that they're not nine to five or some of the man to elements of the top of some of the the these are people that I Want to be in my next nine to five and a resilient\nTheir resilience they'll rebuild but it it is going to have a big devastating impact on the economy\nAll right well what let's switch to a story I Do not know Jamal ... I read his stuff in the post for a long time I am pursuing the story with the vice president yesterday and will continue to do so a senior administration officials today\nIt comes in the context of a very delicate relationship last night run termer and Yusef aloe tie be actually had dinner together that a a event honoring Mike pump pales in this context is an incredibly sensitive relationship but an outrageous extrajudicial apparently murder\nCue this is going to be look I think this is going to be a long term\nFight inside this country and said this government about what to do and I said it's really inside the government I think you may see I think that I as you know the Trump Administration is very close ties with the Gulf states and other Gulf leaders led by NBS um all of it has been about trying to\nCreate a coalition essentially against Iran you know we know what the strategic reason is ... ... it's all about Iran\nBut you know how much how much can you look the other way on this\nI mean this is and I can tell you you can't\nAnd I don't think the diplomatic humidity is going to allow you know this idea you know the president is already pushing back on the idea of of sanctions hey we've got too many other things going on with the country the relationship is too big I had to tell you I think when you see I think there's going to be this is going to be just like with Russia\nWhere there's going to be a bipartisan um groundswell\nTo punish Saudi Arabia here including from corporate America look I think at the end of the day the most effective tool against the Saudis on this affect the punishment\nIs going to be inflicted by corporate America more than it is by the United states of America or in the government because uh you know and the scares a lot about it about Saudi Arabia's reputation around there\nI and I I\nI think you already set up a company that there is I get to a tech conference with the times pulled out a whole bunch of tech leaders say well I didn't know I was on that press release so I think they went to sing on that\nNow by that desert is over a ... why do you think it is likely that the Henry the second defense\nComes up you know he says well no one read me of this metal some priest in for crusader run over and killed back and do you think we'll get the the offering up that ah someone just read this the wrong way and that NBS didn't want to kill the wanted and brought back\nOh well I've already look Richard Engel reported on my show two days ago\nThat there's already shatter that this was a rendition gone bad\nIt was supposed to die um and that that was an accident um\nThat'd be a better measure that make that that one thing to say\nUm but right now they're still just denying anything ever happened so look there is\nI find it fascinating at how comfortable ... how aggressive Turkey's being on this I I have to have to admit I was skeptical that they would be the ... just aggressive ah I I'm I'm Still waiting for him to get there to want on this one all that said\nWe should live in the real world on on this when it comes to Saudi Arabia NBS\nIs trying to essentially eliminate all his enemy whether their family members are not right he's trying to consolidate power people that try to consolidate power also become um become potential targets I didn't give me if\nI just think that that that Saudi Arabia power struggle is something that it's going to become the foreign policy challenge for this country for some time I have a feeling that it may get uglier inside the kingdom for India\nInteresting answers let's switch to the cabinet of fact I think Eric Holder's videotape Secretary Clinton's comments\nHave arm the Republicans to take what was\nA big story in turn it into a category five story I think it's going to drive like the ... or work numbers this morning are terrible for him a Martha McSally is gaining I think Jon Tester's in a fight now how long does it last Chuck Todd and why do you think it lasts that long if at all\nI mean here's the here's here's the good news we're going in the field Sunday\nFor national um in fact I just did an event last night with I'm In a Wall Street journal ... and myself we did an event with our two pollsters bill McInturff compared yang asked him this very question when are you going to feel comfortable to know a if there's how long the cabin outback\nIs going to be there and and and how and how real is it and you know uh\nBasically asked you know the the magic eight ball says ask me again in a week you know you got to see is it how to stay in a bowl is it it's pretty clear that red got redder\nOkay that's clear what's not clear and both of our pollster for saying that last night in the places that were bad for Republicans they're still bad for Republicans right in suburban America so it it's very possible that we are on this bizarre trajectory\nWhere we could have a forty feet half gain an edge on for the Democrats and the two seats and again for the Republican\nI just right now is the this map is that\nWas our air rapidly bizarre I\nI don't know if you saw Jacob sober off [laughter] see I that's not very far from where I live where I'm In California walking along talking to UCI students none of whom care a lick about that [laughter]\nSo disappointing to people like you and me and they wouldn't believe it either so are we again over estimating the people out there versus the people living inside the beltway who just feed on this\nYou know it's funny you we we had we had we had a debate in my that many yesterday actually\nOr two days ago about this is ... is saying they were to to to um to a presidential campaign event remember the reaction of Democrats after the Denver debate\nBasically first week of October oh my God this whole thing's crashing down Romney's on the move Republicans felt good Democrats felt bad entering central and then you know and turned out nothing really changed\nAnd then how about four years later and the Access Hollywood tape really literally about the same time and you're thinking avoids has over a Republicans were panic everything with so I think the lesson both of twelve and sixteen tells us what\nWhat happens in the last week of September of the first big October might not\nMatter as much as we\nLike to echo I examples to very real example I get my regards to John Racine are both wearing ... over the Yankees and the Indians so ah it's been a sad way down on them\nI Will say this as a pure baseball fan I Am looking forward to this Red Sox are a after a series I

made it to the top of seminary rich\n... this might be the high watermark of liberal party let's hope so and only time will tell if I'm All right we'll we'll know during the mid term elections\nI got to be the high watermark of the left wing not hers in that exactly I mean that that's what is on display right now is it there in the role of left wing gutters\nAnd also I'm making the White House White House dot Gov host Hillary saying we've got to have stability and then post Maxine Waters in their face if you see a member of this administration get in their face and yell and scream at them if if Trump will post that White House dot go all the media bias as\nWell you're you're not allowed to use you're not allowed to use White House dot Gov for political campaign purposely yards he can do it and we can do it and we will do it we played every single day and people just got to get out there and make that message so thank you my friend for doing so but wherever you are if you're going to vote early\nVote early and tell everyone do not vote for one Democrat from top to bottom it's a simple reason\nThat which gets rewarded gets repeated if you want more chasing Ted Cruz out of ... if you want more people breaking through barricades at the Supreme Court you more of a people running up and down the Senate\nBeing paid disagreement senators you want more Sarah Huckabee Sanders being thrown out of a restaurant you want more of that ... that softball field shooting then your reward them for this you want more Michael ... then you vote Democrat\nIf you want to review that\nAnd you want more Brett Kavanaugh you want more civility\nYou want more in terms of growth and economic a\nRenaissance that we've got underway and go and vote Republican up and down the ticket do not\nDon't even get close to hesitate to get out there early I Know some people are traditionalists than you like to wait and vote and get your little sticker no no go and vote today go and vote\nToday do not wait you can go to an early voting both in in Indiana I think there's some open in Indiana do\nMontana if you can go register for an absentee to be sent to go and do so do wait a day act on it\nWhen it's fresh in your mind tell everyone I'm so angry I went and I voted early for the Republican I voted for Matt Rosendale in Montana and lay Abu clear in Wisconsin and John James in Michigan and a a gym or an AC in Ohio and Rick Scott in Florida and Ted Cruz in Texas and especially Martha McSally in Arizona\nThis bill Mike Gallagher show we've got a crucial midterm election coming up in November ... we're not going to make America great again was never the\nRay since Nineteen Seventy eight ... voice of clarity for millions of America [laughter]\n\nIf we are fortunate enough to win back\nThe house handles ... started the\nShow known by the most famous man on a plane\nAnd you've been grade Mike and I appreciate it very much you notice I walked over here very quickly\nNow from the relief factor dot com studios my luggage [noise]\n\nPretty astounding thing is happening in America will recognize you the Democrats are absolutely fine with the regime\nMob mentality I don't know that you can find more establishment Democrat than Eric Holder Eric Holder is often mentioned as a presidential candidate Eric Holder the former attorney general under Brock Obama said something this week that I don't hear many Democrats condemn\nUm in fact we were used in the show opened you might've heard a bit of it a moment ago I'm not certain that there is a Democrat alive who has a problem with what he said and varying varying lies to reveal\nI Need to I Need to spend a minute and reveal and and and let's let's just bask in the transparency\nOf the bad shape the Democrats are facing that they're in right now I mean Democrats still remain the favorite to win back the house um they always had a long shot bit of taking the Senate that was what they had hoped\nBut now that appears to be demean even further pools are suggesting that Republican voters are re engaged over the Brett Kavanaugh battle maybe even by the way Democrats are behaving these days and manner they behaving badly\nAnd for some reason those same pollsters though she just but it's not going to be so good for Republicans on the house side that somehow Democrats are going to take control of the house\nWhich would be very bad [laughter] make no mistake about it that'd be a problem that would be um I I catastrophic is an exaggeration but it would be really really bad for the Democrats to take control of the house [noise]\nBut for the first time in a few weeks a new poll is showing Martha ... shyly springing out to a a a big lead over a cure student should among uh in North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp is done I mean her prophetic explanation\nOf why she voted no on Brett Kavanaugh how she was ready to vote yes until she turned the audio off\nAnd Shaw just video so his body language led to hurt no vote\nThat takes put pitiful pathetic\nDo a whole new level um and that I saw somebody on town hall or somebody say that's a clown senator that's just my bet is able to that isn't even a serious person in in public life who would even attempt such a bogus explanation I tend to agree\nSo we're going to kind of focus a little bit on some of these key congressional racism she who's vulnerable who's not\nBut I go back to the fact that I'm waiting for one Democrat to condemn the rhetoric and the violence that we're seeing editors violent when you're when you're when you scream at somebody in a restaurant and hound them\nAnd chase them out of a public place like a restaurant or a subway those are acts of violence Don Lemon that that speaking of clowns\nThe CNN clown gesture Don Lemon can try to pretend that is a\nMob violence it is when you have a group or scary people going into a husband and wife like jet and highly cruise in a restaurant and ... and cursing and hounding them out of a restaurant that's an act of violence\nYeah nobody may have been hit but violence is it a lot of forms and Democrats are embracing this\nYou don't believe me let's listen to gather Eric Holder you could watch this slip if you're a streaming the show today Mike online dot com if you're near a computer\nThis is powerful stuff because\nHe uh was in Georgia campaigning for a Democrat there\nAnd somebody had a camera in the front row thankfully and they ruled what Eric Holder talked about Michelle Obama's famous quote when they go low we go high Eric Holder rejects that clearly\nIt's just cut number one audio curve audio and video courtesy of Fox News and gravy and listen to the way a very establish Democrat describes our discourse in October of twenty Eighteen just a few weeks away from the mid term elections\nAnd it's time for us as Democrats to be as tough as they are\nTo be as dedicated as they are to me is committed and say oh\nMichele always ask yourself oh I Love her you know [noise] see my wife like really high winds slowly ...\nSounds really says that you know when they go low we don't [laughter]\nThey go low we [noise]\n\nThere you go and the audience was even a green ... with the Michelle Obama portion oh yeah that's it you hear a woman said that's it when when they go low we go high\nWell they've abandoned that they've abandoned\nThat entire premise of being civil Hillary Clinton you heard her yesterday you can't be civil with Republicans will only be civil with Republicans you said if we win if Democrats win\n\nThe courses on the president's radar last night he was an eerie Pennsylvania big rally packed house of course there were some criticism of the president going to a rally during a hurricane or\nI mean I get the criticism but you got twelve thousand people many of whom\nSpent two days camping out to see him and to participate in the rally and there's nothing that's not going to get done because he's on a ... at a rally for a few hours in Erie, Pennsylvania and the president ripped into the former A. G. Eric Holder\nEars cut number two from Fox News and gravy and as President Trump very much responded to Eric Holder's despicable\nDisgraceful nasty comments about kicking us if we go up\nHigh rallies and very peaceful and even at the beginning when there seem to be conflict they sent a people and to disrupt our rallies\nAnd when you do that you know bad things happen but they were the ones that started everything so no was it us it was it was totally the other side I I Would ever rally\nAnd paid people were going into those rallies causing trouble and in many cases it didn't work out so well for those people that are paid people were in those rallies but when I hear oh they're making a statement like he may today I think it's a disgrace\nI'm my apologies obviously that was the president was shedding Bream last night on Fox News channel calling Eric Holder's comment a disgrace\nI Wonder if we have a Democrat listening who's willing to condemn the obviously condemn mobile remarks of people like Eric Holder and Hillary Clinton or you're going to dig your heels in and pretend it's okay you think is normal and okay\nTo say we're only going to be civil if we win\nOr when they go low we kick them you think that's acceptable discourse if you're a Democrat I'd be interested in your reaction to this\nOne eight hundred six five five Mike and of course I invite everybody to join us we have an open phone line here in the relief factor dot com studios were headed to Columbus ohio big event tomorrow night I Hope if you're in the Columbus area you can join us a bunch of us onstage holding the town hall rally a civil town hall rally Ohio Dominican University\nFor tickets courtesy of our friends in Ninety eight point night FM the answer and there's a few tickets leopard still tickets available\nGo to battle ground the tour dot com and there's a link there you can click on to take you to the Columbus event tomorrow night\n... very much excited about returning to my uh\nMy home state the Buckeye State for a battleground talkers store or at Ohio Dominican University again for tickets go to battle ground tour dot com battleground tour dot com in the meantime I Hope you join me one eight hundred six five five Mike eight hundred six five five six four or five three\nAnd open the phone line your voice your call your prospective coming up\nAnd then\nIt seems like everybody I Know has been turned on to do go med dot com everybody's excited about this breakthrough online pharmacy\nAnd why wouldn't you be this is the way you get all your prescriptions delivered right to your door every month I get my monthly mess my lip a tour my hay fever medication might might nasal spray river for my allergies all delivered to my how do my home every month\nNot George ... and ... and and that that democratic candidate has said that she wants to offer free college\nChair illegals which she's basically saying she's gonna make Georgia sanctuary I\n...
