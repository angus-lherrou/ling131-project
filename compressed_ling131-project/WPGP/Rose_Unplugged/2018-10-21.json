where facility ... whenever I make sure life easier to their their information I gave it out right at Dana said a couple more times throughout shell out the thank you for tuning in today we're going to talk about the different types\nOf trash talk about a revoke will living trust why you may or may not want to use a revoke about trust\n\n[noise] so what is the trust and I'm going to water down a trusted the basically a contract\nBetween three different parties the party creating it that's the grand tour or the set more the party in charge and that's the trustee and the people are person who's going to inherit your stuff in that trust when you pass that's the beneficiary\n\nWere vocal trust is often seen as a more flexible tool because you can change it it sort of ... you can amend that you can revoke it you can terminate it\nMay be no longer want it and maybe you don't uh speak with the people who you've named in that document as your successor trustees maybe your beneficiaries have changed so we can go ahead and amend that as often as necessary\nBut why do people\nLight revoke will trust I mean I tell you why I liked them it's because you have control necessarily you have control from the grave once you've passed\nYour wishes must be seen to I like that it's flexible I like that it's a ... like we can change it as much as you want\n\nReally and why I use one is because my kids were little and I don't know how they're going to turn out what if God Forbid I passed away and they haven't become the adults\n\nThat they will be so I can see if they're good with money if they are making good choices [noise] God Forbid they have some ... some form of addiction we see this all the time you opioid epidemic\nIs devastating it doesn't discriminate doesn't discriminate on age it doesn't discriminate on race it doesn't discriminate on wealth religion your political views it has nothing to do with that I've seen\nKids of some of the ... most of flu and people here in Pittsburgh battle with opioid addiction doesn't matter\nRich or poor black or white Catholic atheist doesn't matter so those are things to keep in mind I won't know what my kids are like if I God Forbid pass away before they become adults it's like you're gambling and I hate to\nTrust her created while we're still alive they're not your assets are not automatically transferred into the trust we have to do the leg or we have to do the paperwork we do that for you\nPeople ask well what do I do how do I know what to do I don't expect you to know what to do quite frankly that's our job let us make your life easier\n\nSo that that responsibility comes down to us we prepare and you do need to make sure your real estate is funded into the trust we would read titled the ownership of your accounts no not all of your house will go into that trust but some of them will\nSo we were re titled the ownership to put them in the name of your trust we would change your beneficiaries to make sure that those account you do not want to go out right to somebody and you want them to be funded into your trust that your death do\nWhat we've seen many reasons we've seen many instances I should say where\n\nAnother law from another attorney drafted your trust ... didn't transfer the assets into that trust and the failure to transfer assets\nResult resulted in a complete\nDevastation of watcher original plan was you have to be where\n\nI'll give you a perfect example we do a ton of special needs planning whether it be a third party supplemental trust her first party trust whether the beneficiary\n\nHas Down syndrome and the beneficiary has Alzheimer's doesn't matter [noise] I've seen plans implode because\nThe next step wasn't taken so when I review that I'm going to ask the same questions what's been put into your trust what's been funded have your beneficiaries been changed here's a perfect example\n\nWe have a trust we have a will whatever document were using\nThen make sure\nJohnny share of his money his inheritance goes into a third party trust\nSo that his benefits will continue upon this inheritance\nThat's great for what's in your trust if you don't take into consideration Johnny share of your life insurance Johnny share of your four one K. are re investment\nNo let me back up and say we want to make sure he gets his share we don't want him to some hair did that's not the point we want to make sure\n\nHe'd get what you want him to get and take advantage of the governmental benefits at the same time let's get your cake and eat it too\nIf we don't update those beneficiary designations\nTo hold true to Johnny third party special third party supplemental special needs trust\nAnd we leave it to him outright no matter how much work we did in your will in your trust by creating a third party trust if we don't have the correct beneficiary designation on those\nPolicies he may lose his benefits when he received that inheritance he may have to create a different type of special needs trust upon your passing just because we didn't update the beneficiaries\nSo rather than his share going into the third party trust allowing him to continue to receive benefits if we didn't do that\nAnd he receives an inheritance outright and he's receiving some form medical assistance Social Security Medicaid\nHe's going to have to get that inherently out of his name within the first month of receiving it put it into\nAn approved\nSpecial needs trust so he can continue to receive his benefits\nAnd then upon his death anything left in that trust\n\nWill go back to the state of Pennsylvania as the primary beneficiary because they're the creditor\nIf he's receiving benefits so there's a lot that goes into it we just need to make sure all of our I's are dotted and teaser crossed I'm not here to scare you but these things happen because we're not thinking of everything we're not\nJust because we're updating our well doesn't mean we've updated are non probative all\nAssets and their beneficiary designations\n\nThat's really important another important topic and I may not gets all of the examples today [noise] but is a testament hurry trust what the heck is a test of memory trust\nWell\nTested men are each trust is different from a revoke will trust remember\nThere were both will trust is a contract so to speak between the grand tour of the person who's creating it trustee the person who's managing it and the beneficiary the person or people who benefit from the trust when you die\n\nThe tests the memory trust instead it's created upon your passing so upon the grand tour is passing\n\nThe terms of that trust as well as who will serve as a trustee or beneficiary are contained in your will\nSo let's say I die I have my will created that says upon my dad passed this chunk will go into this remainder trust testimony trust for my kids and Suzie will act as the trustee\n... over the beneficiaries\nKeep in mind this testimony trust it's created upon my death by terms drafted in my will is zero vocal and this testimony trust will just outline the management of my terms of that trust\n\nAnd describe when my kids trust will terminate\n\nThere are many reasons why you may or may not want to create a test to marry trust but one of the most common ones like I've been saying my kids are minors there for\n\nI Want to make sure that they don't receive a lump sum that they don't receive a direct distribution at the age of Eighteen\nOr Twenty one\nNow my opinion may differ from yours I've had clients who come in who say my kid is very responsible the age of Fifteen when they turn Eighteen or Twenty one they should get it out right in the event that I die what works for you may not work for everybody else\nSo a testament to trust him my example works well for my kids because they are minors I don't know how mature there'll be if I passed away suddenly or unexpected\nAnd quite frankly I don't want them to get a large amount of money\nOr assets directly upon my death so there's testimony trust will allow me\nTo name a successor trustee I'm Sorry to name a trustee of their trust to manage the assets to manage the money and make distributions of those assets\nAnd a specified time that I say I so I can control from the grave\nMaybe I Want them to get an outright distribution at different ages and I've I've used my own documents as examples in the past\n... I Will I have a test memory trust treated for each child they'll get a third of what's humiliated at the age of thirty\nA thirty thirty five and a third at forty and in the interim my trust the can manage that money invest it even invade the principal to make distributions maybe they have educational bills that\nNeed paid\nMaybe they have health issues they get their bills I don't want them living under a bridge I Want to make sure that their rent or their mortgages paid or that they have a suitable downpayment for a house\nThese are all things we can control by having a testament trust built into our well\nAnd get a review um especially in these times that we're gonna talk about today\nAddressing market risk and the volatility that exists give us a call at eight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three\nWell you know Jay since you're talking about classes and and different things like that we've got a bunch of stuff going on\nSo folks if you would go to our website at synergy group\nInc dot com that's synergy spelled s as in Sam Y. N. E. argue why\nThe word group I and C. dot com go to our events tab you're going to see that there are lots of opportunities for you to come out and learn a lot more about the things that you're missing when it comes to your own retirement planning and folks there are lots and lots of holes in them both these days\nYou want to make sure that you got your volatility covered you want to make sure that you got income for life covered you want to make sure that you address long term care exposure legacy planning\nAll of those things that are important when it comes to your retirement make sure that you get an opportunity to address those things come out to one of our classes or come to one of our live workshops good opportunities again for you to increase the knowledge base and make sure that you're on the right track\nYeah I mean today we're discussing the for solutions to address market riskier in locks on your retirement and we're doing this because we've helped many clients for many years planned and work towards\nTheir financial future by a lot of this done by building retirement income plans which is the foundation of any retirement plan is knowing where your income is going to come from to allow you to retire on your terms and ultimately avoid the shortfalls in retirement goal financial confidence is folks it's freedom it's about extracting more joy out of life\nMore time with your family more time to travel and more ways to create the special memories\nOr that will last a lifetime and the only way that that's possible is with an all encompassing plan that first and foremost addresses market risk now yes we need to address taxes we need to address income planning but we need to deal with risk as well and retirement and a detailed customized plant can really give you the clarity and confidence that you need\nYou know maybe you're listening to us right now and you feel like your current financial plan is is doing okay you know it's it isn't doing as good as it did last year but let's face it nothing bad enough has happened maybe weren't you to make any changes yet\nYou know Jack Welch says change before you have to so why are you waiting for something bad happened why are you just kind of setting hoping the market turns back and the two thousand Seventeen folks you know in my opinion waiting until something bad happens is the worst thing that you can do it's like putting your seatbelt on after a car crash\nIt won't help afterwards you've got to put it on before you put it in gear and an article on today's show is that help you out of crash avoiding system into your investments to give you this protection that you need\nSo there's always a chance the market's going to get more votes towel and that can certainly affect your financial plans in a negative way folks if I could have told you that those or if I could have sold those folks that retired in two thousand and eight\nThat they could have made major changes to build their retirement and protected before\nThat market drop or the people that retired in the year two thousand that we could have built a plan to protect it before that market got creamed in two thousand two thousand one two thousand two everybody would have made those decisions and that's kind of where you're at now we don't know when it's going to crash but you're listening to us right now\nThere's your sign you need to do something your financial confidence is too important\nAnd you have the opportunity to plan before that next big dropped a don't just wonder if you end up financially independent do something about it give us a call eight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three of the eight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three and make sure that you are on track towards retirement\nBefore we dive into today's topic let's talk about this week's ... because as we say every week you need your health to enjoy your well\nThis is a information from an article that was put out by the Mayo Clinic and this has to do with sleep steps at six steps to better sleep is the name of the article\nAnd you think about all the factors that can interfere with a good night's
