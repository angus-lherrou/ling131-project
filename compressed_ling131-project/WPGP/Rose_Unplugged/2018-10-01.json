was the most despicable member of the committee airing allegation than asking questions about rape on a boat that just was totally fabricated\nAnd he went to the media with it he gave it to the media and made it into the media and that person is going to go to jail\nThat person is going to go to jail they called back and they said sorry I made that up but it's too late that Mark Twain said allies halfway around the world before ... gives its boots on and everybody in the country knows it and they're coming after democratic ... vote for\nTwo three four as with the first two hours I'm only talking to women callers today and boy are they serious indeed there is a serious backlash growing against Democrats for their descent into McCarthyism over Brett Kavanaugh but the Saturday Night live mocking them\nFor the latest reporting I turned to Mike Allen of Axios am Mike good morning I Am told my reporting is that Mitch McConnell may bring\nA file for cloture tonight which would mean the cloture vote would be Wednesday in the final broke on Thursday do you have any contrary or additional supplemental reporting on that\nAs you I can tell you that the White House and Capitol Hill are actually very quickly reporting in the New York times this morning that the president in an epithet\nLay the call we would call a at a school to Mitch McConnell and uh\nSaid that they should have just dam bond with this through earlier and you here's why the hurt or actually is popped up a story saying that Brett Kavanaugh is too big to fail now this is the administrator you that it's Brett Kavanaugh or\n... they do not have a plan B there is not someone that that\nThere is not someone they're preparing to send in the game that for some reason Brett Kavanaugh should go down and\nAt a fascinating a quote from a from one who's involved in this process who said that they're worried\nThat any male nominee could have what they call the Kavanaugh problem and a source told Jonathan Swan dominate any man and you worry about an act thirty six years old how do you vet or that\nThat that is in fact what I'm hearing but interestingly Mike I'm willing to make calls today to women because they are worried about their husbands sons and grand sons they're worried that McCarthyism in this sort of McCarthyism is defined\nAs the taking of a terrible charge that is true in some contacts as against the Rosenbergs and his and applying it the innocent people as it was against the Hollywood blacklist\nAnd ruining their lives as a consequence here we have genuine me to where it's like ... a Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby and a number of people in our business who have been outed as sexual predators\nBeing applied to Brett Kavanaugh with zero evidence one bit of testimony from Dr porn which the women who are calling this morning are not buying and they are furious I think how do you I Can't go and below the water as we speak and Joe mansion in diving in\nAnd I'm sad to say this I was so disappointed in Chris Coons who I think is one of the nicest people in Washington not standing up for the righteous outrage of judge Kavanaugh what are you hearing\nSo\nDo there's no question is emotional when I can tell you that there's a lot of women who are angry and even you feel violated and\nI can tell you that uh this is in addition to the point of view the express if there's another one which is that this could be a problem for Republicans if\nIt looks rushed Republicans should have called for an FBI investigation earlier they should not\nLet it be perceived as being extremely constrictor constricted\nAnd limited as it is being perceived they should have a real FBI investigation and then everybody would feel more confident in the result will be better for Brett Kavanaugh it'd be the Supreme Court for short for sure for sure would be good for any Republican who's on the ballot\nYeah Mike I I have to say that I think that's how it's being perceived inside the beltway but in my tent phone calls this morning I have done more reporting of women outside of the beltway than every other talking head I have seen who have been repeating both left and right both pro Kevin on culture cabin on I'm actually\nTalking to women and they\nThey can't get through their seminar callers we know how to do under this Nineteen years we know how to find first time caller to are outraged and the reporting is Contra with the blue bubbles in the newsroom believe and I don't know how we break out it is one of the things that are mad about is one point of view has been wildly over represented\nIn the media this week and I don't watch pocket because I I don't like confirmation bias I watch MSNBC and CNN\nAnd do wild over representation of anti cabinet sentiment is in fact fueling the outrage by people who think he's getting slammed\n\nThe only good news for him is that uh he's been played by Matt Damon you know as as permanent doppelganger\nWell yeah but that also feeds into I\nSaw that and I thought Matt Damon who are ... you don't have to agree with me on this who has contributed very little to the public good as far as I Know comes on and mock so good man it would be like mocking in the army McCarthy hearings chill Welsh Matt Damon should go and play Joe Welsh and the army McCarthy hearing and\nSay have you know decency and the mad sputtering venom filled spittle flex rage because that's the parallel and it is McCarthyism Mike and I think everyone who stands by and what's a good man gets married who has a ten year old and a fourteen year old daughter and a wife and parents they are complicit\nIn this that's why I you can tell I'm furious I don't even know Brett Kavanaugh I never spoken to him in my life but I'm a dad and I just cannot imagine this\nYou another piece of reporting was popped up on ... years\nAnd this is related to the ... of us idea a swan is picked up that we could well have or for a while if\nFor some reason the Kavanaugh's nomination does not work out and you add to that that a Democratic Senate certainly is a more likely than it was about to go\nThere is no sentiment inside the White House for nominating somebody that Democrats would confirm Swann has establishing a quote from a source with direct knowledge of the president's thinking who said if Kavanaugh doesn't make it and the Senate flips I think the court is for for for the next two years\nAh well they said it's not going to ... ... ... and uh I don't doubt that that's true I I Believe that if if the Senate flipped I don't think they'd come from anyone but I Will tell you this ah the\nPresident when recess appointment someone who had nominated between then and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski I just don't believe they're going to be complicit in this I still think it's going to be fifty three forty seven\nBecause Joe mansion and Heidi Heitkamp will lose their seats almost inevitably Joe Donnelly is going to lose any Bill Nelson

bubble and they really don't know what's going on out there these red states Mike Allen and I don't know isn't don't you find it odd we haven't seen any polling\nPulling on\nOn Kavanaugh and which way the public is moving the only thing I saw I was in West Virginia where eight out of ten people believe cabinet should be confirmed\nIt or what is it a point to make the most optimistic about Republican\nJeff Flake saying that unless something new came out of my point is is a Josh Hawley being up on Claire McCaskill Kevin Cramer extending his lead in North Dakota those are two plots that I can almost impossible\nFor sugar is through I can tell you the Republicans are most confident of that pick up with any er\nYeah and and so those two alone make it impossible for Democrats to put the Senate but I think we're going to do better than that even though mansions that had to Morsi this is a\nThis is an issue that throws not just a rock into the pond but a hand grenade into the pond and they don't get it\nUh they they honestly they don't understand what they've done with this ah Mike let me let me finish with the U.S MCA the president has renegotiated NAFTA\nNobody thought he could do that I didn't think he could do it but I don't think it's going to be even noticed because of the cabinet or a blow up but how significant is that he successfully renegotiated NAFTA\nThis isn't a question but when it was an expected it was on his terms it is a better deal for the U.S it's a win and nobody can say otherwise\nIt is that's exactly right and my gosh so much winning a gallon always

how many people at the FBI blob interviewing every five the leaves are able to investigate it are they going to be obstructed him\n[laughter] and I and by the way filing for cloture doesn't mean that the FBI investigation Spanish it just means that they expected to be finished by Wednesday and that is six days after and there are I think a Mac six or seven witnesses and they've already all filed statements\nAnd so there is just there just isn't much to review here and Dr forwards testimony as has been summarized by the council for the Republican than adequately distributed Josh cross our thank you my friends like all of you for listening a call your Senator George to two to four three one two one tell them you know\nBreaking news at a breakneck pace this film might Gallagher show we got a crucial midterm election coming up in November ... we're not going\nRay ... voice of clarity from millions of Americans say you for asking this question a show now owned by the most famous man on the planet\nYou've been great Mike and I appreciate it very much notice I walked over here very quickly\nNow from the relief factor dot com studios mice yellow there [noise] so how\nWas your

hot well it's too cold man it's in the rain too much today uh it's just humid\nIt doesn't matter he's leaving he's leaving he one of the shocking admissions from last night's conversation that he engaged in on sixty minutes\nIs that he would never have pulled what he pulled friday if he had been up for reelection I mean he he did say that you I don't know if you watch the sixty minutes interview it was painful\nEverything about Jeff Flake is painful but it but you have to at least acknowledge him paddling others just cut number eight from sixty minutes\nI'm Senator Jeff flake who stunned the world with his painful change of heart over Brett Kavanaugh Friday after he was yelled at by a couple of\nProgressive activists in the elevator and I I'm not trying to minimize or deny that one or both of them were sexually assaulted I don't know I Know that they are both activists with ... with George Soros funded\nOrganization that's a fact I mean if you can look it up at their names and I we can get into all that if you want so Jeff Flake gets yelled at in the elevator kept looking up incidentally if you saw that video at the cameras painfully aware that it was all being recorded\nKnew immediately was going to go viral because it was what they wanted\nAnd they got their wish they got him to change his mind and say okay well all voted out of committee but I'm not going to vote to confirm unless there's a one week in this investigation limited in scope\nAnd time that's already been shredded by the Democrats they were barely out of the room before they started calling\nThe limitations on scope and time a joke\nSham a farce they started moving the goalposts before they got out of the room fright okay\nAnd here's Jeff Flake on sixty minutes last night admitted that if he had any accountability whatsoever\nTo his own constituents in the state of Arizona He would never have done what he did on friday\nSenator Flake you've announced that you're not running for reelection and I wonder could you have done this\nIf you were running no [laughter] no not ... not a chance to show\nBecause politics has become too sharp\nTo ... there's no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nThat's one way to put it another way to put it is I have no accountability anymore because I'm retiring from the Senate show my constituents don't matter doesn't really matter what they want from me back home I'm quitting\nThat's one way that's another way to look at it but again I jet Li remind you it really matters not what he did friday in terms of getting this done\nThere are lots of things you can do today to take some action I'm going to give you that information as the show unfolds but each futile to rage against a man like Jeff Flake remember the bottom line and this\nSounds callous this sounds cruel this sounds heartless this sounds [noise] um wouldn't perhaps but it is a fact\nWe still need his vote we still need his vote he still has to vote to confirm so to to rip him figuratively apart\nIsn't really that productive you want to be productive colors officers civil e and respectfully
