getting really factor dot\nCom for a starter pack over holding it really factor dot com I'm joined now by Jim Talent former senator from Missouri follow him on Twitter at Jim tell Jimmy came back from my travels\nTo Columbus Tampa and to New York city Pittsburgh in Philadelphia with the Pittsburgh flag so I sound like a horrible but before I go to the president's tweets this morning your reaction to the eight suspicious packages the most recent one of which was delivered to Robert De Niro what do you make of this\nUh you know I agree with Trump's with what the president said it's it's despicable I mean there there is no place for this I'm Glad they're vigorously investigating and I hope they catch you did it and uh catch and quickly and respond quickly I think that would be very appropriate\nAnd it ought to be condemned uh these kinds of tactics you I wrote a column was about\nThe violence of violent protests they have to be stuck on right away and um I I I I really liked the response of ice levels of our government\nNo the um there's a new emphasis on that facility in Newcastle county Delaware\nI got a question Jeff it will not take the FBI very long to give them eight or nine or ten investigatory leads and that's what each of these packages his\n... they'll fight whoever did this unless it's a hostile foreign power messing with our elections again and I'm not ruling out until I get a name and number and whoever is doing this what do you make of that\nNo I ... nothing would surprise me\nI mean I what we need to but I think we should be able to figure that out to know how much of this there'll be able to reveal if that's what it is is there a good question you or I wouldn't rule anything out at this stage um and and they're doing exactly the right thing and investigating a very vigorous way I mean it's\nNot I don't give me your assessment of the caravan what are we going to do and Twenty one thousand people show up at the border the United states\nWell I think we have to enforce the laws of the United states and we do it in a way to consistent with the values of the United states that uh the chess has had a long time to plans and I assume that they have plans in place it does to me show why would be nice to have a wall\nUm because it's a humane way of of protecting the border and enforcing the laws so uh you know they're going to respond I think in an appropriate way and it shows also how the catch and release policies of a few years ago have incentivize people to try this\nNew I keep telling people that which gets rewarded gets repeated yes if if it's Fifteen to twenty thousand people show up at the border and some our allowed in that will have forty or fifty thousand march I mean if you're out there\nIt's the it's the magnet effect and it's real and a number of Romney's talking about you and to and the two thousand twelve and a um it's an issue by the way that Josh how is used here in Missouri Senator McCaskill co sponsored a catcher released bill\nYou know because I've got to play the senator McCaskill's new ad ... number two\nI don't always agree with ground a Casco but I work hard fighting against those terrorists doing all those town hall or ... how to braid end up against their own party and Claire is not one of those crazy Democrats she works right in the middle and find All right\nJim Talent when you've got a democratic talking about crazy Democrats that's an attempt to not be Chuck Schumer is reliable vote does that work in Missouri is anyone fooled by that she'll vote for sure where to be the majority leader she'll vote for Dianne Feinstein to be the chairman of judiciary that's what she'd do\nIts work against her son McCaskill's had a bad few weeks you know beginning with the ... well beginning with the debate which uh which just it really well on despite the fact that the question is Raul hostile they've even asked her about ...\nUh the chief video\nThe bus or you know the bus tour when she did a ride in the bus and now this look it's Democrats in Missouri or who are really upset about this I'm senator ... dollars from a north St Louis county is saying hey this is who you're talking about are you talking about us when you're talking about\nRace issues talking about them she was talking about a Chuck Schumer Maxine Waters Nancy Pelosi you bet she's talking about them Jerry never\nRight and it's playing both ends against the metal and no it doesn't work and I'm really surprised that they looked at it you know here I don't know what's happening in that\nI've seen some old numbers not specifically Josh his campaign\nAbout Missouri that shows Republican intensities is way up now and that uh the suburbs are much stronger or for Republicans and they were even a month ago it was very urging I was talking with some last night so I feel good about the trends here and I just hope that their national\nNo I I Know the president tweeted a very big part of the anger we've seen it in our country has caused by the purposely falls inaccurate reporting in the mainstream media that I referred to his make new fake news has gotten so bad and hateful but it's beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act fast what do you make of that James Talent\nOr I could not agree more you and you know it is when I was running\nFor office then officer corps or twenty five years I rarely criticized the media I just think the last few years they've gone completely off the rails and I don't see that as a Republican I mean this willingness to print anything I'm just I mean and this this this uh assumption of of the war\nTodd here I have both been on the road Chuck I've been down to ah Columbus Tampa Pittsburgh Philly New York city and I did get the Pittsburgh play you've been out on the road as well I Am curious as to what you heard even as we look at the breaking news about ninth suspicious package addressed a Joe Biden being intercepted in Delaware this morning\nA looks like we missed each other and Campos your in your schedule when it looks like you have the same water voice that I Do yeah from all the dry air planes and et cetera actually what I learned you know the thing that is let the big things that big a crush on me but I Would say that\nThey live as an extra pressure on me and go back to Phoenix, Arizona um and how shell shock for all the taxes and having their first we'll competitive like the number of voters who complained to me about the negative ads were higher there than anywhere else in what I look at places island\nIt gets to impose ... um it's the first time the Knicks never really experienced Arizona literally experience one of these knock down drag out fights and I'm sitting here doing boy go loop to Cleveland all moved to Saint Paul and they've been doing dealing with with this for ten years um\nIt it is interesting to me to watch the Phoenix independent voter\nAre worn out more so than any other place I like\nWhat about a cabinet affect what have you seen is it in during my audience knows what I think that what's her with Chuck Todd\n... yeah no I Would say um I also hitting Missouri I it it is [noise] you know the jury race as flipped there is no other race that I think outside of a ticket is had drawn a dramatic more dramatic effect\nA post to have it on the Missouri which was one of my other stocks I forgot embedded there\nUm and then I Would say of the other places I went and Nevada's but the place that it has I think the second biggest impact I take less so and in Arizona and Texas law affects them through the whole as a whole separate ball game\nWhen I was like you're talking about the time when I Would say Missouri and they've gotta is where you could see steel here about ... effect\nTed Cruz's actually coming up right after I think he's listening to you right now what did you find in Texas\n[noise] you know it's interesting it's it's it's um there's clearly increased turnout is clearly in increasing gauge minutes that you see\n'em but that's a race to stabilize you know I I ... when I Can't really put my head around is that when I when I compare I'm watching ... running a red state it's a Democrat\nAnd compared to here soon sit on my own Arizona prepared to frankly Claire McCaskill of Missouri Bill Nelson of Florida journal mansion in a in a post Phil Bredesen all of those other Senate Democrats I pointed out [noise] how are making some slave center [noise]\nUm what I find fascinating and this is the great experiment with this election is is it ... or is it you know he's on a shit about is is is positions just progressive ideal\nUh on one hand it's made for I think it very clear choice between or listeners but it's probably the type of course a choice the cruise cruise a lot\nI won't ask him running ads say\nThat because it it is you know I think you could make a case that it's possible he could have been bombed them differently I I'm just going at while or kids excited the Democratic base in Texas and I think it's a little bit bigger than I think any of us anticipated\nI I Can't you know part of me thinks well if you read a little more like Phil Bredesen my guest is Ted Cruz would would be would be look he's acting like he's nervous enough a lot of money that's been raised ... I think it'd be more ...\nI I we're gonna leave with their Chuck Todd and we'll see you tomorrow night on meet the press billion of course if it's Sunday it's ... I Hope I Hope we both get our boys\nHome ... stay wherever the airport or [laughter]\nTalk to about ... over to Ted Cruz senator from Texas you just heard what a Chuck said I think he's thinking that was runway ... what do you think\nWe got ... with us Sen Cruz\nYeah I'm I hear you yeah well I'm not\nYour Chuck what do you think\nI I I think that's right I'm also glad to join the horse boys club like a two week that from election day at ... and anyone who spend their time doing politics has a little bit of horses right now\n[noise] yeah um he ... chocolate saying beta was run hard left how can any haven't run hard left in Texas you get to that\nAt you know that that has been in pain from the beginning that typically in Texas Democrats at least at least pretend to go to the middle and end from the very beginning a Beto O'Rourke made the decision to go forward left he's running like Elizabeth Warren is running like\nBernie Sanders now what result is mapped the money he is the number one democratic fundraiser like on a last quarter a bed or walk raised thirty eight million dollars that is the most money ever raised in a single quarter by any candidate for US Senate in history\nThat a lot of money and and and what happens is every time O'Rourke embraces a left wing position every time he comes out and calls for aging President Trump which he has\nMillions of dollars ... flood into the state every time they called the uh abolishing like what she has\nMillions of dollars flooded to the state and I think in many ways he is playing\nThe national liberal donors national liberal activists and and the people that he doesn't play to our our our actual voters in Texas to care about jobs and care about securing the border I care about the constitution or he is not responding to the interest that people\nWill know Senator Cruz talk to me a little bit about these nine a suspicious packages at least one who was a real bomb\nThe president's condemned with the vice presidents condemned that Rod Rosenstein condemned it I'm sure you're going to condemn it but the media is running with a narrative that it's Donald Trump's fault I'm sure you see this and I it makes me crazy it's either some not in a basement or it's a hospital power messing with our election\nBut what do you make the attempt to blame Trump\nLuck it it's the media dealing with the media does which which is any any narrative that they can twist against Trump they will do so uh this is terrible I mean this is terrorism and whoever the terrorist is\n... needs to be caught you need to be prosecuted it needs to be put in jail for a long long time\nAnd uh and and I'm not in it that'll happen you know it's interesting you remember ... months ago uh we we had the bomber in Austin a that was standing up bombs throughout Austin and and I'd I'd met with\nUh the ATF boats and the FBI of we're leading that asked for a set of and at the federal law enforcement had tremendous resources to put a bear it to track him down in terms of the components of the bomb I Know there I'm sure they're analyzing all of those now\nWhere the cat just got to put it behind bars but but it is wrong violence is always role or wherever it occurs on the political spectrum I you know we saw tragically a year ago\nA praised gunman coming to Washington DC or with the objective of shooting Republican Congress and and and ultimately go into the congressional baseball\nPractice and and and shooting in nearly killing states elites and and this should not be part of our political discourse disagreement a spy that's even healthy to disagree on policy issues\nAh but but violence has no place in it and and and we need to be able to disagree with each other or with the ability and with respect\nNo Senator Cruz you are cruising and that's great we need to back in D.C\nJust the final question to you about the Supreme Court which is now the thirty Years' War for the court is over at least for a time we have five conservative I Would argue originally stretches there we regret if we get two or three more regret twenty nine appeals court judges and fifty district court judge\nHow important is it that the Republicans keep the Senate and this is about more ethnic selling Arizona my brought in Indiana and Josh Hawley Missouri how important is it that the Republicans\nMaintain their control of the United states\nIt is massively important I the last two years at credible victories for the people that the American\nLand and and he rode the Senate or even better what oh it was actually expand our our majority at a barely fifty one getting up at three fifty four fifty five which I think it's a very real possibility um I think we could accomplish even more and we need to keep the house to get legislation through\nBut on the judicial side uh not only do we have two Supreme Court justices which I was proud to help lead the fight or both ... capital but but we have been from the first year\nWe confirmed more court of appeals judges that any time in history of the first year presidents are right now today one at a sick federal appellate judges of the country was appointed by President Trump and and so it's made of the norm is difference\nOr if we have another two years I I I think we could see it as much as half of the the federal appellate bench\nOr having been appointed by President Trump that that is a legacy as you know virtually every case and a quarter to\nPractice and make it to the Supreme Court and so every one of us who cares and cares passionately about the constitution about the bill of rights about free speech and religious liberty and the second amendment the tenth amendment having principle constitutional is judges is is how we protect those rights [noise]\nIn the market was a bloodbath yesterday that closed down six hundred points NASDAQ was down three hundred and twenty nine points in their worst or ever hasn't peed on eighty four

Evans he's the director of the brand new movie indivisible which will be in theaters this Friday the true story of army Chaplin Darren Turner a David Evans welcome to have you on the Hugh Hewitt she'll tell us about indivisible\nThank you yeah it's a it's a really hear the first movie ever made about a military chaplain you know there's been chaplains that have been featured with with supporting roles and movies over the years but um I've heard about this story about chaplain Darren Turner and his wife about six years ago\nUh taken a long time to get this project put together but I'm really it's an incredible story that I think will appeal to your listeners when you can\nSee what troops experience during times of deployment through the eyes of a chaplain who's really kind of like the pastor to the troops\nBut when you see first hand or the experience of what they're dealing with a and then you know at the same time their marriage as well as under attack as it is so often with with our troops when they leave their husbands and wives behind a\nJust a powerful story of of of that that people who whether you're married or not it's a story that's really going to speak to you um when you see this film\nDavid Evans I've got lots of military in my family and I've heard it said again and again I'm a civilian but I married a Marine Corps brat and just lots of military active duty\nThat whenever a soldier sailor airman or marine Portman go off on deployment they come back a different men or women and their spouse is a different man or woman and they left you captured that in indivisible\n... absolutely in in a in a very vivid accurate way I Believe we use that chaplains actual journal that he kept while he was in Iraq so we kinda get into\nInto what they're going through by by reading his journal and and then incorporating that into our entire script you know so often that I'm as Americans we take for granted that the freedoms that we have and it's really about one percent of the population that that's connected directly to the military through a spouse who's serving or having a child who's\nAn active duty there's this other Ninety nine percent of people that I think really are going to appreciate the story yet got entertainment value they're great visual effects and and a score\nBut it's the it's the deep rooted story about what our troops are going through the I think really speak to people\nAnd um I'd like to also and you it's a perfect date movie if there's a husband and wife out there and they're your your your listeners are looking for something to do this weekend or you know you can cast a vote for or faith based quality films like this by going to see the movie on opening weekend the perfect perfect film for\nFor husbands and wives to go out and watch together\nAnd this is the studio that also brought out fire proven more roommate really succeeds they make wonderful movies as says of course David Evans it got very experienced directorial credits\nBut what strikes me is especially if you have a member of the military and your family whether it's a son or daughter husband or wife grandma grandpa anyone who
