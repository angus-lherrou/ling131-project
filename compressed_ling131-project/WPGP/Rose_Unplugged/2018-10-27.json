the category where people need to take income\nFrom their tax deferred account IRAs four oh one case for freebies\nThe government forces you to take money out of those accounts when you turn aged Seventy so you want to have a place set up ahead of time that makes sense for that you don't want to wait till the last minute you want to make sure that you set that up ahead of time so two things have it in an emergency fund and having a core income account\nOkay that so what about annuities you know these are insurance products I think they do get a bad rap sometimes but they certainly have evolved over the years I Wonder if some of that that negative publicity it's just a simple lack of understanding yeah oh it\nDefinitely is a lack of understanding by the people that purchase it and oftentimes a lack of understanding by the people that sell it\nThere's different types of annuities and he got to make sure that you have the right type of annuity you want to have the ones that are backed by legal reserves not the ones that just float around with the market\nThen you also want to make sure that your annuity is cost effective\nSome annuities out there take the rap for all of the bad press\nBecause they're the ones who is really really high expenses and people here that on the radio or they might see the full page ads that say I hate annuities and you should do and the reason that they're saying annuities are bad is because they have high fees\nBut in reality only some annuities have high fees and not all of them as a matter of fact the ones that I recommend have very low fees especially when you compare them to an overall brokerage account\nSo the key is to make sure that you have the right account that fits your individual situation you benefit from working with a specialist and make sure that you work with a specialist in the area that you are\nQuite honestly if you are thirty five years old and you're putting your children through college in saving for that\nI'm not the right financial professional for you\nI work specifically with people that are developing sources of retirement income and that have recently retired\nI'm an income planning specialist for retirement income\nMake sure that your financial professional fits you and that you understand everything that you're buying keep in mind annuities offered many very good benefits but you also have to understand that they're not liquid accounts they satisfy the need for income\nAnd they don't satisfy the need for liquidity so don't use the wrong tool for the job make sure that you use the right tool for the job\nNow Annan Tony wanted to make sure that they were set so that they could just focused first on their grandchild coming into the world pretty soon and not worry about

also lots of great information on my website ... info if you have at least two hundred thousand dollars save for retirement\nCall me right now we're live will answer the phone we are at eight hundred seven to five to nine eight eight\nOkay so that we were talking about risk you know what about just a simple last way to help control risking retirement if their way to make sure that our retirement plan is strong and can whether any storm that comes our way\nYeah so risks are really kind of uncontrolled and sometimes they're really unpredictable we can't predict the markets or the interest rates we don't know if we're going to get sick early in life or if we're going to be healthy until age Ninety nine\nBut what we can do is we can focus on what we can control so with that in mind going to go back to the first thing that I said in this in this hour find the right financial professional find someone that you trust and it's easy to work with instead of chicken actually implement the strategies that you've got\nNow when an and Tony came into my office that came in and they had sort of a partial financial plan and it was all focused on brokerage accounts and mutual funds and a few alternative investment and it was written out and it was about\nTwo hundred page document and they've plugged it on my desk and they said what do we do is this\nYour financial plan has to be easy to understand and easy to implement\nI help implement things for my clients I manage money for my client when you're choosing that financial professional you gotta make sure that you're working with somebody that's going to actually help you get things done having that two hundred page financial plan\nWell it really looked impressive it was pretty thick and heavy it was a solid book but when they plop that's out onto my table I said did you actually read through it and they said well we started to and I said did you actually do any of the things in that plan and they said no\nWe just got so bogged down in the details that we were never able to do that I think it's important that everything is documented in that you have all the charts and graphs and strategies and things but at the end of the day you got to make sure that you can implement it\nHere's what's in the Andrews retirement GPS I've got all those strategies and charts and graphs\nAnd all those those that verbiage that gives you the tools to put things into place and at the end of the plan it comes down to two pages the first page is a retirement\nIncome plan and it shows you step by step where to take your retirement income from it how to take it at what time and then the last page and the whole plan is the one that people go to first it's a bucket strategy\nPerhaps I should move up to the front page and skip all that but I make sure that everything is documented my clients are all great\nI wanted to mention the fact that half of my business comes from referrals that really means is very much to me it means that my clients have the right financial professional in place they trust me enough to refer the people that they care about\nIf you want to get that Anders retirement GPS in place for you in a well

I can remember being in pharmacy school and pharmacology in in ... and even an organic chemistry in using chemicals like Toyota land in\nBenzene in the lab and we use that stuff and we were in when you know even though they told you then back in the seventies that take precautions we were a kid you know you were\nTwenty years old Twenty one Nineteen twenty to you you're a kid you didn't really think about those that was a joke\nSee but here's the reality that these chemical exposures not just hydrocarbons and not just tall you went in benzene maybe you didn't work in a lab maybe didn't work in a car repair shop but heavy metals and chemicals environmental chemicals coupled with\nOur inability to detoxify efficiently puts us at a much higher risk for the development of neuro degenerative\nDisease or Parkinson's old timers and a lot of other strange diseases say that we you know they they've given names and diagnoses too but they are chronic degenerative types of diseases so why I Am talking about that today\nIs simply because a new article just released\nThis past week new findings from a large national claims database I talked about this on yesterday's broadcast you can always go back and pick up a little bit of the details of that\nAnd what does this talk about this talks about the role believe it or not fat and is\nNow [laughter]\n[noise] excuse me about two weeks ago three weeks ago I took\nA day or two during the weekly broadcast and then the Saturday I Believe it was two Saturdays ago to talk about some of the implications of the Saxons from what they

Parkinson's patients after analyzing a database of over thirty million and what they found that there was about twenty two almost twenty two thousand individuals\nWith Parkinson's and what they found is there was a huge this proportion hits link disappeared in the archives of neurology and what they were saying is is that\nFolks to work on that long term this researcher Dr Wang showed that the risk that is associated with fountains goes up dramatically\nIn the cross section on our says the use of cholesterol lowering drugs including fat and even some ... that was associated with a

A. and it said let me help you navigate the maze you know and I often feel like that's what we do with clients Medicare a\nBee which is original Medicare Medicare see which is the Medicare Advantage\nOr which is a is a whole interesting system and it's affecting a lot of people right now Medicare part D which is the drugs and then you have Medicare supplements which also are branded by\nA a A N alphabetical category plans a through D J so imagine with all these letters you know somebody that's eighty to eighty eight you know and it and I'm not\nI'm not discounting the value of our of our uh elderly population may have ... you know they're smart people but it just gets confusing\nI absolutely and it it's almost like it's designed to be confusing in order for you not\nTo utilize it you know there's some doubt what's Medicare when do you become eligible for Medicare topic ugly\nTypically now there are exceptions to this do to total disability but the typical aging in scenario is age sixty five okay\nUm age sixty five people who were turning sixty five typically again they're retiring from there you know career job they're aging into Medicare they're leaving their group health insurance\nUm and they want to transition successfully from their work coverage or coverage that they have individually you know 'cause usually traditional major medical ends at sixty five you know that insurance company expecting you to age into Medicare so\nWhether you've been employed throughout your life or or not you're still eligible for Medicare\nUm well there are certain conditions you know you have to have worked so many quarters\nA of your career to have paid for Medicare part a through your payroll taxes\nYou know because in essence this is a federal insurance program that you are participating in throughout your working life okay Medicare part a U.S funded through your payroll taxes and the contribution of your employer as well\nUm you know so that there are certain conditions you know people that are immigrants uh may or may not qualify for Medicare without funding it or people who have not worked\nA throughout their career may have to fund\nPrivately you know their aging into Medicare but for most working Americans Medicare is a given they're going to when they turn sixty five\nWhether they want it or not they're going to wind up getting you know a letter a welcome to Medicare here's your part a card and what they will have to do is begin to add\nA you know on purpose they will add part B which is your out patient\nAnd that's where they should talk with a broker like myself to help help them navigate that ... ...\n... so if you turn sixty five and you want to pay for your own policy in in not accept Medicare is that possible\nOr if it is rather tough actually because most health insurers and and the one that you're using with Philadelphia America and in fact you can keep that policy guaranteed renewable to age\nSixty five O. J. and that's how the contractors written because he does understood a that at sixty five you're going to a gym to Medicare and for most people that that is in fact what occurs founder\nSo the audience knows I Am a client of us you are a sponsor of the show I Am and I recommend you highly to to everybody I talked to because you in over this past year and a half have saved me a ton of money and giving me the coverage that I needed\nYeah I agree yeah and I carry a very similar design product that that you do a and I feel that it gives me adequate protection of course you and I are both under age we're not in that Medicare realm\nAnd and we help people are under age sixty five you know primarily the self employed individuals people that pay for their own health insurance we do offer

hundred and Seventy five thousand\nMedicare eligible 's okay are being affected by this\nCourt decision and what has happened is you know these two giants have been fighting obviously it's been all over the news media that the papers et cetera\nAnd BP a Supreme Court handed down a decision a year earlier\nThan what was anticipated meaning what meaning that individuals in Pittsburgh who are Medicare eligible end who currently have a high mark security blue or a high mark freedom balloon plan\nAre actually going to be displaced as soon as July first two thousand Nineteen meaning\nThat you know through through no choice of their own they may not be able to see their UP MC doctors or or UP MC hospitals anymore and this is a big\nFat and that's scary that's very challenge\nYou know I'm
