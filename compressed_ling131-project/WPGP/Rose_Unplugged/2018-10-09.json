time this has happened I mean normally careers are gone lives are destroyed people's sliver away into the darkness never to be heard from again this time Brett Kavanaugh fought back\nThis time

destroyed over something like a tweet\nAnd you know at the end of the day may be may be\nThe push back on behalf of judge Kavanaugh and the Republicans deciding\nWe're not going to destroy this man over this one accusation\nI Know there were a couple but the the first one was the one that was deemed credible you notice the you hear the Republicans who read the FBI report the word credible is used for Dr Ford she seem credible is what all of them said\nIt just wasn't corroborated so you couldn't\nEver ever take him down over her testimony alone\n\nA couple of times I've seen some references to Roseanne Barr evidently that show that she created and return to is going to be back\nI don't think it's returned yet to the air isn't it next week or this week we're going to call it the Connors and they apparently killed off Roseanne all because of her tweet about Valerie Jarrett and it was make no mistake it was a terrible tweet\nBut it was a tweet one tweet and her lifetime of work was suddenly consumed by the fire of the rage machine\nPS she's a Trump supporter\nI saw over the weekend there was a a an NBC reporter I Believe a young NBC reporter who a few years ago\nWrote a bunch of homophobic tweaks they happened to her no she's a liberal NBC report your Roseanne and you re tweet or\nTweet out a racist comment about Valerie Jarrett your die\nAnd maybe\nAfter Kavanaugh
