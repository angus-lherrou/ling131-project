Michael midday dot com\nAnd I should also noticed Brian did that uh the battle of New Orleans and the miraculous details concerning that battle also feature in my book the American miracle\nYeah the ah\nPresident Trump is restored Andrew Jackson's portraits of the White House and he clearly admires president Jackson I could President Trump for this moment in his presidency with all of its challenges could he learn something from Jackson's example\nI think so because Jackson was like LBJ LBJ was\nJackson more where he said okay what do you eat or get it done because you had to get what I Want done you heard a lot of deals with the Senate and leverage to leverage his power\nA guide right of people's face but in the end he got things done and he ... he turned the economy over to Martin Van Buren actually with a surplus and he was the last president to do that not have a deficit\nSo I think that he had to make them deals for that to happen at the same time or you know both to programs that will allow their country to grow\nAnd he understood the working class more than ... percent more than that it was more than my role or the watch it um you know more than John Quincy Adams says he was born a bigger means to an orphan and he understood he really thought a Midwest and then the south or the southwest was totally ignored\nSo I think that Donald Trump constituency is the same one in proportion I didn't even go in and cut some deals in order to average greater objective for sale and then see what happens after two years if you lose the house you know see what happens after six years that we get the second tour\nSo I think back to what they need to learn but relentless the fighting spirit he's pretty much got that down\n[laughter] yeah he does um but Jackson or ... in terms of his fighting spirit also had this great ability of making up with people that he was a fighting against the one point he had he had actually for a dual with a\nAnd been involved in a very bloody brawl with Thomas hard Benton the senator from Missouri who became one of his closest allies and help get his program through\nThat may be comparable to the Ted Cruz Donald Trump relationship\nAnd Marco Rubio and Rand Paul and Lindsey Graham and be Nikki Haley a he has a lot of people that were critical okay I'm working with it but\nWhen they were willing to put it aside and support them and for the most part\nEverybody has I think this evolution others others team is is much more in support of who Donald Trump is Larry Kudlow the Gary Cohn\nSo Larry Kudlow said this Donald Trump got to get over this free trade agreement busing is free trade free trade is good and Donald Trump is is almost one Larry older but you didn't uh he did not want to come in because\nHe said you know the I Can't really go along with Boston up all these deals but then after a few months after talking to him he's now in in the beginning chocolate or\nYou know well I think the planet I

information and and all those recordings of her\nYou know if they say in a lot of lot of pretty radical things back in the day is very damaging sort of sort of personal\nNot talk to me a little bit about the uh New Jersey race because Bob Menendez is in my view the Roy Moore of the Democratic party unacceptable to a wide swath of normal people as a bad guy or enough people to possibly put Bob

Republican column and take away but I don't I Know my son is they had been I don't know if it's take away yet and I think Rick Scott is tied or slightly behind margin of error is that your assessment\nThat's pretty much it misery and the one thing to watch the desert in Indiana Senate races but all in a way towards the Republicans in the last week\nYou know Trump took a little bit of a hit a politically and a lot in the last week I Want to look at those numbers against the Democrats have made some movement but look these are conservative states Donald Trump or the double digit\nOr his views on immigration how popular it in the states like Missouri in Indiana so I I generally think always a slight favorite in Missouri uh Mike Brown a slight favorite in Indiana certainly North Dakota as you mentioned is looking very favorable or the Republicans\nAnd those are the three top pickup opportunities Florida is not living for Republicans both the governor's race and in the Senate race still competitive but but I think Rick Scott as the underdog and an interview on the starting to coalesce around the\nWhat's interesting is that day David writes a pretty big can just published a Florida polls showing its at one point race in the Senate side doesn't say about the governors ah the ... the United states has tweeted\nMe see\nIf the fed back soften starts talking a little more

horrible shooting in Pittsburgh up a synagogue and the stock market has I've lost another point in the last week there's a lot what kind of Trump wanted\nRight before the midterm election that's what we're hearing talked about immigration is trying to resent a birthright citizenship um so I you know like I I don't think a lot of lot of people's minds are locked in but again if if it if there's any party that has the momentum in the final eight Democrats do have a story of her stuff\nOr you know I'm going to make one one correction that I think there's a rebound against the left for going crazy at like Marsha Blackburn the last thirty seconds to I just think the Julia Ioffe off on CNN Marsha Blackburn demonstrator Josh it makes\nWe're not going to make America great again it was never that\n\nWe've got a crucial midterm election coming up in November ...

Jews have believed there were financing the caravan\nMe invading army like a cancer division that is threatening the southern border an army that is wrapped in riddled with disease the same type of\nRhetoric the same type of propaganda that you would have seen in Germany and Nineteen thirty eight that the human ... turning people into infested rom and\nThat is a Republican operative named Steve Schmidt now Lazarus points at last was kind of a I I have to give him credit because he was like\n... just astounded at ... at the realization\nThat these never Trump Republicans who were in positions of of of managing campaigns and tried to help Republicans got elected last does take away was brilliant last said heck no wonder Republicans kept getting beat you had people like Steve Schmidt running campaigns\nHe's a Democrat and when Lance said that it it it it sure does spark jumped into my mind and I wanted to throw it out to you and I know we've spent too much time already probably on these\nThese these these maddening never Trump per se but is Lance right that the people were seen\nBill Kristol Jennifer Rubin Steve Schmidt you go down the list of never Trump Republicans are they really Democrats at heart in other words or they just now showing their true colors or did they flip\nBecause they hate Trump so much\nI don't I I tend to think it's the latter rather than the former I Believe they've flipped and they sound like Democrats because they hate Trump's so much they can't believe that he's having so much success\nAnd so they got to lash out like a typical liberal Democrat Steve shred that audio clip and video clip of you're watching it on the stream and Mike online dot com if you if you you know as you hear that and thought\nThat's what a liberal Democrat says that's not what a lifelong Republican operative says Steve Schmidt worked on\nCampaigns and you go down the list Nicole Wallace ana Navarro\nJim Miller David from these are all people who have been the voice of the Republican Party all these years and suddenly when a president quite reasonably says we have to stop illegals\nAnd this is a small army seven thousand people eight thousand whatever the number is\nI've seen fourteen thousand and some media reports but the number we keep seeing the seven thousand seven thousand people that's a small army you can pretend that's not a problem but when you got seven thousand people a sea of humanity marching towards our southern border of course we expect the government to stop that\nAnything else is well\nWhat a
