I think he's going to run really well there\nAre she's going to try and win by Karen in in St Louis or Kansas City very heavily that's typically the formula I don't think it's going to work here I think Josh is going to run well all over the state but you know we're not talking about uh ten point\nYou know election probably\nBlow you off but it is it says ... year as city I've ever see I mean I I just it's it's hard to make for production is even two weeks out\nI Hope you go over and play our mid term madness gym because I think it is I'm getting more and more comfortable with the Senate races knowing which way they'll break and I'm very encouraged by Jim John James soaring in Michigan oh you can close that gap but I'm pretty\nPretty comfortable about it now I'm ... I'm watching the New Jersey to oil yeah Menendez this fall and because I mean that's really a heavy burden to be carrying and this year to have been prosecuted as he was and they're not money\nInto that too you know a\nGood their ... their panic special counsel Mueller\nIs expected to issue findings in the core aspects of his Russia probe soon after the November midterms now I have a I have a problem with this story being out there I have a problem with a leak either one exonerated the president or one or blasting the president\nOr this is not what justice should be doing it would be disastrous for justice if this report comes out before the election agree or disagree Jim Talent\nNow I agree uh it it would be disastrous to leak something of this ... if you've been on a lecture or not you know you I mean they all they need to hold and confidence until they can present the full report everybody can read it I don't think it's going to find anything I've never believed there was a Lucian what the Russians you know they\nGot in a port and some others with some unrelated things but I never thought there was ... and I'm going to be shocked if they find it\nBut I I and I expect the president be exonerated but I still think it would be bad for the bureau and the department if they leak that before the election it will it will be just like totally coming to the to the microphone about Hillary during twenty sixteen they got to get these high profile investigations off the cycle of politics yeah\nYou're you're would be bad you maybe they'd been compromised in the last couple of years I mean it's it was terrible and I think Sessions' is is moving\nNot with regard to this 'cause he's recused himself but I think\nUh he and the director are trying to clean up the top levels of the euro and the department to try and get ... out of there it's essential you're right this is a huge structural question and I don't mean by that downgraded I mean it's very or to the people at\nThe integrity of the department and the bureau to operate non political you so\nYou're right this would be this would be another huge problem along those lines\nYou know I Do not expect a attorney general sessions last much after the election I'm hoping Michael ... replaces him uh we'll see if you have a comment on that but I Need your quick comment on my ... going to turkey and Saudi Arabia\nA big clipped his comments he said I don't want to talk about the facts trying to make them look bad what he says I Want to talk about the fact they want to talk about back 'cause we don't know what the facts are yet that's what he said and that's exactly what he should have said Jim Talent\nYes and we don't know what the facts are you know you've been reading and I've been reading any but it had a good article\nToday on the on the Web site actually run yesterday that we don't know I mean yes there was there was clearly Saudi involvement in this we don't know what factions in the Saudi Government were responsible or yeah we we need to continue to be able to work with Saudi Arabia in the region and that's\nThe things that the president and um pay or\nAre balancing and they certainly don't want to try and strike that balance until they know what so yeah we got to try and find out what happened then we got to try and do this sort of way where we stand up for what's right but we don't undermine their own interest in the region\nIt's a dead heat who is your land and I am joined by my for on the Republican nominee for the United States Senate businessmen extraordinary has faced off against Joe Donnelly the incumbent Democrat who both elected Chuck Schumer\nHis leader and voted and for against Brett Kavanaugh bright to me Joe Donnelly voted against Brett Kavanaugh might Ron welcome to the program I there's new poll shows daddy\nI'm gay art or the momentum that we've got a ... episode has been measurable that I Know and that I didn't know was there a reason for all of that just came out that you are\nYeah that was being him as a star round the real clear politics and shows you and Joe and the margin of error and it shows the libertarian was seven percent that always makes me crazy when ...\nOf suicide these elections what are you a city or libertarian friends out there about how important it is if they really care about freedom they got to vote for the guy is going to support the originalist judges not not Donnelly but Braun\nExactly and so much of a what libertarians believe in and Republicans outlying up and I think they just need to realize that\nUh if you really want your vote that counts bring it over to my side I've lived my life was alive breed an enterprise that that I think as they start scratching their heads here they are under three weeks now there'll be coming my direction at\nThat real clear politics to average is Paul's I think to get that result that I can tell yours out there are the ones we really pay attention to our own and we do a weekly through the finish line at a much better news and that the Kavanaugh\nA episode in Adelaide declared that he was going to vote against the judge or\nEarly on in that in and reaffirmed that\nUh we feel really good with a structural lead that we're going to be taking end of the final three a week that I it was unbelievable what a difference that made because they\nReally were white or in that particular race that a few others what is the differentiating factor and that was that you weaken talent from the bottom and almost\nHe became a click on it at a\nGrassroots just across the board or disappointed with it\nWell it was it was a disaster for Donnelly because Indiana supported cabinet and they believed them\nAnd I know they are seeing the average still has a man but I don't think they've got the cabinet bump in here and I think that bump across the country has been seven eight sometimes ten points Mike Braun because people woke up and said my gosh the future of the courts the future of our liberties backdoor libertarian friends\nOur First Amendment freedoms of speech and religion are are are right to be free of our property being taken without a compensation our Second Amendment right they're all on the ballot because judges are on the ballot\nWhile and on on those particular issues ah\nI've I've got endorsement of the n._r._a. all the pro life groups or the last debate he only agreed to two of 'em uh one was about a week and a half ago clearly pointed all that out if\nWe go mostly by what our own information helped us because we do it right at in Indiana you gotta\nYou start methodology to get accuracy at all I can use we feel we're in great shape a or carrying a structural lead ... that\nWe lost you there for a second Mike or you might be out you might you know they are back I understand George W. Bush came into campaign for you the president's for you you've got to the entire Republican ticket but again I go back to leave libertarians because they really we can't afford them to indulge the idea that ah their vote doesn't matter their vote matters a lot in Indiana\nIt it really does that I think when it comes down that rats that will be making that calculation just like you described it that I think we'll get opposite way up to three or four of those points because when people look into my\nRecord and what I've gone there you're going to see a libertarian streak want that believe that uh the last ... we have the better off we are so uh I think that will become clear\nNow might gets a little bit more difficult time with Mike Braun candidate for Senate in Indiana and on my new audience Janelle corn listen a closely and in South bend down south all the different places were on\nA lot of people still don't know your story so I just want them to hear your story how you came back from Harvard Business school and you built the business and you stayed Hoosier through to the end and now you're coming into politics to help us out of a mess\nYeah when my wife and I decided with tons of opportunity back at the late seventies moved back to our home town\nWe did it because we wanted to have our own business as a ban raise a family primarily blessed with four cats three of them work in the business with me and that she started her own business and our downtown\nAs their only job it was forty years this temper so we've left the American dream and I've had employees with me that it worked for that\nHires rats and and families that work army at ... things like taking on the uh all the issue of the cost of health insurance back ... years ago it provided going in shark\nWhile covering pre existing conditions that cap on average unless unless you out Framingham slap and the air's\nEverything Obamacare was intended to do but it's falling apart because that was big health care and big ... doomed to fail I've done something then the real world actually address that problem\nMan I Want to close by again going back to the fact that Joe Donnelly your opponent voted against Brett Kavanaugh\nThis is a searing moment in American politics because it was so unfair Michael ... is a tax cut calling bread cabinet a gang rape is it was so unfair and Joe Donnelly so for that and do you hear that much out on the\nOn the campaign trail he\nGets the dominating issue at here the other thing is that is exposed the ugly under ballet democratic politics whereas the masses are they won a salad or government they're not willing to pay for\nAnd all they do is demonized tear down a lack of assay that showed up the Kavanaugh proceeding if people are relating at the Senate race because they laid a gate at the same way\nThe the Twitter feed for Mike Braun is Braun B R A un the number for Indiana and if you want to go and help his campaign is Mike Braun for Indiana dot com and you spell out the for their Mike Braun for Indiana dot com\nIt's a it's the closing kick if we went in the end of the Senate belongs to the Republicans\nAre let me conclude by asking uh any more debates are you doing this again\nWe've got one more on October thirtieth\nAnd I'm looking forward to it because with a record like Joes I it makes a debate an easy thing to do that data that record is so lined up with a ... ... of his party that a ... that's being batted that's why I chose a you know\nAll campaign I think is falling apart\nProduct because he's operated and Bennett disguised as a moderate and its true colors the ban with the left side of his party\nYou cannot you can't fool the good people of Indiana Mike Braun thanks for joining me Braun for Indiana on
