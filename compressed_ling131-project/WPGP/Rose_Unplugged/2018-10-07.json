start from relief factor maybe all you need to lower or even eliminate these pain whole lot of people have already gone to relieve factor dot com and here's something\nYou need to know the majority of people who ordered the three week quick star now only Nineteen Ninety five and go on to order more [noise]\nLet's see if we can get you out a pain to go to relieve factor dot com\nThis is a um twelve fifty to answer the following program it's sponsored by Conti law\n[noise]\nDidn't morning and welcome to hockey live on your health the Chinese ...\n... is your legal concierge and we focused primarily on estate planning state administration tax planning an elder law\nThis morning we're going to discuss something that is near and dear to my heart I only because it affects me and I am that perfect example of I Can't discuss estate planning for parents to become parents older and like\nTypically at least in the past ... or having children earlier on in their twenties late twenties you know having our last chat early thirties on in today's day and age\nIt's more common I think for couples to start having children in their late thirties early forties even look at Janet Jackson she had her first child at the age of fifty\nNow that may not make sense to you and this may not apply to you but it is very common so I had my husband and I had our twins and when I was thirty five and people were shocked that that was our first on\nFirst children are and that you know if we were to have more cats\nLet's be honest uh I'll be forty quite soon uh and so it really\nIs important that regardless if you are having your first child or your fifth child as an older parent we want to make sure that certain things in your state plant or up to date and what I mean by that\nIf you have adult children\nAnd you're just having a a newborn than your current state plan may not make sense for that child if something were to happen to you God Forbid [noise] so in this in this show I'm going to use myself is is the example\nRather than talk about other clients that this is common with my clients so let's say something were to happen to both Jason and I\nI Want to make sure that I have the appropriate guardianship language in my documents naming somebody who's able to care for my children if I'm unable to do that or if my husband is unable to do that\nSo in my will or even in a trust we would put the information in there to have someone to act as my kids the guardian\nBecause if I don't\nIf I don't put down who I Want and who I approve to take care of ... and the court is going to ultimately make that decision [noise]\nThe ... the court doesn't know my children the court doesn't know me they don't know if the person who the court would choose is the ideal person to take care of my kids\nSo here's the perfect example my brother and sister in law do very well for themselves they don't live here they live in Germany um they travel the world they have in what some people would see is an ideal life\nExcess wells freedom uh even though they work their not tied to their jobs so they have more time than most working parents now they are parents but their their son his older um\nThey would be an ideal candidate\nIf God Forbid something were to happen to my husband and I did take my kids and raise them they'd be able to give them everything that they could ever possibly ask for now that may not be perfect because then we don't want my kids to be spoiled either but\nOn paper they are the perfect candidate and let's be honest I Love my brother my sister in law\nThey're great people they could not handle to four year olds\n[noise] my husband's family on the other hand our local they're here they have children\nWe said that that money would be invested and set aside\nAnd my children would not receive a distribution of that money until they attain the age of thirty\nWe did and a third at the age of thirty\nA third at the age of thirty five and the remaining balance at the age of forty\nI had other clients do a direct distribution at twenty five or forty the oldest distribution change that I've personally drafted was for a lady who said I Want my son to retire before he gets the money he will not get a distribution until he turned sixty seven\nNow this is all based on your ... personal preference and belief\nIs in the interim back to my example my brother acting as trustee if he needs to get money out of that account for any health education maintenance or support matters it's called the ... standard\nSo education is clear\nSo my kids need tuition paid doesn't matter what level of education\nAnd you can be very specific as to why the trustee can invade the principal prior to the age of distribution\nSo if there's medical matters my brother could write that check if they need to pay tuition he can write that check\nIf they need a reasonable vehicle or a down payment on a house he can write that check now that's not necessarily always standard that is just what we put in our document\nSo it's up to you and what you're comfortable with and what you allow that trust the\nThe power to do obviously they're going to manage whatever assets are in that trust and their job is to protect and first to preserve those monies for the beneficiary\n[noise]\nIf you have older kids and then you have this new baby or a younger child\nWe would be able to set some aside possibly for the younger child's college education or just their daily needs let's be honest if you pass and you have a child in diapers\nAnd I know there's all too well I had two kids in diapers at the same time it costs a small fortune\nFood education\nSports activities my nephews are both very active uh in football and hockey baseball\nIts astounding what my sister in law and brother in law what they pay on a monthly basis hockey especially I Would want my children to be able to do those things and enjoy\nWhat otherwise they would be able to do if I wasn't here\nSo that that trust these job what they're able to do they are able to go in and pull money out for that child it's just\nJust allowing that child to have access to that large sum of money and again I don't care if the sum of money is ten thousand dollars or ten million dollars\nAnd it comes down to what you are comfortable with are you comfortable with an Eighteen year old getting a large sum of money and I'll tell you a quick story that I tell\nA lot of my clients and I had and I I Believe that I've told you this in the past as\nWell and this happened ... years and years ago and I've been on the show for years and years so I Apologize if you've heard it but I had a gentleman back in two thousand and eight who he was raising a grandson\nAnd he was leaving everything to his grandson his grandson at that time was in his early twenties maybe late teens and I mentioned to him we could put what's called the remainder trust in his will so that even though his grandson would be the beneficiary it would be held\nSo that the\nThe grandson couldn't go and blow all the money and I don't know if it was because the grandfather but he had much more time\nBut I like to be realistic we don't know when our time is going to come life can change in an instant\nAnd in his case he passed much sooner than expected and so when he passed his grandson received a large sum of money out right at the age of believe is twenty two\nAnd he showed up in my office with a brand new Bentley who am I I don't know if it was brand new argues that I Know he spent about three hundred thousand dollars on this car I'm not big into cars so I don't know if that's\nUsed new I just know that he misuse the money\nAnd that was not his grandfather's intention his grandfather expected him to invest that and\nTo allow that money to grow and be there for him when he was older not to go and buy a vehicle that was going to appreciate the second he drove off the lot\nWithout planning without putting those stipulations and there was nothing anybody could do\nEven if it wasn't the grandfather's wish there was nothing any of us could do\nTo say no you can't go and buy this vehicle now this is this doesn't happen all the time but it really sticks in my memory because he was a legal age you can do whatever he wanted with that money because that money was his\nIt doesn't matter if it was a bad decision\nSo this is why I feel it's very important to make sure we tie up those loose ends so that the same thing doesn't occur\nFor you for me I don't want my kids going out and buying a Bentley I don't want them going out and buying a whatever a Toyota I Want them to have\nIf they need a vehicle a reasonable vehicle used vehicle they don't need anything fancy but again those are my opinions I have other clients who disagree and that's fine\nBefore we finished up the show I Want to repeat our information Conti law we're here to educate you to guide you to answer your questions\nWe can be reached seven two four seven eight four zero to three nine our website is Conti law P.

H. dot com\n[noise] and if you have any questions or concerns I can address them on our next show [noise] the other thing you need\nTo consider and if you're just tuning in we're discussing planning\nIf you're an older parent if you're having children later in life we discuss the necessity of guardianship potentially a remainder trust for those kids and other consideration is retirement savings I work with a lot of financial advisors\nAnd I've heard them say we need to prioritize\nSaving for your retirement verse saving for your child or children's college\nAnd let's be honest I have student debt your kids are able to more easily\nGet student loans rather than you barring for retirement it's easier when I was in school and I was a long time ago they were throwing money at us\n\nOne of the advantages however of being an older parent as you may be more financially stable\nDepending if you're retired when that child goes to college or not\nThey may qualify for more financial aid\nSo these are things that we just got to keep in the back of our mind the let's make sure we\nProtect and preserve what you have for your life so you don't run out of money and again we don't know when you may pass but I'd rather take care of you rather than you having to come out of retirement to get a job\nI've seen this happen is very sad you may say well I'll give my kids X amount of dollars for a down payment I'll give my kids money to pay for college so they don't go into debt\nBut in the same breath we need to make sure your preserving your own funds for you and your spouse so you have money to take care of yourself\nWell like I said folks on today's show we're discussing strategies to help you build more certain key into your retirement and your overall financial life and you know we all like certainly and predictability in our lives right Jay\nRight and and when it comes to retirement we like it a lot I mean the bottom line is you can retire when you want to\nYou can control your destiny as long as you make sure that you have enough income to last as long as you do and that's only going to happen if you take the steps that you need is not going to happen by accident it happens by action and as always remember the phone number eight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three will help show you what that action\nIsn't you know one thing that's really interesting about retirement is that when you're working you're out there and you're collecting a steady paycheck you know without fail\nYou check that direct deposit every couple of weeks and there is money that's going into the bank\nAnd the paycheck provide you the certainty that you need to pay your bills and hopefully have some fun there but when you hit retirement age\nThat paycheck certainty it largely kinda tosses out the window\nAnd the critical X factor for a successful retirement as I said\nJust a few moments ago is replenishing the certainty that you had during your working years and that process starts with figuring out how much income you'll need in retirement and that's what we call the real knowing your number you know not the commercials with people walking around and how much they have saved but this is how much income will unique\nOur time is different than anything you've ever done before and and that's why our team here at the synergy group we specialize in this specific area of financial planning knowing your number is our processes helping you discover exactly how much income you'll need and then we build a retirement income plan that meets you are a number\nOf years ago there was a company called I. N. G. analysis orange bunny rabbit the runs around it's called Voyager and they did that no your number thing but no your number isn't about how much you have any account I mean you could have five million dollars in there and that might not be the right number for you to retire now your number is taking a look at your budget\nTaking a look at how much you want to spend and how much you would like to spend on top of that we we call those joy expenses and making sure that the fix sources that are there I mean you add that to Social Security pieces together you add the expansion ... if that's there\nAnd then you look to the for one of the four o three to build the gap so of the budget need seven thousand a month to do everything you want to do including taking those trips and the fix numbers or five thousand dollars how much you've gotten the for three to take out of there to to build that guaranteed peace uh there's a great example of came out of USA Today\nTalked about real lipstick but I think that's real actual name but\nI don't know how you get to the type of yeah maybe it is but the route that put a million dollars together they according to the example of USA Today and he decided he wasn't going to pay fees it was just going to go into an as in the index fund and let it go because obviously you have five hundred companies in there and wide degree of diversification so he thought it'd be fine\nDecided he could based on a a retirement calculator decided he could take five percent off of that and started doing that take I'm forty one hundred and sixty seven dollars a month\nAnd a ... as it as things went along a between two thought this was the apple goes from two thousand two thousand nine by the end of two thousand fourteen years and he was up sixty three percent\nFather he had a lot of extra money in his account there is a ... the million dollars you started with Terry was down to three hundred and thirty six thousand seven or eight although he had\nTaken money obviously here taking money out of there but because of what have you with experience in the S. A. T. that declined that they went along there that two thousand eight to ... he was not in a position to continue using fibers that he was in a position to take two percent so\nIt's not about how big the number that you start it's about what you can contractually bill that will give a guarantee that's an income planned Jay could you talk about what an income plant is\nYeah I mean it certainly doesn't sound like a having a certain plan their sounds more like racket Ralph dentists are they going to\nFall Ralph's did get wrapped in fact I think I saw that Home Depot yeah he was demonstrating pattern cards or something like that wasn't and I think he was either in really nothing against Home Depot and got her car\nNot but when you when you look at what Ralph could have done you know what ... what could have done different is building income plan as you said that and that starts with that inventory you know what you need you know what do we need on a monthly basis what do we have coming in\nAnd then where's that gap what where's the gap that we need to fail to be able to uh be able to do what we want and that comes from your resources you have to listen to resources\nI Will throw out the website back out there synergy group Inc dot com under the resources have there's a great syllable a budget worksheet that you can walk through and it really does help to point out some of those categories when you're trying to figure out an inventory of what you'll need in retirement some of those things that you\nI forget about and it like I said conveniently fills it in for you or the website at the budget worksheet at synergy group Inc dot com under the resource tap so once you figure out okay this is what we need we need an extra thousand dollars a month over and above our Social Security over and above a rental and gum or pension or whatever might be their\nVenue determine how why segment those resources that four O. one K. or IRA or the CDs I have to be able to create a thousand dollars with his little disruption as possible and and Ralph could have said look I'm going to take part of my million dollars\nAnd put that aside to create what I Need so that I don't end up in a situation if two thousand eight were to occur and folks that's around the corner I mean I don't know if it will be as bad as it will be worse\nBut the next market cycle the major down market cycle and when that occurs you don't want to be in that position that Ralph does which means you need an income plan that's what we're going to talk about a lot here today\nAre you listening to locks on your retirement here on your favorite radio station our topic today is three strategies to build certainty into your retirement\nAnd you know we talked to a a minute ago about knowing your number and we referenced that one commercial where folks want it to know how much they needed to save and folks we used that term here to knowing your number but it's a different number\nAnd and just like in the commercial that number is different for every single person that comes in the door and let me just say this Jane Roy I'm over the last two months I put together income plans and the number was so diverse for a young single girl who are not yet young she's getting close to retirement\nThat her number was thirty six thousand dollars a year that's what she needed to live on her income number was her income number that's right it wasn't about hitting that million dollars and Ralph thought that he was in great shape because he had a million bucks\nThat's not the number that you're looking at\nSo you know this this ... this girl and needed to thirty six thousand dollars a year I had a couple they're spending a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year that's the number that you're looking to fix to not just finding that arbitrary number that I Need to save you\nSat down with some folks just last week and they were looking for that one fifty a year number two and they can support that\nBut what they hadn't done in the original calculations simply that we all need to do it has to put the determination as to how much does the government going to share with us before we get to keep what's left and if you haven't thought about state taxes even those are federal taxes are going down of the way we maybe take our exemptions maybe ... before and all of the standard deduction gives us a little bit more\nAbility to duck that and then they were not itemized anymore it's why we have the CPA at the end of the hall I mean Tom Barrett here is able to answer those questions if you come in and we have a conversation and you're bringing a copy of your tax records we could show you\nMathematically what it would look like last year compared to what the new tax implications would be under the under the current law so if you haven't built tax planning is your retirement plan you really have a builder good retirement\nWell and that's why the clients and take advantage of Tom services here I Know that their tax situation every year is being constantly monitored and\nAnd that information is being shared with us the visor so that we can make sure that that plan is still viable you know we can update it we can tweak it and make sure that it's it's still going to do what it was originally designed to do\nRight so you have to factor taxes in there and then you also have to factor in what's normal type of longevity uh the average American should plan to spend at least twenty two years in retirement according to a recent study they're so twenty two years of the average amount of time\nPeople spend our retirement and if you're one of those people to say look I you know I understand what you guys are talking about but I really want to know how much do I need to have saved because I'm a goal oriented person and I can't just figure that out yet you know Tony Robbins put it in his book money master the game to get a two step formula\nBasically said okay what do you need to live off of if you need eighty thousand dollars a year to live you take that number and you multiply by twenty and that's a good target to shoot for those people that need to target out there um and Tony Robbins has really entered the financial industry and thrown some good tip solved there\nAre so those are some things to think about but there's a lot more than that it's not just we're just kind of scratching the surface here\nOn today's show is sharing three strategies to build certainty into your retirement thanks for tuning into locks on your retirement we just

these ghettos running around the house but\nI I mean in the end the person you can count on the most of the person that you see in the mirror I mean it's certainly up to you to do the hard work to have enough saved for retirement yet saving for retirement is only half the battle is crazy that sounds\nThat's the easy part the real battle is how do I adjust or turn my life savings into retirement income that will last as long as God has me on this earth and you know how are you going to guarantee that you don't outlive your assets and we're going to talk about that we're not talking about a traditional role and we've even why that's outdated\nAbout traditional advice says that you should withdraw four percent from your portfolio again this is that four percent role and you shouldn't run out of money ever as long as you let it would last into your late night\nYou know are you using your stock or your mutual fund portfolio to provide that income to to pave the way for years of retirement income well you know that four percent rule don't be so sure there are some serious pitfalls to this advice\nMay biblical be speaking or you look when language was causing problems gone brought the time to be able down by\nGiving them different language to confuse them sometimes the language you hear out there about the four percent rule might be designed to confuse you also a again there was an article in the marketplace or maybe two thousand eleven from Dr David babble there where he talks he's a professor risk management award in school business\nUh and he said that if you have a stock portfolio and throw a four percent per year plus inflation you have a Ninety percent chance of running out of the money and retirement\nHow wait a second I thought that said Ninety percent chance of success\nNo Ninety percent chance of failure and again I remember he was living that pain the pain that we kind of forgotten that two dollars in aid two thousand nine vein\nThat if you look at that comment four percent distribution Ninety percent chance of running out of money before you run out of breath it might just give you cause the concern is that the proper strategy for retirement income\nAnd here's where the fallacy lies many people say well I've lived through these market conditions I have the risk tolerance to stomach this look every time that I've lost my money alone the market has rebounded and all these years that I've been building this retirement up it's always work to just stay invested in the market will so she's never been retired\nYou've never actually gone from adding to your portfolio month by month paycheck to paycheck\nTo withdrawing from your portfolio month by month\nPaycheck from paycheck you've never done this before and that's why we're telling you things will be different this time it may have worked in the past but that same strategy of just trusting the market through and through your creates this scenario where you're no longer dollar cost averaging you're doing something called dollar costs ravaging\nWell and that's a good point because as your building your accounts and you're working in putting money away that dollar cost averaging is really a\nIf it to you you really want to see some contraction because if you're doing dollar cost averaging you're you're putting the same amount into your account every month going into your for one of your IRA you're purchasing positions at various cost and what it's doing is lowering your overall cost of investment so well ever the flip", "show_name": "Rose
