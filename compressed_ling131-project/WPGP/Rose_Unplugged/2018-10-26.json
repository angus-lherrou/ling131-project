from the way and so glad to be back in time to talk again\nWas secretary of health and Human Services Alex ... is our who joins me inside the beltway I'm In the early factor that comes to ... is our welcome back I Want to talk to you about drug pricing and good morning to you but\nI had to visit the pharmacy this week for the Z pack and all the other stuff that goes when you get bronchitis a tell me and I was little sticker shock that I've got an insurance what were you when the president talking about yesterday about lowering drug prices\nWell he was great to be with you again ah yesterday morning here at ha chess we actually revealed data showing that in one of the most important parts of our drug program\nMedicare pays one hundred and eighty percent\nOf what Europeans and Japanese pay for the same medicines\nUnder deals that farm it gives them\nAnd the president came over here to ha chess and he said that's going to stop that for a free ride into the stock we're ... we're going to be done without paying sticker price in that part of the Medicare program and we're going to get the benefit of these foreign prices here in America and it'll save\nSeventeen billion dollars over five years for the program and three and a half billion over five years for patients like you when you get your drugs\nNow six days aren't I Want people to know your very fine lawyer you are what we call a litigator having clerked for the right honorable Michael would act in my correct about that\nIndeed I was his first Locklear\nOkay so I Want him to be our next attorney general but there's a litigator you all have concern for what the statute permits you to do and whether the regulations which will go through the nose to commit ... are going to be labeled an overreach and you know the big pharma spends a hundred and Seventy one million bucks you're alarming so you're going to get\nA zillion comments during the notice income and face when do you think\nUh and without pre judging the outcome ha chess will be able to issue a regulation from the center for Medicare and Medicaid innovation to implement this proposal\nAre planning to have this up and running by the end of twenty Nineteen so the end of next year or the beginning of twenty twenty we're going to take input but let me be I Want to be really clear if you were going to be doing this\nWe're going to get input to do it the right way but we're going to end of this foreign free riding that's not debatable it's gonna it's gonna happen but we'll do it the right way and we're doing it open and transparent process to ensure we're seeing around corners and doing everything right because we want to make sure this works for hospitals want to make sure it works for\nFor our providers for our doctors and want to make sure absolutely it works for patients and will do whatever it takes\nTo make it work for all of them so they save money they have access and we stopped this for free riding and\nAt how far is taking advantage of us\nNow senator or is there I agree with all that but I go back to the fact I think by the time your regulars out into the courts Chevron doctrine well I've been greatly limited so I expect the Supreme Court to look very very closely if the statute under which you are proceeding\nHave you already done that as a litigator and can and persuaded yourself but you got the authority to do what essentially it looks like a referencing to me and midpoint averaging like the real clear politics average of drug prices and implement that as the will buy price preventive care\nThat that that's correct you know um I actually have through a what's called the center for Medicare and Medicaid innovation\nExtremely broad authority to test alternative methods of making payments and Medicare\nTo improve patient quality access and affordability and efficiency of the program that's why this is a demonstration project that will take place in fifty percent of America it has very clear metrics to be studied really\nI have not the least bit of concern about our legal authority to do this to do this project\nThat's very good to know which ... now what about the Americans are on the other fifty percent of the country they're not going to be happy [laughter]\nWell you know I'm using as you just said I'm using the full authority that I've got I Do have to test a proposition\nCan't just do it across the board for everyone now if Congress like this idea they can do it tomorrow across America I'm and I'm happy to work with them if they're interested in that up\nBut for the rest of Americans who are not in the fifty areas the fifty percent of the country that will be doing this they're still going to see a benefit because as we the way the system works\nAs we hold down the reimbursements in this fifty percent of America\nThe silly way that we currently fixed prices in this program will also pulled down the reimbursements as a result in the other fifty percent of the country not as much but they will still get some of that data\nTo conclude secretaries are of health and Human Services you got a new proposal it's going to notice and comment rule making you expect to have it in operation by twenty Nineteen what do you expect a health care premiums to look like in the year at\nA so we actually have had great results Medicare Advantage and part D these are two of the most important programs for our seniors the premiums for them under President Trump's leadership have gone down\nAnd you know I I we we get some golf for this but we don't we don't like Obamacare we think it's fundamentally flawed within gets\nBroken we think the premiums are too high and it needs to be repealed and replaced but President Trump's doing a better job run in that program the guy the guy whose name is on it\nPremiums actually for the silver benchmark plan on which everything is based are going down over one percent in the coming year for the first time in the history of that program and choices of plans are up\nFor the first time since two thousand Fifteen it's still a broken program it's still not meeting the needs of our citizens but we're least making it work as well as it cannot tell Congress fixes it and replaces it\nGoing winters myth and reality you can't put it down you cannot put down leaders General McChrystal welcome back always a pleasure to talk to us by honor thank you\nI got to tell you this is a it's home for me because I've spent hundreds of hours with dark I help Richard Nixon write the book leaders and Winston Churchill great contemporaries is one of my favorites so when I saw that Stanley McChrystal had done to talk for the new millennium six pairs of leaders compare plus one stand on I thought I cannot wait to see the Thirteen are\nBut I didn't allow myself to go through the table of contents I wanted to be surprised are you still and I bought my surprise are you still surprised by the leaders you and ... and mango and chose to profile\nYou I actually am you know I thought we were going to come out with sort of the ...\nExpected political leader or even business leader group but we try to get diversity and what they did and their sex is in the background and whatnot and and I feel really good about it\nWell you said we lack I I'm quoting here now we lack the leadership equivalent of a general theory of relativity so you set out to outline and underscored the complexities and I finished the book and I thought to myself I don't have a formula and I don't think he wanted me to have a formula\nThat's exactly right you know we we were writing this book and partway through we came out with the realization that leadership is it what we think it is and studying history we realize it never has been\nAnd so as we went back to deconstruct what leadership actually constitutes we learned it's not something that leaders possess that they\nAim at followers and they make things happen it's really like an interaction between potential factors followers and leaders and it's always changing and therefore endlessly complex\nSo now I Want to warn the audience I'm Talking about some specific from leaders myth in reality so if you want to be surprises I was you can just turn it off and go over to the book on Amazon dot com leaders met them reality by Stanley McChrystal Jeff ... and a trace of men go\nBut if you don't mind getting a little bit of a spoiler let let me just say the biggest surprise for me is defined rubs fear and Zarqawi at the middle of your book but boy does it make sense when you're done with reading about these two villains they were villainous leaders of extraordinary ability\nAnd the effectiveness that's exactly right and we we call those zealots because their strength came from ... to the shore AT T of their conviction and the fact that they wouldn't waiver from what they believed even though we might think what they believed was completely wrong it gave them a magnetism for followers\nI also picked up general ... names I mean a great deal um zealots and other leaders end up with different sets of name Trump spare became being corrupt double stark how we took on many different names for him\nAnd so this renaming process is part of our myth building and to get back to the core person you always went back to their childhood as grant recommended we do if you want to know the man find the trial\nThat's exactly right because\nI don't think people stray too far from what initially forms and we talk about ... years this tough upbringing in Zarqa in Jordan industrial town he gets cat too she's kind of a bully he gets his fight she does these things and show the rest of his life\nIs both a journey to move away from that\nTo become a leader to become an ideologically pure Islam is but also you can step away from the fact in many ways she's a thug\nAnd when he personally ... people he's not far from me she's\n... and and to bring up the full portrait of the evil and develop tree is and to do it in thirty pages is amazing there's lots of disgust Coco Chanel is a wonder\nAh Walt Disney is far more complex than I imagine and I got a confessed to I've never even heard I Hope I pronounced it correctly John who I had never even heard of him I'll be talking about him and not president she is using in with the secretary of state in a few minutes how when did you discover junk am I saying quickly showing who\nDon't have something I hadn't\nDie there when we were studying this we wanted to find somebody from Asia China preferably and that is that the agitation we had on John ... was a lot of what he's he's known for you know being seven feet tall having a five foot waste\nBeing a made a unique at age ten and then yet but coming very famous admiral all of those things don't seem believable and of course many of them may not be accurate but the reality is she has become a symbol for modern China\nAnd so she symbolizes that China's past was international and show that the bell road initiative is using being is pushing\nHe can go back and point to somebody look John ... and go look this isn't new for us this is legitimate because we've been doing it for hundreds of years\nThe astonishing success or the treasure play again I'm admitting my historical ignorance I didn't know about the treasure quake I did not know that China had ventured as far as they did on the seas and then when you bring up the president is using it in the road and don't rhetoric\nAnd they're building this blue water navy pick up more should put a plug that we have right now General McChrystal it's a great warning to people to read leaders\nWell names better so called me stand who [laughter]\nBut no that's exactly right you know leaders get leverage to and when I say leaders get leverage dinner lifetime they can get leverage but their legacy gets leverage it has a purpose in a value mean Coco Chanel is still a brand that sells things Joan ... is a symbol\nReal ... Pierre in some ways is a symbol for some but it's also a cautionary tale for others\nOut somebody who's a lawyer by training who comes fanatical in his beliefs so fanatical that he essentially leads to reign of terror we look at that and we say even somebody trying to achieve something as arguably\nAdmirable as a virtue of the new French Republic can get so horribly off track\nNow I wanted to say the last three minutes of our very brief introduction to leaders and it's in every book stores on Amazon right now and I'm going to try and get General McChrystal over to the studio to do a long conversation about this\nUh the Marlborough man Robert ... coming up is up my compound other West Point man you're a ... point man but the sort of archetype of West point man is Robert ... I didn't know that I'm reading from page twenty five\nOther general Dwight Eisenhower MacArthur Patton were depicted and statues at West point how about ... but ... was reserved the special honor of emulate ...\nIowa with many other young leaders vendor raided him for his unwavering dignity stoic commitment and courageous leadership but I got to compliment you Stanley McChrystal because\nYou came to grips with the other side of the way and he was cruel to the people in slave and he broke his votes in the United states and so while he had what you call the extraordinary ability for war deeply mixed record\nThat's exactly right I mean\nI grew up literally wishing I could be Robert de ... but never thinking that I could achieve that level of performance or actual as but yet he he really at two things first he lost\nNow people can make excuses you didn't have as many soldiers or logistics but he lost so if he was the c._e._o. you judge that way but much more importantly he chose to betray the shame of that I made it\nA secretary of tail made in the plane at West point tried to destroy the United states of America which his role model George Washington and helped create and then did it in defense of slavery and they almost no way to square that\nAnd I won't tell people about the portrait and your personal story 'cause that's worth that that gripped you and people need to read about it but I Want to know somebody had no merit somebody the merits of family McChrystal rack up at West point\nOh now that's a fair question [laughter] zero I think everyone [laughter]\nLet me let me close by talking with you about I'm not I've seen in Bernstein that's fascinating Harriet Tubman now I Know about Harriet Tubman since being a small child\nBut boy did she have got a\nAnd I don't know that many people in America no that today\nI think when we think of Harriet Tubman we think of this small African American former slave she went back into slave controlled territory certain\nGene times if she'd been captured on one of them would she would have been ... probably executed to bring out fellow slaves and so her personal her\nRicher personal dedication and yet she wanted nothing for herself and so as a consequence she lived to old age still very modest in our lifestyle very modest except in for symbolism she became\nBoth for African Americans and for females proof that you can do things that matter and that's symbolic she became incredibly important and I would argue still is today\nAnd then finally the unusual pairing you're following the turkey and method here lost weight and Margaret Thatcher is the most unusual that clear but it works I mean are you surprised that it works\nYeah we we really short of wrestle with that one because they're very different but\nBut if you think about it Margaret Thatcher has this conviction of a set of beliefs and she's very effective through a sort of a normal arc of a career and then of course she's politically assassinated when people get tired of that has to many leaders\nIn the exact dosage that the scientists that really factor dot com came up with\nOmega a research all I care and encourage them and
