People's Republic of China develop tools of information filtering and basically control when this as a nation that has admitted that a million cars in concentration camps\nYeah I think vice president Pence spoke very eloquently on that point or at his speech at the Hudson Institute last week\nAnd I think the biggest applause line he got was when he said to the information technology sector don't cooperate with the Chinese in in this effort I Would say the shareholders of these companies that portray themselves as the open Internet transparent future\nReally you want to make money off of

control area outlook we did this and continue to do it in terms of dual use technology that could affect nuclear chemical or biological weapons are ballistic missile\nDevelopment I think in cyberspace we're entitled to do the same thing\nThat because we've abandoned free market principles but because we have to be realistic about the adversaries we face in the world today that use the fruits of

administration and Bob Woodward's book a lot was overlook one thing that was overlooked was a candidate missions that they had hit and the scope of the north Korean nuclear problem\nFrom the country so that they had to work for a President Obama had to warn president but that was his biggest problem did they in fact conceal the extent of the problem and we're we prepared for pre emptive strike the Woodward describes\nWell that the Obama policy they described a strategic patience\nOr that is a synonym for doing nothing about North Korea\nAnd it's another example of a ... bill coming due for President Trump a I think the combination of the potential use of military force against North Korea and the maximum pressure\nCampaign that the president waged on the economic front is what has

the place we are today if we'd continued to pursue\nA rock Obama's policies I think four more years of that under Hillary Clinton would've guaranteed and North Korea with deliverable nuclear weapons

after taking two hundred thousand people in power in southern Virginia and leaving a\nTrail of destruction tears from the panhandle north I Am joined by Dr Larry on President Hillsdale College Hillsdale dot edu for all of your Hillsdale needs and his online course on Churchill which apparently very necessary reading for some people in America who thought\nChurchill gotten to this cabinet business doctor before we begin with\nJustice cabinet although tragedy\nAt this level is a little hard for people to grasp but when you look and see\nThat Panama city's gone Mexico City beach has gone to Dale air force base which was home to three thousand people in the military all their possessions are gone ... what do you tell your students about tragedy and sadness of it yeah well you\nGot to pick up and go again but that that's you know when this thing come through and they the water is the big thing you know when ... modern buildings don't really blow down all that much but the water pumps and that just you know you got to start over\nWhat when when England went through the blitz and large parts of it were destroyed and every night this terrible stuff what happened how ... how did they introduce resilience or was that just part of the national character already\nWell uh you know people don't like being bombed and [laughter] and then makes them just like the people who are doing it so they got\nReally rapidly now they they uh you know Winston Churchill as prime minister of Great Britain and he was pretty good job so not only did he give eloquent speeches\nIt's also true that they came up with an insurance scheme you know and so you can bear the burden of that yourself and the way it works you know you can drive through London today and if you\nSee a cluster of old buildings and then an interruption with new buildings and then\nThe old buildings resume that's the bombing at her and if you go up blocking turn left and left again you'll see the same thing repeated in the next block over and so it just cuts swath\nOf London and you know if you were in the law and\nYou got you got hammered but it was it was a you know people wanted to know what's so it's different than you know a natural thing like this there isn't anybody with him to get angry here well I guess you can blame it on me for global warming or you\nKnow if that was there was a lot of that going on by the way they are and they forget the Labor Day storm of the Nineteen thirties the destroyed a lot of Rhode Island they forget Camille in the sixties I mean it it's convenient for Gulf goes up and down and different years it's up this year and that made it tougher\nMhm yeah it\nDid and uh and if you live on the coast you know and what we see in this Michael thing is living right on the coast is\nDangerous if you live in the Gulf are only letting seaboard but uh if you know if you live five miles and that's not like you're enjoying wonderful coastal living now and that is so those people are getting punished and that's too bad you\nKnow I talk this morning with a northern or they or Virginia Beach family or because they have two hundred thousand people without without a power down there and so it started in Florida went through Georgia South Carolina North Carolina an exit in Virginia [noise] that's just never happened before that is a weird thing\nThat we're going to have to see the president respond to it but now and I told everyone or Tim Roebuck on USA dot org if they want to help out let's turn to the other tragedy which was the violence done to the presumption of innocence\nAnd I think this is a answer the mob rule that with legitimate eyes are and to the difference between political rallies and chanting lock her up\nWhich I don't particularly approve of it but it's a rally and it's a chance [noise] versus menacing Ted Cruz and his wife in a restaurant with the imminent threat of violence or they have to be mobs in Portland I think we've lost our capacity\nTo distinguish Larry between political speech and political violence\nTo two weeks ago a ... I read something by the grandson and I heard of talking Hillsdale by Charles Kessler and they both use the expression cold civil war and uh you know this is like the early Nineteen fifties right\nEntertainment news you mean painting or Eighteen fifty Shia Eighteen fifty\nAnd what is the feature of it the point is we have to have an agreement that we're going to decide our political differences through a process and the process has to be agreed in advance and especially if the process is hallowed\nThen you don't want to mess with it right if you read Lincoln's great first inaugural address he says the first time that\nA ballots ever placed bullets in a fundamental too so it was just it was an eight hundred in the United states of America which I think is true so so the point is you're going to so the people elect under the constitutional process sees a majority in ...\nAnd the president of the same party and he gets to elect a bunch of people on the Supreme Court that can't be planned in advance that's you know that's how the constitution works and so to obstruct the process because you know what what I think\nIs it was a shame for this thing even to be taken up and the reason is\nThat that lady seems like a fine lady ensues sincere but there is no evidence for this and it happened you know a human generation ago when Brett Kavanaugh was it was a kid so the thing is that something that you just would not be able to get to the bottom\n... it is a problem of proof at the very beginning that ought to have been recognized and interminable but it was politicized who was weapon I\nI Want to pause for a moment of cold civil war 'cause veteran I have a disagreement about this from Charles and I I went up the ante them two weekends ago and that's a hot civil war that twenty three thousand people dead in one day from a dunk or church all the way down to burn side bridge and\nEven in the Eighteen fifties we had you know John Brown and the Bush ... in Kansas and stuff like that or we're not there but I Do think the warning about what happens when we don't realize that\nDebate can be fierce but you cannot men is a that is the constitutional touched by the way in in the in the Supreme Court which is the intention and the ability to incite violence\nIs illegal it's not protected speech\nWhich right that's right and you know the so I I think I said this on a couple of weeks ago but in in the Nineteen forty five Winston Churchill last elections the socialist\nWhom he said what ultimately result in a ... and the socialist got forty eight to vote and they got over sixty percent of the seats and so\nOf course the conservatives rumblings about\nThat in church gives them a speech he's the leader of the opposition now and he says we're not going to complain about that this is the constitutional system this is how they got in and this is how we're going to replace them and so you know it\nIt contrast that with the ... of the electoral college and now the Senate in the country in other words there isn't any constitutional range but that shouldn't be it's not subject to a salt in the interest of partisan politics of the day it\nIs that is true everything is under assault and if you're not on the right team the media will\nAbsolutely demonize you and by the media I mean the broadcast networks with the exception of Fox I mean the big newspapers I mean the beltway Manhattan Media we they are the left and they will demonize you if you are not on the left and they will protect you if you are and Kanye West is finding out big time on CNN\nWhere they are mocking him in terms that were any\nOther commentator to use concerning any other minority that come to her would be off the air\nYeah well we did have the Donald Trump rule now and that is anything can be said about him or anybody connected to him [laughter] that's a new feature of American politics\nThe repeat that that is true\nYeah it ... when we come back we're

siting Churchill ... and said\nSomething I'm paraphrasing mark here in fact he did not realize the Churchill was so offensive and I immediately began to dumb people go watch\nThe church on video that this can't be allowed to happen where Churchill cannot be turned into a pariah in history because he was a product of the nineteenth century and and then rose to greatness and the twentieth\nWell first of all isn't that a shining example of a public courage this fella [laughter]\nYou know I just got a buddy for that on the line he he's a he's a navy fighter pilot astronaut and sleep walk with Gabby Giffords is an admirable\nGuy but he pulled it up because nobody wants to be thought to be a racist and she'll be so Churchill was a racist people run away instead of saying no no no he wasn't no he was not Great Britain is perhaps the least racist country in the world\nYeah so he says the point is I have little doubt that he's brave and kind of combat and if so thank him for his service right right but the truth is if you use the guy\nWho does turn out to be a great guy but never mind that he didn't know anything about that apparently right if you use the guy isn't it and you get

thirty thirty five years God willing to write opinions that will be his legacy but Churchill whom you've studied your entire life often was assailed\nBy criticisms some fair mostly unfair how did he deal with that Larry art\nBut well he uh this is a ah this this will be a controversial point with people probably but\nWe have changed the libel and slander law is in America is they have not done in England and he would sue people if they said things that were not true oh what what I did not know he was litigious well not you know huge amount but uh\nLike a a fellow ah there's lord Alfred Douglas and as I wrote a book and\nYou know he used and said that when he was little boy\nThat sentence was he stole and he was beat\nAnd just let them take that back\nYou know it's like kind of parallel to Kavanaugh right yeah he's a rather interesting ... wrote in a favorable book about church the church it was it the when he was in high school and Churchill made him take it back\nAnd uh you know Churchill's famous areas went to see the ... and the guy was prostrate before Churchill you know just trying to write a\nFavorable book and Churchill was tough about it he demanded a complete retraction and he got it and what was your name or well there's another guy I Can't remember the guy's name but there was another guy in the lord Alfred\n... always with a scandal about Churchill all the time and they have litigation and they were and you know but the thing is if somebody what we've done now is we have made it so that if you're in a public figure than it's very difficult\nFor you to to have any relief if somebody tells a law against cute that harms and that is one of the reasons why the media is so ... you know I mean on both left and right\nNow you know I I honestly like New

that I Would that would be knowing disregarded the facts but I could come pretty doggone close to that in any other you know you can just make wild assertions\nIn in American media and we are beyond touched because of New York times we saw that I liked that but that is not the case in Great Britain\nAnd if he is so Kevin Oh gosh you know he he's got children right yes damaged by this year your point is not just that\nHe might not have gotten confirmed on the Supreme Court nobody has a right to that right but your point is his personal reputation has been hard exact when he will ever after the the person who\nYou know was accused of the things right and they'll never be the resolution of it and that means\nHis children will be on the inside but how better if he chose to do it for them to be able to say they had to retract that because that wasn't true\nThere's there is a trade off here um because it is true Thirty years from now some of them will be using\nThe ... claims against their kids to hurt them\nPincher them right they'll say oh yeah we all know that and and and I knew that what was weighing on him because you and I are both fathers right and so we know that that weighs on a parrot that what people say about you will be used against your children and so I understood is anger and I would have been\nDone that he was not that angry\nYeah that's right and and you know you you I urge you because you run your show at a certain way in other words you don't go around slandering people all the window\nAnd you [laughter] yeah you know are you talking to [laughter] do I think that really count because he's not really [laughter]\nSo it's you and me and the way our whole field [laughter] everybody but\nThe point is you should surrender your affection for that
