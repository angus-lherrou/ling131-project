there are a to\nAssist in the recovery Mitch McConnell went to the Senate floor yesterday to critique Hillary Clinton's words are not being civil here is what he said\nA minute came to Washington peacefully to share their stories\nThe loudest voices proved to be those other politically motivated far less the same for all the special interests to pledge total opposition to any Supreme Court nominee before the ac was even draw on justice Kennedy's retirement they pulled out all the law\nBut everything that good when it became clear justice Kavanaugh's nomination would not be stopped on the merits well as we know that was all in the beginning\nFar left activists decided that the United States Senate and their members should be harassed and intimidated wherever they live in a restaurant with family got out of their own car or on their own home\nAnything well\nWhen they do not get their way one of these toxic fail to swear they just turn up the anger even more\nProtesters disregard of the men and women of the Capitol police trampled barricades storm of stuff to the capital and the Supreme Court climb to own stature and tried to literally shop down senators brought it in the middle of the roll call vote here and I saw\nOn the dust settles literally hundreds of arrests have been made extraordinary security measures are required to protect the ... the Supreme Court as well as the capital filing\nAnd members of his body and set it up over said threats of violence\nAnd murder after all that\nI'm afraid of the far left their own if and only one time they made it even more difficult for the vast majority of Americans\nAnd take them seriously\nI read it difficult for most Americans protecting people for one but the mother haven't stopped there are certain ones out even more drastic stuff I'd be necessary\nNow the justice Kavanaugh is on the court somewhat one publications or or to try to lay the groundwork for your guest\nLiterally packing record with more

could sell perfectly aware of is president if there are a crowd for Congress quote progressive expect them to use their full power to get Kavanaugh off the bat\nSo it's pretty obvious they all consuming out I'm off of it toward this nominee independent of all the facts at all the evidence still being stoke\nThe far left law is not letting up earlier today former secretary of State Clinton jumped this cycle as clear as to the this is secretary foot hits all soon at exactly how it is millions of Americans who hold different political views from her oh\nHere's what she said you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for\nIf we're fortunate enough to win back the house and the other side of that one civility concern to go no pays until they get their way more of these on the head tactics\nApparently this is the love rallying cry\nBut fortunately the American people know that the fat free politics oh hey fear and intimidation\nOr not how we actually govern at our Democratic Republic the Senate and the nation will not be in Canada\nThe United states Senator Chuck Grassley the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee let me begin Senator Grassley by thinking you and congratulating you on an extraordinary job well done over the past Thirteen weeks of the cabinet proceedings\nCenter you with us today I maybe I'm On speaker\nYeah I'm I'm with you on mute I'm Sorry we're OK well congratulations you're dead an amazing job\nWell thank you and I uh my part was to make sure we had a fair and throw it in a weird eleven votes to get it out and Khamenei but I think a real turning point was senator Collins speech excellent speech and now you can see how the liberals are ganging up against her\nAnd they don't have any right to do that because she's been very much a a feminist rowdy time and they raise free money at three million dollars to run against her and I think\nConservatives ought to get by saying thank you door and making sure that she uh doesn't face or the or the onslaught of this a mop that was a a up against Kavanaugh\nI think the center ... of the center right will rally to her greatly in twenty twenty if anyone has the dumb enough to run against Susan\nCollins of Maine like running against Chuck Grassley of Iowa you just don't do something center a I have Michael Yon last hour he explained to me that he and his family were talks to their private information put out on the Web did that happen to you as well\nUh it must have but not to the point that it affected him in some other senators I got some midnight calls ah that I didn't answer the phone but there was an effort to\nIntimidate me ice holds true of phone calls um\nBut when I heard one four letter word I hung out but I never answered any other\nA ... of phone calls on that particular night out I think it only happened one night to me so I was fairly lucky look at what happens to people like Rand Paul or Mrs Paul and\nAnd the lady and I don't know how many other senators are even Cruz being driven out of a restaurant and what happened to the a couple of months ago to the\nPresident's press secretary or this is mob rule it's in your face and we have senators that are saying\nGet in their face wherever in Congress women say a\nFront or confront a\nCabinet members ... if you see them in a restaurant and um and it's sort of thing that leads to more instability in our society and a if anybody thinks there's instability in Washington a Washington is kind of a reflection of the grassroots\nBut on the other hand those of us that are public servants ought to set an example of civility so we can get this a country calm down bring us together so up\nBook or saying something like get in their face or a\nA congresswoman waters saying what she said it's just a it's not the the epitome of leadership the Republican and Democrats in Washington DC ought to be emphasizing\nNow secretary of State Clinton a poll Christiana pour yesterday that the civility is only possible after the election that you can't be civil the people who are trying to destroy you were you shocked by her ... her comments\nNow of course I was shocked by it and I hope that Republicans a and I assume we're Comic Con because Kavanaugh\nWas successful or we were successful getting Kevin on the courts so my rallying cry for the next twenty eight days of this election is remember Kavanaugh and I hope that we are Republicans and I hope\nPeople that want Republicans had voted for Trump or realize that if there's a Republican majority in the house of representatives not only will there be talk of the\nImpeachment of Kavanaugh or the president but even if there is talk of impeachment effectively the program of the president's going to come to all all they all have a two year a Trump presidency the last two years we'll be status quo\nAnd let's see Israel acted or that the end of it so if you like the victory of twenty sixteen or get behind Trump and vote for Republican congressman capable Republican majority in Congress otherwise Trump is done\nNow a Senator Grassley I always ask you about pending nominees there are ten appeals court nominees before you three are out of committee will all ten of those nominees get a vote before the end of the year\nWell there's more than town there's forty one on the counter right now and I think there's Tana there's cannon our committee and I think I'll hopefully Thursday I get the town out of our committee above ... ah McConnell fought to keep the Senate and session\nUntil we get all forty one of those judges dot org I'm an add on to it at ten more to it\nThat's what I'm Talking about the appeals court nominees and I'm Wondering about the cabinet a vacancy on the DC circuit is their time for a nominee to come out of the White House and be confirmed by the end of the year for the DC circuit nomination a vacancy created by Brett Kavanaugh's promotion\nIf we received it right now the answer is yes but just before Christmas so it kind of depends on how how long will be in ... and by the way I'm not a denigrating your efforts to get ten a circuit court judges approve because I'm In favor of them as well and we're ... we're\nPushing them for instance we have to ... Ohio ...\nCircuit court judges on the counter for today's hearing as wide as another example\nWhat's always pointing to take care of Ohio center I'm from Ohio so I I'm all in favor that let me go back and ask you about a an interesting thing Lindsey Graham said if I become chairman and I immediately looked eBird Chuck Grassley where Chuck Grassley going in is there another committee that interest you more than judiciary\nA well don't forget the first four years I was chairman of the Finance Committee there's two more years of service German the Finance Committee but I Will be making a decision on that and my decision if I were to go someplace else would affect Lindsey Graham ah but I'm not going to make that decision until November the seven\nAll right now can you tell me if you think I'm a member of the D.C bar I'm also remember the California bar a I'm not actively practicing law now but they might easy barges do you believe the district of Columbia Bar ought to investigate Dr Ford lawyers because she said she was not aware of your committees repeated offers to come to her in California\nWell it's a it surely is representing her client right and and I'll leave it up to the bar association discipline action\nThat they ought to take I won't involve myself in that but we do have some members of my community that are raising a lot of questions that went on and it went on and regard the shenanigans\nOf Democrats here within the last ... months particularly the Ford ladder being exposed [noise] uh and uh and uh some of my Republican colleagues think that we ought to do some investigating along that line that\nIs within my prerogative I have not made a decision to do that yet but I'm going to consult with my colleagues on the committee and make it the a collegial determination on that\nNow you do have jurisdiction your committee over\nThe FBI and the department of justice I'm curious if you weren't interested in using the jurisdiction to investigate the disappearance of Mr ... in Turkey because I think the FBI could be of help if Saudi Arabia invited are I talked to the vice president about this invited are people that come to their embassy what what is your reaction to\nWhat appears to be a state sponsored execution of a dissident journalist\nWell it would it would be true of whether uh the terrorists were ah ah killing somebody or a state doing it it's still a as far as I'm concerned\nSomething that violates a not only a human rights but uh international treaties and we and icy journalists as protections for not only for people but at least in our country there the policemen of our democratic system if they're unbiased\nAnd so do you think there's a role for Congress in pressuring the Saudis to come clean with what has happened here\nI think they ought to us because we're so protective of them and so supportive of them and particularly against a\nIran's ah and we're very much in battle with Iran through sanctions and are pulling out of the uh you know nuclear agreement and that's very much and Saudis interest they ought to do it just because of our close working relationship\nAlright last question senator I always ask you this because it it's interesting to me is the History Channel by myself you and I are probably the most consumer the History Channel out there is it getting any better\nOh no it's worse now it's a it's not the X. man it's a mountain man and then pretty soon they're going back to the the swamp in uh in Florida\nSo what do you want him to do what do you think they should be doing\nI Want him day either change her name or have real history\nI'm with you know [laughter] I'm\nWay by doing ... can I can I point you to my Twitter yeah I've got a once a week I have the real History Channel has a real

only to have some ... run off and murder him for zealots in fact doing the same thing to ... what do you know at this hour about the disappearance of this individual\nWell what what I can tell you is that it is a it is as the president said yesterday on the south lawn of the White House and as I also reflected it is a a ... it's a great concern for the United states of America\nI'm with the uh\nThe uh the the suggestion that uh uh that uh this journalist Mr could show he um\nUm was um you know was was was murdered as it should be deeply troubling to everyone that shares is a a free and open press around the world and um as I as I said yesterday or the free world deserves answers\nOr violence against journalists I'm a should be condemned uh uh but at this point uh we don't know what happened\nUh will will continue to call for answers and uh I Will continue to express the the genuine or a concern of the American people are for the the Saudi Arabian journalist your mall a show the who has disappeared\nLast question the follow up here the Saudis were to request are FBI dispatched technicians to the consulate would they do so\n[noise] I I think the United states of America stands
