of a spouse or can be taken care of your children when you're gone so life insurance can be very versatile\nIt can be used for to produce income for you now you have to watch out you have to structure it properly\nOr it can be used to provide a tax free benefit to somebody when you die that's exactly right it's a tax free death benefit now you may have to pay estate taxes on it so in Pennsylvania\nFour and a half percent if you're direct child or direct descendent\nAnd it can be higher if it's a brother or being a non related person\nAnd so you get to get this death benefit of a life insurance tax rate but she got to watch out for a little bit of a state taxes but it's a big deal when you think about one person passing away maybe your pension doesn't pay the full amount to your spouse when you pass away maybe they only get half of that\nAnd you have to Social Security is in a household\nOne Social Security goes away when somebody passes away the lower of the to Social Security goes away so that means in order to pay for that the remaining spouse may have to draw from a taxable account so that makes their taxes go up\nI remember my husband coming home one day and he

not talking about legacy planning or protection for your spouse or they're not talking about tax planning and putting that year by year strategy in place for you\nMake sure you get your money's worth it's a very frequent that people pay the same amount of money to me and sometimes even less that they're paying to their investment adviser and with the previous guy they weren't getting overall planning no tax plan no long term care plan to\nMake sure you get the most for your money make sure you get all of the planning that you deserve for you and your family so that she can protect

time said you know what I'm going to call you the guy\nGot guy 'cause you always talk about the got they got they got they got what about the got what about the guy because so much of our health systemically emanates to from the guy so let me just back that up by an article done in the journal of microbiology\nTwo thousand and eight February sixteenth\nAnd it was ... um actually it was a volume sixteen was published on e pub and a number of other journals it's on the national library of a institutional health and here's what I talk about these researchers there's just a researcher Dr

understanding themselves but I Want to start with a little different angle\nMany people Dr coordinate have problems with their joins and your practice what these stem cells focuses on the job on the joints where that'd be a knee hip or shoulder\nI Would like you to if you would explain what a joint is made of Howard joy becomes disease and then we'll talk about the stem cells and how the stem cells can can repair the damage joined\nWho you know certainly a stem cells\nHave been in the treatment arenas since around two thousand and five and the joint has been the target for the benefit of this\nAlmost exclusively for a long time now\nSo these three large joins you mentioned mean hip and shoulder and by the way those are the order that people presented me the number one request to me is to deal with a chronic degenerative condition of knees second hip and the third shoulder um\nAnd each of the joy I like usually disgusted me because people can sort of been vision that the joint in their own mind you know the\nLarge bone up on top called the femur rests upon a platform of a rather large but also in the bottom of the leg called it to be a and there's a capsule that surrounds\nThe union or the articulation between the\nTwo bones so inside of that capsule there are five tissues\nThey are the bones themselves a membrane that surrounds those bones called the ... there are there's cartilage in between the bones and then there are ligaments in tendons that help strap this thing together and allow you to bring movement in the equation\nI mentioned that five things with the name but the same five things exist of hip and the same five things exist in the shoulder every joined a matter of fact\nIf it's a finger joint or go say five or six so I use the knee joy because they say be because I think people can envision it in their mind but there's a capsule surrounding that joint\nThat if we can penetrate the capital and we easily Kim and deposit stem cells with in the capsule or those stem cells are trapped in there they can't get out they are destined to then randomly land on\nAll five of the structures probably in equal putting them out so it's just a random thing and um 'course stem cells are black cells that upon landing declare to become whatever they land on\nSo those that land on bone will immediately determine and declare to become brand new unhealthy bone and started divided\nAnd likewise the same for the other four to issues involved and in such a way once the divisions begin and at a rate of about a once every three to six weeks they double\nA in a number and over some time not rather lengthy time either you literally are able to regenerate this is the name for this form of medicine it is called regenerative medicine you're able to regenerate a brand new joint\nDevoid of any of the path all gee that brought you to the table to begin with\nSo if it's an anti a hip or shoulder or a ... all\nThe same you can deposit in a joint on your hand if you if you needed to exactly so these degenerative diseases that cause destruction of the joint and the ball for the stem cells to repair that destruction what type of of diseases happen in these joins um\nWell the two most common diagnoses that end up presenting to my office are the ones that claim or join says we age\nOne is this famous bone on but I hear burn on bone overtime as explanation given by the orthopedic surgeon and that is a a sort of a a street way of saying\nI'm osteoarthritis\nAnd then another form of arthritis that is not related to wear and tear it's really related to him in a logical attack of the joint itself is a actually a um [noise] I'm a disease where any joint can be targeted\nBy by your immune system and this is a form of arthritis called rheumatoid these are the two largest diagnoses the nice part about the stem cells is it doesn't matter what the diagnosis maybe if it's ... if it's rheumatoid there is a disease called ... good slaughters\nThere are many different disorders of the knee and the stem cell doesn't get involved with that because the stem cells job is to regenerate new tissue one of those five types and I'm not to read regenerate the pathology\n... so even if there's an injury to a joint nice themselves would help repair that injury\nBut yes uh there's a whole group of people I actually don't see many of them but the younger\nPerson the athlete ... especially the professional athlete now\nI'm really is looking to be rescued without these rather invasive surgeries that we've all heard of over the course of just watching our own sports or sports figures have to wrestle with conditions where are their career pretty put danger well this\nInjury is up for grabs three repaired without surgical intervention in fact that surgery and if we go get back to the kind of patient that I say I don't really see the professional athlete\nThere are doctors sports doctors that work with the teams and those are a individuals ended up being treated by the sport soccer\nEven like what happened to me where I slipped in the bathroom and twisted my knee um my first thought was if I did something my knee gonna see Dr ... going to get a good time so yeah you know not\nCurrently have ... you have a commercial break coming right now and we do have a caller on the line color will be with you in a minute since we get back from our our break places in to work from my wonderful sponsors they are the reason healthy that's healthy people on the air\nOn McDonald's pharmacy a local and it kind of pharmacy offers alternative prescription medicines for certain medical conditions with the same active ingredients for less cost per dose and the name brands\nSo Jesse was bringing up a wonderful point I made or to at this time we should probably discuss what a stem cell actually is in and talk about this harvesting the the way you like it\n... well of course we all have emerged from stem cells\nAfter our conception the next three or four weeks during the embryonic phase there weren't any cell lines that were determined there was just a blob of stem cells\nUndifferentiated ... no I just know identity haven't\nDecided what they're going to be but embryo logically as time moved on appointees reached where a a group of cells say well you know where I'm going to take the neurological track and they become the neurological system of us\nAnd once the decision is made you don't go back so once you leave the blank cells that category and declare a cell line whether that be neurological genital urinary I'm a GI or a cardiovascular\nAfter the line is declared it only moves down that line from that point forward\nSo you put these blank cells and that have no identity and there's some biochemical process that changes and given that identity\n[noise] yeah the the ... there's a lot of cross stock that goes on between these cells and the different chemicals with in the soup that we call themselves solutions and they are contains cytokines growth factors a lot of cross talking goes on to be able to impart the message\nOr to the stem cell on what to become but once they decide and the decision is made on where they land right so those it landed on bone get the message that this is now going to be a bone line that it moves down\nWith an that lands on a ligament is going to become a ligament that lands on a tendon are currently liquid\nSo just basically what you're saying is if you take a single stem cell and you put on the nose that stem cell becomes than us if you put it on an ear becomes that yeah you got put on the finger becomes a thinner and is now doing that inside the joint\nGoing and that's why they were so successful with the joint because delivering the package and not allowing them to escape really is important in the eye and using at a minimum ten million stem cells in a one millimeter vile\nThat sent to me by the company of course it was harvested in the way I previously described and once you put that those ten million cells in dog joined capsule\nThey can't get out they're trapped in there and then they will do the random landing probably within a few hours at least by the end of that day the landing is over the declarations are made in the cell lineage is we're told\nThat you know it's absolutely amazing but we are amazing we are amazing and were able to rebuild ourselves if we have the right nutrients and the right right cell supply dos ... at the moment I think\nThe the the the disappointment is what took so long here we didn't need a new machine advantage by some wizard technician type and all this was biology this has been happening since the beginning of time why did it take till two thousand and five\nTo harvest the cells and administer them look I'm sure there the lab techniques have been improved but\nThe basis for why this can work and should work has withstood our evolution as a species\nOf stem cells are basically longevity it's biology it goes back to biology\nHow wonderful is that nothing sophisticated here this is life\nWe're going to have a commercial break here will be back and we're going to talk with Dr Corning kind of divide defined this harvesting of stem cells and what that means we'll get back in a few minutes unhealthy pets healthy people\nGentleman having an issue McDonald pharmacy
