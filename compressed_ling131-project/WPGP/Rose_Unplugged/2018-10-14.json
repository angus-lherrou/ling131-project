our\nI\n... it to having a map and you know exactly where you are but do you have no idea where you're supposed to be going the ultimate issues hours about where we're going about about the map of where we are although that to wake us\nToday is going to be a little more political than most are not in the sense of\nDirect politics but the subject has political direct political ...\n... I have a have a sad realization that I'd like to share with you\n\nOr better maybe I shouldn't put it is sad realization I have a question to pose\n\nAnd by my earlier statement that said realization you'll have an idea of what I think the answer is but here's my question\nDo people prefer liberty\nOr to be taken care of\n\nSo you know my you know my answer even if you have never heard before just by the fact that I said said realization you knew what I I Believe I've come to the conclusion that most people prefer to be taken care of him lose liberty\nThan have liberty\nAnd not be taken care of them have to take care of themselves now obviously out to the extreme that you you can find a doctor you can find a hospital you can find a policeman obviously there's we're talking about within certain bounds\n\nBut that is how that is how people think\nI Want to be taken care of and if I lose liberty and the process that's OK America was founded on the belief of liberty\nAnd I think most Americans assume for a while I don't know I take that back I think a lot of Americans assume that that was in a chord with the human universal human desire freedom\nBut it it it is it do you know the New York times are you ready I'm telling you this is going to shock you\nShock you in terms of its stupidity as much as in terms of its politics the New York times had an op ed piece in the last few days I did not mention it but I read it\nAnd I have to clean it up I mean there wasn't\nIt wasn't that all profane but you know kids listen to this and I'm aware of that\nThat but also put it in their very general way and somewhat opaque adults will understand it was an article about women who had lived under communism\nAnd then lived under freedom so East German women\nAnd then the wall was torn down and they mail had freedom no longer living under communism the article was a serious article you must understand this is not all lampooned this is not from the onion it was a serious article claiming\nThat women under communist Germany living in communist East Germany\nHad a more fulfilling sex life than women in a West Germany\n\nYou read that correct now the argument was they were show taken care of that the absence of the freedom to even speak did not trouble them as much as they felt rewarded by all the benefits of a communist state\nIs by the way a series of articles in the New York times about how life in less free societies can be better\n\nSo then there was another article just the let's see what today Wall Street journal what's weeds give up for free money\nI moved to sway even for a love not money\nBut I was happy to learn that merely living in this social democracy also entitled me the paid parental leave benefits who couldn't object to free money handed out by the government all Swedish parents then I became a father\n\nAnd he talks about the you know everything free health care subsidized housing paid leave on employment benefits job training pensions\nAnd you know he said this system of internal laced welfare programs is the government's attempt to realize they political and social ideal that has seemingly universal acceptance among Swedes that has noticed to get the R y doubled G. H. E. T.\n\nRight so it's it's the feel so comfortable and secure everything is taken care of\nNow\nOne of the prices you pay is that you know you pretty much have to think like everybody else you know think out of the box\nAnd you just on life becomes this is me I'm not reading from the article life becomes I've often said about Western Europe life becomes really a debate about how many hours I couldn't get off how much vacation time I couldn't have how much I can travel\nAnd it sounds awesome adjust I mean what could be better work less\nTaken care of this is utopia\n\nThat may continue six

her leg and the doctor wants to give the the girl a full\nBody seep the scan the doctor insisted that the procedure was mandatory but not for any medical reason I Wonder if a single one of you listening knows the reason the doctor ordered a full body seep the scan\nOf a two year old girl that's a lot of radiation by the way\nA a two year old girl gets a full body see the scan for a broken leg\nEverybody I Know the reason\nYou don't think there's anyone that I couldn't care less I was thinking why she's getting a full body see peace can write the doctor insisted that the procedure was mandatory get it mandatory he had no choice\nBut not for any medical reason rather the Swedish social services administration\n\nRequires such scans to look for evidence of child abuse\nWhile the doctor did note that the broken leg was the result of an accident\n\n\nHe told my brother in law the matter was out of my hands\nThat is the doctor saying that it is out of my hands I I have no say on whether your daughter got to see peace ... when the girl's parents refused to subject here to this unnecessary procedure\nThe hidden machinery of the Swedish welfare state spring into action [noise] my\nBrother in law and his wife were required to attend multiple interviews with social workers\nAnd to submit friends and neighbors in in their small town for questioning\n\nSocial workers even inspected their phone suddenly decisions as benign is why milk to buy seem potential evidence of parental proficiency my inlaws feared their two children might be taken from them\nIn Sweden the state reserves for itself ultimate responsibility for children's wellbeing\nAs appear at my job is to give my kids the to get\nThat that Swedish term for this great all enveloping security necessary to become productive tax paying members of Swedish society that is why I receive financial support a medical benefits the state is paying me to be a parent\nThis is the key here I Am in effect an employee [noise]\nWhy people are home schooled their children are looked at very often negatively but a lot of other parents the states should teach your children who the hell are you to educate your own children\n\nSo this has been a revelation in my life is the ultimate issues our because this is an ultimate issue do we do we want to preserve liberty number one or take care of people\nBy take care take being taken care of now obviously there's there's got to be an element of being taken care of we we all understand that but an element is not dominant which is dominant liberty or the other\nEven being taken care of to the point where I don't want you to have the liberty to speak because what you say\nMay offend me there's another example of liberty being downgraded on behalf of being taken care of I I don't want to hear anything that may hurt me\n\nOkay\nAh let's go to a are too doesn't agree so he gets on first pillow or doesn't agree Allentown, Pennsylvania Hi\nHi Dennis I

they're getting like that and they go in and they drink and they joined a gang\nGang culture that culture is right for law controlling than anything that parents ever and culture punishment is worse than anything parents ever did\nSo because of the question [noise] two things one is yeah we want to make like I Am\nAnd the second thing is what terms we demand is in a large part determined by our

following program it's sponsored by Conti law\n[noise] um [noise]\nThen morning Malcolm tontines lie on your health between Michele hunting [noise]\nWe just got [noise] everyday people's\nLegal issues when it comes to their state plan out or not tax issues we try to find all of our examples into perspective sell it will see every person he listens um\nToday we're going to talk about when your state plan needs updated\nEven if your plan is meant\nI always recommend that shake the mascot off that binder that your wheels and I'd a folder open that safe deposit box get it out from under your bed because with the changes in laws within the past years tell\nWhat wise effective two years ago may not be necessary now and what I mean by it may not be necessary the best example is the tax change\nSo you're you're exemption your lifetime exemption for a married couple in the past and I'm a huge round numbers wise roughly eleven million dollars so now it's downloaded twenty two million\nWhat does that mean\nMeans that for those couples who fall under the twenty two million\nAll are net worth\nFederal estate tax is not a political it doesn't get assessed or paid upon their passing now\nFor those couples who have amassed more than twenty two million dollars that's different that's a different story there will still be federal state tax but if your total assets your total net worth falls under that number\nAnd you take the ... you\nYou chose to stack your spouse's exemption upon their death if you pass away with less than twenty two million dollars and we don't have to worry about federal state tax\nNow let's be honest most of my clients most of my fellow attorneys who have similar clients it's rare to have\nA large number of clients who exceed that twenty two million dollars so for today's show we're going to ignore them and discuss\nThe rest of us who fall under the twenty two million dollar category\nWith that being said I tell\nEveryone that I can blow off the dust of that binder of the folder that you're wills enter your trust is in and let's see if it's even need it anymore\nWhat do I mean by that was strategies that had been used in the past to help families avoid paying any type attacks but primarily estate tax\nMay now have fallen by the wayside and it all comes down to because that exemption has increased keep in mind Twenty years ago that exemption was only a few hundred thousand six hundred thousand now it's twenty two million\n\nAnd again not a lot of the planners have clients who exceed that number for those clients that I Will say this this is my caviar for those clients who have a massive amount of wealth that is greater than twenty two million\nThen we can still use the same plethora of trust planning the tools to avoid taxes to\n\nCreate your legacy plan so to speak for the for the following generations but for my clients who are your everyday average person who have worked really hard for what they have\nIt doesn't matter how long I've been married to my second spouse my first one gets it this happens more often than not\nI also have people who\nAnd this just recently happened where the lady was dying of cancer and she her mom had moved in with her and so her mom was their primary beneficiary\nOn most of her towns\nAnd when I met with her I asked the question there was a life insurance policy and an IRA and I asked to those beneficiaries were and she said I don't truthfully I don't know\nI listed them years and years ago I've been working with that company for Twenty years I Believe it's my mom\nBut maybe somebody else [noise] well\nWhen she passed away we found out it was in fact somebody else and because she left that those policies actually to other people who were no longer in her life\nThey get it outright regardless of what her intention was because she didn't update the change of beneficiary forms to those forms are very important\nIn this instance the executor can ask them\nTo gift which is what it would be it's not a donation but to gift the states some of that money because there isn't any to pay for her funeral there isn't any to pay off the loans the debts that she had\nBut they have every right to say no she left it to us we're the proceeds outright and the right so those are some things to think about but it's always important\nIn my opinion that you have your contingent beneficiaries listed because you never know if you and your primary beneficiary will pass away in a common accident\nOr if they ... to see shoe and you forget and failed to update your beneficiary form\nSo it can't hurt\nEstate planning to me is keeping control\nOver your assets in the event of your capacity or upon your passing\n\nMaybe you want to make sure that your kids receive your stuff but in a certain way\n\nMaybe you don't want let's use my parents for example let's say my parents were going to leave my kids something upon their debt and I I pre deceased that well\nMaybe they don't want my husband who's their son in law to have control over that asset maybe they don't want them involved period maybe they don't like him they don't trust him he's bad with money\nMaybe they want to skip a generation\nMaybe there's a beneficiary who collects some form of governmental benefits and we need a special needs trust there are all different reasons many reasons as to why we we create a certain documents [noise]\n\nWe do focus on on trust\nThat doesn't mean we don't draft wills we may draft dress inside of wills but it's not necessarily for tax reasons maybe it's to protect that asset from the beneficiary maybe\nYour kids are going through a divorce maybe they have a gambling addiction maybe they have a an opioid addiction\nMaybe they're just quite frankly terrible with money\nSo there's many reasons why we should sit down and look at what has changed\nWhy do we revisit your state planning your seat plan and I know that I started our show off by saying maybe it's not needed anymore but here's some of the things\nI always say if a life event has occurred this is a really good reason to pick up your phone call us to revisit what's in your plan maybe somebody you named in that document is deceased\nMaybe you no longer need a guardian for your kids\nPossibly there's new people in your life who should be named in your will or your trust maybe there was a birth and adoption or death a divorce or marriage\n[noise]\nAnother thing is if there are new state laws imposed\n\nNow we do a fairly good job I'd like to think of updating aren't keeping our clients in the loop I should say of what has changed what's going to change but more importantly what if you move to a different state don't assume that the documents you have here in Pennsylvania\nWill conform to the requirements of your new state\n\nEach state has its own laws so my parents relocated from Pennsylvania to Florida and that was one of the first things that we did was make sure that what we had here will work there and vice versa and if it's not gonna work how do we update them so that they will work\n\nA lot of our clients like I said will name guardians of children\nBut what about personal representatives trustees executor whoever that fiduciary is maybe their life has changed and they can no longer act for you and your said if you're not here to act for yourself or to act for your state\n\nKids grow up I'm finding that everyday it's amazing how fast they grow and that's one of the things people tell me and told us right when we have the kids enjoy it because you know blink of an eye they're going to be this age Lincoln either and we go to high school boy for nine thirty be getting married\nWhen your kids' age and\nTheir life changes it's going to affect an impact your say plan so we need to update it based on their age what's new in their life what if your state who substantially increase or even decrease in value\n\nIf you've acquired or disposed of a significant asset that again is something to consider\n\nWhat about when you age\nWe should always evaluate at least your state plan prior to attaining the age of seven and a half especially if you have an IRA four O. one K. or any other qualified financial plan\nThat requires you to make distributions and again that ages Seventy and a half\n[noise]\nAnd the beneficiaries on those plans\n\nWe need to make sure how is your beneficiary listed is it going to them out right is it going to a trust and if it goes to a trust\nWe need to be at least you should be aware when you pass what your beneficiaries required minimum of distribution looks like\nThere's all different rules [noise]\nQuite frankly the passage of time is reason enough I have more clients who come in who say I haven't looked at my will since my kids were kids and now they're forty\n\nThat is definitely a reason we may not necessarily have to update it as much as you think but we should have the least look at it blow the dust off your documents and let's review\n\nAll of our consultations or complementary\nThey typically last an hour or so depending on your circumstances\nYou come to our office we can come to your house you can have your kids there whatever makes you more comfortable at ease to discuss what is going on in your specific case\n\nLike I said maybe your wealth has grown substantially since the last time you had your say plan done and you no longer need a well maybe we discuss\nWhat benefits a trust has for you and your family what does a trust do\nThe good news is that it's entirely possible to maintain your lifestyle or retirement by following three keys to everlasting income and that's the name of the show today\nI Know folks out there listening you'd probably get advice\nFrom a number of different sources Santa you might have a financial advisor you work with who you may or may not be happy with you may get all your financial advice from Google and you know Google's are provided some financial advice but you've got to be careful because\nYou'll get a million hits and some of them are going to really steer you wrong and there might be some good tidbits there but you know could you be getting better advice and more importantly how can you feel confident\nThat your money will outlast you the key to retirement isn't that have a fascinating portfolio if these glitz and glamour stocks and bonds if they have permanent income and that's the theme of the show today these three key everlasting income\nKnow I was just reading recently about the congressional budget office and the forecast for the U.S Treasury Department says that the U.S Treasury Department expects to run out of cash\nThey have no money to operate ten weeks from the recording of the show and you believe that there could be out of money there is a buddy better get a debit card to get one quick and obviously they'll raise the debt ceiling again and you know recreating hit the printing press but\nYou know the government doesn't have everlasting income they continue to run out and you know if you consider\nHow much income are you going to need personally in retirement to supplement your Social Security or any other sources like pensions are rental income argue certain how much income that your portfolio can provide with\nRunning out so there's probably going to be some gap between what you would like to have and what you have coming in on the fix side so your portfolio has to make up the difference where's your Saturday level there that you can do that you also need to understand the tax impact of withdrawing money from different types of accounts\nRoss IRAs and for one k.'s and and traditional just investment account and I don't know where you stand on that folks I don't know if you're in the dark on these questions\nOr if you feel like you've got some of the figure it out and you just need some fine tuning but that's why we're talking about everlasting income on the show today so you want to stay tuned in in one way to do that again workshops coming up all the time classes coming up all the time remember our website synergy group Inc dot com synergy is spelled F. Y. N.\nE. R. G. Y. the word group I. N. C. dot com check out the events that are always feel free to call us at eight hundred\nThree to one Seventy nine sixty three\nIt's time for our weekly health care because you need health you'll enjoy well\nNow one of the best ways and we all know this or to meet your goals whether their financial or fitness goal is to have some accountability and we all are aware of apps out there for our phones that will help us track our exercise or track or die or whatnot\nBut did you know that there are weight loss apps out there that can actually help make you money\nThere's an app out there called diet that where you can toss it about twenty bucks into the pot and if you set a goal and meet that goal you'll\nGet cash out of that if you don't the money goes to those folks to meet that goal is also one for the charity minded called charity back\nAgain these are apps for your smart phone where you can actually make some money as you meet your exercise and fitness goal so the charity bat again as much exercise as you set out to do if you meet those goals it'll donate money to charity our smartphones are doing more and more and certainly we want to stay fit\nYou need how you enjoy Wellstone yet to work out their eat right exercise and have a good long life\nIf you're just joining us on the today show or discussing three keys to everlasting income right get kicked off year\nAgain if you're out there listening and you're in a retirement or within ten years to save your retirement is a good show for you to listen to you know we're not the only wants to talk about this mostly shows that we err on Saturday and you'll probably find for other shows\nOn a similar type thing but there's uniqueness here folks are the as I mentioned earlier we don't say no to any financial products we crashed the plant\nBased on what you're asking that particular port of part of your portfolio to do is that income is that growth is a money that they're meant\nTo go out to the next generation once we understand what you're asking about money to do that leads us to a particular type of product that would fit that need and then we blend together as I said and we re craft a plan out there to to walk beside us through your retirement years\nIf you haven't done that you need to and the way that you can facilitate doing that is by picking up the phone and saying look a loved to have in our your time\nUh eight hundred three to one Seventy nine sixty three you call when you your information will be taken you'll talk to one of us are will determine what your appropriate steps are coming in for a conversation just answering questions but once we done that you are taking the first step to be more successful in your retirement and you were before he picked up that phone\nFolks the first key to everlasting income in retirement that we are discussing today is actually pretty simple on the surface but it's a bit more complicated once you start to dig down a little deeper and that's something that we call knowing your number how much do I need each year and retirement to live on\nRight in the U.S Census Bureau throws numbers out there uh the average income for people in retirement in that sixty five Seventy five range it's about sixty nine thousand dollars a year or some other numbers thrown out thirty two percent of retirees have pensions wow sixty three percent rely on their investments as their primary source of income\nLawyers often for ones for oh threes and Fifteen Twenty years ago that statement would have been in reverse completely way more people would have had a defined benefit pension a check from the company every month now the company says here's the money figure out how to make it income from it and that's the difference between retiring today and return ten Fifteen Years ago where we can really help\nThem right and the risk now falls on you folks out there to create your own pensions and you can't go out and try to make an income plan without first knowing how much you'll need and and it isn't just about budgeting you know it's hard to budget it's it's certainly hard to do that it's knowing I'm I'm not going to end it just needs sixty or Seventy percent of my pre retirement income\nI Need to understand what are my income source is going to be Social Security pension et cetera I Need to project\nMy future expenses what do I spend now what will go away and what will pop in World War why spend more and then find out what's called your income gap so that's where we can go and break down and we can say All right you've got six thousand dollars rejected the come in every month\nBut we need eight thousand dollars to be able to maintain our lifestyle where are we going to get that two thousand dollars what part of our portfolio is going to provide that how safe do we want that to be and then we can determine what type of investment we need to use and I'm I'm somewhat over simplifying that\nBut boy it's huge to build an income plan to

you to believe they make this whole conversation about them yeah you're advisors well you know I'm the right guy for you to work with\nFrankly our conversation today is all about you because there is no one size fits all solution when it comes to creating income in retirement\nAgain you know successful retirees they have with certainty\nThe knowledge that they can retire because they have the income they made and again we say that statement all the time that there is no retirement without income\nBut when you say that then you have to marry up the fact that you have the income that you need to be handed appointed\nA lifestyle that you're gonna live so once you put those two pieces together then you see with clarity you know why you have the ability to be happy ... predictable income Social Security check pension check your own private pension check that you built for yourself that provides the freedom of choice and retire but\nYou can build inflationary protection in there like

knows and understands the importance of diversification in retirement plan but you know as we say guys to enjoy everlasting income you need to create a diversified income plan for retirement which is

somewhere around sixty percent stock sixty percent equity forty percent bond and set up a withdrawal rate set up a four percent withdrawal rate live off that adjusted for inflation and you're probably in pretty good shape well probably the key word there and that is that being a statement in the past is the most important thing\nOkay so what you're saying then and folks I Want you to hear that if you folks are considering using the four percent rule for your retirement income planning fifty percent of you half of you will fail and run out of money\nSo what we're talking about here are teaching
