kind which existed between people who from the outset of taking each other seriously no flippant see no superiority no presumption\nSo what I look at the caravan\nIcy seven thousand fellow Cubans each one of them in ... with the same dignity that God gave me and you\nI Do not approve of what they are doing I understand the desperation but it's driven many of them there\nBut the response that we have to come up with\nHas got to recognize they're human beings and we have to pay due respect to their dignity even as we turn them away\nNo water cannons wheelchair I see all the crazy stuff out there and I think to myself no no you can't be a Christian and be indifferent to the plight of these people to the desperation that is driving them with America what we need we really do need that fence\nA strong tall double sided fence we really do need border security to deter this sort of thing from happening\nSo that we don't encourage people to risk everything and there's some bad people in this group and there's a lot of bad stuff that goes on at the border because a lot of human trafficking and a lot of drugs there's a lot of bad stuff\nAnd I could not believe the Democrats will not work to fix this is the easiest deal with the world build the fence and regular rise everyone in the United states who is in a criminal\nFifty million people get to stay but we have to send the message that the border is not an option that you choose or don't choose\nThe border is our option our sovereignty and we can't just say imagine what if this works\nWhat will the next we'll be fourteen thousand than a hundred thousand\nWhat if this works and Donald Trump knows that and his ways may not be your ways his approach is not my approach\nBut I understand his messaging and I understand within the Christian framework that there was an obligation to uphold the rule of law I also understand and pardon my voice it's falling apart\nBut the Democrats have lost their minds and that's carried over into people screaming at Mitch McConnell in a restaurant it's carried over to people screaming at Ted Cruz it's carried over to the violence at the softball field that we have to pull back\nAnd I think this is going to be a very great wakeup call do not vote for one Democrat do not reward what was done to Brett Kavanaugh not reward the crazy people assaulting McConnell and cruise and yes the AFC below sea\nDo not do that you knew the pointed out yesterday in her column in the wall Street Journal\nDonald Trump is being assisted by the fact the media it's him so

are these people think their goal is because a ... right now there are so many people who are allowing their political passions to swallow up everything else in their lives that they're thinking it's normal to just scream of people at a restaurant throw their food on the table there's not a question about whether or not your First Amendment rights allow you to protest they certainly do\nBut

is if the Republicans back in my right\nOr you know I I I think they've gotten a boost in the last month and it's given them the opportunity to pick up a few Senate seats or expand our dirty which to be awfully important in the long term it could actually give the Senate as a sort of a bulwark against possible democratic gains elsewhere\nIn the house you know I think you were Democrats has gotten a lower but I still think the pathway to it on the ... had to pick it up as twenty four seats are majority I think that's still it as realistic as it was a few weeks ago so\nI think the house that we're looking at a narrow majority for the Democrats most likely MSN and I said why don't you pick up for the Republican with all said\nNo I think I'm more optimistic in the Senate because of trends but uh the house I Can't call anymore I used to say it was going to go democratic but the combination and I I Will let out the cabinet I bumped combined with the assault on Ted Cruz and Mitch McConnell and the upkeep Locy combined with this caravan\nOf all sort of solidified the issue set\nIn a very ... and be unemployment numbers and the earnings reports they've all just sort of come in for the Republicans at the end here uh Josh and I'd have voters notice\nSo here but big now get somebody to NBC Wall Street Journal poll that we all look at very closely at Democrats had a pretty good favorability rating the party images pretty solid a month ago it's now at negative nine\nWhich is even lower than the Republican Party image which is pretty remarkable I think you're right that that that attributable to the cabins their their their their tactics Kavanaugh at some of the more radical elements party out of showing the face of the last month\nI also think that it's pretty remarkable that Republicans have advantages which party is better equipped to handle the economy at the largest advantage for any already in the history of the NBC Wall Street Journal poll so that'll be the economy is really the driving force in this election\nBut it definitely is given tropic bruised and it's definitely give her a little bit of wind a little bit of um at a Republican\nAnd let me ask you Peggy Noonan wrote this weekend that one of the great advantages of the Republicans have is the media is so obviously hating on Donald Trump and that there's a recording in the public at large when they see a twenty four seven media against one party agree or disagree [noise]\nYou know I I think that showed itself in like having hearings like you know when the when the media was bringing up questions about whether he was drunk and college and had a we're kind of\nVery late shifts and I think that I I totally I was actually just in California reporting on some of the rational races Southern California\nAnd that was all I mean I was surprised to hear from some sort of independent minded voters have have some evidence on how the Democrats and even the press coverage of the cabinet out here but look I think I think people are so polarized you that you know eat it you know they don't trust that anything that here uh they really have gotten\nTo their battles stations that just got to listen to the partisan rhetoric out there so I don't think a whole ... there's a whole lot of truck a for the Democratic side towards President Trump they don't believe anything he says I think a lot of Republicans on trust what they read in the\nLast question my friend Mimi Walters is a very influential in rising star in a very effective congresswoman or I Can't vote for any more because I had moved to Virginia I Would vote for or otherwise is she going to pull it out it would be it would be stupid not to send Mimi Walters back to Congress she so influential\nSo I interviewed coverage for a while I was actually out there that I wrote a piece that covered that that race I mean it's a it's a tough one for\nRepublicans as one of the burden for the district illicit suburban district it's always been a Republican but there are a lot of anti a lot of anti Trump Republicans out there are the best hope that Republicans have is a Democrat is already any order a law professor who was posed with Elizabeth Warren she's too little lap where most people are in that district\nThat's that's the one hope that Republicans up I was trying to interview in order to democratic she didn't want to answer any questions about policy and you know Republicans that they're going to win that district they really end up in our data where she stands on issues like health care issues that but\nShe says to the left where a lot of voters about the\nImmediate works hard I don't know if you cut back but she worked charter their job I mean she goes out and she does every ... out there to do see that\nWell she she's she gave an interview she talked\nTo me either Democrat didn't want to talk of the ... so I you know that that I can only go by\nWhat I heard and she certainly auditor constituent services that that was a little bit of frustration of some voters that you have all\nOf offers so that that was a concern that came up but uh you know it's like what's going to be a close race was a real bellwether I mean this is a very Republican district and every Democrat could win in orange county like let's see like this that will be a good signal better chance\nWay I felt like\nWe've got a crucial midterm election coming up November ...

and the psyche of the country if you will\nI don't like the pet myself on the back but I feel pretty good about the way I hear Americans\nI think it has a big part to do with why always write about Donald Trump I heard Americans before this one is sixteen election I realized Americans wanted a dramatic change wanted somebody who would fight wanted somebody wouldn't\nRoll over wanted somebody who would fulfill campaign promises for a change don't promise to move\nThe or the embassy in Israel to Jerusalem as an example just do it many other presidents promised to move the embassy to Jerusalem over this one did it and so it goes on and on and on and on we're seeing a resurgence\nAnd a a faith I I've never been more I'm\nOptimistic than I Am today\nNBC Wall Street Journal released a poll forty seven percent of all of a of a Americans American voters approve of the job President Trump is doing\nThis is his highest approval rating yet but there's you may hear forty seven percent you'd say well it's not about fifty this was the NBC Wall Street Journal poll\nYou don't want to rock Obama's was at this exact time\nAfter the exact moment at this exact stage of his presidency were rock the chosen one Obama\nRock Obama who wouldn't get negative media coverage if you held a gun to the reporters heads Barack\nObama who was lifted up and shake divide and the new engine by the mainstream media every influence ... rock Obama who could do no wrong he was cool remember he was he\nKnew what he was doing great president\nYou know here's approval rating was at this stage of his presidency exact same time try forty five percent yes Donald Trump has a higher approval rating\nNow the spider despite everything that is throated him despite the entire universe it feels trying to stop him when it comes to the people who matter voters\nThe citizens\nDonald Trump is more popular than bronco Bob now let that sink in I'm not reading is incidentally from National Review or town hall I'm reading this from the hill\nHardly a friendly\nSupportive media entity when it comes to Trump world\nHeadline Trump approval jumps ahead of Obama's mid germ approval rating again let it sink in Donald Trump is more popular than Obama and we know the different ways these two men were treated\nNot only by the media not only by their by members of the opposing party how 'bout members or their own party did you ever hear a Democrat trash Brock Obama\nI don't like calling these never Trump or his out by name because I don't like giving them the attention quite frankly because sometimes I think they just want attention maybe they just want to be relevant Max Boot\nIs a vicious never Trump\nRepublican operative pundit\nAlleged conservative once you would want you to hear what a what a show
