that the Senate event that the people must rule eventually\nTo which the left his critics like this fellow from GQ would respond but the Senate prevents the majority of from rolling so I'd like to expand on on how in fact the majority will work its will as it did in the thirties it just take some time\nThat's right well so you know obviously if there's if there's a public opinion\nSo so\nMadison money there to supply places in the federalist where Madison's a describes what will be achieved by the constitution and then the fifty first federalist forty ninth I Can't remember now sorry he says I'm\nA a\nIt is the reason alone of the people that should be placed in control of the government their passions should be controlled by it now how do you achieve that well you spread authority across the country that's what the Senate does\nBut then the second thing is even bigger than that and this thing just the whole structure of the constitution if you were the argument to get rid of the Senate is an argument to get rid of the whole constitution because the house has represented from districts\nEvery two years and the Senate is elected for\nSix years from states and the president is elected nationally every four years\nAnd then a lot of the power is is lodged in the state and they have lots of different systems right and that means to get a big dramatic thing done you have to ... you have to ask the people their opinion over a series of elections\nAnd it was an interesting you just gave the game away though um it's an attack on the constitution right it's not really an attack on the Senate it's an attack on the constitutionality there\nThe whole thing and and the to the end of what that's what we really got to get to wire people attacking the Senate in order to attack the constitution what is the motive Larry on what is their objective\nWhile the ... the attack on the competition started\nWith the rise what was you know they've been several there was one on slavery became a big deal people decided they loved it under the influence by the way of a bunch of ... ideas of the evolution foreign to the founding of America\nThey they then they were attacking constitution\nOr supporting it you know abolitionists would attack the cops it as it protects slavery a\nSoutherners wanted more Confederate white more slavery would attack it because it doesn't give us enough protection for our slaves in the territories right so these things are not new but the current one starts in the Eighteen eighties nineties\nWoodrow Wilson is a big author and what he says if this regime of checks and balance\nIt's a it's a like Newton like his picture of the universe\nBut now we have Darwin and we know the government is living organism and has to change right so the progressive movement is very impatient with this because the fact that people should understand is right\nThe effect of the constitution is to make public opinion\nPowerful in a sustained way in the end even today with the government has its limits on more than half of the economy\nRight even today it does matter so very much what the people think and to sustain that and get that that is what the constitution does but their idea that progressive Joe Wilson for example what he thinks is experts people who know\nPeople who can apply science public policy should become much more influential in the government and that is what gives rise to this fourth branch of government which now makes most of our laws in forces them and and educate them in their independent that hundred and fifty or so independent agencies\nThat that's where all that came from and it is by the way a change in the nature of sovereignty\nBecause sovereignty came in the in the American revolution according to the nature of the individual then you're born a person you're not born horse or a dog and so you have to be by your nature\nGovern only with your consent the new way is\nWe have power over nature now and if we use science and knowledge we can perfect to society\nAnd people who have that science and that knowledge they become a new kind of sovereign and so of course the constitution must be swept away because it's specific achievement\nIs that it keeps the people in control of the government for a long time\nAnd that is the whole game in every attack on the Senate and that is why today's Hillsdale dialogue needs to travel far and wide before these elections and hopefully we'll even got some no nothing's of constitutional intent and freedom to pay attention to a doctor\nWe're not going

with the legal immigration is president of the United states this is what he was\nElected to do is deal with a problem like that and\nFrankly I look at the optics of it and I look at the politics of it\nAnd I I I Want to get pick your brain but from where I should the timing of this is perfect\nPeople have been saying well you know the timing is politically motivated this caravan it's all the Democrats are are are responsible for this or that are generated up it's all kinds of wild reports cash\nBeing handed out there's a video of cash being headed out to the migrants they don't know all the details between behind the money but it could be I don't know narco money whatever I don't know what's behind it I don't know if that's even accurate the video you got to be careful of stuff you see on the Internet\nBut we do know that thousands of migrants are marching towards the U.S Mexico border with the intent of crossing the southern border into the United states and President Trump has made it very clear\nThis will not stand we're all sorry for people who feel oppressed in other countries that does not mean we can afford to have thousands of people poor across our border and enter our country\nIllegally this is the ultimate wind you to President Trump's desire to build a wall as secure our borders and frankly Democrats think this is great politically the optics of this are wonderful\nYeah I Do too I Do to\nAmericans elected Donald Trump largely because of the illegal immigration problem the last thing the Democrats need right now for those who are undecided those in the
