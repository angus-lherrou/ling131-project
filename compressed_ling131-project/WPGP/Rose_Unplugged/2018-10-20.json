{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WPGP", "content": "Going to make a decision on whether to buy or at least a car and I said you know what you have Seventy thousand dollars in the bank for this and you also have a home equity line of credit available you can use either one\nAnd we talked about it there was some reasons that they might use one and some other reasons to use the other this allows you to have the flexibility of taking that money out to do what you want to do with out cashing something in the market when it might be at a low like just recently\nBats when we're talking cash reserve how much do you suggest your clients keeping that\nWell it can really vary depending on the person but my general rule of thumb is to keep enough to cover one or maybe even two years of retirement income and here's what I mean by that is half of your retirement income is covered by Social Security\nAnd half of it is covered by drawing money from your savings make sure that the other half is not in something that's going to go up and down in the market and make sure that you have at least one year to maybe two years worth of that just sitting there and your savings account\nI Can't tell you how many times people have come to me and said man I really need to pay for this big expense or take an opportunity that they've been planning on like a big trip\nBut it's going to cost me so much because either it's in the market and I have to cashiers that are down\nOr because they have to take it out of a taxable retirement account that just grosses up the amount of money that you need these strategies are suitable for people that have over two hundred thousand dollars to invest\nIf you want to make sure that you have enough money in cash reserve and you're just not sure how to manage that\nAnd how old is set that up in conjunction with your tax plan your Social Security plan and even\nYour Medicare plan make sure you call me will sit down and talk and there is no charge for this consultation\nMy number is eight hundred seven to five to nine eight eight so if you have at least two hundred thousand dollars save for retirement outside of the valley of your home give me a call at eight hundred Seventy five to nine eight eight\nAnd that has a terrific website you can learn more about her events her team and what she can do for you by visiting that the Andrews dot insult that's that's the answer is that I and ... oh All right that we have time to get to your final item and you've brought this list with you today\nI Want you to share with us the most important asset for retirement I feel like we need a drum moral what is it\n[laughter] drum roll [laughter] it's so simple it's really advice I was sitting down with my clients jak and Ruth and Jackson engineer and so he's you know kind of skeptical and he was a do it yourself or\nAnd I said jak you know where are you getting your advice on how where are you getting your advice I wanted to take Social Security and where are you getting your advice on wars the best place to take your retirement income from so that you don't hurt yourself\nHe said well you know I Am kind of do it yourself or but I got a guy I got a guy that's managing a portion of my portfolio he's not giving me any advice and Ruth just kind of roll their eyes he said yeah we don't get anything from he charges assistant managers portfolios so I looked at the cost that they were paying\nAnd they were paying the same amount of money that they would pay me\nBut they weren't getting that Social Security advice they weren't getting that advice on how to take their investments out and they were not getting advice\nOn whether they could run out of money or not they did not have that GPS the networks for retirement GPS tells them they went through the whole process with me at no cost\nIt tells them what they should do to make sure that they don't run out of money when Jackson Ruth First came to me they're probability of running out of money was actually pretty high they want to spend a good amount of money and they had just enough to cover that that if they made any mistakes they would run out\nMy GPS in my car tells me where I Am right now it measured their costs measured their risk and it tells me step by step\nHow to get where I Want to be the networks retirement GPS laid out the plan for Jack and rude and as an engineer jak really liked it he was laughing he told me the other day he said Beth I'm an engineer\nBut your money and [laughter]\nI said thanks jak what about those robo advisers we're talking about advice bath but I'm hearing a lot about robo advisers why not just let one of the robots do all the work well\nLet's look at the good and bad of robo advisers the good is that they're really really cheap [laughter] so what I buy my wardrobe\nFor work you know I'm probably not going to buy the cheap cheap clothes I'm probably going to buy the ones that make me look professional and give me confidence to do a good job\nSo those robo advisers they're not going to call you up when the market takes a crash like it did just recently they're not going to hold your hand through that and they're not going to protect your spouse when you pass away\nThey're not going to be a trusted ally or a guide you know they're just going to it's a computer program that react automatically to things that go on and the market you know sometimes with those robo advisers you can enter certain events in like I'm going to buy a car the next two years\nBut they're not going to factor in the things that are really important to you when I was talking with Shaq and Ruth I had originally met them in one of my seminars\nAnd I asked them what was important\nTo them about retirement and they said our health they set our face\nAnd said our family is at our lifestyle and they like to travel that's my favorite too I Love to travel and I looked at them and I said you know nobody in his room mentioned anything about oh the favorite thing that I had a retirement\nIs that mutual fund or that annuity contract you recommended\nThe favorite thing about retirement is what it does for me the favorite thing is the trip I got to take with my grandchildren to Disney World the favorite thing is that I was able to volunteer for my church and the favorite thing is that I'm able to spend time with my grandchildren\nNobody ever says oh my favorite thing is that mutual fund\nIf you're not getting investment planning along with all the other areas that the American college says are part of your retirement plan make sure you to come and talk with me\nThe other areas that are important is that you have a plan for income and you have an overall plan for taxes you have health planning and if you want to you have plans to leave a legacy you don't just have an idea that you want to leave money to your family you have a salad financial plan in place\nOr you like Jack and Ruth you've got retirement savings but you don't have all the steps\nLaid out to make sure that you use your assets in the most efficient way so you have a better chance are leaving for your family\nIf you're like Jack in ... and you don't have that step by step plan\nThat changes with you when the last changed like the security law or the required distribution law [noise]\nMake sure you give us a call\nOur strategy or suitable for people that

been so looking forward to this and in our show is about education so that people can take charge of their own health and wellness and I think that you're an example of that philosophy and so I Would look for it I interviewed several years ago on a Sunday bridges sunny spot\nAnd it was such a fascinating show and now that I have my own show I was excited about the opportunity to have you on\nWell thank you so much for having the iron always a pleasure to be able to share this information with various posted in various parts of the country at all to get people educated on what the vaccine industry is really all about ...\nAnd that's key and so I you know I have some prepared questions for you Dr tend to any but I'm actually going to I Know we're getting a lot of calls and I'm going to let those calls direct your conversation\nBut I'm just going to start you off and tell us you know I Know what a vaccine is and I think our audience kind of understands what a vaccine is but I think there's confusion between the term vaccine in immunization and maybe you can just start there\nWell sure it we've we've done a really good job of kind of eliminating that word immunize are in it to immunize their children are they in the night because when I started investigating problems associated with that ... Eighteen years ago it became really clear to me that it was a big difference\nBetween vaccinate immunized vaccinate is the act of injecting toxic foreign matter into the human body in an attempt to develop an antibody which we do it's going to keep us from getting sick\nThat put vaccination is immunized means to protect me if it will keep you from getting sick it will prevent an illness\nAnd vaccinating an Indian I think are not sending in because the act of vaccinating are developing an antibody that's not in in ... not a way to immunity protection from infection\nYet that's what we perceive as as people that were vaccinated were immunized\nWell that's because we\n... the word amusing with vaccinate and actually that started back in the Nineteen seventies I actually started back before that\nIt started in the Nineteen thirties which was the first time that the term herd immunity began to show up in some of the medical literature that was in Nineteen thirty six\nAnd then through the Nineteen fifties when we had the polio vaccine that were developed and we started seeing that that smallpox is going away and polio was going away and we presumed it was because of the vaccine in\nThe public health department at that time it came up with this ... the concept of the eradication ism which meant that if we could eradicate viruses and bacteria from the planet then perhaps we would have healthier people\nThen in Nineteen Seventy one they started publishing papers where they started equating vaccinated letters that you were immune\nAnd unvaccinated meant that you were susceptible to illness\nAnd so those words got real blurred together because where it's happening in words have power and they started to become blended together back in the Nineteen seventies\nUntil today when we hear the word vaccinate are vaccinated or get your vaccine we automatically assume that we will be a new or protected from becoming sick and that's just simply not the case\nSo when I was a Case Western reserve I was required by Ohio State law to be vaccinated against me and I'm I have to tell you that we I went to the series of three vaccinations\nEach time I was vaccinated although at the time I didn't equate the two I was deathly ill for weeks after each vaccination you know I just thought it was the smell to hide from dissecting cadavers you know I urge or the stress of being in medical school\nBut now that I realized I understand what's going on vaccinations I ... I can equate those to what's happening so after the end of the three vaccinations are required to take the blood tests is to test for my tighter which I didn't show\nI was given a forest vaccination and then return for my tighter and I did not have a tighter fan of bodies for hepatitis B so that's basically what you're saying here is ... you get vaccinated doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to you may have it the antibodies but doesn't necessarily mean now have the immunity\nWell that's just that leads into a whole discussion about the concept of antibody because that ... you know one of these days doctor at I'm going to write a book\nCalled all over the mix we've been told and one of the major miss that we've been told in in when it comes to vaccination is that\nWe inject foreign matter\nAnd we develop an antibody that antibody has been given a name called protective antibody\nAnd we presume that the presence of that if somebody is going to protect us and keep us from getting sick there by calling us\nThe news but the truth of the matter is is that there are when you look back at outbreaks that we've had across the country that go back to even even twenty or Thirty years had large outbreaks that protest is and there's been outbreaks of chicken pox and measles\nI'm In influenza in fully vaccinated population and when they've done blood tests they have found that those populations have\nAt a level of antibody that is higher than\nWhat the health department and the CDC says the antibody level needs to be in order to protect you from getting sick\nFor those persons who contracts the illness that protested measles chicken pox even ... that have high is the body level and contract did the illness anyway make a\nStop and pause and say well what does that antibody really mean if I have the antibody and I can can track the illness\nAnyways starting out at the at the ... we need to take a a\nCommercial break your number continue the conversation we come
