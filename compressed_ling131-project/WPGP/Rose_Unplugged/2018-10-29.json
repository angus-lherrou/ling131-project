Missouri is running for the United States Senate in the show me state against Claire McCaskill and the most recent polling I obscene\nHas him ahead by a very solid for points I actually believe it's further had been that Josh Hawley welcome back to the your your show my right you're farther ahead in most places in four points\nWe feel uh we feel very good about it you but we also know that we've got eight days ago and we cannot take anything for granted that it's going to be a tight race going to be tied all the way home and we've got to get out there and a while we you know the next day that\nNo I haven't heard a lot of places in Missouri from St Louis we got a big flame thrower they're across Jefferson City et cetera so tell people in Missouri specifically or they're still able to do early voting or is that closed\n[noise] well yeah but this traditional absentee voting in Missouri we don't have a we don't have early voting like other states but that's all I have a voting\nAnd a look we need folks that are planning to get out on November the ... that makes sure that you set aside time to vote talk to your friends if if they are\nI Need help getting to the polls or make sure that you know you're you take a friend with you I did the bowls and we're going to need every last vote because it's going to be tight\nNow Josh Hawley it seems to me though that the Democrats are basically folding their tent in Missouri in North Dakota to try and save by boats other car McCaskill out an awful debate performance she and her ads calling other Democrats crazy Democrats how did that play with their base\nWell you know I just do the ethical really has read the desperation phase of her campaign I mean you could see that in our debate\nLast Thursday very angry very frustrated\nBut your ears the thing you're frustrated and it's really it's not with me with the voters of the state and they see is not done with the voters of the they told her to do is not done what he promised that she would do and they're not happy about it and and that's the problem that has\nA role and Martin who is of course of men and all that but he's a friend of mine just tweeted out the Claire McCaskill not quote one of those crazy Democrats quote ad was one of the dumbest ever recorded in political history she needed a strong energized space in twenty Eighteen her appeal to white rural voters\nWith that ad ticked off black voters if she loses that ad is the reason so you can see right there uh\nJosh Hawley that she clearly is flailing\nWell I I think there's no doubt about that I mean is he is flailing at the good word\nI see is a frustrated she's desperate you and you know let's remember what we saw from the Democrats and the Kavanaugh near\nA few short weeks ago that they are willing to stay and do anything in order to regain power and I'm afraid that McCaskill who was with that mirror every step of the way that you know different and so this is really this election as a referendum\nOn what they want to do to our country on their behavior there is a disgrace that they are carried out with regards to judge Kavanaugh their entire agenda that with this election is about\nLet's talk a little bit about that the judge Kavanaugh a confirmation now justice Kevin or a successful confirmation Claire McCaskill was invisible uh she didn't she she voted against him but she was invisible because she couldn't figure out what to do what in Missouri and think about that because he's obviously\nMan well qualified and he was ... what do they think about her getting from that debate\nOh I I figure appalled by it and I have people say that the all the time they cannot believe the way that the Kavanaugh was treated they can't believe the way the Senate Democrats the coordinated campaign you're right that are McCaskill uh well she went right along with it you never raised her voice against it but she suffered she was in favor\nOf the a Democrat Sam investigations she was in favor of delaying his confirmation votes so that the circus could go on I mean she's on record all of those things that she was part and parcel\nOf the whole smear campaign and now she says it's actually said our debate oh I didn't have anything to do with that oh that's just nonsense I see what they're every step of the way and I think voters are going to remember\nNow let's talk about the tragedy of this weekend a Josh Hawley when you get to the United States Senate you're going to be in a body that's very deeply divided in a country that is profoundly broken but I think part of the problem is that we're monetize ing hate on television where we've created a little corners for people to indulge\nTheir worst visions of everyone on the other so how do we get at this moment\n[noise] well I think we've got to send a clear metrics ... violent never acceptable any form of ... that includes by the way comfort her political conflict cases like screaming at people in public places are using them out\nOf restaurant yes the grocery store I mean this all of them got yeah not a president that exactly the right on\nLife president when they are there is no way no fly at all or this kind of confrontation and violent but beyond that you I think we all that what unites us is are are greater than what I Know the true story I've been to every corner of the state as I travel the state\nInvolves your eyes only factor dot com studios and I am you know what I have\nSpecial day usually my guess on friday and the wife pretty hours a week with a wholesale dialogue with them starting the week with a health fail dialogue and Dr Larry earned because\nWe're eight days from a crucial election and we are on the other side of a terrible massacre in Pittsburgh and a range into bomber in Florida and a incendiary rhetoric across\nThe spectrum and I thought some history would be useful here Dr Larry on good morning and thank you for doing a double dip this week a good morning how are you here I'm good I I Want to begin by asking you to put\nWhat the no nothing movement in context is because last night I saw a lot of people on line saying that Donald Trump is leading the modern no nothing's which is simply not historically correct\nKnew I could turn to you for some ... or you know ... what the ... war\nWell so nineteenth century political movement or they didn't they thought that uh Jews and Catholics and and now they're they're especially focused on them and you know I don't know why they'd rather be be against Jews but Catholics\n[laughter] anyway [laughter] so that we have to have to deprive ourselves of the of our sense of humor in these days but um\nThey they ah you know let Lincoln a lot of them voted for Lincoln or Lincoln denounce them\nAnd what they thought was that uh it was a Protestant country of white country and that it would be better if it remains so\nAnd they and that you know they were spread around the country quite widely they never had a huge percentage of the vote and they were important because you know and in fact there isn't anybody quite like that important enough to to make a difference today that I Know of but they were important because politics for very narrowly drawn for\nFifteen or Twenty years divided on the slavery question but then ancillary matters that could get four or five or two or three percent of the vote could change things a lot so they were important in American politics\nAnd they were ah they were not a passing phase they'd never really gone away the idea of nativism and the CIA that white Protestant on the country\nBut neither have they ever been very powerful and I do not believe they make up much or even an infant decimal percentage of the Trump coalition I don't believe I asked Secretary Clinton this when she was on the show last year do you believe there's more than a half\nMillion white nationalist in the United states and she agreed with me that there isn't and and that we're mixing up two hundred and thirty million people I just don't believe it is that many people do one of them can do are ripping slaughter as was done Saturday in Pittsburgh\nWe ought not to overestimate because by doing so we encourage the rest of the nation of their hatred\nA trade and ah you know I and not only do I do not believe that they're very many people like that I don't believe they're very many people who believe that they're very many people like that in fact many of the people who say that there are a lot of people like that I don't believe they believe it I think it's a political tool\nYes and explain why by the way I think it's going to burn their hand for picking up this tool ah and specifically I talk this morning\nAbout uh the network to which I contribute MSNBC is running high rise to lower third the little the words at the bottom of the of the screen I Want to read to a couple of them Trump's role in stoking violence among Americans how Trump such the tone for anti Semite\nYou see they have picked up this at this white hot slander and I don't think it ensures the president I think it burns the people who employer what do you think\nWell so there's a really great Holleman Jenkins car column on the wall Street Journal I read it this morning it might have been for the last week um and he makes the point that that a\n... you know everybody except for a tiny sliver of the population or all of whom are probably watching MSNBC who knows um think that there's just way too much of this stuff right that that this politically correct talk\nOr you know Megan Kelly him I have never liked by the way\nBut she got fired and if she just left off one expression what she said was entirely on objectionable and somebody at Netflix to write and sell their chords that go after but horse how big are the hordes right and and as you say in a country of three hundred million plus how big are these hordes and the answer is not very big\nBecause most people don't think I mean if you just walk about in society and look\nYou will see the evidence of the fact that the society is organized around the principle of human equality and what human equality means of is a person treated like a person treat the same person like a person\nSo you just see in society today and it wasn't always true with black people by the way which is a blight on our history\nBut you but it is true today just look and see and then you know hey if you think it's always been a racist country go study the Eighteen fifty eight election for the Senate in in Illinois where Abraham Lincoln won the popular vote on the claim\nThat the black woman and not be are equal in all respects but in her right to eat the bread that she earned with the sweat ever owned face she is the equal every person on earth\nAnd I I Want argue audience we've added to affiliates today a documentary on who have not heard you before and therefore will take some getting used to we have to knock them in\nA news radio fourteen ten WTO being Dover, Delaware and radio news radio fourteen fifty W. I. L. M. in Wilmington, Delaware so they will not do our was one of the states that Lincoln had to worry about keeping in the union right Delaware was was a slave holding state\nHim at the time and the civil war and Lincoln had to work very hard as he said I Hope to God on my side\nBut I must have Kentucky he he needed the states and so he acted as a political person with regards to everyone in there but those sorts of politics that sort of new one is lost in cable when\nI mean it's just it's all your evil or you're not evil and by the way it's not just on the left it's on the right as well and I think it's destroying politics\nWell I I don't so that I think that's right and and you know there was a lot of extremism\nIn America in the Eighteen fifties goodness sakes you know there were plots to kill Lincoln and one of them succeeded finally but\nBut it's also true though that those debates between Lincoln and Douglas or very worth reading and then if you read them fairly in my in my argument if you read them fairly will see that the inspiring man\nOne and the man who spoke for the meaning of America One and it's just a remarkable event in human history because they would get twenty thousand people out in the sun\nSitting for four hours to watch those debates\nAnd and that that means that in America there is this you know basic way that we get along as Americans and it's the principle that everyone who demeans himself as a good citizen quote George Washington\nHas the rights of a citizen and must all and and that means that the bias is there's a bias the bias is when you encounter somebody on the street treat him like a human being\nAh the man who spoke for the meaning of America One I think that is so ... would you explain what that means\nWell the you know and so you know all political history by the way has tragedy in it or even an argument it always ends in tragedy but are are tragedy\nThey're very many remember that it's the most glorious political story at least in modern times\nAnd the tragedy is that for the first time we found that the country according to the principle that all men are created equal and buy all men they meant women too and and then we had slavery among us and been here for a long time here under British Rule\nAnd so what do we do about that and in the founding there is a consensus that that's a really bad thing something's got to be done about that eventually and then more than sixty percent of the union it was quickly abolished\nAh but then new ideas took ... and this and this is where the tragedy is in my opinion these new ideas said that nowhere evolutionary figures\nAnd we evolved to be different kinds of things by the way if you look at the thought of modern liberalism radical modern left wing liberalism you will see lots of thinking just like this\nIf I were talking about genes solved time now\nSo it's like it's like somehow your genes control your behavior which means that humans salt is not free anyway that gets going\nAnd by Eighteen twenty that's a major force in America and then what are you going to do about it right and in the in what we did about it was we fought our worst war over the question is human being a product of his heritage or is it a free soul created by God\nAnd it will come back to discuss more of that in a moment a documentary on my desk president Hillsdale College

your own state um the amazing West Point graduate Apache attack helicopter flying African American MBA from Detroit he's gaining on Debbie Stabenow\nAnd Bob how getting in New Jersey is a is gaining on the simply unacceptable as a moral issue Bob Menendez what do you read and that is sort of like a sweeping rejection of the Democratic argument that all these Republicans were surging\nIt does so first of all headwind for you know the party if if the Republicans control the house in the Senate and the presidency\nThe typical number of seats lost in such a campaign is twenty five twenty five would flip the house\nOr the in in in a according to Gallup in a in a year in which the president is unpopular and the Trump is unpopular that means he's about fifty percent\nAnd nobody gets much better than that these days right but then the average will be thirty seven percent nobody's predicting that right now now the election may well break one way or the other they often do\nBut for the last two weeks as you point out the Republicans have been strengthening and isn't that odd shouldn't there be that's I think that's one of the reasons why there's furious\nA reactions from the far left from their point of view this man was unacceptable and everybody should see it by now\nBut you know Rick Scott's very close in Florida and the news this morning is ... is on his way back down there again yeah and that means Rick Scott wants him to come so yeah I think that uh it is a dog fight this election I don't think we know how it's going to go\nAnd uh I think it matters very much which is a question you were asking because if you since any weapon can you know Paul Ryan pointed out that eighty percent of the bills they pass and they passed a lot of them were bipartisan bills\nWell ... thank God for that and it's it's the same phenomenon is the fact that most Supreme Court cases\nAre decided by overwhelming majorities most of them nine to nothing I think right\nBut but at at an all of the difficult cases and all the cases that raise questions of which what is the direction of the country we are deeply divided and the house will be used as a weapon to fight the administration if the Democrats take it\nAnd then if you want that and that's what you should vote for\nAnd I got to go back to the end clothes on this what you just said the media is deeply invested in the idea that President Trump is bad and should be rejected therefore if he isn't repudiated his party isn't repudiated in either house but certainly if it isn't repeated in both of them\nThe media will be face to face with the fact that they are not representative of the country they think they are representative Bob and they are not leading a the population in the way they think they are entitled to lead and I think that is a source that is the bottom line is that people feel toppled from their purchase of power\nYeah and that's been a problem with Trump for a long time but that's not a particular Trump problem just remember\nIt became since the Nineteen sixties and not before by the way since the birth of centralized bureaucratic administrative rule a different kind of rule from constitutional\nThe path to political prosperity\nHas to be the candidate of change and to run against the establishment in Washington and they have become increasingly unpopular with time and they've reached the peak now right and and we we don't we don't just say the Congress is unpopular\nBureaucracies unpopular and the executive branch is unpopular and the media is unpopular everything in Washington DC is unpopular\nAnd and what Trump did was he managed to Marshall that into a presidential campaign and if you look at the campaign to the Republicans his exceeded Reagan or they they all ran as enemies of the establishment although the to name Bush was the only ones who won after Reagan until Trump\nThey both made the administrators state larger and more powerful and various ways it's a very difficult trend to resist\nWe're not going to make America great again it was never that\nFor a way I felt like we got a crucial midterm election coming up November ... cents Nineteen Seventy

that occurred over the weekend\nIn Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at a synagogue or a synagogue beer and wash your Gillette dish shame Ken\nAnd recognize the type of people who don't want Republicans in control in Washington DC here's an example of despicable ugly nasty\nHorrible example of somebody who wants to Republicans too huge in next week's mid term election this was from it I shouldn't be

Americans daily with that but you know here's the irony of iron\nThe\nIn the media all wringing their hands\nSupposedly worried about the tone that could lead to mail bombings or synagogue shooting each\nChair about the tone that's code the cold is this president rolls up his sleeves\nAnd fight and they don't like it he has knocked over the years that was an apple cart and they don't like it so they're never going to miss a chance to blame Trump and his supporters for everything\nIt's wrong in this country the Washington Post literally rolling in an article recently said you can't compare Trump and Hitler because\nThere's no comparison Trump is far worse than Hitler\nThey said that I mean last can finally at the headline I when I saw it at first I thought it was a joke it was a goof it
