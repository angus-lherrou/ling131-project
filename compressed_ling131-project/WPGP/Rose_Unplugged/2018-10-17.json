with Heidi and my girls during the hurricane and and and for months thereafter spent time in virtually every community along the Gulf Coast two three four five times working with the state and local officials\nI mentioned earlier a hundred and Seventy one sheriff's have endorsed my campaign including ten Democrats one of the reasons why the overwhelming majority elected sheriffs have endorsed my campaign is because many of the sheriff I worked with hand in hand after Harvey and the Senate I helped lead the effort to pass\nThree major disaster relief bills\nWorking hand in hand with John Cornyn where we improved and expanded those disaster relief bills and the emergency tax relief that you just referenced was legislation that I author\nI offer to introduce passed into law did it jointly with John Cornyn Marco Rubio the cruise Cornyn Rubio emergency tax relief gave over five billion dollars in emergency tax relief for families impacted by Hurricane Harvey hit passed both houses of Congress\nOverwhelmingly was signed into law provided immediate relief for those impacted by Harvey\nOnly for Texas Democrats voted no on that legislation\nOne of them was congressman

Amendment loves our military vets low taxes they do is a flake\nInteresting Quakers capital F better up there is a double entendre there they're not just President Trump here's some more Ted Cruz from last night\nBut you know it's striking that the congressman O'Rourke didn't dispute his extreme record on abortion supporting late term abortions supporting taxpayer funding for abortion supporting taxpayer funding for abortion the late term even for illegal aliens\nThat is and again he's voted for that that is an extreme position fewer than nine percent of Texans agree with him\nHe also didn't

certain that they continue\nTo have more ... constitutional justices and judges they want to keep the tax cuts they want to build the wall they won't make certain that they are getting regulatory relief that we're dealing with the out of control spending\nAnd they're remembering some of the thing Phil Bredesen dead as governor and if they really didn't like things like increasing the state budget that forty or standing giving\nUp on the house and the illegal aliens valid state issued taxpayer funded driving certificates and they never getting trained the right fine and spent that money\nOn um on on the general fund and these are all things that they apply they all say he's are paying attention to the fact that when he was governor he had two different tracks for handling

a\nLight that he does things they're remembering that they know that if he\nWere to go to the U.S Senate that he would be his boss would be Chuck Schumer\nAnd that he would have friends named Dianne Feinstein a Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren Cory Booker Kamala Harris and Tennessee and would never go to the polls and vote for that is the individual that they know about the film Bredesen is they

going to be invited into the rose garden anytime soon President Trump's with you and Mitch McConnell's with you and I guess it comes down to I always have faith\nIn the average voter understanding that the control the Senate goes whoever has fifty one votes right\nThat's right and Tennessee and now that if somebody were there it is that as a Democrat and um he is trying to as you said this is a sign of desperation and he says I'll go meet with the president and are you know he puts his\nFinger in the ... walling and says yes that would have voted\nFor Kavanaugh but the truth is that if he were in charge if his friend Hilary clinton that he gave thirty\nThree thousand four hundred dollars to long they turn to the president if she will president he somebody like a justice cabinet dying

because of that\nAnd I have no desire to see the movie\nHe he's a great movie he said we had this big argument we have a ... it was a knock down drag out he's got to know what I'm Talking about and making a fool out of myself how can you not see the movie and say I'm like Mark I Know that they didn't show the scene that I remember my my dad one of my few memories of my dad\nWas she in tears in his eyes of are the shuttle room of our home or we had our both black and white TV tears in his eyes when that American flag was planted on the surface of the moon\nAnd they kept it out and mark is just on fire I we ought to play the audio of the back and forth mark and I had this morning um because there was also an explanation that was so convoluted Ryan Gosling and the filmmakers\nWhen they were asked about it they had some dopey explanation of why it wasn't part of the story it's about Neil Armstrong and the first man on the moon oh but let's not put the scene of the flag\nAnd I don't care what the reason is mark says when you're saying it's a it's a anti American global estimate done I don't know what the reasoning is\nI just know they did it they kept us see now I don't want to choose a stupid movie\nEven though I hear it's a great movie now the counters a little different last night I watched the episode without Roseanne only because I Know that Roseanne wants her fellow

words they should never have been sent out she was immediately remorseful they didn't care they fired her ABC executives have recently been quoted as saying maybe we acted too hastily\nUm it'll be interesting to see how many people watch last night if it did well in the ratings it's probably a curiosity factor but\nIf it did well in the ratings and people a lot of people watched they'll probably stick with it because it was a really good episode it it's a great on shop Laurie Metcalf and John Goodman headed up this really find ensemble of of of actors\nAnd it was very much like Roseanne without Roseanne was weird\nBut it was sort of understood that and they told the story that she died of what they first thought was a heart attack and then they found out she overdosed on
