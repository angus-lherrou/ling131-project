the history of partisanship on the Supreme Court your decision to block Merrick Garland a in something they see as far as having kicked off on a new stage in the partisanship associated with Supreme Court nominees\nBut I don't know much history you have to go back to Eighteen eighty to find the last time\nA Senate controlled by a different party from the president confirmed the Supreme Court justice to a vacancy created in the middle of a presidential election they also conveniently forgotten to Joe Biden said or Nineteen Ninety two when he was sharing with additional committed Democrats control the ... Republican in the White House if a vacancy\nOccurred they wouldn't fill it also conveniently forgot the Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid Eighteen months before the end of Bush forty three set up a Supreme Court vacancy occurred they wouldn't fill it would also either ...\nPrime minister later I don't think that's right and I think that the sex Eisenhower nominated Brennan and dandy for Congress was a Democrat controlled and also on the biting rule Joe Biden was talking in the abstract there was no nominee no nominee was blocked and he said to not have the nomination\nCome up before the election but that it couldn't come up after the election and so when Democrats\nSay when they hear you doing this as they say he's creating new rules just actually knew what he wants to do and then you've written in your book the long game when you knew that it actually hurts democracy\nYeah well that's not exactly and I thought at all what happened John here you're completely misconstrue and whatnot but what I gave you is the history of this I Know the history of this I've spent a lot of time on this throughout my career what I did was entirely consistent with what the history of the Senate it's been in that situation going back to Eighteen eighty\nWell I I think the Nineteen fifty six example and also in Nineteen sixty eight later in the election cycle when Democratic president put somebody forward the Republican leader and worked with him to get that person a hearing and get him towards the Supreme Court which is not something that you did a vote in the\nAnd there was a Democrat then it was a Democrat in the White House and the Democratic side but\nRepublican leader ... tried to have an ... that was kind of my head on your on your not listening to move the history is it exactly as I

confirmed until after I was reelected Mitch McConnell knows this cold I've interviewed him twenty times on this\nOn camera on the radio he knows it cold and the the baking the occurring in a presidential election year has never been filled when the party in the White House is different from the party holding the majority in the Senate\nIt just doesn't happen\nAnd it's not going to happen again but let me tell you right now if if the Republicans are holding the Senate and um I don't want anyone to die like Justice Scalia I Want people to retire but if somebody like like uh the the seat that\nLewis Powell the bacon to he created that that created the original ... was in Nineteen eighty seven before the election of eighty eight and ...\nThen dug Ginsburg had to resign ... withdraws

need to get real today Cleveland's your has to win that air this thing or what a year or to lose two twenty again winters and not a never mind Bob Let's get to the White House um first of all I've been asking other people I Believe Donald Trump will meet with Kim Jong un before the election have you\nAny reporting other than Mike Pompeo's tweets that are optimistic to back that up\nA no other reporting to back that up but the president certainly driving toward another meeting is dead so publicly into thin pale really still those claims of the talks ... see a president who sees that\nPotentially is one of his signature foreign policy achievement if he can broker a real kind of agreement on that long term and lasting and you see him continue into Bush before the midterm this ... not not necessarily an October surprise but something that can be powerful\nOur friend Peter Baker reporting three minutes ago that ... has agreed to allow inspectors to examine a key nuclear testing site that was supposedly blown up that's what the secretary of state told them the reporters from the times that would be a big deal or talk to me a little bit about the mood in the White House Robert after\nThis knock down drag out Fifteen around thriller ... no a confirmation that saw Brett Kavanaugh triumphed what is the mood there\nIn the mood inside of the White House when they look at the calendar got about a month ago or the midterms the president's going to hit the road\nHe didn't go to Iowa this week Erie, Pennsylvania to help out and again if Barletta they believe they have a message to sell on the tax on the repeal of aspects of the AC a on the Supreme Court justice in the overall the judiciary and the more kind of traditional hawkish direction and foreign policy that's my opinion on the public and\nAre now the question is can they sustain that message and make that the closing message rather than um a some kind of controversy here scandal a month and be a lifetime in politics to their optimistic but they also know the elections not tomorrow\nThree point seven percent unemployment recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel\nAnd the the congressional tax cut I mean all this stuff I put it in a Washington Post called today because Republicans need to make a closing argument bought this anger certainly gave them an opening and the attention of traditional Republicans uncomfortable with President Trump styled agree or disagree\nOr agree that the Republican voter now has what they want to turn out can they keep that enthusiasm up sometime to politics you know this\nIs the voter who feels like they were wrong the Democratic voter maybe this time maybe more of a motivated turnout knowing this ... knowing Republicans are getting so much done they have to turn out if they want to flip the house and not only have subpoena power but people to stop this this Republican agenda that's moving like a machine\nNow let's talk about that jury now ... is going to go after Brett Kavanaugh\nMaxine Waters is actually urged the physical pursuit of Republican she would be the chair of House Financial services now there would share judiciary I think that prospect actually may stop\nDemocratic momentum in some districts like Mimi Walters that's my home district when they used to live in California um because the people don't want\nThis Bob they want to go back to normal life I think\nThis is a challenge for leader Pelosi she's not talking in these terms she's an old school Baltimore and moved to California politician who understands that the midterms you got to reach out just like she did when she when that happened to the suburban voter\nThe voter who may have one for Obama and well went to jump in twenty sixteen below sea\nIs it making the case for impeachment or for major investigations of these things she's trying to make the message and economic fairness trade but who is the Democratic party that Nancy Pelosi what they're more careful messaging or is it Jerry ...\nTalking about investigating Kavanaugh and Maxine Waters and that's looming question if you're a voter id you define it how do you see it\nSo I've been to watch for ads that show the protesters I I Believe Republican congressional candidates are going to show the mob breaking through the the barriers of the Supreme Court and Lindsey Graham I Want to play this for you he wasn't on our network yesterday he was on Fox News with Chris Wallace kind of break\nWell is a while now and November at that makes sense I Hope everybody running for the house in these purple districts blasted will be asked a question do you support impeaching judge Kavanaugh\nBased on five allegations none of which could be cooperate and they want an outcome so badly that you would basically turned the law upside down a all I can say is that this is going to the streets at the ballot box or I'm going to have I'm never campaigned against a colleague and not lie\nThat's about to change I'm going to go throughout this country and let people and they had you know purple states a red states where Trump won know what I thought no what I think about this process\nNow that Robert Costa I Wish he would say it on sale and I got to have Lindsay on this week on our network but set\nIt on Fox that means he'll go to North Dakota and worked against Heidi Heitkamp he'll go to Missouri and work against Claire McCaskill [laughter] he'll go and work against Joe Donnelly in Indiana he will go and work a ... against ... Wisconsin that is actually kind of shocking for me is that angry\nHe is he really has become President Trump's top ally the U.S Senate yet President Trump's close with Senator Paul and a few other senators\nMcConnell is the power player who make things happen but Graham he channels the rage of President Trump about the process without the Democrat but what he does is he has a real understanding of the inside process of this data and so they're really a innocent team uh wanna at sixteen hundred one on the hill\nI Know I was um I was telling Michael shear last are I have yet to receive a call to interview for White House counsel so I guess I'm not in the running but someone's got to replace Don\nMcGahn ah and I remember from my years as an assistant counsel in the White House that job on the second for the White House is one of the most ... in the entire government people don't know how good print fielding was he was recognized last week for having put\nJustice Scalia on the court he also helped put chief justice Roberts on the court [noise]\nWhat do you think who is going to be the new White House counsel\nWell it's it's clear the Emmett flood\nWho has experience on impeachment and executive privilege is going to be a major player legally inside of this White House regardless of whether it be a formula becomes White House counsel or not he's already in he's working closely with McGahn McGahn as told friends are based in my reporting that he would like people that have to be just a gesture\nBut President Trump has yet to make an announcement President Trump says he pretty much knows we want but he hasn't said so I ... the only challenge the lottery or is a lot of people don't want to come in from the white firms because as much as the client of a lot a lot of a lifetime the with the president of the United states uh this is going to be a political war not just illegal war\n[noise] you know back in the Clinton years President Clinton divide the counsel's office history pretty well uh\nIn Reagan we had seven lawyers total over the nine counting accounts when they're ... council poll seven assistant and social capitals so a total of night it\nQuadruple under Bill Clinton in the impeachment but they're divided the opposition to the to the defense team on impeachment and then the other team which did everything else judges executive orders things like that it seems to me they need that ... team Trump is wrong with Emmett flood running the defense of the president and there is a story out that\nJohn Kelly is preparing for subpoenas by the dozens if the house Democrats get control the gambles can you confirm that\nI I I Can't get from that looks at me what Kelly is dead but I Know the White House thinking about the subpoena power the Democrats wheel and just a few weeks in by the end of the year when they take over in January they well they will have our when the house\nAnd it'd be strange if the White House wasn't preparing for this or you have to report perhaps coming out sometime after the election the Democrats to take over the house this is going to be a White House under siege you could argue yet as you have to use the Democrats but overplay their hand and Jerry ... move too far but\nThey are going to have major power to bring some of the White House officials up in the White House and have to make a decision you argue executive privilege where the lines drawn\nNow last question I Am assuming Jeff Sessions is leaving after the election Rod Rosenstein is flying with the president today an air force one to talk about his relationship\nBut on that short list has got to be judge Michael ... who was the runner up to John Roberts the chief justice of the court for circuit judge for a long time general counsel Boeing is there any other name that you've heard from the new attorney general\nAnd the only other name that I've heard is no Francesco who is the solicitor general who's seen as someone who has respect to the Senate who has the potential attorney general one day it's not a controversial figure that's the only other name\n... interesting Robert Costa always a pleasure Costa reports on Twitter America if

confirmed the network I'm joined by Josh crush hour hotline Josh on Twitter Josh we've only had two poles of Senate races that really even begin to absorb the impact of this and we saw Marsha Blackburn established an eight point lead over Phil Bredesen\nWe saw Martha McSally surge into a statistical tie with Christian cinema [noise] what else do you hear from the campaigns about what they're seeing in the aftermath of the knock down nasty attempt to take out of Brett Kavanaugh\nWell I think one of the biggest races ... came back from a last week a Claire McCaskill was an early no on on the up and a\nHighly had as a whole lot of budget your hands frequently go with your ... and he's litigated the issue on the air when ... when I went on the act so I think that the raise your capital first documented or to eat at ... at the moment so there is a really really close race to watch it looked like it was at\nThat time but now ... has the momentum\nIn the end and Fox News last week this again before that the decision it was a Thursday poll they had Donnelly at forty three Braun at forty one and Brent in its sick he must be a libertarian that cannot be good news predominantly\nMet libertarian vote usually strikes and that's usually a Republican but in a state like Indiana so again Donnelly with the late ... on on judge Kavanaugh I think that's gonna ... method that race we haven't seen\nRon use that issue yet so we have to be looking at the TV ad which which candidates are going to run out of town which ones are I don't think we've seen abroad and go and do it on Kavanaugh so I think that the rate I think not only you know a little more moderate I tried to build our part of an image back home but you're right you know and have a non issue a lot of Republicans\nNow we go to the one where I think it's over North Dakota or NBC valley news did a poll last Tuesday before high camp and now that high center Heidi Heitkamp is the sitting Democrat North Dakota senator she voted against\nA judge cabinet and Kramer got a ten point link Kevin Cramer the congressman from ... is the same as high caffeine is a statewide congressman like she's a state wide senator I think he's gonna win by double digits\nYou I I think you have a look at Heitkamp vote in terms of politics in terms of looking at the polls are what you do all before and it\nShowed her down double digits so I think she felt like she wants to go to her principal when and if it means you lose the Senate race was already trailing in Soviet um and this is a very\nVery polite and issue even in North Dakota Kramer at the very first their first that his support for for cabinet even one thing what pretty tough ah so I mean this is the race that is moving away from the Democrats I think it's got to be a leader Republican theater\nAnd I got I got to cover to more with you in Montana Matt Rosendale is a fine candidate statewide office auditor he's not an original Montana Jon Tester tester voted against Kavanaugh in a state\nThat was a twenty points Trump state I spend a lot of time in Montana that a lot I got up there and fish to a few times with my friend Jay engineer and he almost represented himself into decided no like Matt Rosendale do this put up with is not that I think he's close to a statistical tie and I do not think Jon Tester's survives it's about what do you think just rush hour for race\nFor Republicans I you know I've had some skepticism about Rosendale strength of the candidate as you mentioned you know he's not Montana\nOriginally a but protests are often just going to happen I literally Gorsuch also and and he also was the lead and the complex to remind Montana's when he's out there\nHe was one of the lead dog or against a lot of Jackson's failed domination yet so I'm you know as a little more like artist and Republicans Montana vote Republican and and as the tribal election arisen they'll have a real shot I I still think tester has a slight advantage but this isn't it a race that that's floating in the\nI don't know what I Hope the president spends a lot of time there and it's early voting gets underway this week I think finally Arizona now Martha McSally is my friend I'm very invested in having combat veterans in the Senate she is running against a hard left progressive Christian sentiment is trying to run as a moderate I mean being

President Trump won the battle Saturday with judge Kavanaugh's confirmation the last thing you can do now is\nBreathed a sigh of relief and say a good we got this major battle one we don't need to go to the polls either few weeks we can stay home that's the last thing you can do\nAnd I I it's really weird I've been thinking a lot about Roseanne Barr over the last couple of days\nBecause it says yes for the first time there was a push back\nTo the left demand that somebody had to be on a platter\nOver something good in this case wasn't corroborate first time this has happened I mean normally careers are gone lives are destroyed people's sliver away into the darkness never to be heard from again this time Brett Kavanaugh fought back\nThis time Republicans were unified on the political front we witnessed a unification within the Republican Party than we haven't seen it a couple of years or more\nAnd I was thinking about how somebody can be destroyed over something like a tweet\nAnd you know at the end of the day may be may be\nThe push back on behalf of judge Kavanaugh and the Republicans deciding no we're not going to destroy this man over this one accusation\nI Know there were a couple but the the first one was the one that was deemed credible you noticed the you hear the Republicans who read the FBI report the word credible is used for Dr Ford she seem credible is what all of them said\nIt just wasn't corroborated so you couldn't\nEver ever take him down over her testimony alone\n\nA couple of times I've seen some references to Roseanne Barr evidently that show that she created and return to is going to be back\nI don't think it's returned yet to the years that next week or this week they're going to call it the Connors and they apparently killed off Roseanne all because of her tweet about Valerie Jarrett and it was make no mistake it was a terrible sweet\nBut it was a tweet one tweet and her lifetime of work were suddenly consumed by the fire of the rage machine\nPS she's a Trump supporter\nI saw over the weekend there was a a an NBC reporter I Believe a young NBC reporter who a few years ago wrote a bunch of homophobic tweaks because we're going to happen to her no she's a liberal NBC report your Roseanne and you\nReach wheat or tweet out a racist comment about Valerie Jarrett you're done\nAnd maybe\nAfter Kavanaugh was pulled over the finish

is fifty three percent tax and I'm looking and I I don't know anybody in Florida but\nI Know some people in Florida but there's a beautiful parts of Florida Texas I don't know yet so anyway I went down to Fort Lauderdale over the weekend was checking out some things there\nSo I'm watching everything in the hotel and I'm In the car and I've got satellite radio some listening to the Fox news and\nAnd I was just I was just stunned at the way this is all playing out and I'm listening to it I'm listening and I'm watching this thing progress and I'm thinking oh my gosh she's going to get this\nAnd I was really negative\nBecause we're in a culture now the mindset is the the meat to activists many of them said accusation made accusation believe if you believe the accusation that means you have to condemn the accused\nThats the formula although I Will say and I'd like to find lamps or the audio clip from Tijuana Burke who's the founder of the me too movement from years ago so this is not this was a woman an activist who started this a long time ago it's\nJust now gotten kind of resurgence with the Harvey Weinstein stuff she set on on meet the press yesterday believes the woman doesn't mean don't have an investigation\nShe said it never meant you believe the woman you stop there and you're ruin a person's life she said believes the woman means you listen to the woman you believe that nobody is probably going to come forward and make it an accusation but you have to get an investigation you have to corroborate and I was ... I was really relieved to hear her say that\nShe after all was the woman who founded this whole me too movement\nAnd that's what happened with Brett Kavanaugh there was an investigation seventh one actually I saw senator on TV over the weekend forget which one who said yeah there have been a hundred and fifty witnesses\n\nOver the course of the investigations into Brett Kavanaugh's\nPast not one
