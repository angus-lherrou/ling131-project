honestly I I think that you know when I'm\nWhen Chris Coons says a judge Kavanaugh's who speak in a lifetime appointed the Supreme Court and I'm reading this and who are now think bears the burden of disapproving these allegations that the U.S senators you\nI'm calling these guys out because this is the bedrock of what we fall for all these years I mean the presumption of innocence is what McCarthyism challenge and you call that our this is the closest thing to McCarthyism I've seen in the last fifty years\nA last question do you think it will be confirmed by Saturday\nI Do I think we should see or the FBI report you know even the Democrats it shouldn't take three or four days so we should see that as early as tomorrow and get the procedural vote out a way and before we leave this week we were told yesterday we will get a vote on him and I believe we'll get him confirmed\nGallagher show we got a crucial midterm election coming up in November said we're not going to make America\nThree ... voice of clarity for millions of Americans say forever [laughter] plus a show now owned by the most famous man on the planet\nEven grade Mike and I appreciate it very much you notice I walked over here very quickly\nNow from the relief factor dot com studios mice yellow [noise]\nYou're ready for another day of the battles you strap them buckle up and hang it on for\nDear life what a week this has been what a week there shall be the media in complete meltdown mode over the president's comments about Dr Christine Blasey Ford last night at his rally\nThe media in complete meltdown over the New York times latest bombshell decades ago President Trump's late father\nAnd mother had some tax scheme he's not as rich as he says he is or how we\nGot him again meanwhile the FBI capital investigation might wrap up today\nWhich will of course be another reason for the Democrats who oppose Brett Kavanaugh to say well this wasn't sufficient they didn't even take a week they didn't even interview Christine Blasey Ford we're already hearing that we know what they're going to do because they are\nPredictable if nothing else\n[laughter] very very predictable there's a headline above the fold in today's USA Today that tells you everything you need to know about what's going on with Brett Kavanaugh and the way the direction we're in in the country and I loved it I Love how useful to church here's the headline and USA Today confirmation long and\nThe Kavanaugh fight\nWe article says the battle over Kavanaugh's nomination to the court is unlikely to end with this confirmation vote Democrat said very won't let go of the sexual assault allegations\nEven if he's elevated to the high court if they win control of one or both houses of Congress in November they'll be in a position to continue the fight it's almost like USA Today is unintentionally confirming\nYou better get out and vote [laughter] those it's almost like they're saying do you see Republicans will happen if you stay home on November the ... they're\nGonna they're not only are there are also going to do everything they can to roll back\nEvery single Trump policy achievement of the last nearly two years we know that it is up to us\nAll of this is up to wash November ... put it on your calendar I don't\nCare if you're if you're in the hospital have a wheel of a hospital bed into the ... the poetry pledged drags your butt end to the polls\nAnd vote on November ... for Republicans because the USA Today article is a is a very very\nPowerful reminder of what is at stake and what is at stake here so let the Democrats control the candy store we've got to keep the house we got to keep the Senate\nAnd this nation will breeze a huge sigh of relief it's up to you now let's let's take care of this\nBecause this is going to be tough because you're probably not going to like\nEntirely what I have to say and that's all right hey you know I'm a big guy I can get somewhat ... [laughter] the president as you've heard by now had a rally last night when he was all what he was again on fire\nHaving a great time or\nTall and Mississippi after about a week and a half of being tremendously subdued about Christine Blasey Ford\nBeing very careful about Dr Ford and not\nCriticizing her are attacking her mocking her\nWas there was one tweet and that kind of blew over pretty quickly\nThat has been pretty quiet about it you just kind of ...\nThe process play out he said the other day in the oval office to sound incredible and she seems like a fine woman that's what he said a few days ago well here it is cut ... this is what he said last night in Mississippi which has the media\nUm you know\nWatching their heads explode once more as it often happens when the president says something very provocative\nI had one clear [noise] right [noise]\nWell do you think it was it was one of them are good [noise] how did you get home I don't remember how did you get there and I remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't\nKnow [noise] what\nWas it and I don't know how to [noise] when I was I don't know but that's the only thing are in [noise]\n\nA man's life is in tatters a man slices shattered\nAbout uh the\nFirst to me media takeaway is that settled Trump being Donald Trump or he he goes to the judge Huler he responds viscerally he is he fights he battles\nAnd that's just him and and he that's what got him to the White House and he's going to keep doing it um until he leaves the White House hopefully in six years\nMy problem is that the base really doesn't have anything to do with this week my my concern is\nHis ... his his supporters gonna rally at a rally in Mississippi really have nothing to do with played out how this goes it is down to the to to a handful of senators your your your plane\nTo a handful of people maybe senators you can count on one hand\nAnd my fear\nIs that if one vote is lost because a senator believes that\nThe accuser has been unfairly mock or taunted or attacked\nThen it wasn't worth\nI don't know what I don't know what the upside is so I'm not going to come to work and lie to you and pretend that I'm Glad\n\nThat he said something that I Wish you hadn't said I'm not I wish you hadn't said I've also always always worried about an uncorroborated accusation\nUm\n\nNot necessarily be not true I don't know what happens thirty six years ago we never will we don't know if Brett Kavanaugh did it or not I happen to believe based on his life and his career and his record and his incredibly qualified\nResume he should be the next Supreme Court\nJustice\nI don't believe that she has enough corrupt ration to seal the deal in making the case that he's unfit I Know what the the the the filthy gained the Democrats are playing in moving the goal ... goalpost I understand completely\nHow vicious they've been\nAnd I do share his concerns all along with the current concerns of millions and millions of people about the smear campaign and how it can ruin somebody without any any substantiate substantiate ... it's a problem\nIt's a big problem and finally after a year of the the me too era\n... we're having a national conversation about what happens when somebody has falsely accused I have a story in front of me there were some dentists accused of rape and sexual assault in Las Vegas and it turns out that you use her made it up\nNow is your story is you don't hear often but they happen\nFor Dennis from California including three brothers who faced rape charges for the alleged assault of a woman to win Las Vegas had all the charges dismissed in court this week\nProsecutors dropped all the charges are one of the lawyers said after river a review of the facts it was clear that the allegations were completely fabricated sir for dentists for professionals from California three of the brothers the based ruined ...\nFrom what apparently was a completely fabricated claim this happens and when President Trump said this week I worry about today's boys I worry about paying people being falsely accused I worry about like you said I've been falsely accused\nIt could happen and I\nAbsolutely get it and I share those concerns in this case the case in this week and in this time we got to focus on the senators and get judge Kavanaugh across the finish line and again for for for where I sit\nI and I have even mild criticism I just don't want any I'm ... I'm just worried about these these these votes this week Keith that's all I'm focused like a laser job one get Kavanaugh confirmed job to get everybody to vote on November ... on November ...
