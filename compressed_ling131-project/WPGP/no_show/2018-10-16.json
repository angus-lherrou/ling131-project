with you hope you're doing well thanks so much for listening\nToday we begin week three\nOf our campaign my campaign urging you to support alliance defending freedom I Want to thank you all by the way a for putting up with this right we're taking time away from our radio show\nTo ask you\nTo give money to alliance defending freedom the organization on the frontlines in this country defending religious freedom they are in fact ATF is in fact the premier organization\nFighting on behalf of religious freedom all across the United states of America I Want to thank everybody who's given we're going to be engaged in this campaign all month\nThe entire month of October yeah we're going to take time out of our regular programming this month we only do it once or twice a year but it's important we only do it for good important causes and religious freedom is one of them\nAbs has been fighting and winning for many years uh as alliance defending freedom senior counsel Jim Campbell tells us\nA it was started by people like James Dobson and Marlin Maddox and it was really just a response is these gentlemen and others like them looked out and saw there were a lot of challenges to religious freedom and they didn't see anyone out there to defend it so they said we're going to address this problem by putting together this new organization\nAnd so for the last twenty five years we've been defending religious freedom and defending freedom of speech around the country\nThat is right around the country and around the corner\nElizabeth Warren\nReally uh we are going to now have the great one drop of Native American blood debate\nAs this entire thing is incredible at and Elizabeth Warren is trying to collect at least some of the people operating her name want her to collect the million dollars President Trump has promised if she can prove she's an Indian\nAnd how does she proves she's an Indian\nOr we will get to that it's deeply embarrassing and it really does show that there are some not many but some points of commonality between contemporary liberals and Nazis\nReally yes really will get to that on the Michael ... that show will also get to the great debate about the civil war\nAnd again a President Trump ... did not show in ... when he was telling about general grant and generally to be a particularly sophisticated historian he wasn't hired for that but\nHe absolutely did not inappropriate leap craze a Confederate general and he shouldn't be condemned for it and the press has helped him they've shown and in fact they were forced to retreat\nExactly why it is so many Americans and it's left right and center distrust mainstream media\nAnd rightly distrust mainstream media and most of all President Trump has been blessed this week at the beginning of the week\nWith the\nElderly inexplicable desire of Hillary Clinton to inject herself into this democratic campaign\nWhy\nThis is a mystery is she some kind of secret agent for the Republican Party is that possible\nI mean she blew the campaign kind of everybody knows that she blew the campaign against Donald Trump President Trump acknowledges it and and now she is doing her very level best\nTo uh to to basically um\nHelp President Trump and help Republicans in the forthcoming campaign this November OK Hillary Clinton was on CBS on Sunday Morning\nAnd it's one of those things will posted up at our website at Michael midday dot com you really have to see it to get a a full force of how uncomfortable she looks wives submit yourself to this\nI I don't understand I don't understand what is possibly to be gained here except to strengthen Republicans\nAnd why is that she's not a political newcomer she's been around the block a thousand times she was a problem for the first campaign that Bill Clinton lost and and people forget this this is part of ancient history\nBut Hillary and bill got married bill got elected to be the governor of Arkansas very young man and then when he ran\nFor reelection the first time he lost and he lost because Hillary was the issue because she hadn't changed her name yet she was still Hillary\nRodham she still had those coke bottled glasses that I remember her wearing from law school and uh she she was a much more of an quote outspoken feminist will eventually change and\nShe campaigned alongside bill but given the fact that she has this long long experience in the political world\nHow could you be so honestly unprepared for questions that are very obvious and this this comes especially after we spoke to Ken Starr who's an outstanding American and has just written a terrific book and again I recommend the book hardly to everybody\nThe um\nThe book by Ken Starr which is posted up at our website of Michael med dot com tells the story of the impeachment of Bill Clinton and it tells much more tells the whole story of Ken stars life\nBut it does not portray Hillary in a very positive way and when you read that book you can understand why she would be so utterly unprepared for questions like those she received on CBS listen\nWhat role if any did you play in criticizing the character of the women who have accused bill sexual misconduct\nNone no no no real I take responsibility for my life and my actions\nShe also stood by your side as\nHe was impeached after lying about his affair with a White House intern today has said he should have stepped down\nIn retrospect do you think [noise] bill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of\nPower now now there are people who look at\nThe incidents of the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with an intern the power imbalance as to why an adult\nBut let me ask you this where the investigation of the current incumbent against him numerous allegations had been made and which have dismisses denies and ridicules so there was an investigation and\nAs I Believe came out in the right place [noise]\nOkay I it came out in the right place for Monica did it uh it came out in the right place for those people by the way including very much Lindsey Graham\nWho was one of the leading Republicans in the house of representatives at that time a working on impeachment\nThis is so astonishing this is eight eight utterly shameful display of what about ... let let me play it for you again because he will notice immediately\nThat rather than talking about what was obviously an abuse of power involving a president of the United states and an intern and intern in his office\nIs she a\nDoesn't confirm that and she says oh well but what about Trump but you know what here's the key point and and listen to how how ... Hillary Clinton just he lives that she just moved away from it and doesn't even touch it\nPresident Clinton was accused of miss behavior the kind of behavior that would have gotten\nAny CEO fired and so quickly so quickly you can't work for any corporation I mean anywhere today you can't even work in Hollywood\nAnd be involved and doing stuff like this and and come out the other side the accusations about Trump has to do a with a period\nIn his life long before he was directly involved in politics and certainly before he was in the White House by the way or just listen one more time and I want to come back to this 'cause it's very very important\nAnd it's it's so crucial to make distinctions okay here's Hillary Clinton again being questioned about her record defending bill\nWhat role if any did you play in criticizing the character of the women who have accused bill of sexual misconduct\nNone no no no no I take responsibility right where my writing and my actions\nShe also stood by your side as he was impeached after lying about his affair with a White House intern some today had said you should have stepped down\nIn retrospect do you think bill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scan absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of\nPower now now there are people who look at\nThe incidents of the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with him in terms of power imbalance as to why an adult\nBut let me ask you that she didn't wear twenty or nation if the current incumbent against him numerous allegations have been made\nOkay stop stop stop right there I think anyone including the most devoted supporters of President Trump a would acknowledge that if it came out that he was having an affair with the White House intern if you were doing the things that Bill Clinton we now know did\nThat yes President Trump should step down but there is no evidence of that and I am virtually certain that especially given the amount of media scrutiny of President Trump\nAnd Secret Service scrutiny and an FBI school and everything else there's nothing irregular about his sexual behavior since he has been president\nAnd see the the point over here is the failure to make distinctions in other words Hillary Clinton and liberals want us to believe that what Brett Kavanaugh did as a Seventeen year old allegedly at a party\nA is a is incredibly serious in ruins him forever and what Bill did as president of the United states and when you talk about abuse of power there's also such a thing about abuse of power involving\nThe Congress and the government and federal investigators or we will get to that and much more coming up on the ...\nBob Michel ... vigil wash 'em or is it the fans have welcoming it\nThis is Michael [noise]\nBelieves that it is significant if you're able to find that if people have taken these DNA tested always turns out own you know two percent African American and I'm One percent\nAre from from uh Australia aboriginal I I don't think that turns up very often\nBut the the entire thing is not\nThe only Democrats do this\nIt's completely ridiculous why are we so obsessed with DNA this is the question here would be was was there any sense in which you grew up with a meaningful identity as an Indian and she didn't\nSo she was a fraud about it she ought to apologize and just move on I I Do find it embarrassing when the president used the term Pocahontas cause Pocahontas by the way was somebody of real Native American heritage who became a Christian she changed her name to Rebecca and she converted Christianity\nUm look a President Trump was asked about these latest revelations about a Senator Elizabeth Warren who was getting ready to run for president that's why she released this video the timing is horrible for her because it will only heard Democrats and the forthcoming elections here's what President Trump had to say\n[noise] trying\n\nRead it again I\nVery easy I also\nI Do not because of it\nGoes well I think\n\nIt is going to be a long process for the Democrats um are there are people who are saying uh well President Trump said he would pay a million dollars if a she could prove that she was an Indian\nNow and there are people saying well he has to pay or a million dollars now 'cause she proved a that she may have had and\nOne the Indian ancestor six to ten generations ago sorry here's exactly what President Trump said he said at a rally\nIf I'm debating Warren I'd make or take a DNA test and pay or a million dollars if she can prove she's an Indian\nNo she can't prove that but I'll tell you one thing you can prove is Elizabeth Warren is one of those Democrats who is threatening to bankrupt and destroy or Medicare system how we'll get to that I'm an right up on them at that show\nBob Michel message across America this is Michael ...

show I'm mentioning earlier today that things seem to be going very much in the right direction for the Republicans who are\nFighting to maintain control of the house of representatives the Senate should be fine that that also could be close but it should be fine and things from the house side are turning around\nAnd one of the reasons is stupid mistakes by people like Senator Elizabeth Warren and a former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and then mainstream media in general\nBut one of the other reasons has to do with the fact that a little bit more and is one of those people out there beating the drums for Medicare for all\nSo for those of us who actually support Medicare and I do I I Know how important it is too many many many Americans are who happened to be over the age of sixty five\nAh why isn't it that the Democrats have always claimed credit for Medicare or now posing such a grave threat to it and nobody better to talk to about that than a Daniel see Weber\nThe founder of the association of mature American citizens a Mac he founded back in the summer of two thousand seven and then first of all we're over a million members now right for a Mac\nGot Mike ... thanks to you and your show where one point four billion active members right now\nIsn't that terrific I I I Love that so talk about why it is that this very appealing slogan a Medicare for all really means Medicare for nobody\nWell exactly and it really is expanding up for Medicare which is a kind of an insurance when they're going to converted to a socialism land and here's what I'm Talking about there's twenty two million Americans have Medicare Advantage plans\nThose plans this year actually having a decrease in premium because they're operated through independent insurance companies having a decrease in premium\nHowever the Bernie Sanders Medicare for all would lemonade Medicare Advantage plans or replace it with the socialism plan is similar to what happened in Canada\nAnd the problem with that is they have rationing for example it takes twenty two week schedule a surgery and I don't think most Americans like a back behind the medical treatment\nI was blessed become the fire chief in Atlanta on the then mayor Shirley Franklin and um ten or twenty months after serving her I was appointed to the United states are construction\nOn the ministry of president Barack Obama and I was there for just under a year when I was recruited back to the city of Atlanta about the honorable America St Marie in two thousand and ten has served him faithfully for five years until I was terminated in January of two thousand and fifty\nOkay this whole story your whole story is a great American story and it's a great story of public service and success how how is it you ended up\nWhether you are say you were terminate you were fired was it wasn't because of something that happened in the line of duty what was it that led to your firing\nWell a a year prior to my termination I published a book that I had written on my own time and self publish for Chris Jimmy and the book is called who told you that you were neck and if the question that got ask Adam\nIn the garden to eat and then I say that because a lot of people don't connect that question with genesis chapter three birth eleven so\nAh so the book is titled who tells you that your neck it overcome the stronghold of condemnation\nAnd uh so that happened a year before I was suspended ah but the reason why I was terminated as as a cause I spent a few paragraphs explaining God's purpose for sex\nAnd marriage and that God created a sex for procreation and and and for the pleasure between a husband and I hardly matrimony and that any sex outside of that a is a thin and ultimately that's what cost me my childhood dream come true fairy tale career\nOK Now let's get history you have these opinions which are opinions that literally hundreds of millions of Americans share and you weren't trying to impose these opinions on some of your men and the fire department where you\nKnow are not at all\nSo it it was the fact is you self published the book you had any public funds what business is it of the city of Atlanta\nOr the mayor of the city council or anybody or what the fire chief does on his personal time as long as it's not disgraceful what was the argument we're using a passage in your book to ruin your career\nWhere their position was that those positions those views conflict it with the city views are and that I can have those views as much as I Want but when I was an employee of the city\nOr I had an obligation to check those belief that the law is what one council members fit and the mayor clearly supported that dish\nOkay at this point or this I think most people are listening to us or slapping therefore hands I think this is just clearly unjust and when people suffering injustice or discrimination\nOr a really an assault against their religious liberties and freedom of conscience who you're going to call not Ghostbusters you'd call the alliance defending freedom a David Portman attorney for the IDF\nOr what did the ATF do what did you do a about a chief

David court men tell us quickly what's happening with this law case that you've taken up on behalf of the cheap\n[noise] ... yeah so the the city argued they were trying to be inclusive believe it or not by firing the chief because they didn't agree with his youth I didn't I didn't quite understand that but we filed a lawsuit on behalf of the chief the good news is\nA is that we argue that the policy you they actually required prior permission so they told the chief afterward that oh no you can't write a book on your own time for a Bible study unless you get prior permission from the city in the city allows you to do so\nWe challenge that as being unconstitutional his only prior permission needed is the first amendment and the judge ruled with us\nI'm so that the judge ruled in favor of the cheap and now we're going to trial to figure out where the case goes for there and and how much damage as for the chief\nFor Republicans to keep control of the house of representatives of the Senate or the United states we should be able to do that\nAnd uh of the White House in the hands of conservative leadership one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy\nSix what's amazing about this is they ask\nPeople to uh to determine do you have a great deal of trust in politicians trust and confidence politicians do have a fair amount of trust and confidence in men and women in political lights\nLife or or\nDo you have a low amount of trust in politicians trust has been soaring here's the amazing part\nThe increase it's not only a ten year high it's seven points from a year ago\nAnd Thirteen points from the record low of forty two percent in September two thousand sixteen okay now what happened right after September two thousand sixteen the election of Donald Trump is president the United states\nIs it appropriate to feel more trust in politicians right now\nActually I think it is I Do\nWith all of the problems that we have in American politics and all the conflicts we have if you're one of those people\nWho trust politicians not at all or less than ever or you can give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six um\nMeanwhile I Want to get back to that question but there was a fairly remarkable interview with President Trump on sixty minutes and no it's not Fox News is not Fox and friends it's not the friendly confines\nPresidents from those it when he's going to be interviewed by Lesley Stahl who's interviewed him\nBefore and then when he was going on sixty minutes these CBS network he's not going to get easy questions fast\nBalls or pardon me slow hanging curve balls right over the plate\nHe's going to get some fairly tough questioning and he did so how does the president do or you\nCan uh help judge for yourself up for those who did not see the sixty minutes interview which was big news last night\nHere was a when I think was a fairly\nInteresting inappropriate question from Lesley Stahl with the president's answer right at the beginning\nYou are the first president to the United states who never had a political post or for worse never served in the military you come up here and you've been here for almost two years what is the biggest surprise and what have you learned since you've been president\nOkay so I always used to say the toughest people or Manhattan real estate guy shouldn't bother now I say that they be included in the political people this is the most deceptive munitions world\nIt is a vicious it's full of lies deceit and deception and make a deal with somebody and it's like making a deal with that table give me an example I don't want to give you an example I'm not looking at in the meantime nobody's been able to do what I've been able to do\nRemember that when you look at ... as you look at regulations you look at um making deals with other countries [noise] nobody's been able to do anything like this actually\nMost people didn't even try because they knew they didn't have the ability to do it but it's a very deceptive well\nOkay I Am very deceptive world um how does that correlate with the idea that trust and politicians is it a ten year high I I think it has to do with the fact that most people regardless of which side you are on\nCan feel that it it's at least\nSome of your concerns\nAre being addressed because there's so many voices in this political debate something on a romantic and even though we don't\nOfficially have divided government ... the Democrats haven't been shy in letting their points of view be known\nAnd by the way the poll from Gallup that show the trust in politicians at a ten year high that was taken before the accusations by Christine Blasey Ford and before the second round of the Kavanaugh hearings and there's no question that does\n... took a toll particularly on confidence people hadn't in Brett Kavanaugh though I still believe that uh that entire confrontation is going to work very strongly Republicans\nAs does this general sense that believe it or not with all of the deal making the viciousness that President Trump is talking about\nThere's a sense that the political system is working\nA President Trump was a then asked about ah the aspect of the political world that he is most routinely condemned and that of course would be as good friends and mainstream media\nThe other thing I really learned is I never knew how dishonest media was I I really made it I'm not saying that as a soundbite\nBy now I I never knew how to get well no but even the way you asked me a question like the ... yeah when I say Obama did it you don't want to talk of them out I when I was reading writing and\nThe answer but you did it for time I'm just telling you that you treated me much differently on the subject I don't want to have that high but the okay All right now the fight with all the time I'm president and you're not\nA okay uh\nAnd and then they change continues to a a question that I think a lot of people ask about an editor mocking was used regularly the president mocked Christine Blasey Ford well Lesley Stahl picked up on that and just took it a little bit to the side\nProfessor of philosophy forging mimicked her\nMade that speech we would not have one but I was just saying she didn't seem to know anything you know and you're trying to destroy a life of a man who has been extraordinary why did you have to make fun of her\nI didn't really make fun of the nation is the person that we're talking about\nGetting over here in the time the plays professor they forgot before the Senate and ... and was asked what the worst moment and she said when the two boys who laughed at me at my ... and then I watched him and my car and\nThousands of people were laughing at her\nThey can do what they I I Will tell you the way now justice Kevin always treated\nHas become a big factor in the ... have you seen what's going on with the ... did you have to\nWell I think she was treated with greater respect I Know they understand what do you think do you think ... I just seem to be saying that she relied on ... you know what I'm not going to get into it because we won it doesn't matter well we won\nOkay a look at the one thing that I think he was on the right track with he did not make her mimic during her as if you try to imitate her accent or tone of voice he didn't do that\nAnd that would have been horrible\nOr what he did was he talked about he ... he didn't changes tone of voice he said he said\nUh when did it happen I don't remember where did you go I don't remember if we can have that played that soundbite for you but this entire media narrative which I don't think is working in the left if you disagree with me and give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nThat President Trump was mocking Christine Blasey Ford that he was mimicking her mimicking is even worse because people do mimic people I mean I I have been known to mimic people I Am perfectly\nSometimes but I Do a better alone it but this was not\nThat and then uh\nThen he was asked a question that has a profound concern to Democrats here's Lesley Stahl\nAt ... why not they shouldn't do it this is a terrible thing to do it you have to believe that the Russians interfered in the two thousand sixteen campaign or election they metal but I think China metal\nToo and I want to know something I said why don't you tell me ... metal because I think China metal\nDo show and I think frankly guide\nHave a problem to the verdict in the whole Russia right now I think Russia but I'm also saying that\nOK here's an Amish many times what is undoubtedly the case which is Russia interfered in the election and I think what President Trump is saying is a there is no evidence that Russia is weighed the election and by the way I think that's true\nOr if you can disagree give us a\nCall one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise] guinea shocking\nThe way that a viscerally solve questioned the press\nAnd you can understand why he's somewhat reluctant to do these interviews we'll be right back with more what it means for the campaign and why the rise in confidence for a politician one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nMichael ... Michael\nWhich actually I think we were justified in and taking some role and I know that very controversial but what does that has to do this in other words if the United states is looking after our own interests uh we we oppose\nRussia's meddling in our election not because it is profoundly wrong in some kind of cosmic sense but because it hurts the United states it's a hostile act and we want to stop\nIt [noise] so what's what's wrong with that\nI don't think there's I don't think there's anything really entirely wrong with us trying to question our own morality in uh in our current role in the world today but just to just think that there are not governments that are trying to influence our our because we are one of the most powerful countries\nNone of course there are governments that are trying to do it but uh and we are we're right to call them out on it and to try to oppose it and then again I think people are right when when a country acts abroad as apparently Saudi Arabia did\nWhich is why do think that what people are talking about about this being some kind of rogue operation that went wrong that they were actually they're not to kill cause show gay and chop them up into little pieces in Istanbul which they did a but to actually just apprehend them and take him back to Saudi\nI I think that is relevant as well and yes there's a difference appreciate your\nCall I'm President Trump inevitably was asked about the border by Leslie stall there was this interchange\nWhat about the for separation of children from their migrant children from the same as the Obama law you know Obama had the same thing it it was on the books but he didn't enforce that new one for us to launch that pop the zero tolerance policy\nTo deter families with children and then everybody decided and courts don't want separation and frankly when you do to separate when you\nAllow the parents to stay together\nOkay when you allow that then what happens is people are going to pour into our country will you gonna go back to\nThat well we'll look at that a lot of things really what we want to do is change immigration was because they were there were a laughing stock all over the world

I'm Sorry I didn't get to our caller in Grand Rapids Michigan I Would have loved to\nBut he was making the point that President Trump did so a mock Christine Blasey Ford\nI don't think he mocked her but I Know he didn't mimic her and that was the word that Leslie stall use you said you mimic Christine Blasey Ford here's what President Trump actually sounded like a this is before the final vote obviously on judge Kavanaugh and it was a a a comment that he made during a rally in Mississippi listen\nWell you'd think it was always wonder\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get

is the one thing I I actually agree with Trump and is it\nIs right to challenge the narrative about what a hero in how selfless and how some noble Christine Blasey Ford is\nI'll tell you when it's appropriate to challenge it can somebody tell me what good at it for the country with Anita Hill on Clarence Thomas even though I don't believe she was telling the truth I don't at\nLeast you could say she raised awareness of problems\nOf workplace\nHarassment\nWhat are you trying to accomplish but says here let me read you one of the descriptions\nI'm\nIn Portland which has long seeing clashes between the far left in the far right for two weeks they've been consumed with Brett black lives matter protests over a fatal police shooting in September\nThose protests in turn provoked right wing groups when video emerged last weekend of demonstrators blocking traffic and beating on a passing drivers car and those videos were horrible\nAnd it it's completely what was so amazing is a police didn't break it up these people were attacking motorists and ...\nAnd by the way most of the more we're white most of the demonstrators are white and they were attacking motors for being white people\nHate crime okay ah\nPortland police apparently had been expecting trouble and managed to prevent it for half an hour or so by lining up and tactical gear along the street I'm sure they love this but after sundown things kicked off the anti fascist may provoke violence\nAccording to a freelance reporter who documented the ensuing Malay on Twitter one of them burned an American flag as the Proud Boys and company we're leaving causing the Proud Boys to return another quote anti fascist than Dallas the entire group with pepper spray\nOkay and then it went down from there I might\nMight question to folks is what you accomplished with us on either side and do you really want to make the American people hate you is there somebody out there who sees the Proud Boys rolling\nWith the ... people and you think wow those ... people are really braver go let's hear it for the Proud Boys they've done such a great job I honestly\nThis this is\nThis is the worst of what's going on in America right now is this idea that somehow you express your political point of view or you advance your political point of view by beating on other people\nReally\nLets or go to a your calls to Christie in Plymouth, Minnesota Christie you're on the Michael ...\nI'm a high I I guess I missed what I'd have to say I was I've been listening to your show and my hackles went up a little bit when you when you said\nIt was just an attempt to to to block him that's all it was by her her going up there and saying what she said because\nThen the timing the timing why why do you think given the fact given the fact that this happens thirty six\nYears ago and that Bradley ... has been a very public person for at least Twenty years why now\nAnd that's and that is exactly what I was going to what I was going to say because I don't want this man\nOn the Supreme Court deciding things that have to do what rape cases per se and analyze that that will that will very possibly look at ... ... you know the way that that in a lot is that if I\nI Know what why is it all off it you know I don't hold on I don't hold on just helped me logically what does something that he allegedly did when he was Seventeen but he denies and nobody else says he did it it's just her\nWhat does her charge against him when he was Seventeen has to do with roe v Wade\nNo it doesn't have anything to do with all the way what I'm saying is he he's going to be on the Supreme Court which could decide wise like we're all the way that would be influential and two women and that's what I was getting at but when\nYou say to when I don't want to move on I don't I don't hold on roe v Wade is first of all it's not a law roe v Wade is a court case and say understanding ... he is repeatedly answered questions about roe v Wade and he said he considers to be settled law\nAnd I I don't I don't understand in other words do you think that the fact\nThat if it was somebody else's name wasn't Kavanaugh somebody else who was accused of misbehavior when he's Seventeen years old that should disqualify him from ever serving on the Supreme Court\nAt absolute it's something that if it's something that like for example she he talked about that in her therapy sessions seven years ago\nYeah but you know it's still early years after with its it's still Thirty years after it happened and Kavanaugh was already famous seven years ago and talking about a year therapy Sessions is very different from writing letters to a congresswoman a Democrat\nTo try to stop the nomination which I think is very clearly what she was trying to do hey I

this\nPolitical correctness and talking about politically incorrect is it true that President Trump went to Ohio and delivered a rally and the big take away from the whole rally was that President Trump has a great big admirer of Robert de leite\nHe I Want to show support for Confederate general in Ohio and now it's not true at all\nSo what did President Trump really say about the civil war General Robert e a lea we will\nGet to that are coming up on the ... that show one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\nBill Marr is one of those people and I've known bill for many many years and he's not such an easy person and however I Will say that there's almost nobody better\nThan Bill Maher when it comes to calling out his fellow liberals for their inane\nAbsurd and disgusting political correctness\nWhich is one of the reasons that I Believe Republicans will prevail in these upcoming collections Americans are sick of it we covered this study that had been featured a by a Harvard professor in Atlantic magazine a study that shows that Americans across the spectrum\nIncluding liberals and conservatives and moderates and blacks and whites and young and old and the highly educated in the not so highly educated\nEverybody believes that political correctness is a problem in this country eighty percent\nAnd it's ah even higher percentages of Latino people in Asian people people normally skew quote liberal on the political spectrum\nAnd Bill Maher I think understands some of the dangers he said on his show over the weekend this\nPolitical correctness I Believe that would destroy it for them and I believe that now\nAnd I think people vote not so much on policy anymore I don't think they followed closely I think they vote on who's strong they know Trump's ... but he looks strong political correctness\nWeek eighty percent of this new Atlantic story that produce this full eighty percent of Americans the political correctness as a problem\nAnd I think it's our problem and I don't know why more mainstream liberals don't denounced the political correctness that they must know in private conversations is insane\nOkay eight he's entirely correct and there are so many examples about it uh and and some of the examples or alluded to I think effectively by Bill Maher\nThere's like ten stories a week let me just company with a Scott Kelly you're familiar with the astronaut okay he tweeted one of the greatest leaders of modern time sir Winston Churchill said in victory magnanimity I guess those days are over\n... where she would apology for that for quoting Churchill because Churchill I live by the standards of the nineteenth century it was okay let me just because of this because [noise]\nHe said I did not mean to offend by quoting Churchill my apologies I Will go and educate myself further on his atrocities fishes that guy who save this from the Nazis\nAnd and you know he's a he was a fighter pilot married the Gabby Giffords was shot and ugly continues on and somebody and people on Twitter and no one denounces his and he has to make in a ... just when the Trump people go yes you people are too fragile no you're being going on with the government and the\nOkay by the way I think Scott Kelly is actually the brother of Mark Kelly Kelly they're both astronauts but naming bill is close enough on that and\n... and we we call attention to the same thing here and they show it how ridiculous I mean the idea that Churchill who ah was an old man even at the time that he took over in Great Britain in Nineteen thirty nine um Winston Churchill I actually took over in Nineteen forty or\nThe idea that that that Churchill can't be voted without probation\nWas or as Scott Kelly also offended by uh the reason I'm movie darkest hour which is one of the finer movies of last year or offended by the movie Dunkirk I mean come on it's absurd\n... if we really reached the point\nWhere Winston Churchill\nHas to have his bust removed from the White House\nNow it is not true that Brock Obama ordered the bust of Churchill removed\nIt is not true that President Trump ordered the bust of Martin Luther king remote the bust of Churchill had been loaned to the United states by Tony Blair as a gift to President Bush and then they weren't back after President Bush left the White House\nBut uh I suspect that President Trump has put some kind of image of Churchill back in the White House ah meanwhile\nThere was this idiotic response from a Princeton professor named ... junior who's much in the media he's African American he had this to say to this idea that a church all should be a dissolved of his various crimes listen\nWhat if it was the case that that uh that she realized that the invocation of Winston Churchill wasn't consistent with what you've out\nBut he didn't know everything about Churchill and then he realized that Churchill that night Jane fairly three sanctions right the starving of Indians and ... and ... he realized in fact the church was inside\nOf me and we are committed to the empirical project you realize that Churchill did not represented so what I mean I just I Want to say this really quickly\nFor those who have been caught in the foot of history you just\nCan't simply in both the mandate of history as a reason to accept certain ... hold on hold of course\nLincoln comes to me I can I can embrace Abraham Lincoln right I can and races democracy but then I realized that Lincoln held a view that white people no matter what the beer once I understand it and selling I live in ... but I\nNot except Lincoln test because the west declares him as a great I have to accept it like a year but every time I bring up I have to apologize for that long ago I didn't make it ...\nIt is what he said he was saying in that moment in other words why not quote Churchill or who basically said in ...\nNow have a a victory Matt and magnanimity and then and uh and in\nWays that into the defiance and\nAnd this is something where we have to be magnanimous and defiance at the same time we're going to lose this one and by the way what any clown junior is saying about Churchill what he's talking about about Churchill's relationship with India\nDuring the war gundy gundy yes the sinking gundy tilted in the direction of Adolph Hitler he did\nHe he justified Hitler because he was in the struggle against the British Empire and he assumed\nThat the weakening of the British Empire would help him and it wasn't because he wasn't Nazi that was where he was and when Winston Churchill crackdown on Indian Nineteen forty three in Nineteen forty three Britain was fighting for his life\nAnd there was a very real chance that the Japanese were going to come over from China where they had taken over\nAnd drive with the Germans to destroy England by basically taking over in India\nThere there were strategic considerations and to say that Churchill harbored some ideas about lots and lots of things that are not particularly up to date or accepted today it is is not to uh to to disqualify\nEverything the man ever said or student for a fact that he said the world and by the way not only save the world from Nazi\nIsm but he did but also from communism\nBecause it was Winston Churchill and his great speech in Fulton, Missouri who first were warned the world at Westminster College\nAgainst the iron curtain\nHe said from a a step in the Baltic to trust in the ... an iron\nCurtain is descending over Europe and he was right and they help to mobilize
