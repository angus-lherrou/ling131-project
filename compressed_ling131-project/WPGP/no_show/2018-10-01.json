{"month": "10", "state": "PA", "station": "WPGP", "content": "He didn't say that of course but no I I I understand what you're ... let me bring up to ... I think this illustrates exactly what you're saying and you're right about it Steve is that a part of a truly squirrel is editorial in the uh New York times\nIt says judge Kavanaugh gave categorical denial isn't at a number of times including at other points that he had ever blacked out from too much drinking give numerous reports now is heavy drinking in college such a blanket denial is hard to believe\nAnd I was actually something about that some some friends um I'm just Stevie you're kind of anonymous on the uh uh radio but have you ever blacked out from drinking [noise]\nAh I I haven't blacked out but it definitely didn't go to Kay eggers than high school to be a\nRight okay okay the the reason I'm asking you about this is I have also been in a situation\nWhere after him too much and then behave badly um with drinking too much as it happens or not any more but once upon a time and did however I never blacked out and I think most people haven't blackout blanking out ... you're it's that's a life threatening\nSituation if you're drinking so much alcohol that you lose consciousness which is what blanking out means that you no longer you don't know where you are and you wake up sometime later is that what happened\nAnd that's that's extreme I think it's highly credible and no one has given contrary evidence that oh gosh I saw Brett Kavanaugh I'm blanking out from drinking their people have said they saw him drink too much\nUm let's go to college in Seattle colon you're on the Michael ... show\nI like are you doing doing well what\nAbout um they said it charges that seem to be flying around and I'm not a wider about about false charges being held accountable for that\nI'll tell you why because it's so difficult to win that kind of case because Brett Brett Kavanaugh is very much a public figure and you know what they have to show they have to show that the people who made the charges don't believe them that they know them to be untrue\nAnd also they're acting out of actual malice that they are trying deliberately to damage this person well\nIf you're being charged with gain weight or\nThey don't you want to be with you that you need that\nWell again she doesn't need to prove that charging a decimation case the burden of proof is on the person making the case in other words\nIt all the person has to say in this case Julie sweat Nick is oh I Believe that that was true this is what my memory is said to me and I've had psychiatric issues and this and that it's it's it's very the way our lawyers are drawn I think that's correct\nIs we give a great deal of latitude in terms of freedom of expression\nSo that you have to really show that somebody is sort of a twirling a mustache and rubbing hand yeah [laughter] I Know this is alive but I'm going to say it any way if you can prove or at least create down to that you actually\nBelieve something that you've said publicly uh then um ... you're not going to be um I suffer from a deafening nation so you'll be able to defend yourself from it it's usually a tremendous waste of time or let us go quickly to buster and Houston buster you're on the ... that show\nYeah just\nBelieve that our credit if they're not the Republican\nRecall where they're already from by the way it doesn't have to read and then it would just be some kind of statement about your drink it through or something and they'll say the word is larger there are other there\nBut then ... will go through the committee and then and then now are these people you know for a vote or not to vote for all world for like a fancy ... recovered\nLocation I don't I don't think that is likely to happen and remember all they need right\nNow is one more vote one more vote they need either Susan Collins or Lisa Murkowski or Joe mansion one of those votes assuming they have Jeff Flake and they do Jeff indicated that pretty clearly today are\nAnd to get that one more vote I I don't think that vote is going to be shaken and specifically they're not supposed to be using the FBI to investigate any new charges the charges on the table right now that's what the FBI if the president says he asked would be investigating over

there\nUm I have a blackout before and it doesn't mean that I lost consciousness that just means that I I don't remember what happened but even looking at surveillance footage from my own house of myself or riding home from a night of drinking are completely fine I just don't remember it\nAnd that doesn't mean I'm advocating for getting out there and\nGetting way way way way to I don't I don't

Blasey Ford and then\nA particularly by a Brett Kavanaugh why was the\nThe testimony yesterday by Brett Kavanaugh even more riveting well because it was confrontational because I'm Brett Kavanaugh received a great deal of\nUh invective and doubts and negativity from Democrats but you may notice the the um the Republican senators were extremely easy going on a doctor blondes before\nIt in fact there was so easy going they didn't ask for a single question all the questions were asked by their designated interrogator who wasn't exactly talk my motto I mean I I Will tell you that Rachel Mitchell for somebody who has a reputation as being a pretty formal prosecutor or the New York times reports she tried to\nPoke holes in Boise Ford\nStraight do she didn't she was just trying to get details so respectfully you talk about being handled with kid gloves the one thing that was clear to side was no one can say she was mistreated\nBy the committee or that they were unsympathetic she will sympathetic the committee treated her with great respect and here we are so how do you figure out which side is telling the truth\nOr is it possible that they both where\nI Am joined by an old friend who has written a fascinating new book a Frank Buckley is a a distinguished professor of law but he is more than that he is the um [noise] foundation professor at George Mason university's\n... school of law but that doesn't mean by the way the fact that as the school the school of law\nThat everyone who goes there where everyone who teaches there must agree with Justice Scalia and all things so that wouldn't be bad either a Frank thanks and welcome to Seattle\nThank you for having me lotus yoga\nIt's wonderful to see you he has a brand new book is called the Republican workers'\nParty and it's a defense of what he considers to be the authentic Donald Trump Republican Party defending it from ... on the left and defending it from ... on the right or we will get to that and just a moment you know judge Kavanaugh\nWell I met judge Kavanaugh you know one reach people around them I don't think I have any basis for commenting on is integrity related but\nI really was an extraordinary episode yesterday or the most dramatic testimony in the Senate anyone could remember I mean and and he's been faulted for being so a passion was exactly what was warranted I thought\nOh absolutely if someone again and I asked people this if someone had accused you of this kind of\nBehavior drug gang women and gang rapes\nAnd and all of this nonsense and you knew it was every five or ... you never did this you are innocent of course you'd be angry um\n[noise] uh let let me just go over I don't think you heard Senator Cruz early this morning I being the gay guy and I got up very early and Ted Cruz was just outstanding this is the Ted Cruz that all of us have been hoping for an and\nBoy do I hope that he was a big victory against that Beto O'Rourke a any he will and he deserves to but here's what Ted our duty said look you have two different witnesses they both are highly credible they're both highly sympathetic how do you evaluate\nWho was telling the truth because they can't both be telling the objective truth and he says you look at the evidence and he says the three pieces of evidence that we have\nOne is the other witnesses who were named\nUh by Dr Blass before none of whom can verify any of the details she has suggested in one of them directly contradict or that would be her friend Leland Kaiser who says she never met Brett Kavanaugh she was never at a party with Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd okay there's that second point his calendar is diary which does appear to cover almost every day of that summer\nAnd does not have any reference to any party like this he was out of town for many of the days that we've been most likely to have been operative here and the third point that\nThe Ted Cruz made and I thought it was a very good one which is if if he truly were guilty of these crimes as a sexual predator as a young man\nTeenager it's almost a certainty that they'd be something against him in twenty three years of public service and it's quite the contrary that there is a complaint there's nothing in his file he is about as clean as the proverbial Helms to\nUh do you think that's a a good way to our\nYeah it is and and cruise asked a good question and answer to properly who was telling the truth\nThere's another question in my ... which is a different question which is who was light and I think nobody was line I think that the ... ... you know Dr Ford was telling it\nGoes you remember did not accurately but not maliciously not line\nSo one would like to imagine some way of all of this going away but I can see one is at times I thought this would be like some old English movie where the guys alone in the room and the ... income soon\nAnd they put so loaded pistol on the desk and he says well oh fellow bad luck but I think you want to think about the regiment and he walks out right\nUm but that wouldn't do it either right because you can't ask Kavanaugh to do that with us just being admission of guilt\nYeah for the rest of his life and for his children and for his ah eleven year old daughter who is now now praying or he says or for a doctor Ford I'm\nSo ... with what you're saying is is I\n... you would agree that if you Brett Kavanaugh with the strength of his denials if he actually had and someone down and try to take off her clothes when he was Seventy he would be like\nYeah okay and you don't think that's you know I don't think it's like an eye crucially\nDon't think she's law and I think she's confused so I think the Republicans properly didn't want to go after her right someone confused I mean\nNothing in that for them but I think there's enough doubt planted about whether or not she remembers accurately what was going on\nWhat what are the things that is ... and I know Lindsey Graham had focused on this a little bit um at least in some of his correspond as in private conversations\nA\n... there's a difficulty about where this house was located because they have now identified the homes in which all of the identified five people who we know of who worked\nA PJ Smith and Lynn Kaiser and mark judge and a ... who ... who used to be and Brett Kavanaugh has five people\nThis could not be the home of any of them because ah they none of them lived anywhere near the Columbia Country club and one of the things she specifically remembers is this was close to where they had gone swimming\nSo again the the failure to identify home in which this occurred it's problematic to her account no\nAbsolutely right I mean but does that matter to Cavanaugh is a point a opponents I recall something that Alan Dershowitz said in a debate with Jermaine Greer you said germane what you're telling me is rape is such a serious crime that innocence is not a defense [laughter]\nI've gotten used to be [laughter] they put down the line but in the age of Michael ... and that's the horrible thing about all of this right I mean you you know you might hope that it would go away that\nUh Brett Kavanaugh would pick up the loaded Pistole and do the decent thing and all that but that that's that's going to work and the reason why it's not going to work is because it's an invitation to the ... the world to do this again and again and again and that's would corrupt our politics and our institutions more than anything else\nAnd let me let me just say a word here and I think this this goes to it is that I um\nI I was a number of people have written to me are very angry as what you're only defending Kavanaugh because he's a Republican and because he's a conservative any cause another vote on court\nAnd I made the case back that there was another very high profile case in this hash tag me to thing where I looked at the evidence guys are very well known liberal I mean well to the left\nBut he was only a kid and I said so and now the additional evidence appears to be yes he was probably wrongly accused of who am I talking about we will\nGet to that in a break I'll be back with Frank Buckley F age but he's the author of the Republican workers' party coming up [noise]\nRight so I I think among conservatives there's a desperate desire for someone on the other side who's going to say what what you know like you said of Travis ...\nYou know he was innocent and that's all the matter is we would desperately liked to see this reciprocated I mean one of the people I revere as Lionel truly offended Whittaker Chambers right there was nothing like yeah okay so you know where are those people and and you know what has happened to the clarion call for truth\nWell this this is an interesting thing is that part of what you argue for in your book the Republican workers' party is the Republican Party filling other role not as a party of William McKinley but as a party of John Kennedy\nAbsolutely John Kennedy ... you know I I'm dating myself my first consciousness as the Nineteen sixty election and of course I Love the Kennedy right didn't weigh all didn't we [laughter] yeah and um you know and and our\nHistory was ... he was pretty tough on the Russian\nHe was pretty tough on the Russian she was pretty softball its foreign policy generally I mean very from Illinois and but it's true and and and\nUh and then there was the kind of do tax cuts the tended to tax cuts came at a time where the top marginal rate was Ninety One percent and the congressional Republicans voted against this reducing the the the the the tax rate why because they were concerned about what it would do with the deficit\nSo you know there there is sort of the old Republican Party to green eye shades\nAnd um and that's somewhere along the line something bad several bad things happened\nThe Republican Party\nI think they became prisoners of an ideology\nWhere you know but they were faithful to the free market ideals with invading a difference to people and I'm I'm thinking of Mitt Romney fine guy but the defining moment or two thousand twelve was makers versus takers the election was over then we have to be undecided both\nLet's go to a some calls and to\nUh we can't because we're almost at a break a leg will do one more segment with the author of the Republican

Mont Hi and I'm\nAn Animal House all of which were as he and rightly observe they were all very popular movies the time that he graduated from Georgetown Prep\nAnd to make it make your point ... ah you're exactly right what he said was that that was why people made the year book sound the way that the yearbook sounded and when you you read that year book\nIt's kind of doesn't really fit with a bunch of people were going ending up going to the top schools in America and are at age as with\nPrivate boys' prep school Frank\n[noise] well I went to a Jesuit school and uh but I was expelled [laughter] I've written it took nine Ninety fifty four Ford indication twenty four year um you know something yeah the the effort to go after the yearbook was one of the ...\nHas voted to um to make this request so President Trump's of course he's going to heed the request and we can move forward I think that is good news let's go to your calls into a pool in Monterrey California Paul you're on the ...\nYes Michael so much to the consternation is due to the reporter confidence of Dr Ford in her position but right toward the end of the questioning yesterday a racial metro was a sexual assault prosecutor\nStarted a line of questioning with Dr Ford who was a psychologist as to whether or not she was familiar with how a forensic psychology psychological evaluation\nIs done to a prospective a sexual assault a victim in preparation for a trial and uh\nIt it didn't matter there wasn't enough time to go anywhere without but I think what it did was succeed in putting into question whatever psychological or therapeutic process Dr Ford used to come to the position that Kavanaugh's attacker\n... I see I I Do think this is is really the questionable aspect which is why\nUh it was so so telling the question for her was the level of her certainty that it was Brett Kavanaugh who are uh hinder to the bed and tried to remove her clothes tried but let us repeat failed\nOr one of the things that bothers me today is the way that people conflate any kind of sexual assault with rape\nOf today when there were a number of protesters who corner Jeff Flake in an elevator they were holding the elevator and they were ...\nKnown as the women women will be it's I don't even\nKnow what the action was but it was a lady with an accent and she said\nHere as a man was violated a young\nGirl okay I I mean this is like defining blackout how do you define violated usually when you use the term violated\nIt means something even worse than what a Dr Blass a Ford\nAllegedly experience and by the way I I agree with with what Frank ugly was saying and what the others have said I I have no doubt that she had some kind of devastating\nA encounter when she was Fifteen Years old and and um\nFeel terrible for her but I have very very very big doubts that it was Brett Kavanaugh who did it because\nI Believe he was equally persuasive an equally a short and the evidence goes to support his point of view let's go to um Claudia in Olympia, Washington Claudia you're on the Michael Mann that show\nHigh out there that there is no if no one has appointed to the Supreme Court and it's a four four tie that all the cases what going back to the lower court and they're very quick and\nDoes that mean that would stand forever and there's no going back to them and how many kids can go to the lower court and said well go back into fashion\nHere's here's here's here's the biggest danger and and you can see this on like some of the gay marriage\nCases is the circuit court of appeals courts of appeals often don't agree with each other you'll get a different judgment from the third circuit us from the Ninth Circuit and uh so that what you would have would be no final decision\nAnd it would be a mess it would it would completely undermine the the value of of even having a Supreme Court now but by the way this is an absolute worst case scenario this will not happen\nAs long as Republicans control the Senate which is why it is so crucial to support Josh Hawley in in Missouri he has now standing Kennedy really really really good guy or I've spoken to his law school professors at Yale\nAnd this is one of the brightest students Yale Law school as ever produce and uh he will join people like Samuel Alito who's also a yellow graduate will welcome a Josh Hawley in Washington DC not up for the Supreme Court yet he's up for the U.S Senate\nBut referring him to Claire McCaskill is also crucial because it is very\nLikely that President Trump will get another Supreme Court nominee\nAfter Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed what you're talking about is Brett Kavanaugh was not confirmed and if the Democrats take\nControl of the U.S Senate they are talking about yes blocking any Trump appointee until after twenty twenty what a disaster we'll be right back\n\nThe American Red Cross is working around the clock to provide seek shelter in comfort for the tens of thousands of people impacted by Hurricane Florence has\nThe threat from the devastating storm continues the storm are still bringing extremely dangerous flooding to the affected regions and getting help to some of the areas will be difficult for some time as rivers continue to rise in hundreds of roads roommates closed American Red cross president and C.

if you wanted to insinuate something salacious about it could have easily [laughter]\nOkay and this is\nA ... ... did you one was a really wild and crazy crowd in in high school a lot a lot of blackout\nYeah glee club a wire [laughter] uh I wrote late from Jake's in quotation marks on my your book which that lends itself to interpretation was actually banned I was in high school but you've got to White House who knows what he would've implied\nOkay here's here's something and I I Will confess this and I was thinking about whether I'd invest this or not there's something really really embarrassing in my high school yearbook for my graduating class [noise] do you want to know what it is\nI'm not in it ah and\nThere are some pictures of me with activities\nAnd but I I was sort of censored out of the year book and I'll tell you why I I was an elected student body officer I was elected commissioner of publications and I know that sounds like a Marxist deal but we had at at uh my high school we had commissioned publications and I was elected\nAnd my big drive as commissioner of publications was to uh cut funding for the year book\nAnd to use the money to start a literary magazine and which we didn't have before and I thought illiterate ... published palms and short stories of presumably they would have all been by me but uh that wasn't true there were actually a number of other people I Do not know this for a fact but\nI have always believed that the reason and I was there I mean I graduated from that class I really did graduate from high school\nAnd but the reason that I'm my photograph and name is not is not there in the high school yearbook is because the yearbook staff which was extremely annoyed with me for this political struggle about their funding as censored me out of it\nUm okay so but now that I have the Brett Kavanaugh\nOh my goodness uh I'm not sure which embarrassing references I might have made but again what is really at stake\nIn in this nomination fight this came up on CNN and John King starts ... got a panel and then sitting across from him as John King is Jeffrey to ... I guess on the show\nAnd I've I've had some respect for his writing in the past but he is ... leave early on hinged on this Kavanaugh facing edged out to lunch and he's lost it\nAnd please listen carefully to what he says will happen to America if a Brett Kavanaugh's confirmed he will be by the way this is a on from CNN [noise] how\nCan you move forward and confirmed somebody to the ... on the United States Supreme court\nWithout getting a potential eyewitness under oath I Do not know how they can answer that question because they want to win right because they want to overturn roe v way because they want Citizens United expanded because they want people to be not allowed to shop everywhere they want to shop and Geoffrey ...\nOkay they want to\nNot allow gay people to be able to shop where they're at it does does he honestly believe that the secret meetings of the Republican high command a a bunch of people are sitting around what can we do to stop gay people from shopping\nBy the way anyone who tries to stop gay men from shopping is asking for a load of trouble this is not going to happen um [laughter]\nDoesn't want by the way how was the Supreme Court of the United states going to stop gay people from shopping where they want to shop\nBecause they want people to be not allowed to shop everywhere they want to shopping\nOkay can we fact check this\nUh and by the way are are there are a lot of conservatives out there but if I if we have callers who your big issue that you want the springboard to deal with is to stop gay people from shopping\nUm\nPlease call and backup Jeffrey to been on this because I teach got us dead to writes this is really the the ... what is it number three priority uh overturn roe v Wade expands Citizens United by the way the the idea of expanding Citizens United\nHe of course what how does he understand that that Jeffrey went to ... he he knows better than this\nI think but maybe maybe that evil\nBrett Kavanaugh spike the punch and are Jeffrey isn't fully in control of his observations let's go I'm up quickly to a Carla in Phoenix, Arizona Carla you're on the Michael ...\nOh hi I'm just you need so fat\nLet you discuss it afterwards the lady said that I have a lot so I'm just\nGoing to say about 'em think would've been upset with the Washington Post it on an interview the high court doctors for what they were searching\nOn what it showed on there in the journal it's asked her afterwards was that in her um Thirteen which hold our heart [noise] uh that's probably about ...\nAnd ... that's ... husband\nBy her husband or by her and she also say that for boys raped her\nOf all I'm just going to go through the wait wait wait\nAs she said for boys assaulted her a ... I don't think she ever even in the therapy note said she was right ...\nWell that journalists out troops that\nWere staying for boys right to not one and you're not ... granted mistaken they said they wish her special degree didn't really took accurate\nThough it's is it just said I don't know then then that journalists said to her husband did you ever hear the last ... well this is the God's truth they sponge that's from the Internet I found one other place in her husband said that\nI never heard of the Wilson Center because I'm a little off Christmas it's been so many that are terrorists lost her home because of this law there she didn't want him to a concert I'm just thinking you\nKnow again and we don't we don't need that um the the point over here is look there is a great deal of confusion when you can't even identify the town that the houses in where this allegedly occurred\nThen something is wrong and there there are big holes in the story appreciate your call Carla or let's go to a Charles in Olympia, Washington Charles here on the Michael ...\nMichael Hi hey there are a lot of things that troubled me about this cannot situation but you know you're talking with Greg earlier about what stupid and idiotic and I find this whole Christine Blasey Ford thing to be stupid to me the Arctic okay\nBecause we know that this is a political ... job why will people just come out and said that it's a political ... job we know what the Democrats want we know that the Democrats are the party\nWell actually by the way there are two people very important people yesterday who came out and said look this is a political hatched a job this is not worthy of America\nOne of those people was Lindsey Graham and a fine fine moment I've actually tweeted about that and pleaded out his comments [noise] and ah one of the people who said that pretty clearly was named Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd he said it again and again and again and I think it was a factor\nThere has been zero complaint from any of the attorneys of veered before him for many of his colleagues from any of his law clerks and he by the way during his period of time on the bench Thirteen Years he's employed more female law clerks than anyone else ever and\n\nOkay but but again you're questioning his temperament someone's temperament is not measured\nA when is measured day to day ... hour by hour and it's not measure when someone who's accused you of gang rape and drugging women and participating in a secret cabal among Marilyn teenagers\nOf gang raping and drugging a series of women including apparently this woman who was four years older than them and in college but go ahead\nMichael like white guy running up and then or the\nYeah and and and by the way Christine Blasey Ford was a very privileged white girl her father was president of the country club go ahead\nMen and women are very different back in those and I just got ... or you know I think that you've walked over in your book all these old you know a little live when you're when you're you're ... you said why this guy and he's like\nWhat did he lie about\nTrump most often or you know first of report on what really our president were\nOkay do do I look the fact is Don McGahn who is running this process has run it very well and if you look over Trump's judicial appointments all of them are none of them have been voted down none of them has been blocked they of all gone through so far\nAnd ah actually there was one that was withdrawn I'm Sorry but but this is of hundreds and and his judicial appointments have been fine so again I I think it's a mistake for Democrats to try to make the issue Trump\nBecause frankly President Trump did you hear Trump's statement today Alex\nOkay\nYeah I think it's a mistake to make the issue about Trump because frankly he handled this very well today he had a decent statement about it he was sympathetic to Dr Blass Z Ford\nAnd the the point is that character assassination is worth condemning and uh I Do think he was criticized rightly for his Fox News interview where he was not sufficiently indignant\nWas sufficiently had appropriately indignant yesterday
