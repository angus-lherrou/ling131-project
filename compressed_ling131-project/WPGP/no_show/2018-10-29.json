just about anybody\nAnd has followed politics ... he's also an expert because he wrote the book on it literally on the question of voter fraud and manipulating elections John as a a columnist for National Review he has a contributor at Fox News\nAnd he has why is the blue wave looking more like\nA splash then it's not me that's his latest piece it in our National Review John thanks very much for coming on the show\nTruck pleasure Michael I've always\nOkay right now uh uh uh ... how many states approximately are people already sending thousands of course here in the state of Washington people are because they'll vote by mail\nThirty states have some form of early voting whether it's apps and to your uh you know showing up at a government office before the election\nOkay so let me put the word out to people anyone listening to us right now and one of those thirty eight states and you probably are I don't wait sending your ballot get it done that way you make sure you're making a contribution\nTo this important national decision the consensus seems to be on the part of everybody who's looking at this John Fund that the momentum seemed to turn around in a Republican direction after the Kavanaugh hearings you agree with that\n[noise] well I think a lot of people had baked and the cake any negative attitudes they had the President Trump and I think that Trump's antics\nAs a personality had depressed part of the Republican base but the Kavanaugh hearings brought out the ugliness of the left their complete disregard for normal procedures and rules and the rule of law\nAnd I think that it's best to show the Democrats to be the equal of Trump in a violating norms and politics\nAnd at worst almost extra constitutional so I think that Trump\nManaged to succeed where nobody else ever thought he would he managed to get the Democrats to drop their own to October surprise on their feet to blow up in their face\nAnd yeah it's it does it does seem like that and I know there are a bunch of people like Dean Heller or who is long considered our most endangered a senator senator from Nevada\nHe strongly supported Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation and that appears to have given him a boost I think they're running tied now right now in Nevada aren't they\n[noise] I think of the election were held today Republicans would lose none of their seats and the only question is what the Democrats lose two three or four years\nWow which means they of course Republican control of the Senate what about on the house side\n[noise] I Would say the Democrats because of a variety of good factories including the fact that uh\nYou know suburban women become one of the most resistant groups against Trump twenty five point gender gap against them or against Republicans I think there are sixty percent chance to take back the house with sixty percent of a lot lower than it was two or three weeks ago\nBecause I think that as the issues start to be talked about you know remember most\nOf your listeners are into politics Michael you and I are into politics the average voter\nDoesn't pay attentional took much closer to the election so when they actually look at the issues is a center right country and if the Republicans frame the issues property they tend to close the gap in the last two weeks unless there's some extraneous of it like the two thousand they financial meltdown\nOkay two two issues which are very much front and center at this moment ah one is the alleged did horrible gaffe that President Trump made last night and used and when he called himself a nationalist do you think this is going to alienate millions and millions of American voters\nI think it maybe the hundreds and hundreds of reporters and journalists were once again appalled by the fact that the president is you know troll ... telling them I mean a\nNotice when he said and he said I don't I'm not supposed to say it but I'll faint anyway I mean look the president may not be the most elegant speaker but boy does he know how to use language as a weapon up but it often use whatever ears as a trigger word from one of them why keep you both the trigger\nRight and a pulls the trigger on on them to watch their heads explode and I it's just extraordinary I'd like to hear people I even offered to listeners to call up and say why nationalism was a bad word a one eight hundred and\n... Seventeen Seventy six our phone number go ahead\nIt has some bad historical antecedent but basically it's another sending them and I think you pointed this out for patriotism\nYeah of course a ... and again the first three Senate ... that are listed when you\nJust click on it on the Internet are national feeling a national uh as patriotic feeling pardon me patriotism and flag waving\nAnd uh nothing wrong with any of those three things what about we we had on yesterday or Eric eggers who\nIs a very concerned about ah the confusion in American voting registration suggesting that as many as twenty four percent uh of registered voters right now are really shouldn't be voting\nHow you've written about this um extensively do you think that's a very big problem\nTwo weeks from today\nIt depends on the state\nOr you know I I hate to draw national brushing twenty four percent sure from high to me I think that the problem with voter fraud as it doesn't show up until the very end\nWith an election was closed and somebody gets desperate and they put their farm on the scale and found the street money out and it all happens quickly at the very end you know under the cover of a ... you know vans and everything else so we may not know\nWhat happens but we do know that we need to watch for it and if there's anything on toward\nThese bad with these look like in Georgia you know these ... these are not people are being prevented from voting it just means they have to show up at the polls and fill out a provisional ballot and prevent their id it doesn't we're not preventing anyone from voting we're just making sure the person who's voting is the person they say they are\nYeah I mean while I'm there is a um a this additional ... thirty six governors' ships that are up in in this election right now right\nYeah it's a big this is the big casino yeah and these these\nThese governorship will help decide how redistricting is done after the next census within two in two years\nRight which will also help to determine whoever wins what it will be a very close election you don't think there's any chance the Democrats win more than thirty seats are you\nThere oh no no no in fact I think I think the governorships they're going to be a lot of swaps rip them across will take back some Midwestern states that have been in Republican control for a long time like Illinois and the Republicans are going to take back I think they'll pick back states where the Democrats mismanaged the finances so bad that um\nYou know they've given up any chance of governing but Connecticut by the way even Oregon even Oregon\nMake it like the Republican governor for the first time in Thirty years\nRight which would be amazing Boyd is Kate Brown ever deserved to be voted out of power in Oregon now there's one surprise to look for is there a Republican candidate against Angus King in Maine\nThere is but ah and he's a good guy but unfortunately Angus King has this impenetrable independent image because he technically runs as an independent so he's got that nailed down\nOkay except I understood the New York times today random forming piece about the Democrat there is a democratic nominee against Angus King whose name is Zak Ringelstein and he apparently is a big Bernie Sanders guy he's been endorsed by democratic socialist\nIf we could encourage if anybody listening to us up in Maine vote your conscience vote for the real socialist votes or Ringo sky Democrats\nAnd makes his because right there has to be at least forty percent something like that will vote for the Republican anyway right\n[noise] well you know all all I'll say is that when you're trying to remember who to vote for king does beat rankled Stein\n[laughter] at the ... yes in in terms of the future but I I assume that the Republican candidate could do more than ringelstein as well any other surprises that you think we should look out for an election day\nYeah Minnesota Senate race the the the L Frank and resigned from the appointed incumbent named Tina Smith Michael last night they have the only debate the Democratic candidate\nDidn't show up refused to show up fighting scheduling difficulties there was one candidate on the stage the Republican candidate that enough people to him well and\nUh by the way as close to the both it's a six point rate according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune which does Republicans do favors at its poles\nThat is terrific I'm actually going to be in Minnesota and a campaign event on Thursday night there are three red hot congressional races in Minnesota there to Senate races one of them not so red hot where I think isn't senator club is on the ballot to\nShe's the probably the only political figure of the Democratic side who came out with a reputation and a half of the car with our hair and could\nBe a John son's reputation enhanced by his new column about the blue wave looking more like a splash than its nominee we will be right back on the man that show with some of the worst political ads of the season\nTo win a democratic seat um ... where do you think Republicans should place the emphasis in these last two weeks in a campaign in order to try to hold on to the house\nWell I think that they have to emphasize three things one is you know even though there are problems in the world were peace\nAnd frankly we are more respected now than we were two years ago that's number one\nTo the economy is really good and that's not an accident or ... or ... policies having a delayed reaction\nIf you want higher taxes and want to take a risk with picking the economy backwards vote for the Democrats the takeover Congress and the third is you know\nAre there some basic things the Democrats don't seem to care about one of the rule of law is proven by Kavanaugh and to\nWhy are they saying nothing about this caravan this mob whatever you want to call it the moving up from Mexico as the wall Street Journal reported today which was very pro immigration this is outrageous that we have these people encouraged to move to the United states that influence our election\nAnd at the same time the Democrats are completely silent a fundamental issue of national sovereignty\nAnd apparently this is the work of a former president of Honduras and his henchmen\nA which the wall Street Journal is written about in the Daily Beast has written about that this really started or as as basically a means of undermining the currents center right president of Honduras and to hold the American people hostage to the vagaries of Honduran\nDirty tricks campaigning doesn't seem a good idea Jon\nOr or the Democrats need to step forward and say this is wrong and I hear crickets cricket\nWell exactly what they have nothing to say because again they would much prefer to a run on the the the the family separation issue which they tried to make a great deal of apparently sixty two percent of all democratic ads of each or health care isn't that a mistake don't you think\nWell it's putting lots of eggs in one basket and you know I think preexisting conditions are important I don't think they're that important to that many Americans\nOkay and the Republicans have been very emphatic that we are not going to endanger people with preexisting conditions that those guarantees will remain a we are speaking with John fun John appreciate your insight and I hope but maybe you can come back again\nBefore we have the occasion for a a post election let's hope celebration or John funds new column is post on our website at

[noise]\nThere's a great deal of controversy about Stacey Abrams who is a candidate for governor\nShe's the Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia and she's running as Brian Kemp who is the Republicans the states ... states Stacey Abrams is state senator\nAnd a ...\nHere here's the problem is a two fold problem one of the items that seems to me is more of a problem than the other\nAnd ah the one that's getting all the attention today is a CNN is reporting democratic candidate to be George next governor explained her presence Tuesday at a Nineteen Ninety to protest that included burning the state flag\nShe said that was part of her opposition to Confederate symbolism\nHer or\nInvolving came to light on social media and the statement to CNN Abrams campaign said that the actions in college were\nPart of a permitted peaceful protest against the Confederate emblem in the flag it's part of Georgia State flag\nAt the time of the protest in Nineteen Ninety to the states flags states flag contained the Confederate battle flag emblem which had been a prominent feature of the state flag since it was adopted Nineteen fifty six when the battle over to the segregation was raging in the south\nThe Confederate battle flag emblem wasn't fully recover removed from the states flag until two thousand three\nAnd then the state in the uh Stacey Abrams campaign says during Stacey Abrams college years Georgia was at a crossroads struggling with how to overcome racially divisive issues including symbols of the confederacy the sharpest of which was the inclusion of the Confederate emblem and the Georgia State flag\nThen and then goes on to say a crunch time in public services deputy city attorney in a state legislative leader of all been focused on bringing people together to solve problems\nOf educate\nFact that back in Nineteen Ninety two she participated in a demonstration against the state flag that's not a problem it seems to me and shouldn't be a big problem in our campaign it's a long time ago and the flag was changed anyway she's not burning contemporary Georgian flag I'll tell you what is a problem\nShe has gone on record and she is standing by it about basically blowing up the largest Confederate monument to the mall\nAnd this is one then I have spoken about this before on this whole issue of Confederate monuments\nI I can understand why you would decide not to blow anything up but to move a statue for instance the best example is a New Orleans\nThey had a statue of Robert de layer on top of a pillar and it really looked over the whole city and it was sort of like the Nelson's statue on top of a pillar infer fog or square in Great Britain in London\nAnd having Robert de Leon such a prominent place looking over the whole I get a problem\nDon't blow it up but they and I don't know what they're putting on top of that pillar of anything made it took the whole pillar down they move the leash statue okay\nBut when you're talking about Stone Mountain I actually looked it up the Stone Mountain memorials bigger than Mount Rushmore and its carved into the side of a mountain it took about Thirty years to do all the carving it was a very very big undertaking\nAnd in the side of the mountain is an image of Jefferson Davis president of the confederacy Robert The league commander of the army of northern Virginia and his chief lieutenant Thomas Jonathan Jackson Stonewall Jackson and they're all riding along\nAnd Stacey Abrams is taken the position that event monument has to be removed and trashed\nAnd honestly I don't understand it there are lots of African Americans in the state of Georgia Stone Mountain by the way over three thousand acres the beautiful beautiful park\nAnd it is owned I'm pretty sure by the city of Atlanta is three thousand acres and their trails they used to have a whole neo Confederate theme park is the New York times points out where they had a plantation house that's all gone if they put up appropriate signage that looks\nSide of this mountain as a historical symbol wouldn't that be a better way to go than simply sand blasting it or ruining it are knocking it down and because of the size of Stone Mountain you're putting the minds of the Taliban remember them they blew\nUp these Buddhas because they took over the Buddhist were over twelve hundred years old\nAnd they blew them up in the ... valley and\nUh basically that was a that was before September eleventh and I went on the air and I talked about it and I said this is an act of terrorism against the past and\nLook I understand that you can move a statue but the notion that you have to blow up a whole mountainside\nIt's it's a little bit nutty in uh the New York times they point out that the David Huckabee who is a Georgia syndicated columnist no relation to the White House press secretary assailed\nMisery roast position rating that she intends to run the most racist and divisive campaign history of Georgia politics\nRemoving such symbols won't keep one black father at home with his family won't take a single illegal weapon off of a single street in a single black neighborhood\nAnd a ... look I\nI understand that the whole history behind the Stone Mountain monument is a a a it is a terrible thing because they started putting it up started plans for Nineteen fourteen and it was associated with the rise of the clan\nAll of which of course was presided over with great approval by a southerner Democratic president Woodrow Wilson and yes Woodrow Wilson was a sudden there is ... Virginia I Know he was governor of New Jersey before\nBut uh the idea that you have to blow up that memorial why would Democrats want to be the real Taliban of American politics I don't get it one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number ... we'll be right\nDavis covers three acres on the face of this mountain and the idea of just blasting it up it it seems to me that a number there are a number of black leaders in Atlanta\nWho do believe that that it's a new asleep polarizing and pointless to insist on blowing up a a beautiful city park let's go to John in Kansas City John you're on the ... that show hey\nYou know my heart I'm well you're very good job or do you make it and I can listen to your ... and above is again okay maybe in fact built their heritage\nNo no I've never I never say that this is their heritage I never say that because the heritage of treason should be rejected\nAll right okay okay we're hearing the outfits you find it so\nBeautiful historical and all that how would you feel that there was a Stone Mountain of Adolf Eichmann I'm Rick killer and all that they don't they lost the war to they were fighting for their country that there are good\nBut again and again I I I Would I Do not use the argument of heritage I that's not the point the point is if there was if there is an art work a piece of art is carved into a mountain that can't be moved because you cannot move aid three acres culture that it took Thirty years to make you only blow it up\nOr if there's something like that it's different from moving a statue and I again I Do not believe that they're at I think it's important to preserve for instance I don't think that ... should be blown up\nI think it's important that it be preserved date is part of the record of history and they didn't have any statues and now she is but if they had them there that should be preserved as part of the historical record as well\nAnd given the fact that\nAh they've taken out some of the they used to have a plantation house\nAt a Stone Mountain I think they still have a place that was there recently they still have a place called Confederate house but Confederate house doesn't have anything inside it any more they just have T shirts say Stone Mountain\nAnd or should it have anything inside us of that some people the Confederate souvenirs no of course not\nBecause you're right this is a dark chapter of American history is not one to be celebrated\nBut that doesn't mean it seems to me following the Taliban example of blowing up monuments from a different era we will be right back on the ... that show [noise]\n\n\nMost executives don't want the job place frankly attorney Michelle county host of counties law on the importance of proper a state of ministry
