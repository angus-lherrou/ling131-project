you this Tuesday you know what I'm plugging right now come on now you know all month\nOn that we are partnering with alliance defending freedom or they are the organization the front lines defending religious freedom in this country\nThey defend Americans for free\nFree legal advice because of that they need to raise money so that they can do what they do they need your help I Need your help or on behalf of real people like posh Thomas a mother in Decatur, Georgia last November Pasha centered kindergarten age daughter\nTo school unaware of the school officials had quietly enacted a transgender bathroom policy\nIn elementary school when posh his daughter was alone in the girls restroom\nTo kindergarten or were sexually assaulted by a boy who was allowed in the restroom because of the new policy it took two weeks until school officials agreed to meet with Pasha about the assault on her daughter but as she tells us they refused to alter their transgender bathroom policy had\nTold the facts that album demanding that in a little windy taken out of the classrooms at that point she's she but she says she would she would not\nTake them out of the last one I have well in ... when no longer be allowed to go to the good the bad though not all that kind of shy of anything that I'm not watching the show you that\nIf this tragic and avoidable salt could happen to Pasha Thomas's child it could happen to yours\nSo alliance defending freedom has filed a complaint with the U.S department of education to office of civil rights and an investigation is now under way\nThere's also more talk of trees and in a Senate race [noise]\nA a would be the United states senator a Democrat of course\nI didn't say and it's on radio and it's\nOn tape and you can hear it as she did say that it was fine she had no problem with people going over to Afghanistan and fighting with the Taliban\nThat is against people like the opponents of this particular would be senator we'll talk about that race will talk about another race where a democratic campaign to re elected US Senator has just about collapsed and with it perhaps\nThe Fort Lauren hopes of the Democrats to capture the U.S Senate and meanwhile the house races very very much\nUp for grabs and are there is every attempt to try to use everything at hand right now this is like a bar fight and that's what happens in the last couple of weeks of the campaign that's what people talk about October surprises a because people\nWill grab hold of anything of a bottle or its share or\nUm ... anything that you can find an ashtray and you throw it in the ... and you see what hurts and you see what sticks that's the stage of the campaign were in and what that means is that even when there is a gruesome assassination\nOf a a Saudi journalist and by the way he's not an American citizen he was living in the United states he had come to a we're talking about ...\nUh and I'm not even sure how you pronounce this in proper Arabic I'd always thought it was ... but a lot of people are saying ... ...\nBut whichever way he's was chopped up into a lot of different pieces in his body apparently was brought back to Saudi Arabia\nIs not a nice thing it's a terrible thing that had happened and if you listen to CNN\nWho's to blame\nMost Trump of course why I'm Brian Steltzner was on with Fred Hyatt on CNN and this is what Brian Steltzner had to say\nTo lure someone to a consulate to December the body and to take it back to the Saudi that it it is a crime of a different caliber uh I Wonder if you look at what's happened the last five days and you wonder if enemy of the people rhetoric\nNot just from President Trump but also then from other world leaders has anything to do with anything at all\nOkay what what are\nThe Trump's rhetoric has to do with the actions of Saudi Arabia I yes we are aligned with Saudi Arabia and yes we need to be there's a powerful piece by Walter Russell Mead in the wall Street Journal today that make that\nCase but the attempt to blame the killing of this Muslim Brotherhood affiliated journalists\nTo attend to blame that killing on President Trump or on his rhetoric is is just absurd\nOf the people who listen to Trump's rhetoric and share it when he takes on fake news are not murderers and they are by and large not Saudi Arabian I mean while this was the response from Fred Hi it on CNN too uh that\nCharge in a case like this with important through on the actual crime\nOr to keep focus on the actual criminal and you know of the Washington Post were very focused thing we've got to get the facts\nAnd then there has to be accountability and there has to be consequences\n[noise] I think there is a larger picture which was also fair to look at which is that a dictators around the world feel embolden when you have fruit and reaching out to Britain to poison his enemies when you have China\nReaching out to Hong Kong and elsewhere to kidnap people they perceived to be their enemies\nAnd went in each case they supposedly enemies are peaceful ah you know for people who have done absolutely nothing wrong or you have to ask why is this happening and I do think is happening\nIn part because the United states is retreating from its traditional role as a leader in the world standing up for democratic values and including freedom of expression\nOkay that's fair enough I mean the idea that there should be no us retreat and you need to establish norms and rules of law by the way of course they forgot about North Korea is North Korean our good buddy you may remember\nThat I'm Kim John I'm it it also abroad had his half brother um murdered\nBecause he might be dissenting from the regime look this is one of those things that there is obvious concern about and it's bipartisan and it should be a Lindsey Graham who's become one of the strongest supporters for the administration in the United States Senate\nHad a had this to say on Fox and friends about the cars shaggy killing\nI Know there's nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without NBS knowing it who's going to be I have for thirty three year old crown prince who jumped him over other people he's the son of the existing came\nAnd I think he's on a on a bad track\nI can never do business with Saudi Arabia again until we get this behind us and what does that mean I mean I'm not going back to Saudi Arabia as long as this guy in charge so you're selling the crown prince has to leave this up to them but I'm not going to I'm In their biggest offender on the floor of the United states and\nThis guy is a wrecking ball he had just gotten murdered in a conflict in Turkey and takes that made it north I feel used and abused hours on the floor every time defending Saudi Arabia because there is a good ally there's a difference between a country an individual thing NBS figure\nIs Timmy toxic he can never be a world leader on the world and what is the president did thank us up to the ... but what I Would do I know what I'm gonna do want to sanction the hell out of Saudi Arabia [noise] you know\nWe deal with bad people all the time but this is in our face I feel personally offended they have nothing but contempt for us find would you put a guy like me and the president in this box for after all the press and has done this guy's gotta go Saudi Arabia the lifting there are a lot of good people you can choose but NBS his tainted your country and painted into like\nOkay this is probably not the right approach frankly because you have a situation in the country where the crown prince NBS Mohammed bin Salman\nA is a in power because his father is old an ailing and uh I'm not sure that there is a power structure in place in Saudi Arabia that can simply replace him right now\nAnd there's a fine piece in the wall Street Journal I mentioned by Walter Russell Mead the headline is don't ditch Riyadh and a fit of righteousness\nAnd he makes the point that we have to deal with these people\nAnd I I don't think anybody would say that we shouldn't go forward with some kind of a deal with Kim Jong on which remains one of the most promising\nA diplomatic initiatives of the Trump Administration so far uh nor should we simply write all Saudi Arabia or there is breaking news in Washington Post is reporting that\nUm that President Trump spoke\nDirectly to the crown prince to Mohammed bin Salman apparently he was together\nThe crown prince was meeting with secretary of state Mike Pompeo and he may have handed uh the phone when he was on the phone with President Trump to a mum had been Solomon and according to the president the crown prince totally denied any knowledge of what happened in the\nHospital in Turkey any promises answers shortly ... disappearance a secretary of state Pompeo press the Saudi leaders to move quickly with a transparent investigation of the disappearance of democracy hoagie and yes it sounds like a\nTruly awful business he he comes into the consulate\nBecause he wants to get papers he needs so that he can get married his fiance is waiting in the car outside now he never came out of that council it or at least he never came out in one piece\nThey brought in a an expert with the bone saw they brought in an expert in autopsies they apparently packaged the various little pieces of his body and sent them back to Saudi Arabia this is a bad thing\nIs it a lot of fans\nEven the norms of state misbehavior but then again\nMohammed bin Salman has a um a a real problem also with the with the policy that's going on in Yemen\nAnd the I guess the Saudis are basically looking out for the American for American interests and standing up against the Iranians who are the ones that would really stand to gain if there was some kind of big break between the United states and Saudi Arabia which I emphatically hope there won't be\nBut something has to be done or with a show of arresting people who were behind this killing and making it clear that is not approved of or authorized by the government one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six you remember may remember that\nUm last year the Saudis kidnapped the ah well they arrested the Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri [noise]\nThat was a disaster they all said this failed diplomatic confrontation with Carter\nWhich was a disaster we need a stable productive and strong Saudi Arabia but we also need a stable productive and strong US government Alec Baldwin says we need to overthrow it out while I Will get to it coming up\n... doesn't that sound a little bit like a conspiracy theory well it is now there's a history on this dinner this was originally called the Jefferson Jackson day dinner and named after the two founders as it used to be told of the Democratic party Thomas Jefferson\nWho started the Democratic Republican Party and then Andrew Jackson who started the modern Democratic Party\nProblem with those two guys they were both slave owners [laughter] and big time slave owners hundreds of flights so they changed last year the name of the Jefferson Jackson day party to another illiterate of name\nIt became the Kennedy Clinton day dinner\nOkay that's a little bit of a problem and hash tag me to do you think that I Know Hillary says that President Clinton had no abuse of power he was your driven snow\nWhat'd you think that John Kennedy and Bill Clinton each have a a little bit of a problem in the view of feminist by the way feminist had a very very important anniversary they celebrated we will get to that um so what are they

Wyoming majority of African Americans there's a little bit of Native American and most people whose families have lived here in the United states for many years and that is true for Elizabeth Warren's family\nBut the best case analysis for her the idea that she has one sixty fourth Native American means that about a hundred and fifty years ago she had one of her sixty four great great great great grandparents\nWho may have been Cherokee as she says family lore suggested the entire thing was a ridiculous claim to begin with and wouldn't it be better for\nHer if she just backed off that no but she won't she basically insists that uh this is the way she's going to set up her presidential campaign my question to you\nWould be what is she thinking why is this a good idea\nIt makes her look ridiculous and make sure looked like a liberal racist why do I say that\nBecause for goodness sake if you grow up in a situation where you never affiliate with a tribe no one in your whole family within memory has ever affiliated with the tribe you've never gone to India and events you haven't raised with any Indian culture you know nothing about Indian history or background\nYou have no connection no affiliation no participation know communal involvement with the Native American community\nAnd ah then when you get hired at Penn and at Harvard you put down that your ethnicity as Native American because that qualifies you as a diversity hire\nI mean the whole thing is sad now is it\nThe end of the world no it's not the end of the world but she is making at the end of her campaign she is blowing herself up and she chose to do this thing this would be a good idea or does she really saying she should get the million dollars that President Trump by the way did not promise here is what that is\nBased on where a that's number three they're under Warren audio Jeremy where where President Trump makes the original offered to senator ... and he's doing a rally in Montana or over the summer listen I Want\nFavorite charity\nIf you take a test of the shows your your [laughter]\nOkay and it shows you are an Indian right but the uh ... that whole idea\nShows you're an Indian means that you would be accepted by some kind of try and there is no try them in the country the except someone with one sixty fourth Indian blood as an Indian and they do require you to be an enrolled member of any tried to actually show that yes you have a personal history\nThat has involved you or someone in your family or someone in your background\nShe has none of that and so she can't\nCollect the million dollars in the wall Street Journal is wrong and that the um the wall Street Journal and he should tell you what their editorials said and why I think they are wrong and seriously wrong about this it's bad or they basically suggest that Trump would look good if he just paid or the money\nAnd I'm here here's what the what they say in a their editorial they say write the check Donald you'll look gracious and you'll have him using talking points photograph it will last the entire two thousand twenty campaign\nShe says I'm miss Warren now says Mr Trump should make good on his post to write a million dollar check to charity and ms Warren proved she had Native American\nBlood he didn't say she had to prove she had Native American and bloody said she\nAt the show she was an Indian and that's right and if he doesn't do this is what you call in and give her right or an Indian better I'm\nAs Lindsey Graham actually spoke on that she was willing to uh he's going forward with his own DNA test and he's going to out Native American Elizabeth Warren here's what Senator Graham and to say\nIt was before and yet in a test she could be anywhere from sixty fourth to one thousand Native American you have a challenge I'm going to take a DNA test all of you have I've been told him my grandmother was far Cherokee Indian it may all be just talk\nBut you got to find out in a couple of weeks I'm going to take this year we're going to take it I'm taking it and the result is going to be rebuilt here\nThis is my ... this is our phone and say well you know I just I'm dying to I mean I you know I didn't really think much about it but she's less than one tenth of one percent I think I can beat her I think I can beat her right and if you do ... what would you ask for a million dollars from the president to no warning casino enemy about\nOkay he wants a casino and a million bucks uh I I I have good luck with that Lindsey or by the way you can you imagine how are the headlines and some of the more left leaning papers was South Carolina senator says he wants to beat\nHis colleague from Massachusetts are abusing woman again really ... by the way it does this have anything\nAt all to do with Semitism are hashtags me too if you think it does you can give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six looks the one thing that a Senator Warren I think established\nIs a a really bringing Americans together and a news busters put together a collage showing the way that major networks including some that are usually reliably liberal reacted to this Elizabeth Warren ploy\nThe Cherokee Nation criticized warns announcement saying that are used to be in a test is inappropriate and quote undermining tribal interests with our continued claims of tribal heritage beyond its\nPeople questioning whether this revelation related when her at any point for ... this is the reason it controversial when she was at Harvard law school and when she was at the University of Pennsylvania\nShe represented herself as Native American sheep contributed to a Native American cookbook\nCalled powwow chow\nCherokee the Cherokee Nation called the president's attacks interested but it's also criticizing Warren things she is undermining tribal interests with our continued claims of tribal heritage\nAdding a DNA tested useless current DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person the ancestors were indigenous to North or South America in the video Warren\nSays she respects the difference between family history and tribal affiliation not enrolled in his prime only trying to determine tribal citizenship and\nOh boy oh boy\nOh boy is right I mean really what was the lives of Martin thinking and\nWhat is her side of this is there a sign of is not that I see a there was a um Cherokee Nation secretary of state and yes it is a separate nation officially a was on CNN with Jake Tapper and Chuck Hoskins junior had this to say\nThe problem with a DNA test is that it proves nothing of relevance to whether a person is a citizen of the Indian nation a member of an Indian nation DNA at best can give you some indicators of some markers that indicate that you're\nRelated to somebody who live long ago that may have lived in North and South American maybe in a native peoples of those continents\nUm it's irrelevant to what it means to be a Native Americans in this country that that's the base that's based on a legal definition certainly every tribe has that in common that we have some legal basis for citizenship that we determined consistent with federal trainees\nJust holy unhelpful for any national later to a claim to DNA to determine the or to establish that their Native American in this country\nAnd by the way it doesn't really establish require DNA there's a very famous American and he's a featured character in my book the American miracle name Sam Houston\nAnd Sam Houston was an official member of the Cherokee tribe why not because\nHe was born that way but because he went and they live with the Cherokees and he worked with them and he was adopted by a local chief and he learned the language and he was deeply involved themselves a Senator Warren and your free time after\nYou lose your presidential race maybe you could explore your post Cherokee heritage of one one thousand and twenty fourth maybe from an

a specialty buy one get one free gold you might be a little dog\nUsually from Madrid [noise]\nPam I I Will say that President Trump has told outright lies things that he knows not to be true because he's been told but where is there an outright lie here on this issue\n[noise] I Know he said find out if you have I don't know exactly what he said\nBut let me tell you the story and he said he oh what's her that million dollar let ... let me ... let\nMe play it for you okay I just wanted to be fair here listen to what President Trump said\nHere's President Trump's original offered to Elizabeth Warren I won't\nIf you take the test of the shows your your [noise]\nOkay if it shows you're an Indian and my point here was that there is no Indian tribe in the world in the country\nThat would accept her as an Indian based upon this DNA test that shows that she may have had one great great great great grandfather who was an Indian that's my only point\nYou just want to say that I'm Trump your color and uh and the previous hour said Trump that brought us down to the gutter he really had and I mean you guys I I'm I'm just\nSo I said let me let me let you let me ask you\nThis okay do you think that is honorable or for Elizabeth Warren to have a promoted herself as a diversity hire to have contributed to an Indian cookbook to have gone through this masquerade for all this time\n[noise] no I don't think she should have done that I okay I thought it was trivial and he shouldn't have done it but I'll tell you what Trump calls out women he called the doctor for it doesn't matter and she was lying or not and we want and what do you want it that's all he cares about winning and he didn't care who he dumped on\nOkay look I I Believe that President Trump does sometimes go way over the line I think it's unfortunate and I said it already on this show\nI think it was a big mistake on his part and it was inappropriate for him to attack Stormy Daniels who was made accusations of intimate kind against him\nTo attacker is for space at it put that in a tweet today\nUm it's probably we probably reached a point in our world where if you're going to be attacking a female and you can attack or the way President Trump is attacking was warm but don't attack or looks I think we can agree on that and Pam I appreciate your calling\nMe and carrying enough about the show\nTo actually

fourth innings there should be about nine dollars and thirty eight that\nI'm sure you've done the math that the problem is he he basically said she needs to show she's an Indian and what that means is how do you define who is an Indian now\nIn the URL Nuremberg Laws and Nazi Germany\nThis is something you'll find out about the ... movie uh they used to ... someone who is Jewish who was eligible for

go back to great great great great that's for great great grandparents a hundred and fifty years\nAnd it's absurd she cannot prove that she's in Indian she cannot show that she's in India and

all there are a lot of women who love President Trump by the way President Trump won a majority of white female voters\nHe did not a huge majority but by eight points\nThat something and there are lots of people out there is some of his biggest supporters are black women like diamond in silk\nThey're all kinds of folks to abandon stereotypes and have feelings positive and negative ... sandwich oldest rages about\nThe President Trump beat a female candidate for president and he won the election and people don't like the result why is this a moment of intense female rage is the economic situation\nInitial a cancer diagnosis and the charities have been so wide\nRanging and for the most part so noble pull gee Allen philanthropies ... has been emphasizing the environment including preserving or some some wilderness areas and and global health and helping with diseases like Ebola\nBut he's also had more local\nFocus and and this is one thing that I wanted to to speak about particular it's very unusual for somebody to basically grow up in a place he was born in Seattle his father was one of the chief librarians at University of Washington\nAnd he grew up here and he came back here and he's had just an enormous impact on the city almost all of it very very positive it could have been more positive one of the things that I first admired about Paul Allen is he was pushing a plan called the Seattle comments\nWhich would have been a terrific sixty one acre park right in the middle of the city where it would have replaced\n... a a bunch of warehouses in a very fairly rundown area of town with a great green space coming back from lake union\nAnd uh and then that would have been surrounded by housing buildings and office buildings in any event it was turned down in a city vote a right the same year that we we arrived we moved to Seattle city vote was incredibly close\nAnd but it was turned out and so now there are lots and lots of office buildings in that same area many of them by the way developed by Paul Allen's company Vulcan\nBut he built the museum of popular culture which used to be called the experience music project he was a huge fan of Jimmy hendrix who was a Seattle boy\nAnd he wanted to commemorate Jimi Hendrix originally then this developed into this big museum with a controversial building by Frank Gehry some people hate the architecture's others love it\nHe um owns the Portland TrailBlazers down in Portland and the Seattle Seahawks he developed the Allen Institute for brain science and the Allen Institute for artificial intelligence he also has this other very cool museum it's called the flying heritage and combat armor museum\nWhich is a collection of vintage military aircraft tanks and other military hardware yes living computer museum that he built the the point about this is that so many people have the idea of why don't we take more money away from rich people pull out had more money than he needed and the answer\nThe energy and the creativity and the love with which he spends his money\nWas a a true factor about\nThe the success that he had with these various projects and most of them were quite successful and they made a difference the notion that the government could have spent this money better than Paul Allen\nI think is fallacious\nHe should rest in peace his sister and his other survivors should be comforted and his memory should be a blessing [noise] okay meanwhile there's a big new movie from the marvel comic books universe and it's just out on DVD is that a blessing or
