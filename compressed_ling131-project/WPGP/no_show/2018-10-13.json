also talk about another source of political unity for the United states which is a a complete contempt mean total content\nThan his share by Americans are black and white and Latino and Asian and rich and poor and living in the interior live on the coasts everybody shares can him for political correctness\nThis is something that is stunning and there is a new study that a yes or a monk over at Harvard has written about yes Harvard we'll we'll get to that in just a moment and uh\nThere's something else that uh I I think should unite Americans but maybe doesn't yet which is a fear of another impeachment crisis I mean Democrats are being more and more serious and more and more credible saying if we win the house of representatives and on the Senate\nWe're going forward with impeaching Brett Kavanaugh we're going forward with impeaching President Trump\nIs that a good idea will talk to one of the people who was central to the last impeachment crisis we had his name as a judge Ken Starr he uh was in charge of the investigation that led to the impeachment\nOf Bill Clinton\nWhat are the lessons for today's political world and one of the lessons for Robert Mueller who's playing the same kind of job that uh that that Ken Starr function in back in the Nineteen nineties one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\nOn this issue of political correctness first as there's this amazing piece in ah the Atlantic of all places in the Atlantic is not a conservative journal headline Americans strongly disliked dislike PC culture\nAnd this is stunning\nIn the way that it shows that hatred for contempt for resistance to political correctness brings together everybody\nHe um\n... what what they write about is this is if you look at what Americans have to say on issues such as immigration the extent of white privilege\nAnd the prevalence of sexual harassment there distinct clusters that emerge progressive activists traditional liberals passive liberal politically disengaged moderates et cetera et cetera okay one of the things is fascinating here is people who are traditional conservatives\nFar outnumber those who say they're progressive activists by twenty five percent or conservative eight percent or progressive activists\nBy contrast the two thirds of Americans who don't belong to either extreme constitute an exhausted majority their members share a sense of the tea with our polarized national conversation a willingness to be flexible and their political viewpoints and a lack of voice in the national conversation\nI think that's exactly right and you can count me uh yeah I I mean I I Would\nProbably be grouped together with the twenty five percent who are devoted conservatives they say traditional conservatives but they're certainly elements sometimes you feel like part of an exhausted majority\nAnd then they go on to write they say most members of this exhausted majority remember that's eighty percent of the public\nAnd then some dislike political correctness\nAmong the general population full eighty percent believe that political correctness is a problem in our country even young people are uncomfortable with it\nIncluding Seventy four percent between the ages of twenty four and twenty nine and of those under twenty four Seventy nine percent that means the\nPeople who most resent political correctness who think it's a problem in our country or the people are having a shoved\nDown their throats it's not working and why is this why is this resentments so common and by the way who what\nRacial group resents political correctness most remembers eighty percent of everybody\nYou think why people you are on the\nAh racial group that most resents political correctness as American Indians\nAre second or Hispanics Hispanics hate political correctness and agents\nThey hurried I'm political correctness or even more than white people do\nBlack people Seventy five percent resent political correctness think it's a problem in the country and this piece in the Atlantic quotes a forty year old American indian and Oklahoma who participate in a focus group is part of this project and it's an interesting\nProject but uh\nThis American indian again forty years old said it seems like every day you wake up something has changed you said Jew or Jewish is it a black guy or African American you have to be on your toes because you never know what to say so political correctness in that sense as scary\nThree quarters of African Americans oppose political correctness this means that they're only four percentage points less likely than whites and only five percentage points less likely than the average do believe that political correctness is a problem okay uniting blacks and whites and young and old\nCan we say no to political correctness\nAnd that goes for political correctness even in San Francisco and this is an amazing story about someone named Steve on don't say Steven his name is Steve on S. T. V. O. and\nHe is the new president of the San Francisco Unified School district and they've had a long standing tradition for the San Francisco Unified School district\nA tradition of I'm beginning each public meeting I saying the pledge of allegiance well no more instead\nThe first meeting that Steven Cook presided over as president of San Francisco in high school district sounded like this\nLike you tonight we start this me to get out of the claim American writer and activist Maya Angelou who wants to when you learn teach when you get give [noise]\nSection ... is accessibility to information for public section B. opening items approval of board minutes for September twenty fifth ... motion the second please Selma certain ...\nOkay and then they go forward and demeaning or no pledge of allegiance and instead a a phony quote why do I say it's a funny quote the Washington Post ... actually looked at this\nUm this quote that his allegedly from Maya Angelou the only source for believing that she ever said it was that Oprah Winfrey\nA\nSet at that Maya Angelou said it but there's no record that you have a road that are set it or anything like that and by the way what does it\nMean when you learn teach when you get give 'em a ... I'm\nNot sure what that means okay here's the story of Steve on cook he's a young man he grew up in public housing\nHe did very well in school he went to Williams College very exclusive high ranking liberal arts college in Massachusetts and um then he came back to San Francisco he's involved in a number of social initiatives and gum shelf life in the school board is now the school board president\nBut he said the um\nThe move dropping the pledge of allegiance and instead of calling Maya Angelou was not a demonstration in the vein of Colin Kaepernick another San Francisco bureau enclose a he says I was looking for creative ways to express admiration for the people that make the country what it is\nHe told the San Francisco ... chronicles of the current current political climate was disappointing and the Trump Administration has quote been attacking our liberties\nOkay\nYou can even say all kinds of things about the Trump Administration where it's been the Trump Administration been attacking liberties I hadn't heard that before what\nWhat liberties exactly is the Trump Administration attacked one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and then he said I don't spend much time thinking about President Trump\nYeah I think that's probably true\nHe says although there is a requirement that schools conduct a pledge or similar activity there is no such requirement for school boards that was a statement from the district spokeswoman whose name is Laura ... dead Nick and no one in the audience appeared to mind\nCooks new introduction of course not San Francisco and now they are planning on having other quotes from other worthy of to begin in a place of the pledge of allegiance those will include Harvey Milk James Baldwin\nToni Morrison the Wright brothers Abraham Lincoln and more um so what's wrong with this\nAnd what's wrong with a cross on a war memorials under attack we'll be right back on them eventually [noise]\nUh well he actually dissented from the majority opinion said nearly a century ago Marilyn citizens out of deep respect and gratitude took on the daunting task of erecting a monument\nTo mirror the measure of individual devotion and sacrifice these zeroes had so noble e achieved the panel majorities has their effort violates the constitution the soldiers fought to defend I respectfully\nThink otherwise it is outrageous\nAnd one of the points that has raised an important column by a Jeremy ... is one of the lawyers involved in this case is not too far away from this monument and Maryland is Arlington National cemetery\nAnd if this decision stands up it won't it's going to go to the U.S Supreme Court and there will be probably a seven to two decision against the stupidity the story here as private citizens decided to honor people from that community who died in World War one by creating a monument in their honor\nAnd putting it up with public subscriptions it was not using taxpayer money it was all paid for by donations they put up this monument to honor the war dead\nAnd now if this court decision stands the monument would have to be removed destroyed or defaced to a race to cross\nThis is outrageous\nAnd it's why the judicial issues are so important let's go to Rick in Los Angeles Rick you're on the Michael ...\nThanks so much Michael for taking my call it have a couple of points you know on this issue that you brought up first of all the gentleman at San Francisco who thinks that their freedoms are being attacked\nI I Love this about ... you know all you have to do now is this week with those views that they hold and all of a sudden it's become an attack right that's how they would know this is absolutely\nAnd the other examples you're bringing I mean you know thank our wonderful a higher education system we all we have this now hate America embarrassed for America anything old traditional like the constitution forget it\nThis is outdated now we have to form a New America which you know the almighty less phony moral list and Supreme they think they are they're going to shape the New America\nWhat you're ... you're exactly right but this gives us an opportunity and the opportunity is based upon this other study that I threw into the mix which is a very profound\nStudy will get to more of that it doesn't matter whether you're white or black or older young rich or poor or liberal or conservative Americans have had it up to secure with political correctness so time to rally the troops on this issue how we'll talk about is coming up with your calls him and that that show [noise]\nTwenty nine four five seven genes Seventy six so Michael ...

democratic move for impeachment impeachment Brett Kavanaugh impeachment of President Trump\nOr if you're concerned about what's happening with the Mueller investigation or if you're concerned about the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation\nThere is extremely relevant material on all of that in contempt\nIs subtitled a memoir of the Clinton investigation the author is Ken Starr and a judge star I've I've got to tell you this book is so reasonable it is so relevant and some of the revelations are\nMost sensational unsatisfying and uh the the book is posted at our website at Michael met that dot com in writing it and then the response to the book which has been overwhelming since has come out what surprised you most\nOf what surprised me very positive way is that uh the Clinton a spin machine has remained silent\nAnd I say I say and and I don't mean that to be unkind\nBut to the of the Clinton spin cycle is Howard Kurtz that at the Washington Post style but uh was extraordinarily busy and energetic and so let's say highly effective\nAt a uh taking issue with what seems to me to be indisputable and that is the facts and so I'm very pleased about that the other thing Michael I Would say is that there's so many eerie echoes from the past that we are hearing today and you mentioned to impeachment\nThat's very high on the list because as you though a impeachment was extraordinarily controversial in the nineties and yet some of those crying for impeachment now with some of the most of the sufferers voices saying how dare you are\nOn the book is called contempt a memoir of the Clinton investigation or Hillary Clinton doesn't come off are so very well in your book\nYes and uh you know turn the other cheek and uh and kindness to to others and so forth but it's just the facts and and and and the facts are are\nA and sort of the day new mall was when we and the investigation seriously considered presenting an indictment or to the federal grand jury and little log\nNaming Hillary Rodham Clinton alone for her crimes in connection with\nThe Little Rock Arkansas face of the investigation in addition a during the course of interviews with her at the White House\nShe stood in such complete contrast in terms of relational skills and the like with her spouse Bill Clinton who of course is immensely\nCharming and charismatic and a empathy at all the rest of it\nAnd she said as I say in the book seem to be just sort of deliberately in your face a A R massive a failure recollection not only strain credulity Michael we just did that\nBy the time we assessed all of her answers we knew that she was a she was lying under oath fainting or a failure recollection there was so colossal so profound that it's simply could not have been true\nOkay you clearly believe a and I know because you said this house where it would be a mistake to pursue for Democrats\nOr to pursue impeachment proceedings against a either a justice Kavanaugh who used to work with you or against President Trump or why why would that be such a destructive course for the country and and I mean you can relate that to some of the lessons in your book contempt\nYes Michael it goes back to the a structural protections built into the constitution to prevent mob rule and we heard Senator Cornyn during the Kavanaugh hearings so to speak about ... rule which\nSeemed to be the disorder of the day and the dystopia that we all experience done were stunned at\nThe founding generation wanted a and demanded a supermajority requirement in the Senate a simple majority of the house the people's house should put\nThe issue into play at their discretion so the majority can simply send articles over but then there needs to be a bipartisan consensus\nThat's the practical political message in the two thirds super majority requirement or embodied in our constitution so don't go there there's just\nNo reason there's no justification other than that to a further divide the country if that's the goal let's just divide the country even even more let's do what the Russians\nWere paying other ours amount of money and attention to to do and continue to do was just continue to sow discord a and rancor among the American people that would be the eventual a result\nAnd and I experience that and obviously we learn from our experiences and while I was not advocating impeached but I was simply putting the facts of the Clinton investigation\nBefore the house of representatives and while I thought it was a perfectly reasonable action by the house of representatives once the articles arrived at even before that it was very clear that the American people through the United States Senate was just they were not willing\nTo go so far as to upset and election over these clearly establish crimes\nNow

don't you think\n[noise] yes I think a resolution of censure condemning the president's\nAh crimes a violation of basic principles of the precepts of the rule of law would have passed overwhelmingly not unanimously but a overwhelmingly I think it would have exceeded a two thirds majority of cars were given a principled an elegant way out\nYeah and and ah why why was ... who made the determination because it wasn't you who made the determination not to accept a resolution of censure and then to go on with the people's business\nBut a number of arguments were fans to the fact that the

that's why he was appointed obviously there's the whole Manafort monitor the Rick Gates matter the indictments or the Russian individuals and organizations which really do touch on\nReason that he was

president and CEO of the job creators network and Alfredo you're in the midst of a national tour you're heading next to the American heartland to Indiana Ohio Michigan or what's the message\nThe message is that we have to make sure that we understand exactly what is at stake this is what we're calling they big choice election Michael and what does that make right or pay check your paycheck for your your your listeners matrix round about their jobs around about retirement savings account healthcare is all on the ballot\nThe market is up even with the small declines we've seen this week when people are starting to go oh my gosh it's all over the market is still a forty percent unemployment is at three point seven\nPercent the lowest rates in Nineteen sixty nine that Neil Armstrong Neil Armstrong walked on the mood\nRight we're going to be talking about because there's a new movie about that\nAnd uh [laughter] is that the idea that we could walk on the moon and Nineteen sixty nine but it was only then we had a comparably low unemployment rate that's that's pretty amazing ah\nIt really is Michael and people have to remember that understand that and remember specifically that the Democrats have said quite like a promise to work on repealing the tax cuts which is generating all the positive wonderful resolve that lead into this record unemployment and really record GDP Growth rate\nAnd what do you say to people because you hear this on the other side all the time hey are Democrats just want to raise taxes on rich people but that would actually mean tax relief for people in the middle and then the working class why are they wrong well\nSomebody who was heroic but understated an unassuming with a quiet and mysterious deaths and in the film the emphasize that part of the reasons\nFor that attitude was Neil Armstrong's life at least according to this film in the book that it's based on\nRelated to a family tragedy which is very dramatically portrayed on screen at the beginning of the film every one is remarkable in this movie in terms of performances clear for playing Neil Armstrong's Wife Jan\nA ... and she was a long suffering wife and she was somewhat skeptical of what he was doing she said she wanted to have a conventional life and instead here he is an astronaut risking his life constantly and that's one of the things that this film brings back\nA very dramatically I I live in Seattle is people know and we have a a museum of flight here and you can go there and you\nCan see some of these old space capsules that they actually use from the sixties and you look at them and they're incredibly small and rickety in dangerous and you think do you really want to get into that things of this giant rocket can really into space\nAnd yes people died in the space program and that's dramatized here two of the the scenes in which director Damien ... who previously did la la land with Ryan Gosling and before that did whiplash which also won an Oscar for Jk simmons well deserved\nIf he does such a superb job I mean truly superb job of dramatizing the space flight itself the training and the Gemini flights from the dangerous flights that came before\nIt's um it's it's one of these films where you cannot take your eyes off the screen\nIt is so riveting and by the way Jason her which provides a film score that his heroic that is stirring that his captivating and very knowledgeable there's even a little bit of a nod to two thousand one space odyssey during one of the Gemini sequences where they're trying to hook up in space\nOf the only reservation one can possibly have from the film is that it's not the kind of a real wake while we've done it totally satisfying triumphant conclusion you expect it's not the right stuff\nAnd uh ... what did shows also went emphasizes is it the space program had its elements of controversy or use your voices on screen about people who are questioning the value and the amount of money that we're spending on putting a man on the moon when we're going through very difficult times\nIn American urban neighborhoods\nBut with all of that the caring about the characters including Jason Clarke Jason ... what a year for him he was outstanding as Senator Ted Kennedy in a film about Chappaquiddick\nWere Chappaquiddick happened in virtually the same week as the moon mission with Neil Armstrong Jason Clarke plays astronaut at white who was one of the best friends of Neil Armstrong and he is outstanding to um ... by the way one quick word\nThere's been some controversy that's been ginned up\nTo some extent by conservative media I'm afraid about why they didn't show the American flag on the moon they do and I don't know whether they put that in because of the protests in controversy\nWith they don't show is they don't show a big scene where Neil Armstrong comes down in plants the American flag and I claim this land and the name of president Richard Nixon no that doesn't happen\nHowever there are American flags everywhere in this bill you see an American flag being raised you see the American flag patch on the shoulders of the astronauts on their uniform\nUh there are I I saw the film with rock star break Tomlin my producer and uh he counted fourteen different flags scenes so don't worry about that three and a half stars for a film that is rated PG Thirteen it's rated PG Thirteen for some very\nIntense scenes of danger I imagine that most people who see this film are going to love it as I did and the uh it it is part of the succession you could have an entire sequence now\nOf movies about space program heroic movies remember Apollo Thirteen with Tom Hanks hidden figures a couple of years ago and a ... and then of course the right stuff now\nFirst man or it is a very major Oscar contender as la la land was we will be right back putting it in perspective\nOne more minute did go to Michael meant that don't\nTen years and the research
