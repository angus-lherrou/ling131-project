Thursday um thank you so much for listening following me on Twitter at walls freedom\nHey a breaking news from our friends at alliance defending freedom listen to this\nJust yesterday the U.S department of education announced that acting complaints filed by our friends at ATF against the Decatur, Georgia city schools\nUm the U.S department of education is opening an investigation\nInto a horrible assault of a kindergarten her in her school bathroom a as a result of a boy you being a loud and the girls rushed him due to the school districts transgender bathroom policy Pasha Thomas who's little daughter was assaulted his understandably devastated\nMy daughter ... she was on classes as she acts to teach and so she can do to the that's\nThe light on my daughter's ... what happened to her and said devastated so angry betrayed playing out where they never thought you know who would think day when I'd want my child article I Would think that she was actually saw it in a bathroom landed up a little boy\nNow this just open investigation is only the latest case of alliance defending freedom standing up for the rights of men women\nAnd in this heartbreaking incident children all across America\nBut law suits and engaging over three thousand local attorneys all over America man that\nThat costs a lot of money you can help right now come on we've been raising money all week\nIt would be another president who was up there on Rushmore and no not\nWashington who is so great that he seems in approachable and almost like a statue and no not Jefferson with his complexities and as many flaws it would be that fourth Russia more present the president we celebrate today\nThat would be Theodore Roosevelt the all American Boy [noise]\nAnd then use it that you're hearing [noise]\nIt'll be a hard time and the old town tonight [noise] was used by Theodore Roosevelt as something of a theme song why Baker\nIt was used for his regiment of rough riders before they went to Cuba and the Spanish American war then played at virtually every rally until he got rather sick of it while he was running for governor of New York in Eighteen Ninety eight before he became president of course\nAnd I I Need to answer a couple of questions the very beginning first of all\nThe idea that I call him Theodore Roosevelt\nAnd uh not Teddy Roosevelt as he's often no\nWell that's because President Roosevelt always lose to the name teddy when he was a tiny boy he was called GD and he didn't like it and he never like being called teddy and he was declared anyone who calls me and he doesn't know me at all\nAnd I certainly hope that by the end of this broadcast you will know President Theodore Roosevelt well there is also great confusion about the pronunciation of his name\nThere are people who say Roosevelt and they will say Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt then there are other people say no no they know that Franklin said Roosevelt because we have all kinds of recordings of him saying but they'll say Theodore Roosevelt\nHe always said Roosevelt he very clearly did and I have become friends with President Roosevelt great granddaughter in other words her a grandmother was President Roosevelt daughter\nAnd I asked her is there any doubt at all that everyone in your family says Roosevelt she says no it's Roosevelt stop with the Roosevelt and then the last question about the title of this very special broadcast on the Michael ... show\nPulling him the all American Boy\nI I Do that because part of the fascination with President Roosevelt is his boy ... which lasted his entire life\nHe never quite grew up in fact one of the most famous statements about him was made by the British diplomat assess all spring rice who became a very good friend with President Roosevelt when he was the White House and he said you must always remember about the president\nThat he is about six\nAnd a there were others who are also impressed with his boy ... the only route the gray evidence who served NPR's cabinet um said on the president's forty six birthday\nYou said you've made a good start in life and your friends have great hopes for you when you grow up\nAnd then later six years later in uh Nineteen ten he uh greeted him on his birthday by writing Tim is after a President Roosevelt had been reelected Theodore you are still the same grade overgrown boy as ever\nAnd most movingly of oil and I just came across this stunning to me is former President Theodore Roosevelt humbled themselves and came to the White House to beg a favor\nOf the man who defeated him in his last race for the presidency Woodrow Wilson he he didn't like Woodrow Wilson he was referred to Woodrow Wilson as the real W W stood for weasel words which is quite a thing to say but he came to\nPresident Wilson in the White House in Nineteen Seventeen after American entered World War one\nAnd President Roosevelt begged him to allow the presidents he begged the president to allow him President Roosevelt to organize a regiment and lead a regiment at the front\nBecause he wanted to spend his own money to recruit people to get volunteers\nAnd and President Roosevelt time was in his late fifties he wasn't in perfect health and Wilson said no\nBut afterward he wrote this in his diary he is a great big boy I was charmed by his personality there was a sweetness about him that is very compelling you cannot resist the men\nAnd people felt that way about Theodore Roosevelt for most of his life and part of the reason that he remained an overgrown boy his entire lifetime was because his actual boyhood was at least for his early years so miserable\nHe had a terrible case of Assam as a child\nHe was born to a family of privilege otherwise he might not have even survive\nBut his family had come here with some of the original touch settlers in what was originally called New Amsterdam they came in the middle of sixteen hundreds\nAnd the family was always successful they were prosperous his father Theodore Roosevelt senior was a widely respected community leader and the successful importer of glass\nAnd generally a a very dedicated community minded businessmen\nAnd in terms of asthma\nA young ... as he hated being called a was too sick to attend school and his mother took him to various practitioners who attached mustard plasters at one point they massages his chest\nSo vigorously that it started to bleed he got electric shocks and none of it seemed to work\nThe only thing that worked\nWas the time he would spend in his father's arms\nAnd he remembered years later I could breathe I could sleep when he had me in his arms my father he got me breath I could sleep when he had me in his arms he got me lungs strength life\nIn some sense of what his childhood was he was considered well enough to go with his family when he was ten years old and they went on a grand trip of Europe and some of it was fun he kept a diary of a trip and it's amazing to read it\nFrom ten year old Theodore Roosevelt in Switzerland August twenty third he writes in the afternoon we threw paper balls at the waiter and chamber made an rushed around upstairs and downstairs to dodge them he's talking about his sister and his brother and himself than September twenty fourth Venice\nI was sick with asthma and did not sleep it on\nSeptember twenty six ... I was sick of the asthma I sat up for for success of ours and papa made me smoke a cigar to help me breathe\nThis was his reality and it was also his father Theodore Roosevelt senior who encouraged him to become the master of his own body\nAnd to work out with barbells a with very regular exercise to build up his body and his strength\nNow this is often exaggerated he he never became a truly a superb athlete but he did develop as he was growing up first of all he his height was was never on firing people think is Theodore Roosevelt does this towering figure\nHis height depending on which source you believe was somewhere between five eight and maybe as much as five ten it was probably five eight or five nine\nAnd that was not considered large for the time but when he went away to Harvard He took up boxing and she became\nObsessed with this physical culture and improving his body [noise] so how is it that this was sickly young man\nBecame America's most celebrated advocate of what he pulled the strenuous flight [noise]\nWill tell you more as we continue this special broadcast Theodore Roosevelt the all American Boy [noise]\nConfirmation so for these Democrats talk about um temperament or another talk about credibility\nUm [noise] you know it's it takes takes a lot of gumption when it comes to credibility judge Kavanaugh's way\nOne if you were speaking to a judge Kavanaugh I I Do believe you will be confirmed on Saturday probably with fifty one vote should maybe with fifty votes who who knows it could be fifty to a buddy will be confirmed and what would you advise him uh in order to\nTo rise above and and prevent ill and become the great associate justice of the Supreme Court that we both know we will be\nWhere I Am not going to be presumptuous and after two I think that you need my advice but I'll I'll say that uh we saw his judicial temperament and has been packet of ... legal mind for twelve years on the DC circuit when he was vindicated by the Supreme Court and unparalleled Thirteen times\nAnd we also saw in the last confirmation hearing that he was outraged about an outrageous process as well he should be and I have confidence that wants to use on the bench spring court hopefully he will be\nThat we will see the judicial temperament that we saw for the past twelve years we don't have to guess about what kind of judge Brett Kavanaugh will be\nIt'll be the same kind of judge has been for the past twelve years so I'm I'm looking forward to that I share your cautious optimism I understand uh you know it's it's the process is so farcical at times that it leads to sell it lends itself to jokes but\nBut I Do want to really you know he's serious that the people have been hurt Brett Kavanaugh has been hurt his family doctor for that they received death threats this process stinks\nAnd how do we fix it ... and that's the last question or that will have time for Justin Walker professor of law how we fix the process\nOf my good

the big picture questions more than just learnt civil procedure but at the Yale I've heard that they just they really learn how to solve the world's problems\nWell again this is a a gigantic problem and I want to get to that and get that with listeners because clearly this process is broken I mean everybody hates if this has not been a good moment for America\nLet me tell you one thing and I'm going to tell you this as soon as we come back from break\nI think one thing that every single American can do to help fix this process and to stop this madness for the future what is it will get to

and like everybody else I felt sympathy when I saw the testimony of Dr Ford I felt great sympathy for judge Kavanaugh who was seeing a distinguished and spotless career all of a sudden trashed over issues about his high school yearbook and other stupidity that's utterly irrelevant\nAnd watching all of that question is what do we do to fix the process because we really do need to get back to the sort of situation we had before where two justices who were confirmed unanimously\nYes Ruth Bader Ginsburg big liberal\nAnd yes Antonin Scalia one of the greatest conservative mine's ever to be on the

whether\nYou believe Blasey Ford or Kavanaugh regarding the sexual misconduct allegations I think that it should be investigated whether he liked to the Senate Judiciary committee has I think it's not credible\nHappened on definition of love and devil's triangle for example and I think okay\nHow how would you determine that\nHow by asking people who he hung out with for example mark judge\nOkay again in ... in order to that in order to demonstrate a lie you know as an under oath you would have to say you'd have to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Brett Kavanaugh said some things that he knew to be untrue\nI and ... the the idea that this is the best we've got right now I was I was commenting about this before Suzanne\nWay out of bounds or we will talk about this and all the matter is before us\nA with a a very veteran and season political observer\nOr Mike Huckabee who has been a friend of the show he is a long serving ten years governor of Arkansas where his enormously popular governor\nTo time presidential candidate a recovering or I guess perpetual Baptist pastor and by the way the star of Huckabee\nWhere TBN wrapped season one of Huckabee and this weekend show which is very popular is the most watched program on that network congratulations Governor Huckabee\nWell thank you very much Michael I have had an amazing year with the TV and show I'm loving it we do it in Nashville and uh we have a large theater that we produce the show and and it's just fun it's wholesome it's entertaining I tell people to just enough politics to keep it a current\nBut not so much that raises your blood pressure to three hundred over two hundred every weekend\n[laughter] that show is designed to give people something to relax about we have comedians even acrobats and music and a wide variety of things and I I think it's a show like television used to be and like I think it should be again\nOkay and uh I assume that this coming weekend you're not going to be debating the deeper meaning of devil's triangle and ... [laughter]\nI Will probably not even try to to find what ... means right ah we've really lowered ourself or in a new way when the members of the Senate Judiciary committee\nOr try to interpret a sixteen year old musing a in a high school yearbook it's beyond anything I've ever seen\nBy the way there are a a serious as a serious letter to the Judiciary Committee by ... and his association of alumni of Georgetown Prep\nAs to the real honest to goodness meaning of devil's triangle we will get to that I don't want to take your time for it but\nLet me ask you this governor I eat you were of course earlier in life a very successful Baptist pastor or are you richly encouraged by the newfound democratic uh eagerness to make war on alcohol abuse\nOr you know listening to some of the Democrats last week I thought I was listening to the reincarnation of carry nations\nAnd uh I was expecting them to all bring out an ax and go and and a tear down the saloons\nOf DC I I've never seen church hypocrisy in my life\nAnd it was it was embarrassing to watch and and to realize that the same party that are covered over people like Ted Kennedy and Chris Dodd who once took a waitress at a restaurant in DC and literally through her on to a table while they were in a drunken state\nNever got charged for it humiliated the four young lady ah the the party of those kind of ethics uh would dare\nTry to ah to tell a Brett Kavanaugh that what he did in high school and then his college days made him on fit to be on the Supreme Court\nYou I I Know in both your races for the presidency one one of the themes that that you stressed was trying to bring America together\nAnd to heal some of the bitterness and they renew will of the spirit the spirit of Brotherhood and amity and right now they're just I'm a part of the news coverage is the literally thousands of anti Kavanaugh demonstrators in protests were swarming over Capitol Hill\nWhat would you say to people like that assuming that we when victory or on this confirmation this weekend\nWell I Would quote to them two of their favorite a political figures I Would quote Iraq Obama who reminded us a rather bluntly that elections have consequences and he's right\nAnd then I Would remind them of the words of Hillary Clinton in October twenty six dangerous before the election when she said that it would be a real threat to our constitution and to our democratic system if someone lost the presidency and refused to accept the results of the voters\nAre these are two very important things that I Would love for uh people on the left to think about it and don't take my word for it or take the word of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama\nBecause Michael I Believe that the fundamental underlying issue that we've seen over the last few weeks with this Kavanaugh issue and frankly over the entirety of Donald Trump's presidency is\nIf you want to speak for the demonstrators if you share some of their anguish and their occupation of the heart atrium Senate office building I clearly if they're going to try to disrupt the business the United States Senate they will have to be cleared away and arrested\nAnd what is it they are

to be an indication of the following\nA Joe mansion by the way he's doing fine and his reelection bid I Hope he does not get reelected I Hope that Patrick Morrisey who's the attorney general west Virginian will be a find US Senator defeats Joe mansion\nBut the polls show that he's running while I had a I think he would\nSecure his re election if he voted yes on Kavanaugh because Kavanaugh's nomination is popular in West Virginia Trump carried West Virginia by forty points\nBut um my\nGuess is this is somehow two of the three Republicans vote in the wrong direction that Susan Collins and Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski of two of the three of those vote no\nUm than ah\nThan mansion would be the deciding vote\nBut if two of the three Republicans vote yes then mention mentioned is just the gravy he's just I'm a frosting on the cake\nAnd I think she will vote yes because it will help him politically in a won't cost the Democrats anything they won't be angry at him the one thing that I think is normally likely is on the anti Kevin I'm protesters\nSpelling stop him with their bodies in front of the court house\nWhich court house I was in Portland, Oregon I see okay great I the ...

why I I think I'll ever have\nMe too [noise] going on right now women right literally all her heart\nIs that someone says look I I get to decide a lot of things as a justice of the Supreme Court but I don't get to make new legislation or create or discover new rights that no one ever suspected existed before\nThat's refreshing and it's worth supporting\nAnd I think it's um it's very much a force in unifying the Republican Party the Republican Party hasn't been so unified on any issue not even the tax cuts though they did go through\nThis issue I think is unified conservative sentiment across the board number one because Brett Kavanaugh is a good man and an outstanding judge who either way who's judgment of been affirmed by the Supreme Court in the past\nAnd the record number of them is a been\nA very successful judge so far he's a good man the other reason is unified the Republican Party is because the Democratic assault\nHas been so despicable and it has been despicable and childish and demeaning\nI Do think there's going to motivate Republicans to turn out to care about this election and it should\nAnd with any hope it all it after all the hysteria will discourage Democrats\nThe

I never would it be ...\nI dunno we're losing a little bit are you there\nOkay I I'm Sorry I didn't mean to cut you off um your your phone dropped out look I I I Do think this is fundamental a because if if Kavanaugh's nomination is denied ... if it is blocked I think it would\nBe a an electoral disaster for Republicans and a Democratic House for anything that any conservative claims to care about how was the Democratic house an advantage how does it help you you may be alienated from a given candidate there are some Republican candidates\nBut you know what they're Republicans and is important to maintain that house control we'll be right back [noise]\n\n\nHey this is Michael my bed for American federal rare coin and bully and if you bought or sold gold coins and bully and then you know that many dealers claimed to be competitive when they're selling the coins and they claimed that pay top dollar when they're buying but how do you know is their claims are even true American federal has been in business for thirty seven\nYears and I can tell you from personal experience they really do pay more fair coin don't be fooled by other dealers who claimed to pay the highest prices it's usually just a ploy\nTo get you into their office so they can trade you up the coins that are heavily marked up it may seem like these other dealers are offering to pay more but in reality they're overcharging you want to trade American federal will always give you a from cash prize when buying your coins then if you want to purchase gold silver other coin\nYou'll buy them at American federal wholesale price no inflated claims just true top dollar before you accept an offer anywhere else called American federal rare coin and bullying called toll free eight hundred to two one seven six nine for that eight hundred to two one seven six nine four or American federal dot com American federal dot com\nPeople come in with health concerns and we try to address those at the root cause at the medicine Trump's in Oakland hills nurse practitioner Joyce give has conducted over three thousand consultations with pharmacists mentor and friend Joe DiMaggio\nI actually my nurse practitioner and family practice and I always wanted to practice getting to the root cause is in family packs I finally got his giving a pill for the ill always pharmaceutical base you really get to the main problem that caused the symptom visiting example of you have heartburn there's many reasons for acid reflux heartburn and\nSome of those reasons can be not enough I Do chlorine gas it where traditional medicine blocks that and as we age our body typically doesn't even make enough as it said to break down our food a lot of people want to get off their ... and we had little protocol to wean that very slowly so they don't have rebound heartburn\nCall for a consultation today the medicine shopping mountain hills eight eight eight eight six five Ninety five Ninety five the average person considers estate planning just for the wealthy attorney Michelle Conti host of counties loan on a steep planning for the everyday person there's a lot\nThat goes into it and people take more time picking out what car they're going to buy where they're going to go to dinner as opposed to what\nTo my children state will dictate who gets why if you don't indicate to is to recede yourself\nOn your passing we want to make sure we planned appropriately so that they get the best of both worlds they continue to receive the benefits and they get the inherent in the other thing you have to think about is planning we tried to be proactive in the approach\nThat we minimize any type of tax consequences when somebody dies depending on the value of the state these taxes range anywhere from four and a half\nTo forty percent so we try to make sure that the beneficiary or Steve as much as they legally are able to\nHear more on countries last Sunday Morning at eight thirty here on the answer for immediate help visit county law P.

telephone into an instrument of an event [noise]\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number [noise] we try to privilege disagreeing phone calls every day every hour of Michael methods show but today this hour on Thursdays we limit ourselves to\nCalls that disagree I think it's quite natural the today on the eve of a historic vote really the most important vote of the Trump Administration so far\nAt the evil that vote or it's going to be natural than many of our calls are going to be people who disagree with me about Brett Kavanaugh I Believe that he will be a great justice of the Supreme Court I Believe he will and should be confirmed\nIf you disagree you can send us a disagreeing tweet\nI have been somewhat prolific on Twitter on this issue and uh you can access us on Twitter where and Medvedev show on Twitter that that ... show or you can call us at one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six of the state of play at the moment\nIs of Chris Coons the senator from Delaware who's been\nHe actually is a good friend of Jeff Flake of Arizona and it was they together who added this extra week to the process so the FBI could complete his investigation which they did\nLast night the Republicans are pointing out that there is nothing new in the investigation which is a vindication of Brett Kavanaugh the Democrats are claiming as was entirely predictable that the investigation is incomplete and it's insufficient\nThe whole point of the investigation was not to find new information\nIt was to make Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski the three wavering Republicans feel\nComfortable enough with\nHaving given the process some time and some information and getting reports from witnesses particularly mark judge who was interviewed by the FBI extensively to get enough information from these people so they can feel comfortable voting to sustain\nThe Republican Senate majority which means voting to confirm Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd uh I Believe and and certainly hope an ardent lead pray that all three of the wavering Republicans perhaps joined by Joe Manchin of West Virginia will vote for confirmation\nGiving him a a victory or by probably a vote of fifty two forty eight maybe fifty one to forty nine if you disagree with me that this is a\nA positive development and will help our politics he'll and I think it will\nI honestly believe that it will help America move in the right direction if you disagree with that you can give us a call it is disagreement day one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nTo ... to give us an example of the kind of thing\nThat I think the American people will be voting to reject the Senate voting to reject first and then the American people in November's election listen to a Chuck Schumer the Democratic minority leader I think he will be returned as minority leader of the U.S Senate\nHe um he said this this morning when he was responding to the FBI investigation\nMany fears that this was a very limited process that would constrain the FBI from getting all the facts having received a thorough briefing\nOn the documents those fears have been realized for second I disagree having received this\nA briefing on all of the documents\nDisagree with Senator Grassley statements that there was no hint of misconduct\nWe are reiterating our call given how limited\nThis these documents were and how limited the scope of this investigation was\nWe are reiterating or call\nThat the documents with proper reduction be made public\nWhy should all of America sees\nAnd second we are reiterated more call to make the directive that the White House and counsel McGahn sent to the FBI\nBecause we believe it greatly constrained V. investigation from the get go\nOkay ah ah investigate investigate investigate I've I think one of the things that his clarifying about this whole process\nIs that it is giving people a little bit of a taste of what America would be like if the Democrats do take control of the house of representatives if you like this\nIf you like hearing from a various aggrieved Democrats making wild accusations trying to a practice the politics of personal destruction\nTrying for a massive and comprehensive investigations of what the terms blue thing in devil's triangle really meant to high school students or Nineteen eighty two if you believe this is the kind of endeavor\nIn which our representatives in Congress should be engaged I Know most of the Democrats\nAnd cause you'll be getting lots and lots and lots more of this and they win this thing ... one of the reasons that I think that Republicans have been so unified and so energized by this whole process\nIs because there's an understanding people right now they're not attacking Donald Trump Donald Trump I mean he attacks back and he says things sometimes that are stupid\nSays things sometimes that are not true but that is not Brett Kavanaugh for goodness sake\nBrett Kavanaugh's entire record is one of mainstream conservatism of judicial excellence of support from people who don't agree with them building coalitions and that's exactly why they're afraid of him on the Supreme Court\nJudge Kavanaugh has a good relationship with Elena Kagan an Obama appointee associate\nJustice of the spring court how do we know because she says so she was the one when she was dean of Harvard law school who appointed Brett Kavanaugh to change their\nAnd if they are going to go after Brett Kavanaugh who does build coalitions who works with other people who has a life long record\nOf impressing people positively men and women and black and white and liberal and conservative if they're going to go after Brett Kavanaugh and make him into some kind of cartoon villain make him into some\nOf serial rapist stumbling drunk I mean none of this is true\nAnd it's the worst kind of politics it's despicable politics and people talk about is that the democracy this kind of politics is more of a threat to democracy than all of President Trump's stupid tweets combine then there are plenty of stupid tweets and\nThe idea that a President Trump is going to permanently alienate female voters it's it's not true President Trump in the last election won a majority of white female voters\nSurely didn't win as big majorities Romney did\nBuddy won a majority and\nThe the idea that that the Democrats are trying polarization to separate eight women\nOut and say ... women have to vote like women see how that worked for Hillary Clinton ... it and the answer is it didn't and I believe that this democratic strategy is divisive\nAnd awful\nAnd ah that the American people are waking up to its dangers\nAnd to um to to try to to stop it here here's a disagreeing email that came in from Brian in Compton, California\nOr his message to me is judge K guilty where there is smoke there's fire you Republicans whitewash everything\nIt's clear as a twenty year investigator for the state which includes sexual assault cases rape et cetera I interviewed over thirty plus pick another candidate Andrew BS comment about his demeanor court versus private that's ridiculous my comment\nWas is she was at the committee as a witness not as a presiding judge\nThere is no evidence and all that as a presiding judge or as someone functioning in a courtroom nasty he has never shown any problems with his temperament\nIs a functioning alcoholic pick somebody else\nHe set himself he is now we didn't\nBiased really\nAnd you are going to make him a judge long is the biases for your side it's fine these are the fax cover up deceit\nNo hearing from Merrick Garland there we go that shows your bias and lack of fairness nothing can beat that [noise]\nUm [noise] I again not Merrick Garland good man by the way somebody who's been a good judging will continue to be a good\nJudge on the appellate court we'll be right back disagreement day on that show\nIt it you know that there is one of the things that is appalling in this country and that we need to continue to make progress on we've made some progress\nIs the high rate of crime against black people but nearly all of that\nPrime nearly all of it or the overwhelming majority and it's over Ninety percent is perpetrated by other black people and that was the reason that I was speaking about that now let me go to your point about judge Kavanaugh\nDo I know that he is telling the truth or in in terms of his denials about what happened allegedly to Dr Ford I don't know for certain diseases telling the truth\nBut I think the absence of any confirming evidence at all\nIs overwhelming and the whole way that her accusations against him came out or very suspect\nAnd ... and by the way it is impossible to remove this from a political context and the reason I feel so outraged about judge Kavanaugh is he really did appear to be the ideal nominee I don't know and I've never met him\nBut I Do know people who have worked with him closely and they have the highest regard for him including people who are only a left\nUm al ... who was a guest on this show recently is a professor of law at Yale who has had interaction with the judge Kavanaugh in the classroom and otherwise\nAnd he's a liberal he was very active in the Hillary Clinton campaign he strongly supports judge Kavanaugh's nomination and the notion\nThat he should be blocked from the Supreme Court\nBased on auto early unsupported unprecedented\nAccusations against him seems to me a profound wrong because one of the things that you know about people who are sexual predators real sexual predators and people who commit sexual assault and rape and and uh and violence against women\nMost of those people do it as a pattern is on a one off and\nThe idea that the other accusations against a judge Kavanaugh other than a Dr Ford are completely non credible and have been clearly denied or that I think is worth taking into consideration of coming up [noise]\nVery prominent Republicans speaks to\nA group of protesters that going to be women [noise]\nAny urges those women to grow up\nIs that an outrage we'll play the

to the United states are stretched it on the minister ration of President Bush Iraq Obama and I was there for just under a year when I was recruited back to the city of Atlanta\nBuys the honorable America say Murray and two thousand and ten and I served him faithfully for five years until I was terminated in January of two thousand and fifty\nOkay this whole story your whole story is a great American story and it's a great story of public service and success how how is it you ended up\nWhether you are say or terminate you were fired was it wasn't because of something that happened in the line of duty what was it that led to your alright\nWell a\nA year prior to my termination I had published a book that I had written on my own time\nAnd self publish for Christian men the book is called who told you that you were neck and if the question that got ask Adam in the garden to eat and ... and I say that because a lot of people don't connect that question with genesis chapter three birth eleven so\nAh so the book is titled who tells you that your neck it overcoming the stronghold of condemnation and uh so that happened a year before I was suspended ah but the reason why I was terminated was cause I spent a few paragraphs explaining God's purpose for sex\nAnd marriage and that God created a sex for procreation and and and for the pleasure between a husband and why and how they match 'em on it and that any sex outside of that\nA is a fan and ultimately that's what cost me my childhood dream come true fairy tale career\nOK Now let's get history you have these opinions with your opinions and literally hundreds of millions of Americans share and you weren't trying to impose these opinions on some of your men and the fire department where you\nKnow are not at all\nSo it it was the fact is you self published the book you had any public funds what business is a of the city of Atlanta\nOr the mayor of the city council or anybody or what the fire chief does on his personal time as long as it's not disgraceful what was the argument for using a passage\nIn your book to ruin your career\nWhere their position was that those positions those views conflict it with the city views are and that I can have those views as much as I Want but when I was an employee of the city\nOr I had an obligation to check those beliefs that the door is what one council members fit and the mayor clearly supported that position\nOkay at this point uh this I think most people are listening to us or slapping therefore has I think this is just clearly unjust and when people suffer
