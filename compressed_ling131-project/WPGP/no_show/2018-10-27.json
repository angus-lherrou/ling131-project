nine Seventy nine or good walls freedom dot com and click on the ATF ban or\nJump on the president the United states or to jump on people in the mainstream media or to jump on one party or another party or this one or that one and say boy did you ever get it wrong boy is this terrible boy are you to blame I ah\nI I Want to try to avoid that\nBecause honestly we have every reason to celebrate of the country and President Trump has been speaking recently about the need to come together and to see things in harmony and to see things as Americans not as Republicans or Democrats or pro Trump or their anti Trump or his\nBut basically to look at this thing citizens and when you look at this thing uh this has been\nRemarkable and one of the things in it\nYou literally just moments before I got on the air here I put out a tweet that said look this should remind everybody of how lucky we are\nTo have people in place like yes Jeff Sessions and yes Christopher Wray the head of the FBI and yes all of those extraordinary people who work every single day sometimes putting their lives on the line\nTo keep us safe through the FBI and the rest of law enforcement\nThrough the New York city police do the local Florida police we just had a um a moment with Jeff Sessions are announcing the arrest if you haven't heard it and you probably have but Caesar say all coups fifty six years old\nWho um it at least as far as I can gather has known employment\nAppears to have been living in his van and yes his van is festooned with all kinds of a political a bumper stickers and posters it's actually kind of artfully designed\nBut the messages on the van are insane and a despicable and dare I say it deplorable\nIn any event he was a arrested today taken into custody he's having multiple charges filed against him\nIs being interrogated in what they call a national security exemption in other words they can't interrogate him without an attorney present dinner fear I think that what they're trying to do is to determine\nWhether or not he had any accomplices or had any associates and he doesn't appear to a a guy with a very very long criminal history\nA guy who as I mentioned may or may not have been living in his van recently uh before that during another very serious criminal charges in during another bankruptcy that he declared he was living with his mom\nAnd I'm at ... we're not talking about a an ... an upstanding or model citizen and when you look at pictures of the van\nI you know I think about this because my most important role in the world is that right and that's true for probably many many of the males who were listening to me\nAnd I was looking at the pictures of the van with all the messages on it and literally you can't see out the windows because the windows are totally covered with top youth soccer recruits for Trump drain the swamp dishonest media CNN sucks\nI'm hard rock weekly or they have\nA seminal hard rock weekly now this has led to some confusion I think because people are saying well he may or may not be Native American I think the seminal there is not a reference to the tribe it's a reference to the football team\nOr to the um uh Florida State Seminoles I Believe it is in any are there are also pictures of Michael Moore and Hillary Clinton and I believe in the van\nJones a with a targets on their faces and that's not good but in any event I ... when I was trying to imagine is think if you have a daughter\nAnd somebody's coming up to pick up your daughter in front of the house and he's driving a vast like like if it's ... I mean I'm I Know somebody is is it okay if I say who it is Greg it's you or who has suggested a that any any time\nThe police spot a van or a car or any kind of people with more than six bumper stickers they ought to investigate it immediately\nIn any event this uh this is a sort of a tip off to where he was coming from but this is the way Jeff Sessions sounded this morning and by the way I Hope that this leads to President Trump and all the rest of us\nAppreciating the attorney general a little bit more appropriate here's the attorney general of the United states\nSo I Am pleased to participate in this amount that I suspect is in the custody of the FBI I Want to remind everyone up to defend it in this case as in every case is innocent until proven guilty he's been charged to die\nWith five federal crimes including hamster state transportation an explosive illegal mailing of explosives\nThreats against former president ... certain other person's threatening interstate communications and assaulting current and former federal officers for these charges a defendant faces up to fifty eight years in prison\nThese charges may a change or expand as the investigation for ...\nThis is the law and order administration we will not tolerate such lawlessness especially not political by\nOkay good for him or he's he's exactly right and you don't want the president spoke beautifully this morning no I mean it\nAh the Twitter feed probably best ignored but uh his speaking this morning was solid he uh he was speaking to a great group and they were so enthusiastic and he was bonding with him so well it was a moving occasion\nHe was speaking to turning point USA's young black leadership summit and it's it's ironic I just this morning I left um Minneapolis I left the hotel this morning at five\nAnd five AM and I wrote to the airport with my friend and colleague Larry Elder who was on his way to precisely this young black leadership summit\nAnd a here's what the president sounded like with the announcement before he began what was a very successful and a fine speech to the uh people who are attending that someone who is the president the United states\nI'd like to begin as you are leaders that's a real leaders I'd like to begin today's remarks by providing an update\nOn the packages and devices that have been male too high profile figures throughout our country and a media organization I Am pleased to inform you that law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody\n[noise]\nCredible job by law for us we've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation finds that person or persons responsible\nFor these events these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country\nI was struck the authorities to spare no resource or expense and finding those responsible and bringing them to swift and certain justice [laughter]\nWe will prosecute them him her whoever it may be\nOf the law okay a good for you Mr President and then he went on to say this\nMuch never allow political violence to take root in America come up with a half ago and I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president just stop it\nI've just concluded a briefing with the department of justice following the apprehension of the suspects\nI Want to applaud the FBI Secret Service department of justice the U.S attorney's office for the southern district of New York the NYPD and all law enforcement throughout the entire country credible partners these people have worked so hard\nAnd to have done it so quickly it's looking like a a you're looking it's a needle in a haystack how do you do this so quickly they've done an incredible incredible job but I Want to congratulate\nThe president of\nThe United states and this is a fine moment for President Trump and I know he didn't ah that that's so said the DNA on the saliva on the stamps from the packages with this guy personally but he's in charge you know things went wrong he would get blamed\nIt isn't this something worth celebrating and and what is it on what basis would you attack the Trump Administration on this issue\nThis seems to

on the planet Michael\nAnd on the Michael ... show I've referred a couple\nOf times on this show to um [noise] things that President Trump has tweeted that I think are not constructive uh this is a tweet from a couple of days ago before they saw this a crime\nThe series of crimes actually President Trump tweeted a very big part of the anger anger capitalized we see today in our society has caused by the purposely falls and inaccurate reporting\nOf the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news is gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description\nAnd\nThen he says mainstream media must clean up its act fast and fashionable capitalize with an exclamation point\nUm\nWhat's my big problem there just one word\nWhich is purposeful\nPurposely falls and an accurate reporting\nIn other words this is not to say that there isn't an accurate reporting there is not say there was a blast reporting there is but the idea that it's\nPurposely falls that as part of a conspiracy that\nI honestly journalists don't go into the business and this is true for people on Fox News as to where people on CNN it's to va right and left you don't go into the business of journalism or commentary to get things wrong\nDoesn't help your career it's embarrassing\nAnd the prospect as he will be going away for some forty eight years but meanwhile the president the United states charged as\nEarlier today and I think in an appropriate and dignified way with the necessity of people actually coming together and transcending some of the bitterness and viciousness of our politics recently\nAnd I want to speak to you for a few moments or with a friend and somebody who I I view as a very significant ally for constitutional causes his name is Michael Ferris he has the president the c._e._o. and general counsel of the alliance defending freedom\nAnd uh and and Mike we were just talking off the air for a moment\nUh I think we agree that one of the essential elements of trying to\nTo reduce the levels of polarization and hostility and viciousness and meanness and craziness that has afflicted American politics\nIs to affirm freedom of speech and freedom of conscience freedom of faith and that's exactly what the alliance defending freedom as about we agree with that proposition wins you\nSure the the historical American position has been I may disagree with everything you say but I'll defend the right to say it\nAnd we're losing a left in particular although there are so in the right but the left with livers our like in the jak Philips case where they tried to shut down or should they didn't want to use his creative skills to speak a message in favor of same sex weddings\nAnd the California case that we did is we were last year were California to force her life centers to give a pro abortion message people aren't willing to let people have their own opinions and say them freely\nAs at you down can we go to the California case for a moment because I follow that very closely and it was extraordinary an extraordinary victory it seems to me for the alliance defending freedom\nA this was I I've spoken several times for fundraising backwards for um for crisis pregnancy centers and what crisis pregnancy centers tried to do is to give people an alternative\nIn a crisis pregnancies where a very often people are on Mary they have no funds\nThat rather than terminate the pregnancy getting an abortion or that the centers will help you ... a bear the child raising the child and and deal with all the challenges involved\nAnd they were being forced by legislation in California to put up signs that said if you want abortion services [laughter] go go to this address go here go there um and that's about right isn't it\n[laughter] yes I'm I argued the case in the Supreme Court myself you got it exactly right California's real brag to either papers passing a law that this is a part of their progressive vision to ensure that the correct pro abortion message was given everywhere\nIncluding these charitable private crisis pregnancy centers that were set up by donations from people who are pro life\nYeah exactly and so the they were not willing to let people have a different opinion on abortion if if you're on\nOur side of the issue of the other side of course wasn't required to print the Planned Parenthood has not affected by this law it was only they claim that the only one that all women to have views well it didn't work that way\nRight and and be a cause just to get this so people see it so clearly in other words you would have been fine with is is that a Planned Parenthood day and said well if you want an alternative to abortion then go to a crisis pregnancy center\nIn equal actually I Would have ... I Would take the position that Planned Parenthood shouldn't be forced to give our message and we shouldn't be\nForced to give the pro abortion message but the the lack of a quality shows what the real problem here is is that people want to silence\nViewpoint that they don't agree with and I think that that's that's where the lack of civility is really coming in as it were saying that the other people don't even have a valid point of view I mean we can\nAre you saying you know you're you're entitled to express your view and saying I agree with your view and you know it's it's okay to disagree in this country but to some people are not allowed to disagree anymore and they will silence you disagree with the progressive viewpoint\nWhat uh what is the story going on right now with Blaine Adams and who is a proven does promotional T shirts a case\nCases pending in Kentucky Supreme Court [noise] um the local officials there went after him because he wouldn't T shirts with a gay pride to them\nAnd he will print teachers for any person but he will deliver messages there's other messages these turned down over the years\nHe found them another T shirt shop to deliver the exact same shirt and the exact same price but that wasn't good enough it wasn't that if you wanted to be entitled to have their shirts which they clearly God\nThey wanted to have a pound of flesh to go with it and so they're trying to punish plant outage and hopefully we won that case in the Kentucky court of appeals\nUm hopefully that'll be affirmed in the Kentucky Supreme Court if if not we'll be taking that case the sprinkler the states I I just\nSaw an unbelievable number um how how many uh different uh attorneys do you put out in the field to defend these cases with with the ATF the alliance defending freedom\nWell we have a sixty attorneys on staff and three thousand allied attorneys that um volunteer their time sometimes it reduced rates sometimes absolutely free um but we have a big team that are willing to come in and help Christians and other people all over the country\nWho have real religious freedom and freedom of speech problems\nWell that's a that's a very a very significant um army if you have the three thousand volunteer attorneys and by the way we're we're talking to you because right now today is friday we are going into the weekend you will feel great and you'll have more reason to celebrate and feel grateful over the weekend\nIf you can do something to um\nLet's say help the alliance defending freedom go to our website at Michael midday dot com you can read more about their fascinating work and some of these important cases\nAnd see what this great organization led by Michael ...

they found all\nOrganizations all all groups are supposed to be on equal basis as it turns out normally equals not equal\nThe pro life groups was denied any funding for speaker but the gay and lesbian groups received over about a quarter of a million dollars round numbers\nLayaway a quarter of a million dollars for eight years and all\nThe other groups combined received in around thirty thousand dollars\nIt's so the groups that are pushing the progressive\nMessage really two groups received the Y. insuring my in this is money taken from every student in student fees just like a tax on public school and college campuses\nSo so what what are you suing for what the relief you're seeking for Nathan ...\nWhat we're seeking a equality relief for open mic on these kinds of cases\nIs the end the practice of collecting student fees for for these kind of purposes that they just need to stop there there are being administered and such uneven fashion that they become nothing more than a propaganda tool for the last it's students of all stripes that are being forced to fund these propaganda machines\nOkay it's so important to get updated on all this stuff you can find information on

our parents or grandparents or great great grandparents to come to this country\nAnd we benefit and we inherited this yes it has inherited if you're born in the United states the chances are very large that you have at least one generation maybe two maybe three maybe ten generations of people who work very hard for this country and that gives you\nMore of a right than people born abroad to enjoy the blessings of this country isn't that basic isn't that sensible one\nEight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nAnd then Megan McCarthy concedes a truly open borders policy has no constituency in the American electorate but it's the implicit philosophical framing of most news media stories on immigration\nWhich tend to focus on the Mike Rowe problems of the individual not the macro problem of just how many of those individuals the country can admit\nShe says this\nIs easy to say no of course we can't let in every single person wants to come because doing so would transform this country\nInto one the few Americans or any political persuasion would want to live in the United states would be vastly more unequal and income and opportunity migrants would languishing the kind of squalid poverty\nThat the United states hasn't seen for a century in numbers a doubling of the U.S population is probably a conservative estimate that would defeat any conceivable tax and transfer program\nOkay this is the core argument simply allowing people in\nIs a disaster for the country and it's not a a blessing for the people who are allowed in because by encouraging more and more and more and more immigration with no limit\nWhat you're doing is undermining undermining the vitality and prosperity and opportunity that those people\nAre coming to pursue in the first place\nOne eight

I mean you may have just mentioned it but\nThere are obviously traveling through other you know Mexico depending on where they're coming from but it's like\nWhat your weight your or medically and what can we do immediately\nOkay well first of all Mexico has not been terrible on this and even President Trump has agreed that the new the new president of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has a ... agreed\nTo some level of cooperation they want to discourage these people from going through Mexico and the numbers of apparently declined recently but I've been cut in half\nWhich means that maybe half of these people have are gone and the other direction or split off from the caravan or or finding some places to stay in Mexico it seems to me this is an area where government can cooperate with and work closely with\nPrivate charities and they're all kinds of private charities that could take it among themselves to greet these people on the Mexican side of the border before they get into the United states and say hey\nWe're going to help you get back home and when you get back home we're going to help put your feet on the ground and we're going to help work with you I I Know that the charities that we support\nActually do things like building wells in a village which can make a huge difference I'll tell you what makes a huge difference in a village\nWere in a city in Central America is continuing to help the local law enforcement\nSo that it's not a situation where people are shot in the street all the time and it's it's much better to invest\nMoney in that it seems to me\nThen invest money in the process of simply a letting people end of the United states and then processing them and then sending them back and taking some\nTry to dry up\nThe attraction of coming here and the other aspect and and this has to happen with immigration for must\nIs workplace enforcement so that people don't think I can just come into the United states and whether I'm legally accepted or not I'll find work we should make it very very difficult for people to work here in the United states who do not have the legal right to be here\nLet's go to Dan in Columbus ohio you're on the Michael ...\nHey Mike or just want to say thanks first of all for not only having an emotional point of view of having a rational point of view what's the point of view that I feel like the lap off the lax and even if you lived in the you're limited to the article earlier today\nUm it's such they'll rational argument I mean I can make this I could draw the same comparison to say you know it's so and so was I was born into more wealth than I was therefore I should have access to their finances which is of you know maybe the law has but at the end of the day\nThey have to come to the conclusion that there's a rational side of the argument that they often fail to see or understand and I think\nYou know even if you look into it a little further you would simply relate to the point that there's this emotional side of them or for whatever reason they feel like they have to solve all the world's problems\nYou know what it is I think it's a lot of it as guilt is in other words people look at themselves and I think look here I Am in America and I live in a great country and things have gone well for me and ... for my parents and my grandparents\nAnd they don't understand that by states hang the point of view that we think everybody in the whole world is is entitled to what I Am a that would actually undermined precisely those things about our country that we value and I know\nThat our country does have a tradition of mercy and acceptance and integration an American as a nation\nBut not on on on limited basis and the idea that you should be able to inherit some of the credit that you were approached janitors have expended\nFighting for this country and building this country that is profoundly rational I appreciate your call we'll be right back\nMichael ...

be a film that you will want to see uh I Do not know what kind of film they're going to make\nAbout Caesar say on who suddenly is one of the most famous people in the country he of course is the fifty six year old a Florida resident\nWho was just arrested earlier today and is being interrogated and being charged with the series of fourteen bomb packages that he dispatched to do all kinds of famous liberal folks\nAnd I'd Jeff Sessions the attorney general of the United states announced the arrest or just a couple of hours ago listen\nWhy employees to participate in this announcement that a suspect is in the custody of the FBI I Want to remind everyone to defend it in this case as in every case is innocent until proven guilty he's been charged to die\nWith five federal crimes including interstate transportation I'm an explosive illegal mailing of explosive\nThreats against former presidents in certain other person's threatening interstate communications and solving current and former federal officers\nFor these charges a defendant faces up to fifty eight years in prison\nOkay yeah I the\nThe details are just coming in\nOn say or say occupy this individual who has been arrested who apparently first of all his DNA has been identified his fingerprints had been identified those are two separate but both very compelling bits of evidence tying him to the mailing of these packages\nAnd here's part of what we know about him and his criminal record which is very extensive I'll share it with you comes from the Florida department of law enforcement\nAnd the time of his last arrest which was in two thousand Fifteen he was five eleven and two hundred and Fifteen pounds yes brown eyes black hair and a scar on his left\nArm he was born in New York\nThe records list I'm Mr say ox occupation as manager it's not clear what he managed or has ever managed she certainly didn't manage his own affairs very well\nAccording to a a two thousand twelve bankruptcy petition to the finals in Miami Mr ... or resigned at the time and his mom's home a handwritten note on the petition said lives with mom has no furniture\nThis is two thousand twelve so he was fifty at the time\n\nThat some residents of Avon tour a Florida report\nIt seeing is very distinctive white van and the photographs of his flight white van show that that the windows\nThe windshield and not the rear windshield but the windows on the side of the van are entirely covered with various bumper stickers and messages and of images of various liberal icons including Van Jones and Michael Moore and Hillary Clinton was crosshairs on them\nAnd he has\nA another image of uh illegal immigrants as they're supposed to be with crosshairs on them and it says I have a dream liberal melt down\nA it says are\nLured here by liberals are millions of illegals are forced to cross the border\nBy fear of a Trump presidency than uh there there's a other indications and pictures of President Trump now I Know it it looks like this is some kind of stunned to try to discourage Trump supporters from\nSupporting and because nobody wants to be associated with somebody like that say by the way if there are those of you out there who who really think yeah this is my guy I'm I'm Glad to be associated with him I I don't think you even want to call the call it's critical to show but you can one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nI think the idea that this is some kind of set up by some level enforces that this guy is not a sincere Trump supporter\nIs bogus it's ridiculous they've gone back to look at his\nEntire Facebook history and his Facebook history going back until two thousand Fifteen is all about Trump and lots and lots of Trump for president he's posted big excerpts of Trump's speech at a rally\nAnd he has this van he may have been living in ...\nIn it some residents of Evan tour a reported\nOr seeing a similar white van covered in pro Trump stickers\nOften part in a lot of a local strip mall\nAnd somebody who saw that van who was a documentary film producer and editor\nNamed David ... getting set it struck me because the crazy conspiratorial stickers covering the windows it was unsettling and also it seemed to be occupied in other words on living there sometimes the door would be a jar or window would be open which indicated to me that maybe someone was living in the event\nOf President Trump has spoken very appropriately he said these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country we must never allow political violence to take root in America he was just outside the White House moments ago\nAnd they shouted a question of the president would you yourself pledge Mr President the tone down their rhetoric for the next few days\nAnd here's what the president said he said I think I've been toned down if you want to know the truth that is the truth the has been toned down in the last few days but then he added this he said I could really turn it up because as you know the media has been extremely unfair to me into the Republican Party\nUm you know can we play because we should for president from my uh granddaughters favorite song which is let it go she doesn't really know the lyrics she just knows that and she knows let it\nSnow let it go let it snow let it go\nOkay she doesn't sing yeah she's not to yet but President Trump should get the message of between now and election day I I don't think that winning and these clothes districts that we have to win big ...\nBecause otherwise the Democrats are going to take control of the house of representatives or I don't think it helps to continually go after media and to suggest that they are deliberately lying\nNow they get stories where all the time they show by us all the time but the idea of deliberately making things up and lying\nThe president tweeted a very big part\nOf the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely falls and inaccurate reporting the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act fast\nThey do try to clean up their act when they get things wrong I Am very very all of a sudden they will apologize I there was an outrageous story early in the Trump Administration\nI'm sure many of you remember it where they were reporting in time magazine that the president of the United states had ordered to remove all of a bust of Martin Luther king that never happened it didn't exist and within four hours after posting that story they apologize and took it down\nAnd it's outrageous that they made the mistake in the first place and there's no excuse for it but at least you respond the same way when you move back\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six I actually believe that politically\nThis thing should buy writes benefit the president of the United states I'll tell you what\nBecause people said they were so worried about Trump weakening the FBI people are worried about it they should build back up confidence about the FBI about the proper functioning of government it is Trump's attorney general is Trump's director of the FBI he appointed both of them who are responsible for this\nAnd you did very well with the press conference today\nWhy would the apprehension of this suspect so very quickly and it's coming prosecution not be properly viewed as a triumph of success for this administration one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six we'll be right back\nComing up we'll also review hunter killer on that that child [noise]\nIs not actually sent to prison a woman named viola ... filed a civil complaint against they opt for domestic violence in Nineteen Ninety four you also has a history of financial\nTroubles can't imagine why a two bedroom two bath house\nHe owned in Fort Lauderdale was foreclosed in two thousand nine three years after he purchased that say I filed for bankruptcy in two thousand twelve now all of this is terribly sad\nIt's it's very very sad but it I think just feeds the\nFrankly Khamenei narrative that\nThis is somehow a democratic stunt and the the best proof to me that it's not a democratic stunned will be the fact that it will have no impact on the polls and will have no effect on the election ... will have an impact on the election of President Trump and his administration performing well in protecting\nUs and identifying this guy and apprehending him and now bringing him to some kind of justice\nLet's go to Matt Mesa, Arizona Matt you're on the man that show\nThe Michael thanks for having me on your ah look\nHey I I totally understand how it can sound cocky media can sound crazy but the way the world is right now I think it's a little bit insulting when we say that things like CNN the fake news\nThat they don't operate from a place of a it just irrationality sometimes when they called people like the Southern Poverty Law Center and and there are ... members were doing a you know where justice work social justice work\nI wait wait I've never I've never heard CNN describe antifa as doing social justice work and try to describe themselves as social justice warriors and the joker their sucks\nBut I've never heard I've never heard CNN or MSNBC or any major mainstream media source save it antifa was good guys\nWell at least the the point that I'm trying to make is they're not out clearly making them out to be the bad guy and the people who are the the voice that they have on their network at least hold them to a high regard and they're not shutting down and and I totally understand that but\nThat that you look I think what you're saying is true I think there is profound buyers throughout media news it it's it's very very biased and they they certainly treat neo Nazis a much more harshly or Proud Boys much more harshly than they train\nAntifa antifa deserves just the same kind of contempt injustice same kind of criticism but that's different from making things up\nAnd they are and and to say that\nPeople are deliberately fabricating stories is a very different charge we'll be right

spectacular but once this film gets going and you get into the plot\nIt's based on a novel that was written by real life submarine commander it co written by him and\nIt's almost plausible\nBecause it's based upon political instability in Russia and an attempted coup and basically because this us submarine is up there near the naval base where they have taken the president it's actually up to a un American\nSubmarine and for navy seals to try to rescue the president of Russia\nNothing goes exactly as you would expect it to go and of the film ends up a with a very satisfying and actually thrilling conclusion\nIf you stick with this movie and and you will if you go to see it in the theaters which is a good place to see it as kind of spectacular looking\nUh I I think people see it will appreciate it and will appreciate the admiration and sincerity that it has toward\nPeople in the military by the way of both of us and Russia are there's a big\nSub text here about the growing respect
