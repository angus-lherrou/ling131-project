Stutzman or just the tip of the iceberg ATF is on guard all over America as new challenges pop up just listen to a BF senior counsel Jim Campbell\nYeah we represent a promotional print or in the state of Kentucky or he was asked to print messages that conflict with his religious beliefs and he declined specifically he declined a request to promote a a gay pride festival and he was sued for that and he had a local human rights commission that ruled against him\nAnd so now that cases all the way up before the Kentucky Supreme Court so far we've won that case but if they rule against him will have to ask the U.S Supreme Court to hear the case and there's the threat\nRight there is the threat if it can happen to a print shop owner like Blaine Adam soon in Kentucky a man it can happen to you it can happen to anybody\nThis is what we got to be on the guard against this is why alliance defending freedom is so doggone important dose of us\nWho cherish freedom are troubled by the ongoing attacks by secular forces on the most fundamental freedoms your freedom of speech and your freedom to exercise your religion and ... while alliance defending freedom supports its clients with free legal help\nThe Matthews police departments that\nAuthorities have the shooting was believed to be an isolated incident\nAnd at the scene had been secured by police thank God for the police and thank God for the police in Pittsburgh and thank God for the work of law enforcement in diffusing those bombs and apprehending the evil bomber and yes he is evil he's not just pathetic\nHe's evil and it's possible to be both of course everybody wonders about what are the political implications of all this I Want to go a little bit deeper than that but we'll get to that too\nAnd I want to talk about what this means about America\nAre weak coming apart or we're experiencing a total social breakdown something utterly unprecedented in and this is just the worst thing in the world\nNo we're fine we're fine\nOne of the most beautiful things I ever heard I really mean it was the announcement on all the media and it was\nBased upon a statement by the Anti Defamation league which monitors anti Semitism and anti Semitic incidents they reported that the horrible attack on Pittsburgh and yes it was horrible and was nightmarish was pure evil\nThat that attack was the deadliest single attack against American Jews in the nearly four hundred years that we've lived in North America think about what that means what an indication\nOf how blessed we are how unbelievably fortunate we are with this great country one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number [noise]\nUm [noise] let me let me give you a little bit of personal perspective and I don't usually do this but this is very personal I'm not from Pittsburgh I'm from Philadelphia originally\nBut of course we have friends in Pittsburgh I have war shipped at a congregations not at the tree of life synagogue but congregations in squirrel hill Pennsylvania we have squirrels us as squirrels we we have friends in squirrel hill\nI'm sure squirrels too and in addition to humans but um [noise] [noise] the the attack as devastating as horrible and it's nightmarish\nBut uh I think perspective is a hundred percent necessary and what Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a White House press briefing I think this could be her best press briefing today\nAs she made a very important point which is when news of this attack came out the very first thing President Trump did was to condemn\nAnti Semitism extremism hatred bigotry that kind of sickness that led to this attack and the very first thing that many voices in the news media did she said\nThe media in general but it you can generalize many voices very first thing they did was to blame Trump and to blame his rhetoric\nAnd I think that stinks and I think the attempt by some\nRadicals and they are radicals in Pittsburgh to hijack this tragedy saying that the president in the first lady won't be welcome in Pittsburgh\nBecause of their past rhetoric let me make something clear I guarantee you those people who have signed that position they're sixteen thousand of them\nDo not speak for Pittsburgh and they emphatically do not speak for the Jewish people in the United states I Am I found out about this on Saturday morning after I walked to synagogue and and what I usually do and I mentioned this before or our son and\nDaughter in law and a almost two year old granddaughter lives not far from our synagogue um I live further away so I Walk the close to three miles and then I stop in\nUm with Danny in and were shell and Julia and maybe for a cup of tea but just to catch up on the weekend to actually\nSee this adorable little girl and this week uh Danny walked with me from his home in the two of us walk together to synagogue and which is just literally his his houses clubs\nAnd when we got there uh it was something strange\nBecause there was a guy we know a dear friend actually Christian guy who is a former marine officer a marine aviator I Know you're never a former marine you're always a marine and ... he's also a world famous honest\nOr opera singer and an\nAunt or a instructor and an end are a last life member and he was standing at the back of our synagogue again he's Christians not Jewish\nAnd I came up and great on hey Charlie what's going on a great to see you and I said you haven't heard I said no what happened and he said\nThere were a lot of people killed at a synagogue in Pittsburgh and I just wanted to come out here to help protect my friends\nAnd it was so overwhelmingly beautiful and it's such a demonstration of America\nThat this marine from Nebraska would see fit now as it turns out we also have an armed security guard we also have at least five members of our congregation um and\nIt's religiously because we have a ... an enclosure and a rule of around ... ...\nThey're packing\nOn there and they're also guys who are life members of the n._r._a. and they're ready\nSo we now I'm not suggesting that every congregation that country should do this but this was part of our factor and then part of what happened was that um when when Danny heard the news he said\nWell maybe I Want to go back home and tell Rochelle not to bring Julia because you know coming to a two year old and if you're expecting some World War three it said come on we'll we'll be fine we're fine\nAnd he said sure\nAnd and the baby came and she had a great time she played was a big girls in sort of behind the services and then we had our\nUm our\nOur kid is like our social after the services and everything was fine now there was there was of course there were special prayers\nAnd a mention of what had happened in Pittsburgh we didn't yet know the identity of the killer and this is part of\nOf what is so horrible about this is that um that this occurred on on on the Sabbath and it's ironic those we listen to a lot of the show I ended the show on friday\nBy talking about the importance of the Sabbath and how much I was looking forward to the Sabbath and and the value of actually turning off\nA media for one day a week and\nIt's because of turning off those media that I only found out when I actually arrived in\nSynagogue what had happened but you know ... everybody who's Jewish pays attention to this stuff\nAnd you have in the back of your mind what's going to be necessary I I Know that that um to go if you ever go to synagogue in Mexico and I've gone to services in Mexico city and Los ... which is a a neighbor who was angel Jewish community in Mexico city\nThey're they have really heavily armed security guards and metal detectors\nAnd well but that's that's basically the Mexico such an unsafe well it's not\nNearly as bad as Honduras in Guatemala and El Salvador and we'll be talking about the care of and in a moment to\nBut um it it is simply wrong\nWell here's what Howard Simon said Howard Simon for years of Newsweek he was commenting on\nMSNBC and uh this is what he said uh because I think it's it's just dead wrong and we need to answer\nAnswer it back years fine\nJust watches the Jews ... know their own history this was about a Jewish story this was an American story this is an American story about the fraying of our social fabric and the rise of violence as a way of expressing yourself in this country\nThat we haven't seen the likes of in modern times if ever we've had a civil wars we've had strife\nBut we've never had this kind of individual violence against groups based on hate the way we're seeing them bubble up now ah and that's my concern and that should be all of our concerns on this morning\nOkay that's ridiculous it is ridiculous the first\nIn modern times and still in some ways most horrifying killing at a place of religious sanctity was the four little\nGirls who were killed in Birmingham and in the Obama administration of course we have this horrible horrible Charleston episode and then be for countless Ryan stance riots in Tulsa, Oklahoma\nThat killed about three hundred African American people left ten thousand African Americans homeless destroyed thirty five square of life that was Nineteen Twenty one [noise] I have no idea what Mr find minutes talking about\nWe're old hey this is

don't compare Louis Farrakhan the Donald Trump I mean Louis Farrakhan is an open unapologetic lifelong anti Semite\nHe is I mean he he he clearly is you don't even apologize for it anymore and uh he he is identified I don't know anyone who can plausibly say that Louis Farrakhan is not a hater of Jewish people\nAnd Donald Trump is so free of that charge you can charge Trump with lots and lots of stuff but I I tweeted about this it is unequivocal that Donald Trump cares deeply about the state of Israel\nAnd as Sarah Huckabee Sanders said today he adores his Jewish grandchildren\nAnd the idea

his own family the president is the grandfather of several Jewish grandchildren\nHis daughter is a Jewish American and his son in law's a descendent of Holocaust survivors\nTomorrow the president and first lady will travel to Pennsylvania to express their support of the American people and grieve with the Pittsburgh\nOkay and that is the right thing to do by the way some props to the NFL\nOr the Pittsburgh Steelers went on with their game and that was the right thing to do and yeah there were some religious Jewish people in the crowd USA Today wrote about them\nAnd there was a sign that I think called the uh the attention of many people which is hatred can't break a city of steel\nAnd by the way the Steelers one uh but they were playing sorry you've you at the Cleveland Browns so that wasn't a shot a John Jonathan Karl ah posed a question to Sarah Sanders about the the president's a legit responsibility on this are\nThe ... over the weekend that he could tone officers rubber wears the by that and does he have any concern that all his words\nQuote is fire approval for all people do awful\nCertainly ah the president wants a\nEnormous where our country is hurting like we've seen 'em in the last several days of find ways to bring our country together and we've seen him do exactly that\nHowever the president is going to continue to draw a contrast a particularly as we go into the final days of an election the differences between the two parties particularly on policy differences you'll continue to see him make that contrast [laughter] ah but he has certainly I think\nFound those moments to bring our country together and certainly focus on some of the things that all of us can support and all of us are can condemn as well\nOK and again I ... it is hard for me to imagine\nThat Sarah could have handled these\nThese questions more effectively than she did Jonathan Karl kept a going at this and about President Trump blaming the media which by the way yeah do I believe he should pull back on that of course it's tired it's stupid stop it uh\nBut Jonathan Karl put the question to Sarah\nWhy is the author you say you're going to be why is the author very very first\nThing that the president didn't which condemned the attack soaked in Pittsburgh and and the pipe bounce the very first thing the media did was blame the president and make him responsible for these ridiculous [laughter]\nAccent is outrageous that that would be the very first reaction was so many people on top of the country the I'm not finished the only person responsible\nFor carrying out either at these heinous acts were the individuals who carried them out it's not the president no more than it was Bernie Sanders fault for the individual who shot up a baseball field of rational Republican you can't start putting the responsibility of individuals on anybody but the individual who carries out the crime was\nInteresting is the news media is the first one was the one placing blame here\nYou know the person who don't seem to mind the president's not it's not responsible for these acts\nAgain the very first actually let the president did was condemn\nThese heinous acts the very first thing that the media did was condemned the president and go after and try to place blame not just on the president but everybody that works in this administration\nThe major news networks first public statement what's to blame the president and myself included I mean that is outrageous that anybody other than the individual who carried out the crown withhold that responsibility\nOkay and ... again particularly regarding the synagogue in in Pittsburgh when you talk about trying to divide the country the handful of people from a radical leftist group who are trying to prevent the president's first lady from coming to Pittsburgh\nShould 'em straight up and fly right I I mean he's the president of the United states\nAnd he's doing the right thing by going there and by the way um I in his comments are never ideal but it's obvious that is hard his concern with this thing we we will be right back with more\nThe dual between Sarah and the press and Mike Pence was excellent on this we'll get to that coming up on the ... [noise]\nI'm Jewish and the daughter of a Holocaust survivor of course I'm shattered by what is going on I was warned by my father came from Germany to all we know that anti Semitism bubble over this are below the surface\nYou know it's funny that you are sort of rhetorical you what would what he thinks is Jewish people were doing you said very clearly that they support refugees they helped broker genius or quote invading a scratch or ... and ask what we are of our country has used that phrase those are all\nHe actually said they were committing genocide he said they were killing my people is what he said\nHe also hated Michael yeah\nHe said these invaders or committing genocide and they are killing my people\nRight or not use the word invaders invasion infection and they show readers who's here so it's worth\nOkay from Trump has used some of those words not all the ones you just mentioned do why do I agree with that Trump's a response to what let me ask you ... on the issue of the caravan what do you think the American response should be\nWhat was the moment [noise] excuse me the caravan of ... and wild\nAnd they're not not white but it's it's okay when it arrives what should the American response bait\nAnd that matters to the shooting in Pittsburgh how\nBecause you just brought it up in relation to the show today in Pittsburgh me\nI'm Sorry you just did you you were the one you're the one who brought up that President Trump has spoken against the caravan very harsh light\nAnd you were comparing that to the Pittsburgh shooter now I Am asking you what you believe that different from President Trump President Trump believes that it would be extraordinarily dangerous and I happen to agree with him\nTo simply allow these people to enter the United states without authorization or to ... and by the way what they're talking about doing and the administration I think is very smart Sarah Huckabee Sanders talked about a day\nIs saying that OK if you report at the border then they will consider your application for asylum about a quarter of the people who apply for asylum actually get in three quarters get turned away\nBut if you actually crossed the border illegally you will not be able to apply for asylum doesn't that sound sensible to you\nAnd is that why Trump called any infestation\nEaters I better he uh he hasn't used the term breeders or infestation he did use the term invasion recently and I and the the point\nWell this is I'm Still asking you what do you think that the United states should do\nAbout this caravan of destitute people there's one from Guatemala a new one just started from El Salvador so they have bought a mile Salvador and Honduras an\nAll I think I'm Sorry go and what should we do\nWell I think what you're just propose a sensible they arrive when they're process the way that all asylum seekers are are processed trial\nCorrect correct and that that apparently is what the administration is talking about the the troops there at the border\nLike oh well it is not what Trump that is not even remotely close to the ... to be the absolute incitement that Trump uses about this\nOkay I I ... I Do agree with you when you I've just acknowledge before that I think the president I'm the president can make clear that we are simply going with that we are going to try to defend our border and defend rule of law\nWithout a insulting or or giving groundless charges that there are Middle Eastern terrorists mixed in with a caravan there apparently or not\nAnd ... and all of that I think it's perfectly legitimate to object to what Trump is saying but that has nothing to do with somebody who is a classic anti Semite as this one was and who finally acted on it let's go to Jamie in San Diego Jamie you're on the Michael Mann that show\nI think that um I heard a shortly after the shooting there was probably a rabbi sorry chemical and one of the new channel and he was a kind of denouncing in

president just this morning referred to congresswoman as wacko\nHe's called people low IQ he's called people horse face a front of athletes to the prime minister of Canada I guess the question here is

the American people believe that\nThose who are responsible are are the people that actually conduct these threats\nOkay that's exactly right and that that one reason I basically that that I Would hope that the president would not use phrases like horse face or low IQ or\nOr the basically the Rodney Dangerfield kind of a presidency\nJust because they don't think it's politically working anymore if it ever did what once when he was running and Seventeen other Republicans and he could just appeal to his base\nRight now between now and election day it's a question of mobilizing the base it's
