approval rating is the highest it's ever been\nOkay don't get too excited is forty seven percent\nBut forty seven percent to forty nine percent disapproval it means that President Trump has actually closed the gap between disapproval and approval is now basically tied the Americans or even evenly split\nAnd one of the things that I found stunning I Am by the way in the midst of a battleground talkers tour I'm tonight in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania [noise]\nUh and uh then on Thursday I'll be home dad willing in between and on Thursday I'm going to be in Minneapolis where there are also some very hot congressional races and the governor's races and Senate races and more\nBut right now it's all so tight\nYour vote really really matters\nOne of the things that I've found stunning is that um I was watching CNN in the airport when I had to change planes about six this morning in Washington DC I flew from Seattle, Washington DC and from there to Pittsburgh and um\n[noise] in the airport that Tom Perez on who is the Democratic national chair\nAnd uh they\nShowed in the new numbers about Trump soaring approval rating\nAnd are asking why and he had no idea he couldn't answer it and the\nAnswer is very obvious is that Americans have gotten used to Trump\nThey um and most Americans like the economic situation where in President Trump gets very very good marks on the economy and for most people the economy is the most important part of the job\nA meanwhile with an election this close vote fraud is a huge problem we will be talking about that later in the show there is a new book that suggested it is far more common than people on the left ever wants to lead on and far more threatening\nAnd uh [noise] there is also a um an issue lurking in the deep background which is the issue of marijuana we did um [noise] a segment on the show\nA couple of weeks ago about a a a guy who said look I'm just a normal [noise] I'm middle aged a stay at home dad\nWho almost ruined his life

that all coming up on the Michael med betcha one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nIf you can answer the question that a Tom Perez could not answer why President Trump's approval rating would be going up so dramatically the last couple of weeks [noise]\nHonestly part of it as the Kavanaugh situation part of it is the caravan situation anybody here who thinks that we should simply opened the gates and and lead in all the people from the caravan\nHe even those of us who support him ... immigrants and immigration reform and I support immigrants and I support immigration reform\nThe idea of simply saying that uh you get seven thousand people together and they're marching to the United states and they're all waving Honduran flags well of course you let 'em in because they're having a tough time in Honduras is there a lot of suffering people right\nBut the notion that that uh\nUh that just somehow what are the Democrats said about this what is the right thing to do\nI think the right thing to do is to make it clear that before they walk the other two thousand miles have left to walk before they get to the United states border they get a very very clear idea that President Trump and most other Americans who actually can think about this with anything like an open mind\nAre going to say no this is not a good idea\nYou don't simply a let people into the United states without authorization without security clearances or then have them flood the system for processing asylum applications one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nMeanwhile somebody who seems to have a position on everything\nBut I don't really think you have a position on the caravan because how could he be is a battle or work\nAnd one of the questions I Would ask here\nIs what is so great about Beto he is he is now inspired people\nThis the Democratic nominee for US Senate against Ted Cruz President Trump is going down to campaign for the guy who once called lie in bed and people say oh to Trump's such a hypocrite this happens in politics all the time\nPeople who were opponents to run against each other then come together and work together it happens all the time of Ronald Reagan and George ... a age W.

called to talk about the uh the planned invasion\nYou are you calling the caravan of planned invasion\nYes sir\nWell it's a you know given the fact that we've had so far this year\nI think we've had about twenty times the number of illegal entries into the country this year the illegal entries are way up because the economy is very hot right now people are getting across\nAnd uh this I'd only constitutes an invasion I think it is a challenge to our whole immigration system\nIs basically an attempt to raise the border and say that uh we have to let in anyone who wants to come in and most Americans don't believe that a lot of them say that so [noise] but when you say ... and ... of planned invasion what do you have in mind\nUh I think it's just a part of the war or the battle between conservatives and left us that are trying to take down America\nAnd this is the latest strategy\nExcept if you look at those people and I've seen ... and of course they play a lot of very close compassionate a video showing some of these poor people who I think are hungry or scared\nI'm hopeful ah\nThey they do not appear to be actors or manipulated their just desperate people from\nPlaces in the world that are deeply deeply dysfunctional look I I think that President Trump is doing the right thing to basically make a stand and just say no we simply cannot just open the doors to anyone in this country that's not going to be our immigration policy\nBut I think he makes a very big mistake when he threatened to cut off foreign aid and I'll tell you why the best way to prevent other incidents like this and so this doesn't happen every week or every month\nIs not to cut off foreign aid to Honduras is to coordinate more foreign aid to Honduras to take these people these seven thousand people I think that's how many they think there are right now\nAnd to bring them back home where you can work with them to try to make Honduras a more livable place because that's really going to be the only kind of answer that has a long term impact on let's go to Marco in Los Angeles Marco you're on the ... that show\nI might go a great job either way hey ah three things I was calling regarding that that the um the reporter that got killed I I feel that that really not our crime it locked the guys get killed all over the place we're not we're not up in arms about it\nFor sure it's a bad situation that happened but why are we getting involved country installing\nThem because we are and we are involved with the country I mean the the argument is we uh we have a lot of financial dealings with Saudi Arabia\nNow of Saudi Arabia is not a country we give foreign aid to their one of the richest countries in the world but it's a country that we saw a lot of arms to him as President Trump says we have a pending one hundred ten billion dollar arms deal and if it doesn't go through with us if we cancel it for some reason they'll turn around and by the arms from\nA China or Russia and ...\nWhy does that have to do what is that the deal with this guy can kill\nWell ... what's left is trying to do and I think it's despicable frankly is to suggest that somehow um Mohammed bin Solomon the prince crown prince and Saudi Arabia got the idea that it was okay to kill reporters because President Trump is always so critical of the press and I think\nHe he obviously President Trump has never hold on anyone to kill\nReporters are and ... do I think it's unfortunate that President Trump made some reference and it was a joking reference to Greg Gianforte and one of

I Want to buy because in some ways marijuana was a creative force in my life I Would you know I I wrote\nAlmost all my book I all the time and I I Can't although in retrospect there there's a law that there are a lot of scenes and the novels that are about getting hot and I I think there'll be fewer of those but you know I ... it helped me come up with certain like fancy indecent\nJoke um and it was a creative stimulant in some ways but uh so I've actually been I Would say like in some ways less creative since I stopped smoking pot but everything else in my life is so much better I mean I'm just I'm more present for my family and my friends um I'm Better organized\nUm I I I Can't ... making more money but\nI feel like my life is in order professionally in a way that it was it\nIs not as much chaos and I'm and most importantly I'm not having the emotional highs and lows that that was happening when I was using marijuana you know I'm not I'm not super up all the time and and then when I when I bought 'em out I don't bother them out if there's no there's no high or low like I said\nSo I'm not having the melt down that would characterize\nA sort of my my addiction cycle\nEight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nOur phone number I speaking with Neal Pollack who wrote about how marijuana almost ruined his life\nYeah one thing you you mentioned you've been married for Eighteen years does your wife ever share a urine Suzie asked him for a read\nNo in fact you know she was just the opposite does she she has no interest in it at all um and she many many times\nTried to tell me that I had a problem or just you know I Would just shovel or off I you know because the the myth is that marijuana is an addictive it in some ways it's considered a health food um and so\nI just you know even though I had a history of alcoholism and\nMy family um and obviously have the addiction gene I just it just didn't register with me\nUm maybe I should add you know if I was stuck in behind the dumpster on the weight walking to the gym it's like you know take a hit like it'd be high wall of working out you know that's not the signs of someone who is necessarily healthy but uh you know I\nI uh I didn't see it she did and she she was so grateful when I finally made it a ...\nYou know you use the figures in your in your piece that I I I think they're generally accepted figures from the journal of the American Medical Association and based on studies done in a number of countries they suggest that uh some nine percent of people\nWho ever use marijuana end up getting addicted and Seventeen percent of people use marijuana is teenagers did you first use a weight as a teenager\nYeah I smoked once at a party when I was in high school but you know when I was when I was a teenager which was you know the Nineteen eighties I was\nI was sort of a a go getter do good or student council tight sort of a modeling myself maybe not politically but like at least in terms of my lifestyle on you know Michael J. Fox is character from family ties uh-huh I Know that was my model like I was going to college I Would be successful\nI was going to be a great American citizens and um and so part didn't really play into it um you know in college I kind of um\nI I went a little uh I I I I'm a member of generation X and so you know I I I became kind of a a a grouchy pop culture sit next but I still wasn't doing a lot of drugs or it wasn't until I was in my twenties that I um that I really started a consuming it\nSo it was an adult onset addiction\nRight right and I had view I'm ever tried to calculate how much money you invested in and buying we'd over the years about\nOh I mean it was probably a few thousand dollars you know the the thing is it and you know and this this isn't the brackets back you know I there was a time there were I was a ... you know well known writer and people would just\nGive me drugs or or or smoke me up and I I'm I'm\nI'm kind of I'm inherently cheap so I Would look for situations where I ... I knew I'd be around people who would have it so I wouldn't have to buy but of course still with them you know when I Lived in LA I had a medical marijuana card I Would go up to Colorado for a week and it's been a hundred two hundred bucks\nSo it didn't bankrupt me in that sense but it you know it still it was still even on the month where it was really good at managing we're still caught me at least fifty dollars not a hundred bucks and I\nKnow you you you've written a since you've written this ... sentence obviously caused a great stir have you done some negative reaction from some of your old friends\nOh no people have been very supportive I've had a few people who are wonderful go\nYeah yeah I mean generally when someone announces that they're an addict the reaction is that like you're faking it or\n[laughter] you know you're it's not you know or or you're not an\nAddict I mean if you if you go through what if you go through the twelve step program guided there's no way you can anyone can say that you're not as an addict I mean I wouldn't have done it if I wasn't but uh you know there was some sort of anonymous\nEmails and comments on line that that said that there is no way without describing could possibly be true that I was fictionalized thing that I was somehow working with reactionary forces who want to continue can contribute to the drug war but those comments were wider five percent most\nPeople because you may get you make it very clear in your in your column that you believe that marijuana should\nBe legal given the fact that you recognize that it's dangerous uh that's a fascinating position to take we will get to that and much more with Neal Pollack\nLink to his website as well he's um um written a powerful piece about marijuana addiction will be right back with your calls for Neal Pollack coming up\nTwenty nine point five seven genes Seventy six Michael Medford show\n[noise]\nHas to know did it help your wife or into your life for me you know I didn't\nHave a voice that I was trying to fill fill a marijuana we just kind of stumbled across to each other but certainly the creative aspect that may be a little bit more artistic side of the visuals side but I feel that\nIt's it's certainly a struggle and and my main question was what ... for the show was what finally made you quit\nYeah that's a good question and to address the thing you were saying it's like it's just marijuana is kind of creeps up on you right it's not like I'm you know heroin where your job if you get addicted very fast I'm\nStill ... you can use it for a number of years it's sort of a low level gradually increases as for me that my moment of clarity game ... ironically enough now that the Dodgers are back in the world series that actually came at the world series I ... I went to Los Angeles\nBecause I'd always dreamed of going all World Series game even though I didn't really have the resources to do it and I bought a ticket off of some ... third party Web site before I did that\nI managed to get as high as I possibly\nCould um even though you know there's no reason why you need to get hired and go to the world series but I needed to get hired to do everything and that was a special occasion so I got really high\nUm smoke in the huge joint that has all this crystallized th ... all over like smoking weed with a stranger and it has an echo park I went to the stadium\nBombed out on my mind and the ticket didn't scan it was it was like I said it was fraudulent 'em and rather than deal with the situation rationally I started screaming at people and I was I got arrested I got it scored it\nOut of the stadium or by security guards I was in the parking lot sobbing and it's kind of took a look at myself into a side view mirror of a car and I just saw this you know old man with Red River the eyes cry over a baseball game and I just I thought to myself this isn't good\nI Can't go on like this and so I didn't quit that day but three weeks later I I kinda sunk and and I just I took my last puff\nKen Daniel born round vote can can you be around other people who were getting high uh use our would you go into the other room\nSo I can I was at a music festival I live in Austin, Texas and I was at the Austin city limits about spoke\nA couple of weeks ago and I was hanging out with friends there were smoking joined than ... than I have a side of poker out I was going to where ever which passed joined around the table that was the only one there was a stone I lost\nMy view [laughter] well I I Wish you better luck with poker you've obviously had better luck with your life that's Neil Patel like we've posted his information on our website when we come back marijuana and driving\nA will deal with it coming up on the main event show [noise]\nWhen he was written by Seventeen Seventy six Michael [noise]\n\nYou know the moment the word game is over your daily responsibilities has been that\nThe shoe flip off line\nChat dang [noise] ... when you rest on their bodies to renovate made locally at the original mattress factory\nRelief from middle man ... and a hard day's work the original mattress factory thoughtfully made fun of the price of regional mattress dot com\nYou know that when you buy a mattress from a retail store that mattress is being sold for the second time [noise] what do I mean well the manufacturers sells the mattress of the retailer who in turn sells it to you with constant mark ups for both parties\nAt the original mattress factory we have our own factory right here at our store to the mattress you buy is being sold for the first and only time\nThat's why our prices are hundreds lessen the mainstream mattress brand\nStop by one of our factory locations or visit us out of original mattress dot com to see for yourself\nEvery day roughly ten thousand baby boomers turn Seventy and a half and what does that matter because that's the age Uncle Sam decided we have to start withdrawing money from our retirement accounts they're called required minimum distributions or ... for short\nAnd if you're like most people you have questions about what they are other calculated how you can plan for them that's why Kevin Bach from integrity retirement solutions is hosting an R.

distinctive perspective on an item is very much in the news is a report in Bloomberg\nAre the headlines stoned driver crash risk grows as legal pot spreads the insurance Institute for highway safety found in a new study the traffic accidents are rising in states that have read to legalize recreational marijuana\nThat follows dark warnings from the national Transportation Safety board which last week issued several recommendations to combat drug impaired driving and then Neal Pollack our guest wrote a piece for the drive where he says I'm\nPot is being touted as a cure for all human males and its negative effects are drastically underplayed but there is no greater negative to marijuana than driving stoned as dangerous as hell\nIf you really think it's safe to drive stoned then you've either never been stone had never driven or lying to yourself one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\n[noise] um I Neal these these numbers look look fairly serious and I think\nOne of the big claims when we were going through the legalization debate in the state of Washington where I live [noise]\nWas it this would be so great because fewer people would be drinking and more people will be smoking weed but for first of all there's no reason to believe that smoking weed stumps people from drinking as they're\nAbsolutely not I mean I I was much of a drinker when I was getting done but I Know I Know people who do both in in ... they go together pretty well\nSo now they're going to believe that but there you know there's the thing with driving while stoned right there was this other live in a in this donor community that I'm\nActually um it's much safer to Dr stone than I I've been drunk because you know when you're stone you you get paranoid and you're more focused and you can get kind of tunnel vision and you're not and it's just it's just a massive alive and your your mind can drip all over the place when you're high\nYeah and um\nWhat what ... what are the killer or is it basically lack of concentration that makes it a problematic to dry stone or slower reaction time\nOut pacing Democrats in early voting in key states NBC

lot however he didn't necessarily do it was early voting but when you're talking about Arizona Florida Georgia Indiana Montana Tennessee in Texas [noise] those are all states that Trump\nCarried and uh however he did these\nCandidates in those days so new to do better than Trump they just need to do as well\nAnd uh this\nWould be very encouraging and it also brings up the point that when you read the generic polls nationally and when they say well\nThe Democrats are have this big advantage in the generic poll\nThe reason that that doesn't matter as much as you might think it would it's the same reason it didn't matter ultimately that Hillary won the popular vote by more than three well three million votes but you know what that was all in California\nAnd that's the point one of the reasons I think that Democrats may be doing well on the generic ballot there are thirty six seats\nWhere there is no Republican candidate\nReally where it's just so like I I don't think Maxine Waters has a Republican candidate against are there other states that are so dominated by the Democratic machine no Republican runs you know how many seats there are no\nDemocratic candidates only three so

the mind of someone who was speaking in Las Vegas just moments ago and it's a voice you might recognize listen\nNovember's election are more important than anything I can remember in my lifetime and that includes went out with them about [noise]\nPoliticians say every time there are the most important ally for this one how long we've been born [noise]\nThe stakes are high\nThe consequences of anybody here not turning up and doing everything you can to get your friends neighbors family to turn out\nThat the consequences are you staying home with me for found Lee dangerous to discover toward democracy\nOkay\nI I Can't believe that Obama President Obama is saying uh this is the most important election of my lifetime and again everyone says that\nAbout every election and it's almost never true [laughter] really [noise] and this is a midterm election and it will not be a landslide one way or the other\nAnd yes I think it's important and yes I think everybody should definitely vote because this will help to determine the direction for the country for the next two years but then we have another presidential election and I think one of the things that happens is we're all so desperate to get people to turn\nOut and then went on election happens and there isn't some kind of profound change how people get disillusioned how often get new cry wolf about that stuff one eight hundred nine five\nFive Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number a President Obama's successor was also speaking today and he had a a different tone he was speaking outside the White House and here's a President Trump said\nWe're putting in a resolution sometime next week a week and a half\nWe're giving\nSet for says now for people to the middle that sort of the fact that we've already got [noise]\nI Know you've got to do with the vote there was a vote after the election\nOkay uh\nI'm not sure this is going to work and what he's talking about is\nTrying to do a ten percent middle class income tax cuts sounds pretty good but honestly I don't I don't think he will get the support he needs unless a and first of all these right to say we're we're going to\nTry to do the vote after the election when he's talking about now is a proposal to try to excite the Republican base and of course people should be excited about it you know how much money you\nSpend in taxes and getting ten percent of that bag that's pretty cool that's a nice thing however\nHe can't do it honestly unless he finds some kind of compensating\nA place for money to come in\nBecause it it simply does not work it does not work that when you cut the tax rate\nThat automatically the revenues go up I mean it's true that the revenues didn't go down from the last tax hike but because we're spending so much more than ... continue to go up we're already looking at a trillion dollar a year deficit\nAnd I think the president should a work as hard as he can maybe after the election with a Republican House and a Republican Senate to try to yes continue to cut taxes\nBut to do so by cutting spending one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six or in Nevada a President Trump spoke on Saturday and he was talking and somewhat similar terms listen\nRelocated every once in a very major attack or middle income people [noise]\nAnd we do that it'll be from briar I Wish they would have ever had are setting very deeply right now around the block they may for middle income people not at all let your people working on it [noise] All right we're we're all working\nAt a major tax or\nI Would say some time around the first real them or maybe a little bit more of that\nOkay one of the things that we need to keep in mind is they're already was a tax cut for middle income people you may not be aware of it but you will when you fill out your tax forms and everything it because basically the exemption was doubled\nIn other words part of what we have now is that the standard deduction the standard deduction that people receive\nWas doubled which means that there's an extra twelve thousand dollars that people who are middle class taxpayers are not paying taxes on\nThat's a good thing and that should save a lot of money all ready for middle income people\nAnd uh I I think the timing of this I may be could be a little bit better\nAnd also President Trump did something that provoked a ... usually negative response on CNN what's striking about this is not the light it sheds because she has no light at all on President Trump's proposed actions concerning the federal government\nAnd trans gender ism\nWhat's shocking about it is supposed to be journalism and honestly these reporters on air uh are sounding completely an unapologetically partisan\nI'm Talking about John Berman and um and I'll Alison ... and that John Avalon on uh CNN listen to how they react remember\nWas just over three years ago that same sex marriage became legal in this country\nSo now the wedge issue has moved to trans Raj and concerns I Love to lock the issue of by better I'd gender identity symbolized by Facebook's dozens of gender options\nI'd also liberals abrasive myriad of gender pronouns for many conservatives in some moderate it's a potent example the PC culture the Trump constantly attacks to great effect Republicans want to benefit from this backlash and it's an easy dark just look at the numbers\nFor gender folks make up an estimated zero point four percent of American adults work was watch lots of people\nThat still a lot of our fellow citizens but it's many fewer than a million of gay and lesbian Americans\nMost people now know was friends family your co workers\nThis just simply picking on minority rights to try to win the popular vote last time I checked self determination was a pretty basic American values\nRooted in freedom and equality what President Trump has also been playing up the caravan of asylum seekers from Central America pushing it as a threat at rallies in tweets with plenty of amplification from conservative media this is just more play the bass panic rooted in fear and anger rather than any reality that these asylum seekers are going to rush the border\nOkay there let's say they don't rush to the border what are they coming here to do they're they're coming here\nAnd ... to get into the United states and what they will do is flood our resources or submit applications for asylum and basically challenged this notion that the United states as a as a basically the core of our sovereignty\nGets to decide who comes into the country and
