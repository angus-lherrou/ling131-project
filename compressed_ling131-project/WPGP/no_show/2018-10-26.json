why\nFor our friends at alliance defending freedom off for such a vitally important research to people of faith all over America ATF spot Trent says\nSeemingly small ways are religious freedom is

vigorous investigation what's likely\nTo come out of it or we will be speaking just moments from now with Jim Fitzgerald who is one of the FBI supervisory special agent in a criminal profile or who helped to crack the Unabomber case\nWhich ah it won't take as long I don't think to crack this case will speak to specialize in Fitzgerald retired are coming up on them that that show about that it's also a big day in the world is media uh I I Know that people often have an exaggerated idea\nOf what people immediate jobs make\nBut there is a figure in America and a media who has a three year sixty nine million dollar contract that's that's awfully good money making\nUh gone fired dropped by her talent agencies CIA in by NBC\nUh it it\nIt uh their NBC and saying well she may be just off not out she may collect all her money any way what is the conflict all about it's about oh about Fifteen seconds of TV Time\nWhat did she say does it deserve this response we will get to that and then a question about the caravan\nUh we we all hear from a left\nThat President Trump is terrible and the caravan and yes now a Secretary Mattis is sending eight hundred troops to the border as presidents request\nTo make sure that order is maintained and that know people are not just simply going to walk in from the caravan I that is of course the right position to take\nBut what's the Democratic position\nIs the position that literally anyone seeking asylum in the United states should be welcomed with open arms and should be allowed to come in if they are suffering there are a lot of suffering people in the world\nHow many do folks on the left actually wants to take care and then we have a disagreement day of course a but first up I Am very very pleased because\nIt'd be it'd be so depressing the other way up President Trump is handling this bombing situation decently\nIs handling it brilliantly in with unbelievable a plum and so much style and someone's firing no but it's it's it's better than adequate it's good it's fine I mentioned on the air yesterday it it might have been a nice thing and who knows maybe he did it just hasn't called attention to it\nTo call some of the people who have gotten these bomb packages send to them and say gee I feel bad we are going to try to track these people down and make sure you don't get any threats again I didn't call Joe Biden you can call Hillary Clinton you can call ... rock Obama\nWhy not he's president the United states\nAnd uh he did get the tone I think pretty close to just right at the beginning of this rally last night Wisconsin a lot of people are saying oh what's he going to say in Wisconsin in federal court fact people in the media are freaking out they say he's blaming the media for this whole thing he is not\nHe is not they are distorting what the president said here is what he said the very beginning of his rally in Wisconsin of course all of this for the midterm elections which are coming up twelve days from today here's President Trump\nHow water begins tonight surrounded by addressing the suspicious devices and packages that were mailed to current and former high ranking government officials\nMy highest duty as you know as president is to keep America safe that's awesome [noise]\nThe federal government has conducted an aggressive investigation and we will find those responsible

is the problem people have with this one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number or because it seems to me that the president got lost each year there from conservative I haven't heard a single conservatives say well you know what people who\nGot these bombs uh deserved it a ... no one is anyone stood up to try to defend the mad bomber whoever this person is\nI don't think so certainly no one on the right if anyone on the left stood up to defend him or her I think it's probably a guy a ... ISIS as ISIS defended [laughter] the bomber and by the way it's not an ISIS flag it has now been carefully analyzed\nIt was the image was a parody of an ISIS flag that are invoked a Larry the cable guy\nGet her done but that was the image which was a parity from an ISIS flag showing three scantily clad women in high heels okay I mean really\nReally [noise] [noise] okay\nIt's the president went on in opening his rallies speech last night to say this where you are\nAll sides\nTo come together in peace and harmony we can do and we can do it [noise] we can do\nMore broadly there's much we can do to bring our nation's together for example those engaged in the political arena must stop treating political opponents as being morally defective after\nThe language of moral condemnation and destructive routine\nThese are arguments\nAnd disagreements that have to stop\nNo one should perilously compare political opponents to historical villains\nWhich is done often son all the time\nGot to stop\nMob people\nIn public spaces or destroy public property [noise]\nOkay I by the way it is a he has completely correct I literally in the last twenty four hours there have been about a half dozen instances including very prominent one on CNN of ah of people calling comparing President Trump to Hitler\nAnd know that is not appropriate and yes that is disgusting and it's inappropriate so the president is speaking well I I Know is reading from a teleprompter I Know it's prepared for it but that's what you want for goodness sakes this is a time where he has to be careful of his language and he was\nBut then he added this and this was the controversial part of his rallies speech last night and I think what he said was absolutely one hundred percent correct and highly defensible listen\nMedia also has a responsibility\nA civil don't yet or stop\nThe endless hostility and constant negative and\nOftentimes false attacks and stores have to do [noise]\nOkay why is it not possible for people\nOh say on CNN or MSNBC or on CBS or any ... any of them to acknowledge that the president is right about this but instead of that we heard this from John King on CNN in response to the president's remarks\nNo one's blaming the president that he won't go in and the president\nUh but the president that wants to make this about him I'm a mentor the president for what he first said yesterday\nEvery body tone it down\nTo see where the fact that what the investigators do their job we can all be better\nIt's our fault why\nOkay she never said it was your fault the president's words where the media all the responsibility to set a civil tone and stop the endless hostility and cost the negative and oftentimes false attacks\nHe didn't say it was your fault he said that if we're going to be better as a country and that is one good thing that could have come out of it it's going to have to involve\nSides and everybody and er here was I'm Caitlin Collins on CNN [noise] uh\nYeah we we will get to that at at actually arguing with Jeffrey tube and a Jeffrey ... says the most in temperate things about president I Know he's a fan of the idea of impeachment and a removing President Trump from office but even Jeffrey too when I was defending him against\nThe comparison to Hitler meanwhile a a an American hero James are Fitzgerald retired FBI supervisory special agent

because quite frankly none of them have detonated but that's a but they're getting their point across as look how bad this other side is so please vote for us in two weeks I Can't tell you Michael which one is that it is but I've worked cases in the past\nNot always bombs or sometimes just letters and and then saying certain things and other political ah um incidents in another elections where\nOne side as there are people write to 'em you know the opponent by pretending they're on his er or get to the opponent pretending they're on his side sort of a mini fall sly type situation and let me just throw in your Michael the last thing\nSince we had ... outside source forces or as in the Russians and some others\nA mess with the two thousand sixteen election or at least try to I Can't completely rule out any very simplistic and\nAlmost unsophisticated way that there is some parties such as that are involved in this whole thing just to throw a wrench in the works of our upcoming election and just confusing confound the people involved and cause a little bit of a man and quite\nFrankly I'm getting it makes America look bad and they I I and that's my uh my wife was a clinical psychologist is convinced that it's the Russians who knows we'll see\nBut her her idea is that this kind of thing on not only makes Republicans look bad because everyone's assuming it's a Republican\nBut it makes our country look bad because uh if if you're having a very prominent people whose safety is being threatened in this way by bombs that aren't even that well made it looks like a banana republic\nOr do you think it's likely that we will have a ... a before the election of twelve days from now\n[noise] I I I lost one word on you there I think if you set a resolution and the

generally you can look at the experience of cinnamon for patriot\nAnd yes I think my country is the best in the world and I put my country above any other nation in the world I Do\nAnd you know what what's amazing here as you'll hear Caitlin Collins is twenty six years old she's a graduate of University of Alabama\nAnd and this may make the make you dealt with Crimson Tide holes on the national championship frankly because she's arguing with Jeffrey tube and the legal analyst for CNN and he also defends the term nationalist but it sounded like this\nI don't think he can just change the war national I like that I just don't think that is how this works and I don't think I think we're letting if I didn't do that I mean do you ever have you said you would think you are a nationalized then

national at the guy a negative connotation it is not the national is Teddy Roosevelt in the Nineteen\nThirties now there are a little mini legitimate grounds to criticize Donald Trump for for his

election\nOf tell me why what is it that is exciting you and turning you on about this one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nAnd one of the things you don't get to vote on is Megan Kelly because no matter how much you want to continue watching her on NBC's Today show apparently that's not going to be possible and this particular case is one of those\nWhere I think that people who were treating this treating her as a victim or treating her some kind of horrible criminal\nOr both wrong or what Megan Kelly displayed\nIn her injured change on NBC about black face and Halloween blackface\nUh costumes does not represent racism\nAnd it doesn't represent innocent victim mode either it's just represents colossal monumental indescribable stupidity\nShe's a lawyer she's obviously a very bright and capable TV journalist and for goodness sake given the fact that she had just a couple of years ago a huge explosion of well deserved controversy for her insistence that Santa Claus was white\nAs she should have been able to watch out on this\nBecause what all of this is based on as she was commenting in a discussion about a Halloween masquerade which looked truly awful frankly uh by ... the lesson was one of the real housewives of New York\nAnd um she um she dressed up as Diana Ross\nAnd pose and put out pictures of it\nAnd uh and and Diana Ross and of course has very um a light skin and as soon as she was trying to approximate that wearing a big giant afro wake and it looked awful and ugly and people were offended by it of course\nAnd a leg and kill eight took it upon herself in a conversation on air\nTo defend the idea of dressing up in blackface for Halloween a very very stupid\nPoint to make but here's what it sounded like\n[laughter] you get in trouble if you are a white person by the time we are black person that puts out white they all the way\nLike that that was a kid that was okay as long as you address character LA feels like something as offensive to them then you should say it and that's fair game and if they're gonna dressed up like I Want to take\nYou've got to be able to take it\nOkay Allen broker of course veteran a weatherman on NBC or was one of the many many many people demanding that Megan Kelly apologize and er here here's what al ... had to say\nThe fact is on for a while she apologized to the south she owes a bigger apology to folks color around the country because\nThis in the history going back to the Eighteen thirties minstrel shows to do to me and denigrate\nUh a race wasn't right when I'm old enough to live through Amos and Andy where he had white people in black and he's playing to black characters and it was just magnifying the worst area attacks about black people and that's what the big problem is\nOkay yeah it is a big problem and by the way Megan Kelly saying when I was a kid it was okay to dressed in blackface she's forty seven years old\nIf she was a hundred and fifty years old maybe\nMaybe it was okay or or even if she was\nEighty years old or Ninety but I've got to tell you I'm older than Megan Kelly I hate to admit it but I Am and uh when I was a little kid it was emphatically not okay\nIf somebody had showed up at our Halloween carnival in my elementary school in San Diego California uh ...\nBeing black face costume for Halloween\nI think they would have been asked to go home\nIf it has not been okay for a long time a long time\nAnd that's something that Megan Kelly as a graduate of the University of Syracuse in Albany law school and somebody who's been a TV journalists for a long long time honestly should've known her apology on air\nWas very carefully composed and it was meant to say for career obviously and it sounded like this\nThat want to begin with two words I'm Sorry\nWe made her they answered a we had a discussion here about political correctness and Halloween costumes and that conversation turned to whether it is ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another\nBlack person making their face later or a white person making their darker can make a costume complete I defended the idea saying as long as it and that was a respectful and part of a Halloween costume and old okay\nWell I was wrong and I and [noise]\nOne of the hardest thing in his chair and getting them [noise]\nI talk sometimes I let him [noise]\nAnd yesterday I learned I learned that given the history of blackface been used an awful way by raising country\nIt is not okay for that is part of the Halloween [noise] otherwise\nI'd never met a kind of person [noise]\nBut I Do understand the value and being that if you are history\nChicken early on race and ethnicity is past year has been so painful\nFor many people of color the country fail so divided and I have no wish to add to that pain and offense I Believe is is it time for more understanding war love more sensitivity and honor and I want to be part of that\nThank you for listening and for helping me listen to\nAh well didn't work she suspended or now it looks like uh\nShe uh she's not going to be on air on NBC and she's also dumped by CIA the talent agency major Hollywood talent agency that handles her so she's dumped by both but she\nMay be able to collect a what's left on her sixty nine million dollar contract\nSo good luck with this I I Do feel there is something that first of all black faces disgusting and all you have to do is go back and look at some even some quality old movies I I'm\nOne of the films that that comes to mind is a wonderful movie called holiday and with Bing Crosby\nAnd it it's a lovely film excepted has a sequence in it with Bing Crosby in blackface singing the song Abraham about Lincoln's Birthday and pretending to be kind of an old slave and it's so cringe inducing its horribly embarrassing\n... an enormously popular a singer\nAnd just enormously popular and he of course was known for doing his shows in blackface do I believe that Bing Crosby and ... and were were horrible racist I Believe that they basically shared some of the values of their time where\nIt's almost as if there was something funny something humorous about being black because it was so different and the whole minstrel show blackface history\nIs low mental and it it is an indication of how far we've come or do I think there's any defense for Megan Kelly making making the case that uh uh that wearing black face on Halloween is okay no there's no real defense for it\nBut is it perhaps an overreaction to see her entire career go up in flames because of this one stupid passing comment\nWell it's happened before or with other people I again I I think it is appropriate and good that we are more respectful and more careful\nI mean well there's a piece over at Fox that actually pretty amusing if you don't get what's wrong with blackface here's why it's so offensive\nAnd genetic Desmond Harris writes put down the black and brown face paint step away from the bronze or twelve shades darker than your skin that is if you're at all interested in not being walking symbol of racism Halloween wait what's wrong with black face\nA lot of people thankfully don't need this question answered to many it's obvious that it's a lazy non funny costume\nBad idea with the depressing history that is the opposite of celebratory people have even made very simple visual aids communicate this and they have one circles I should I wear black face on Halloween next circle says no\nI yeah it it is a big ... you know if you disagree [noise]\nHi Michael nice to talk to you great to talk to you [noise] um\nSo I originally called in to say why I'm voting for the first time in the midterm\nUh good I'm Out here and why\n[noise] well I think it's a way of expressing yourself all the yanks that people are saying and feeling right now like these ... reported bomber\nOut these pipe bombs you know I think part of it as he has ... and yet he is probably here she is probably a a dysfunctional person I'm Sorry I'm getting off track [noise] so how voting because I think when people that are in power\nOr you disagree with that you tend to to look and see what they're doing and be paying more attention and so I think that the best way to express my feelings are about the situation in my lot in life is to vote and vote and the local level and the state is the best way to do that\nNo good for you yeah is one way or the other but\nThey're no good good for you are I can I ask are you voting for a Sherrod Brown where are you voting for congressman or a ...\nA ... at this point I haven't looked over their platform and listen to all the governor debates are that's far and I'll I'll be voting for Cordray for governor um\nUh that's interesting why\nUm I agree with issue one uh mostly um I I thought he did better in the debates I feel like the viewpoint wind up\nUm\nIt after that that that's kind of how I took away when I took away from it\nWell I knew I was fascinating as you know Ohio carry big time big league for President Trump won Ohio by nine points\nAnd right now uh I Know the the governor's race as close a Sherrod Brown the very very liberal senator who really should be voted out but it looks like he is going to win and what these shows is the American people are not doctrinaire they're not automatic about their voting\nBut I I salute you Josh what you're saying about voting to express yourself to get involved\nIt's a good thing and it's the right thing and congratulations on that let's go quickly to David in Duluth or ... to ... uh okay we will go to David in Duluth, Georgia in just a moment are coming up I Want to go to this idea\nOf um this early voting and what it means and why it is that Republicans might be voting

I ... when you say can or can't you\nCan do whatever you want it is a free country but there are consequences and right now there is a very different sense about a white person dressing up as a black person by putting black makeup on then it would be the other way around here would be one little point of advice\nI don't think anybody would mind if you just left off the skin makeup\nRight if you wanted to dress up like a Bob Marley uh we had a caller who apparently dresses up as Bob Marley or you want to dress up as a Freddy Mercury Freddy Mercury was a a Persian ancestry\nAnd yeah he had somewhat darker skin and\nOkay so you want to mess up as for Freddie Mercury dress up as Freddie Mercury of the uh of queen\nBut don't put makeup on your skin because it is that that whole process\nOf darkening your skin usually in a comical way because if you look at some of the classic black pays performers they don't look\nConvincingly black it's not like Jimmy Kimmel Robert Downey junior and

Brian in Schanberg Illinois Brian you're on the map that shows disagreement day\nAfter that happened to be a lot to you a lot and you get away with a lot of slippery language and one of the while I'm calling about today is well you you're spot for a Mac he made the point that seniors are getting what they paid for which is not true they're getting a lot more than they paid for\nThat's ... that's absolutely true and I don't get that average\nFor every dollar a senior put put into Medicare they're getting three dollars back\nOkay ... what I said I don't I don't believe that I have said that that seniors are just getting back what they paid for I Am saying that they are are listed in a program and part of a program to which they've contributed for many many years\nAnd they have but what you're saying oh by the way doesn't work for all seniors it's not every senior who gets back more than he pays for but particularly seniors who were lower income so they paid in less to the Medicare system are getting a lot\nMore back that is true so I'm not sure where our disagreement is here\nOnly getting what you pay for but in reality I went on average on average at every what mayor right back a lot more than they paid in\nAnd on social wired and on Social Security as well which is one of the reasons and by the way do you know why they get back so much more\n[noise] because medical costs going so I\nKnow it's actually 'cause our life expectancy keeps going up and in other words Social Security used to pay for itself because the life expectancy was sixty seven sale and to provide Social Security payments for people\nFor an average of two years and uh now our life expectancy is almost Seventy seven\nSo it's very very different and much much more difficult to make the\nUh the numbers workout but your point is fair enough uh we we all do get more back from both Social Security Medicare than we pay it but at least we pay in something and when people talk about Medicare for all they're talking about people getting payments who put in\nNothing not anything at all let's go to a Steven born in Pennsylvania you're on them at that show\nUp or down in New Jersey Michael Oh

fortunately no one was injured that's a good thing\nBut she is out with this lengthy video today and what she says she concludes that she believes that Donald Trump is the worst thing that ever happened to this country\nWhich seems to me a profound lack of perspective and uh\nShe she says this\nAnd I guess she's trying to help heal do you think some of the current polarization and divisions here's what she has to say about President Trump and what he should do\nI think the president of the United states should take responsibility\nUp with a kind of violence that we're saying oh for the first time in different ways I think the president of the United states has been dog whistling to his constituency making them believe that their problems are caused by a lot of people over there and I think that there are ... out\nBut they believe the president wants them to do and the way that he wants them to act\nAs a matter of fact if you pay attention and you pay attention to the president doing his campaign oh when he talked about he talked about moving up on people and taking them out on a stretcher\nAnd even said he would have a ... they're lawyers' fees to get them out just the other day he was one thing and uh\nAnd um it didn't work out so well for the candidates are who by the way we're and historians confirmed this is not only of biblical account they were child sacrifices they\nPracticed human sacrifice they burn babies alive or so not such a level folks\nAnd by the way you want to have ancient Cain tonight's welcomed with open arms into the United states or you were six sorry son of a B and you need help science Sally in San Francisco will thank you for helping me with this segment we talked about this earlier\nIn the show 'em look I think it is perfectly appropriate for people to have personal compassion\nFor some of the people who are in that care of it and no I don't think they are all terrorists and I don't think they all mean or evil for the United states\nBut if you simply cannot say that the country is going to be wide open to a every single human being in the world who is hungry are starving or facing violence are facing a difficult situation it's billions of people\nAnd that is not fair to the people who have lived here who themselves or their families have contributed to the United states\nI look what what is has to happen with the caravan particularly this is a test and\nIf the Democrats really want us to say oh come on and you six thousand or seven thousand or however many they are\nThen what do you take say to the next caravan was already starting Guatemala\nThe truth of the matter is I Do believe President Trump is wrong to say well we should cancel foreign aid to El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala what we should do is a look let's work together on this and we will provide more of that foreign aid to keep the people there\nAnd for the people who are going to be sent back from the caravan you don't have to say well you're going to be sent back to a hopeless situation send them back with some private organizations are some Christian organization some do good organizations that will help them get set up so they don't have to live under such squalid conditions\nAre back in Honduras or back in Guatemala with the other caravan but the the answer and I haven't heard a single Democrats say this but that's the implication\nIf everyone who is needy and helpless and a destitute and desperate has an open door in the United states what does that mean to our population and what does that mean for the people who are here already\nAs Joanne from Los Angeles wrote in er during the disagreements segment last week you mentioned how the right to not generally harassed groups of politicians as the left is prone to do\nI remember the Tea Party people disrupting rallies and far right groups in Charlottesville et cetera okay the Tea Party people were not disrupting rallies what she's talking about is they came to town meetings\nA constituent meetings that were held by congressman\nTo try to get their attention and the left does this too that it seems to me is not is not hateful when people come and you have a constituent meeting with a member of Congress would I'm Talking about is the I the effort to shut down people and not allow them to speak\nThis on college campuses is uniquely the left when it comes to interrupting congressional hearings uh when it comes to end you might say well what about these bombs we don't know about the bombs right now we don't but\nIt's it's sold a mental bowl and this and same thing by the way it's true Charlottesville Charlottesville wasn't conservatives\nIf these people these creature that's one of the good things in the ... movie\nAnd yes it has some good things in it some things that are I have more problems with one of the things that I thought was very good in a movie in an interview with Richard Spencer who is this leading neo Nazi was very much part of that Charlottesville scene and he's a leftist he's not on the right okay and then there's a\nAnother email that came in about where left and right stand right now and where they're going saying that no Republicans haven't moved to the right up plus a a tweet\nThat says Michael you're wrong President Trump is a hundred percent responsible for where rage takes us in the United

look I agree with you it's reprehensible when he says things like that and I don't think he's said directly the Democrats are evil but when he says the presses the enemy of the people he should drop it and and again it's just not worth it\nBecause anybody who likes that uh is going to vote for Trump and Republicans anyway\nAnd ah for people who are uncomfortable with it like those people in the

these pipe bombs were received\nAnd it's really they were thankfully harmless there is no real apparent literal physical threat with these pipe bombs nonetheless\nHours after she had in New York City headquarters were evacuated\nThe networks president issued a statement condemning knock the bomber knocked a maniac who did it knocked a lunatic who would or the hope stir or whoever whatever word you want to use\nThe blame President Trump but the White House and Sarah Sanders saying they should understand their words matter\nIn other words CNN can call Donald Trump Hitler all day long and there's no accountability there\nBut as soon as some\nManiac sends the suspicious packages and these pipe bombs to all these prominent Trump\nHaters match Trump's fault the statement\nContinued the president and especially the White House press secretary should understand their words matter that's far they have shown no comprehension that now let me tell you what has to happen let them do this\nDo you dare do you go down this path normal Americans are seeing this garbage sheen Trump blamed for everything from hurricanes literally\nThe pipe bombs so my aunt birth is get out and you know what Americans going to go to the polls and reject\nThe left they're going to send a message to CNN and the Jeff Zucker is of the world you're not going to get to witness thing\nDon't you dare go down that

find out and they'll catch whoever did this if they find out\nThis was some kind of a Bernie Sanders supporter like the guy who tried to kill the Republicans on the baseball field if we find out this was a member of a you know Planned Parenthood or is this is a Democrat operative trying to\nCreate havoc bullied me the floodgates elope it people will then say look at what they did but if they find out as a conservative who hates Trump around me who hates the media and hates Democrats and loves Trump\nThen guess what was what gave you an open on us and you know what may happen people are going to say well we'll do you people who said it was a Democrat hoax\nThey're already saying that I'm reading Jonathan ...

saying what you want to say and believing what you believe\nBut we got too many people\nWho are so quick to blame the president for everything including Republicans just pick up all Republicans like the governor of Ohio John Case the man who would be king he wanted to be president so badly\nThat he used it down with his buddy over to MSNBC Brian Williams does this cut number three from MSNBC and gravy\n\nTrain does and that's part of the reason why I never endorse them and I I never been personally critical of him about yeah he does bear responsibility for the divisions are he has the biggest megaphone\nJohn Case six says sure he does Donald Trump does bear responsibility for the for\nThe uh the tone of America John Cage that has never gotten over the fact that this fighter\nBe ship John chase has never recovered from the fact that Donald Trump has fought in a way that we have never seen a president quite in our lifetime ever John Case she doesn't know how to play ball that way that's why John Case it lost\nIts why he will always be a failed presidential candidate\nAnd all of these people who have been beaten by Donald Trump love to sit on the sidelines like little like little ...

I got the screener and watch that you got some heavy weights you got some some real real powerhouse actors and actresses of this bill\nWhere really do in order to tell a story like this you need a ... a lot of the performances in a in a meaningful realistic way\nAnd Sarah Drew and Justin ... who some of your listeners will know from a great show team a TV show Grey's Anatomy but we've got other actors there as well come along and support them and and really pull this off in a meaningful way\nYou know I I Love your story I've been reading about you you you began shooting homemade films at age twelve with your brother on your parents little a little uh Ricky ... camera I always show grateful to two filmmakers who try to do to take a different path\nWhen it comes to to telling a story or creating a movie in again with the culture we're up against right now in some of the tough things we're facing um I I got to believe that this is your life's work provided an alternative to people from some of the junk that we see a on the big screen these days\nThe last year\nI guess David we got you know what happened to us that we got a little bit of a technical problem I think I'm this is is there did you got us back\nI got your back now so I'm Sorry about that David we apologize I we were just talking about the alternative a movie\nLike indivisible which is such a different refreshing change of pace from some of the garbage that that is in Hollywood frankly today and I know this has got to be part of your life's work to provide some inspiration for a change rather than some of the depression things we see on the big screen\nRight it definitely is and again you know when people go out and watch a movie like this on opening weekend it's really a vote you're casting for more positive content that you can share with your families on the big screen and uh so often we see movies like this will come along and they last about a week or so and then it's like who are gone\nBut uh when you have a true story like this first of all it's a story about soldiers that are fighting for freedom it's a well acted well produced Feldman M. we want people to get out of the support that movie on opening weekend your vote for Moore movie like this and\nIt's so important and keeping the movie around as long as we can so by getting out in supporting at\nAn open the way can help everyone who's working on projects like this to step forward and keep pushing to to get their ...\nCouldn't say better myself even even I even like the theaters instead of theaters here from Arkansas I could tell I Love it [laughter] I proudly I Love it David David Evans director co writer of the new film individual congratulations on this thing about this film is everybody's as you said everybody to get out and see it\nOpens October twenty six looked at more movies like this\nCall to serve indivisible David Evans keep up the great work thanks for joining us on the Mike Ehlers show sir\nGreat great go by the way for more information go to indivisible movie dot com\nIndivisible movie\nMany say he's the hero of the hour Senator Lindsey Graham provide below the state of South Carolina\nLindsey back and he's going to join us next we'll talk about the pipe bombs that the rhetoric capital and more stick around you're not gonna wanna miss it [noise]\nYou know watch not smart job sites and overwhelm you with tons of the wrong reservation but you know what is Martin he's a recruiter dot com slash M. G. unlike other job sites\n[noise] we've got a crucial midterm election coming up in November ... since Nineteen Seventy eight Gallagher has been a voice of clarity from millions of America although it\nWas just Democratic Party if\nWe are fortunate enough to win back the house band or is it that ... started to\nShow known by the most famous man on the planet\nEven grade Mike and I appreciate it very much notice I walked over here very\nQuickly now from the relief factor dot com studio Mike\n[noise]\nAre in the middle of an incredible time [noise] the president tweeted today a very big part of the anger we see today is our society is caused by the purposely falls that an accurate reporting of the mainstream media but I refer to as fake news\nI was so bad and hateful but it is beyond description\nMainstream media much clean up its act fast well the mainstream media doubles down and says this is all his fault these pipe bombs at least suspicious packages that have been sent to prominent Democrat critics of President Trump um we've had a voice of reason in this country lately\nUh last night you know in a room of about a thousand people\nIrving, Texas\nRight outside Dallas we had a an event on stage where Sean Spicer\nMy colleagues Larry Elder Dennis Prager Mark Davis and I\nWere talking about all of these important volatile issues\nAnd I mentioned the name Senator Lindsey Graham at a roar went up\nThe likes of which I haven't heard in a long time I know he's feeling the love about everywhere he goes because many of us believe that we're not for Lindsey Graham's passion\nAnd his heart felt anguish over the way the process of judge Kavanaugh played out he wouldn't be justice justice cabinet today what a what a joy is to bring back to the Mike alligator show Senator Lindsey Graham from the Palmetto State of South Carolina Senator Graham what a time to be alive ha\nAm I Am trying to make the guy that won the lottery I don't know who he is but I'm trying to find it\nBut he's in your state right I mean listen can I all I have ten million if you if you get five I'll tell you I could do five or seven and you know and we'll be All right [laughter] you know if his\nTrial yet man and I get more and so that's\nThe good no kidding I write he'd get fringe group he'd get three groups and you get one of ice cream Senator Graham on us to do this last last night I mean here we are in Dallas texas and here's hundreds\nAnd hundreds of people roaring their approval for just for your name were so appreciative of your voice and and I I just got to get the Lindsey Graham\nThirty five thousand feet view of of what the of the time we're living in this investigation is intensifying these suspicious packages CNN's Jeff Zucker immediately blamed President Trump what is what a Senator Lindsey Graham say about the last twenty four hours of this very nervous a dangerous time\nWhere you take your frustrations out at the ballot box to support your team or support your causes appropriately I don't blame President Trump for this any more than I blame Bernie for the guy who shot\nState Scully us and tried to kill a bunch of congressman Rosa Bernie supporter but Bernie doesn't support that or this person is obviously sending bombs that critics at the press that that's not the way we do business in America hope they get caught I Hope they go to jail and I hope and about Thirteen Days republic\nWhen at the ballot box because we deserve to get reelected\nAnd that's the answer the only answer we have we got to be the the the we got to have a big boy pass on we can't Flay all around and and point fingers of blame so long time to do this because frankly Senator Graham seems very clear Republicans have a great deal of momentum heading into November ...\n[laughter] no question about it I'm so Kevin uh I think what people were trying to say to you and to myself when I made them is it thank you for speaking a thank you for speaking in a in a fashion\nThat if I were there I Would have said the same thing less than what they were kind of data Brett Kavanaugh who I've known for Twenty years is destroying his life to keep the seat open\nTo make sure that Democrat could say within twenty twenty they actually said that\nThey play dirty and they lost I'm Glad I called him out I had all I can take a thirty for ... taken now because Hubbard chose them but that was I thought they were qualified they're meant to against birds are hauling story for Scalia to people from South Carolina the game's played differently now\nAnd what they were trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh hope it I Hope there's a backlash at the ballot box and I hope we pick up seats and they get punished for what they're trying to\nDo you mind if I asked if I go a little person with you because of knowing you for a long time and I have respect for you at all on ... you know that all the years that that I've been on the radio I said Senator Lindsey Graham is a good and decent man I met you in Washington DC\nEarly in my talk radio career you told me something that stuck with me you said Mike I came to Washington not to say no to everything I Want to get stuff done I Want to get things across the finish line\nThere's a belief and I and I hope this doesn't hurt your feelings are a big because I respected admire you and I knew for a long time there's a belief that with your friendship with the late Senator McCain\nYou were sort of restrained a little bit and with his passion is like Lindsey unleashed its Lindsey Graham the way South Carolina south Carolinians have known him for many many years is there any merit to that Senator Graham\nNow people are thinking way too hard ah here's the deal or\nIf you know anything about may have tried to be supportive of an independent judiciary are are traditionally needs to be independent of politics John McCain was my dear friend he voted against so tomorrow and cake cameras heart asked when it came to judges [laughter] so the bottom line as\nI could never done to set them aren't taken what they were doing to Brett Kavanaugh they were misrepresenting his life they trade that for ward and there's no doubt in my mind something happened to the doctor for but I don't believe Kevin had anything to do with it\nOr they tried to ruin his family\nAnd they said if you're really innocent or not you asked for this charade continue and that's what I lost it as when Durbin asked Kevin out attorney Don McGahn the White House counsel if you really have nothing to hide wanted to ask for this to continue they present him guilty not innocent\nEverything that I Believe in as a lawyer a was was basically trampled on\nAnd I pushed back and it's still more complicated than that\nWell we're ... on a nation is grateful for you and your push back many believe I mean is it is it an overreach to say that that that that your voice your speech your passion helped the confirmation occur\nWell here's what I Would say number one I Want to congratulate President Trump for picking Brett Kavanaugh who's that great legal man of his generation has resume of being a judge was unquestioned his integrity he's just a great guy I think what happened is that\nI gave voice to those on our side who said enough already rancid always are judges Mike why is it always Clarence Thomas and board and Alito and now cabinet why is it all up to our people right and they wanna they wanna went too badly over there\nPlaying pretty it's a Republican a dentist a male democratic nominee will be crucified\nOh we'd be visited ...\nFor these people can you imagine if there's a democratic male nominee a lady from South Carolina announced demand gives me a letter and I sit on it never shared with it the Canadians they'd need to me if I recommended a conservative lawyer never told the lady from South Carolina oh by the way the Democrats would come here to meet you there'd be a riot in the street\nOr without the press so so I just got mad I was pissed\nI Know you were an MRI make about it that get tests to get so hopefully with [laughter] well we hope\nHe is he is justice Kevin I mean that battle was more and and and he's on the Supreme Court and maybe there'll be another conservative on the Supreme Court\nAh in in over the next few years Senator Lindsey Graham is with us let me ask you about the big burning issue that I think is the October surprise we've got thousands and thousands\nOf people in what's being described as a migrant caravan um a lot of people are concerned as much as ... as the country is enamored in love with you right now\nThere are a lot of us should live as a push back a little bit on\nOn the issue of illegal immigration and and you have been if you've been an interesting\nI think that it industry ... voice in all of this where do you stand right now with these thousands of people who are marching towards the southern border uh and and and frankly I think from a political optics point of view something that is encouraging Republicans and independents people to go to the go to the polls and say\nWe can't have open borders we got to have sovereignty we got to have a secure border what's your take on the the migrant care of and Senator Graham\nOr between Kevin on the care of and if that doesn't make you want to vote is Republican nothing ever will be if you're an independent voter our hope you will come on our side\nI'm going to be practical when it comes to solving the immigration problem within our country if you've been here for decades and you've got to American citizen children are there more treat you fairly you'll have to learn our language pay a fine get in the back of the line but I don't want a third wave out President Trump stops
