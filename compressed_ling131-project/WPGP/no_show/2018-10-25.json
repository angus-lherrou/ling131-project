he and his team get from working at alliance defending freedom\nGetting to know our clients jak ... a chief Cochran in Atlanta and I will send in Kentucky a beer standing up for everybody's freedom or they could have made it easy choice and just gone along with what the government was telling them to do is a compromise and their beliefs and they were not\nWilling to do that or I just get a great

exist\nBecause of the tax deductible donations that people at your listeners provide us and right now there's a donor a friend of ATF who's willing to double match every gift is given during this campaign there's not that much time left\nAnd they apparently are bombs they're rudimentary they're not highly sophisticated but they apparently\nAre operational\nGood for the NYPD and the FBI and the New York bombs\nWas basically an all the people who are trying to deal with this and do it also for some of the\nReactions not all of them some of the reactions have been appalling and hypocritical and wrong or but not Steve ... of the various reactions that I've seen I think the one from the whip for the Republican Party in the house of representatives\nOr the ... congressman from Louisiana who's been a friend of the show a Steve writes these attempted attacks that have been made or beyond criminal their acts of pure terror violence in ...\nHave no place in our politics or anywhere else in our society I've experienced firsthand the effects of political violence and I'm committed to using my voice to speak out against it wherever I Can't\nThose responsible for these evil acts of terror and yes even if no one has killed God willing known will be killed these are evil acts he writes those responsible for these evil acts of terror must be hunted down and brought to justice and I have great confidence that our law enforcement officers will succeed in that mission\nAs a nation we must agree that this is a dangerous path and it cannot become the new normal\nExcellent that is fine and\nBy the way what the president said he spoke after Milan yen millennia was promoting some of her causes any complimented his wife speaking as she introduced him he got a standing ovation and uh then the or the president said this about the bombing attempts\nSuspicious packages and devices mailed to current and former high ranking government officials the safety of the American people is my highest an absolute priority\nI've just concluded a briefing with the FBI department of Justice Department of homeland security and the U.S Secret Service as we speak the packages are being

these despicable acts to justice we will spare no resources are expensive this effort\nAnd I just wanted to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together\nAnd send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America [noise]\nWhat the\nPresident said is fine and it's appropriate and he offered a little bit more to be more specific here's President Trump\n[noise]\nIt's a very bipartisan safe and I can tell you from both sides we both agree on that\nDisagree just conduct is abhorrent to everything we hold dear and sacred as Americans my administration will provide additional updates as they become available and I just want to thank everybody for their understanding [noise]\nWe're extremely angry upset unhappy about what we would this this morning and we will get to the bottom of it\nOK given the fact that two of the most prominent targets of these bombs\nWere Hillary Rodham Clinton who President Trump defeated and the election\nAnd the Democratic president that he replaced Brock Obama I think it would be helpful for the president or for Sarah Sanders frankly to reveal I mean enough revealed this honestly but I think it would be a good thing for President Trump to call President Obama and for President Trump to coal Secretary Clinton\nAnd to express his concern and his gratitude that they and their families are okay\nBecause uh ... just saying that doing it would detoxify this entire matter and one of the things that I resent is mainstream media right now and a lot of democratic leaders\nAre injecting toxin into this situation\nThey're basically trying to blame Trump\nFor this now I get it I understand most of the people who have been targeted or very clearly identified with the left their opponents of Trump\nThey include Eric Holder and Maxine Waters and Morocco bomb and yes all three of them are African American I understand that it also includes Hillary Rodham Clinton Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nAnd I'm I'm oh and George Soros she was the first ones to receive a a package and apparently they are now saying that the package was actually delivered in person by somewhat\nIt was not mailed to George Soros but the package with this rudimentary bomb and it was delivered to Soros his home outside of New York city\nAnd um [noise] look at\nThe idea that Trump is to blame for this of course that is irresistible to the left and it seems to me it is entirely wrong\nI sent out a tweet about this immediately when that tendency started\nAnd I understand that there are people in the media who are trying to link together for phenomena what are the four phenomena these bombs the bomb scare number to the show the murder number three the fact that Trump ... says that it's fake news is the enemy of the people\nAnd um and and\nA number for the uh the idea that Trump praised at a rally in Montana\nThe body slamming a reporter by congressman Greg Gianforte by the way to apologize lavishly who paid the guy damages who apologized again and actually was pleaded guilty in court for assault and battery\nSo ah here's here's the point you just four separate things Greg John forte\nThe Trump assaults on news media as fake news an enemy of the people the murder of ... and these bomb scares which are attempted murder\nWhat's the connection between all for nothing there is no connection the first two are evil threatening to murder people sending out bombs to people's homes that is evil murdering Jamal because she'll be which no American had any role in at all\nWas evil and it's been denounced that way by the president the United states the other two things Trump sprays of Congressman John forte for the most embarrassing moment of his life\nAnd Trump's general ... on the news media is enemy that people are stupid and it's embarrassing it's not evil and it's not a crime and basically trying to associate these things is wrong it is irresponsible I Know it's irresistible\nFor people on the left especially Thirteen Days before an election but it's deeply irresponsible you want to hear about irresponsible Jack Reed the senator from Rhode Island was on uh CNN and of course CNN let him directly to saying what CNN\nWanted to hear listen\nI think is quite obvious us some of this is a reflection of the\nThe base tone a debate and the president of the United states is at a rally and smiles as people chant lock her up or make their own direct attacks on the news media that doesn't raise the level of debate that lowers it and it creates this environment where these acts could take place\nAnd not only being an attack I think the other thing has to have this or act found out is someone is sending as explosive device anonymously to people who could be hurt\nAnd and this is something that is just just just to wrap it\nIt's not just disreputable is not just caught cowardice is evil but the point is we don't know anything about the perpetrator yet I Hope we will soon\nAt one of these guys are wrong let me give you an example of something else it was just a couple of days ago that in Washington DC in northwest Washington Fox five Fox News in other words was attacked\nBy a guy who have now identified his name was George ... and he came and he broke two big pains of glass and he came in and the security guard thank God shot him\nDidn't kill him he's alive now if\nAll of a sudden you're attacking Fox News of course some idiot could jump to conclusions oh this is because of all the hostile things that Democrats are upset about Fox News nobody said that because we didn't know anything about this guy now we do\nWhat do we know about him\nWas he indeed a left wing activist actually know uh what was he we will get to that in just a moment we'll also get to some of the outrageous stuff that was set on NBC\nAnd some outrageous stuff that a leading Democrats said\nAbout the shooting of Congressman Steve sleep so no you can't blame the left for that even though\nThe guy who shot Steve's Phillies and ended up dying was a Bernie Sanders volunteer we'll be right back on the ... [noise]\nPresident Trump condemned the newsroom shooting and offered his condolences but he is often portrayed the news media is the enemy that people\nAfter the shooting the publisher of the New York times AJ shoals burger said in a statement that he told the president in private meetings that quote his language was not just divisive but increasingly dangerous in other words what did they have to do with the newsroom shooting in Annapolis\nOr the attack on Fox News which is where this appeared in the paper\nWhere this we don't know yet\nIt'll be interesting to find out we do know be on any shadow of a doubt\nThat when Steve school leaves was severely wounded and there was an attempt and and so we're Washington officers severely wounded designed to protect the congressman and other attempts to kill other Republican congressman\nThat was politically motivated the guy was clear about it\nListen to what Nancy Pelosi said at the time when a and this is more than a year ago this is June of two thousand Seventeen right after ... was shot she asked about\nUh some Republicans would condemn some of the hospital democratic rhetoric and here's what she said\nThey have or comments from a public ... including Congress about Israel and rhetoric from the left things in some ways say\nWell I think that your question is an excellent one and I think that the comments made by maverick public ... are outrageous beneath the dignity of the job that they hold an eighth of dignity and respect that we would like Congress to command how dare they say such a thing\nHow dare they so this sick individual that's something that the ball\nAnd it was horrible what he did hateful that's our van ... all the sudden the sanctimonious and see if they don't never seen such a thing before and I don't even want to go into president the United states but in terms of some of the language that he has you know again I let's go there and the other day\nBut don't you ask how could they possibly say such as\nFar as the way they can have such a thing the way they could say such a thing is big cause that shooter had told other people that he had a grudge against Republicans she had been just active in the Bernie Sanders' campaign for president\nHe was deeply politically active and apparently mumbled to his wife all the time when he saw stuff on TV we know the guy was politically motivated\nSo the only kind of political motivation that can be condemned is if it is from the right well there are other people who say no this couldn't have been from the right this is probably a left to set up can I say\nWe don't know when will we find out we'll get to that with your calls coming up it's pathetic the Michael ...\n[noise]\nThe average person considers it said planting just for the wealthy attorney Michel ... the host of counties law on his team planning for the everyday person\nThere's a lot that goes into it he don't take more time now what car they're going to buy where they're going to go to dinner as opposed to what happens\nTo my children the state will dictate to get like if you don't indicate\nTo is to receive yourself on your passing we want to make sure we land appropriately so that may get the best of both worlds they continue to receive the benefits and they get the inherent in the other thing you have to think about is planning we try to be proactive and the approach\nThat we minimize any type attacks constant when when somebody dies depending on the value of the state these taxes range anywhere from four and a half\nTo forty percent so we try to make sure that the beneficiary or Steve as much as they legally are able to\nHear more on countries will on Sunday Morning at eight thirty here on the answer for immediate visit county law P.

that John Brennan set a while back remember you had dogs all the intelligence community it takes away from Sunday getting back at you\nI don't remember what he's saying exactly that but he said many

similar President Trump said at his rallies during the campaign was stupid and it was a responsible and he shouldn't have said those things but is it necessary for him now to go\nAct there and say gee I'm Sorry I said these comments more than two years ago in the middle of a campaign it's not necessary for him to do that what has happened\nIs he has stopped encouraging violence and then somebody is going to say well the other night he was speaking in Montana\nAnd he congratulated a congressman Greg John forte\nFor having body slammed a reporter uh who um got on his nerves it wasn't even a reporter would have been particularly hostile to Congressman John forte\nLook I think it was a mistake I don't think he should have done that and handed the other side that kind of support but the idea that that is somehow associated\nWith somebody trying to kill people and whether or not these bombs were very well made up it was an attempt to kill people or at least make people think that they were being threatened with death\nAnd it was outrageous\nAnd look there should be no problem at all with people acknowledge ing President Trump said something very good there\nHe said we should condemn political violence of every time we should condemn scuffles we shouldn't condemn people and by the way it is part of what he's very I'm perfectly and very poorly try to do in some of his garbled and messed up response to Charlottesville\nOr when he said there are bad people on both sides what he said it was terrible as he said there are good people on both sides they weren't but there were bad people on both sides and that was accurate and if he can go ahead and consistently now\nCondemn people from groups from the Proud Boys to end chief uh from the neo Nazis to uh some of the other people on the extreme left\nWho won't allow speech to proceed you know something I was just I just found out about ... and it's it's appalling to me because\nLook I I have a certain affection for the physical a Yale University campus and I spent close to seven years of my life there and [noise]\n[noise] right now I'm Harold the camp has been totally defaced by graffiti and all the graffiti is excerpts from the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford right\nOkay what is the point of that for goodness sake I guess the point is because Brett Kavanaugh went to college and the al ... law school he was also there for seven years so now they have graffiti to remind people I mean\nReally that's pathetic and yes\nPolitical violence and intolerance is pathetic whichever direction that comes from\nAnd I hear you have two members of Congress actually former members of Congress a David Jolly of Florida who by the way is very anti Trump and Steve Israel of of Florida who well surprise is very anti Trump here's how they sounded on MSNBC\nWe're in an era now where violence seems to have licensed by the president of United States and it's not just going to Montana endorsing body slamming and it's not just saying that neo Nazis you know are good people there are good people on both sides of a marsh including neo Nazis\nRemember that the president either states in the campaign offered to pay the legal bills\nOf his supporters are if they attacked his opponents I'll just say one other thing on this it's not even just the president we have a bomb squad at CNN or the CNN building in New York City today yesterday I was walking in New York City and I passed in the building where Fox\nNews is headquartered and the ticker the digital ticker that displays news in that building was reporting on the George Soros a bomb threat and it began with these words for the man who has everything that's not funny it is dangerous and so it's not just a president who gives a license to violence\nBut those who are enabled by that violence they have a responsibility to make sure that we are\nEmbracing values of a piece of safety and not pouring gas on the flames\nWere happening too often I mean I'm Sorry how does how does I I don't know what the Fox ticker\nActually said but if it said for the man who has everything\nIs he sure that that was in the context of George Soros I I don't know but it seems to me that if you are in the midst of a heated political campaign is very easy to say this rhetoric goes over the top or this is wrong or the president said you should beat up protesters who disrupt his rallies\nThat different from murder\nIt is and it's different from condoning murder and the problem the refusal to make a distinction between things that some people in the right may say that are sometimes embarrassing and irresponsible and just\nPlain dumb that's very different from an action of attempted mass murder which is what we're dealing with here making distinctions is\nUnder Lee necessary if we're going to be serious in our politics we'll be right back there's a statement now from CNN [noise]\nBut equating that with the cars she'll be murder\nAnd really you want to show me that ... I'd love to hear from a prince Mohammed bin Salman oh yeah President Trump told me it was okay I heard them attacking the lying stinking disgusting fake news media and I thought okay I'll do something and no of course he didn't think I didn't\nAt first of all we don't even know Solomon a mom and then sell them on was actually directly responsibly probably was\nBut the idea that he was somehow encouraged by Trump's ongoing fused with MSNBC and CNN\nIs ridiculous I Do hope\nThat when we emerged on the other end of election day whatever happens and I hope urgently in earnestly that the Republicans prevail\nBut that we can move on from this this stupid back and forth on both sides it doesn't do that country any good to have voices in the media just perpetually blaming the president for everything and attacking him for everything\nWith a visceral hatred that I Do believe is unique it goes beyond anything that they applied to George W. Bush a Ronald Reagan or anyone else\nLet's um\nOr go to I'm John Berman who is an American news anchor\nAnd currently the co anchor CNN new day with Allison come out on CNN he's a regular a relief presenter of Anderson Cooper three sixty this is what he had\nTo say it could have been sent to John Berman\nMeant to be because they said John Brennan on the packages had Brennan B. R. E. N.

how should presidents from\nRespond now to a new joint statement from the two leaders of the Democratic party in Congress both of them want to be majority leaders I\nIn Thirteen Days from now when they we have a great big election uh also thirty six governors' on the ballot in that election is so important to be sure you vote\nHere's what Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer had to say we listen with great interest of the president's remarks this afternoon we'll take an oath to support and defend the constitution and to protect the American people and that is our first responsibility\nHowever they say President Trump's words ring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts of violence\nTime and again the president is condone physical violence and divided Americans with his words in his actions expressing support for the congressman who body slammed a reporter\nThe neo Nazis who killed a young woman in Charlottesville he never expressed support for killing a young woman in Charlottesville it's outrageous and it's wrong\nLook he was as that's outrageous charge and they have it right in their\nExpressed his support for the neo Nazis who killed a young woman in Charlottesville he never did that expressing his supporters are his sport is at rallies who get violent with protesters dictators around the world who murder their own citizens and referring to the free press as the enemy that people\nLook at the the instincts year to play politics with a direct in serious threat what would they still be doing that if if one of these bombs going off and people were killed there will be it would be even\nMore outrageous and it is a now\nWe we had a caller who um who called in and palace you wanted to say should Trump\nTone down his rhetoric he should certainly avoid anything that can be construed as an endorsement of violence on any kind at the very least between now with the election and probably forever\nAnd yes he can be more careful there is nothing wrong with a a a president being careful about what he says it's Theodore Roosevelt called the presidency a bully pulpit\nAbout the asylum process and about the level of illegal immigration and it uh it it mentions that illegal immigration right now is at a\nForty year low the only years where illegal immigration has been even lower than it is right now\nWe're the last three years including last year as the Obama administration has been brought way way down and brought down by three quarters way greatly reduced part of it a bad economy part of it much better border security which began by the way under President Bush\nIn any event here's the interesting thing when uh people come here in terms of uh applying for asylum between the years two thousand twelve and two thousand Seventeen in other words including the Trump Administration\nImmigration judges turned back Seventy five percent of the people who came here from Guatemala seeking asylum\nSo she may say it's America's strength to be tolerant accepting but right now including under President Obama and yes under President Trump most people are coming looking for asylum or turned back\nAnd that seems to me is reasonable and says the Trump Administration has made the process even more difficult by ordering immigration judges to stop granting asylum to virtually all those claiming to be victims of domestic violence\nA move that could block tens of thousands of people from gaining permanent entry into the U.S and in other words if you're running away from an abusive husband\nYou probably don't have to run away two thousand miles to get to the United states\nAnd that seems to me is reasonable enough uh let us go to your calls to John in Columbus ohio John you're on the Michael ...\nMike I'm

know and I don't even want to posted its its ugly and it's disgusting and are\nThey are reporting the Jim Carrey is pending at least part of the blame for multiple explosive devices targeting Democrats and CNN on President Trump is not being part of the\nBlame blame a plenty of blame it shows Obama emerging from Trump's mouth Trump spoken the bomb came into existence\nGod's spoken light in the world came into existence so why not Trump ... create a pipe bomb in his mouth in any event uh he um ... the pipe bombs of course this this morning we're targeting\nAnd by the way there is not is not true it is fake news that there was a pipe bomb targeting CNN\nThere was a pipe bomb targeting John Brennan now yes they misspelled his name they spelled it B. R. E. N. A. and I just want and not to\nAnd but they addressed it to them care of CNN he also does by the way commentary on MSNBC he um he he actually plays both sides of the aisle on that one both so balanced CNN and MSNBC\nIn other words that but MSNBC did not get a John Brennan package CNN did\nBut all of these packages seemed to be very directly and personally addressed two\nProminent figures on the American left bronco bum Hillary Clinton former attorney general\nEric Holder congresswoman Maxine Waters and yes ah also Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz now you may have heard on this show and I know it can be a little bit confusing that the return address on these packages\nAll of them apparently was Debbie Wasserman Schultz no one believes that she's the one who sent [laughter] usually if you send a bomb you don't put your real address on it I mean and I know Debbie Wasserman Schultz has an idiot she is\nBut uh no she didn't do this ... I don't I don't think anyone is suspecting that congresswoman Wasserman Schultz did this\nWhat obviously was going on here is that this was the warped sense of humor of the evil and warped individual whoever it is who did this who figured oh great if they don't deliver this package and they return it then I'll get bad Debbie Wasserman Schultz and in trouble if even if I don't blow her up with a bomb that I sent her way\nA look all of this is is serious enough and I'm OK Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nToday condemned the packages sent this week with her return address chef saying she is deeply disturbed that her name was attached well I I can imagine that I think as indecisive that package that apparently\nCan turning can painting explosives were sent on Wednesday to high level democratic leaders including former President Obama and former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton\nWith Wasserman Schultz has also has a name as the return address one of those packages addressed former attorney general Eric Holder was returned to Wasserman Schultz his office because it was sent to the wrong address two of her Florida officers were evacuated and response\nShe confirmed in a statement the one time Democratic National committee chair she's been replaced by the indescribable awful Tom Perez or she says in her statement we will not be intimidated by this attempted act of violence\nThe appalling attack on our democracy\nMust be vigorously prosecuted and I am deeply disturbed by the way my name was used okay I think it it makes it fairly clear that um there are a lot of suspects on this and I hope that by the time we're on the air tomorrow\nThey will have identified a suspect they certainly should they should move as quickly and decisively as they possibly can but not meanwhile\nThere's all sorts of craziness Stacey Abrams is running for governor\nOf Georgia and they're a series of issues that have arrested one of them not that serious one of them\nIt seems to me very serious and one of them as it seems to me is very very serious the one that wasn't that serious\nIs that on the former flag of the state of Georgia she engage while she was in college in a protest or in which the state flag non the American flag the state flag was burned they cause it had the old Confederate battle flag in the flag\nThey changed the state flag she has never been involved with burning other flags since then okay let that will go for a moment much more serious\nShe has called for doing a Taliban on Stone Mountain which is a huge and and beautiful mountain in city park\nWhere it would cost literally hundreds of millions of dollars and it would be unsightly and destructive to erase the work of art that was put up there in Nineteen thirty one is when they finished that they've started putting it up and Nineteen fourteen and say three acres three acres of carved stone\nAnd she wants to blow it up\nI think it's perfectly appropriate if they put signage they're all around that saying that this image of Jefferson Davis and Robert de Leon Stonewall Jackson commemorates the cause\nThat we do not honor of support and I think it's been very clear that the government of Georgia the government or the whole United States\nHas rejected the whole idea of the confederacy\nAnd the white supremacy that the confederacy was based upon very proudly and very directly that's fine\nBut this idea there and they're even black leaders who have spoken out against Stacey Abrams radical position about basically blowing up and Dinah mining Stone Mountain it's a Taliban position and it stinks\nAnd even worse was what she said last night now look I understand the\nDemocrats are trying to capitalize on this health care issue but you think the way to capitalize on the health care issue is to trash the entire free market system here is what Stacey Abrams the Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia had to say last\nNight [laughter] and higher here you're bound to free market [noise] [laughter] [noise]\nI remember being a free market [noise] so what you're going to have [laughter] the marketing in your heart [noise]\nDoing [noise] free marketing marketing [noise] [laughter]\nOkay the whole idea there is no profit and doing the right thing is entirely wrong\nBecause the very essence of the free market system the very essence of capitalism\nIs that you give people what they want and how do you know what they want is what they pay for\nAnd the notion that no one can make a profit doing the right thing that is only government that can provide for people\nIs utterly ludicrous\nAnd what she is saying here I Hope loses her the election I really really do because what she is a jets thing is that the free market system that we have to the extent that we even have a free market system any more than we do to a large extent you still have a lot of choice in your medical care\nAnd the idea that that is inappropriate when she says I've never seen the free market uh write a prescription and rural Georgia I'll bet there are people in rural Georgia who were ... listening to us right now\nWho have gone in and gotten prescriptions through the free market either because you have health insurance that covers it or because you pay for the prescription yourself and because it's made available at a local pharmacy now does that local pharmacy make profit by selling your prescription of course they do\nBut you see that's the whole idea of a free market you pay them rather than in slave in them\nAnd government forces a matter of enslavement this is a point that Iran next brilliantly is that basically to get people what you want to do you can either use money and pay them to do what you want them to do or you can use force\nThat that's basically it I Know of course you can persuade people to do what you want them to do and then you do something for them in return but that's a free market transaction as well\nGovernment transactions are always by their very nature about force and the idea that someone is the Democratic party nominee in the state of Georgia who believes that the the free market has to be rejected because you can't make a profit doing the right thing for\nGoodness sake look at the hospitals that we have right now most of which was fantastic job\nThe development of drugs that we have there's actually something about the development of the drugs that we have through the free market that is worth considering it involves a a a brand new movie as well we will get to that and your calls one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nOh you saw a definitely think it was ... or\n... or so so what does our government has to do with that and other with my problem with this with with what you're saying Li is I think it's\nBigger than what everybody's looking at it as much bigger than than the small picture a pop bombs is much bigger and more contained the there's more people involved and and what you think\nWell I again if that's the case then I think they definitely are we'll figure it out I uh I I appreciate your\nCall but I I Hope that people will not\nBegin seeing your neighbors and your associates who may be completely wrong politically and disagree with you\nAs definition only bad people because they disagree with you\nOn this I think\nPresident

all there's so many losses and there's so many regulations in so much government interference\nAnd more than half of every dollar that we spend on health care right now passes through the

New York\nAnd uh at at home and that could toner and Obama\nOffices but you see the point is why do they list CNN first as if she and there was a main target of the attack because that goes along with their general narrative that this whole thing is part and parcel of and associated with Trump's war with mainstream media\nLook outside for a long time I think the war with mainstream media is ill considered I don't think it serves the president I certainly certainly don't think it serves the Republican Party in going into this election I Do I think it's fair inappropriate to call out media when they distort things like this guy run does\nAnd it does assure you have to do that but um [noise] particularly in the next several days uh when when President Trump does his next rally and I don't know exactly when that is\nWhen President Trump does next rally or probably I think you will hear the president pulling back a little bit on the Trump versus media narrative\nBecause right now it's it's not helping the day after the election probably not helping the day of the election either a let's\nGo to your calls to what Carol in Prescott, Wisconsin Carol you're on the Michael ...

an important don't you think the line should be and try to imagine for a moment that he wasn't a liberal darling\nThat he wasn't the Democratic nominee for governor of the state this this kind of scandal would have sunk him\nAnd there's something else that that people are just wrong about I mean one of the big democratic issues that they're trying to raise across the country in the last Thirteen Days the election\nIs it President Trump is they hate filled beget and he wants to make war on transgendered people and wipe the mountains and when the concentration camps cetera et cetera et cetera\nAnd or can we agree here that\nGender identity should be an injured\nIndividual matter and that it should not be decided by the federal government\nAnd basically that is what the Trump Administration wants is not to impose federal standards about how you respond to somebody else who says I'm a woman even though he may be biologically equipped as a man\nAnd by the way in the New York times they have a\nA a big piece very sympathetic is transgender as Mrs anatomy does not determine gender experts say but there's this section and that I think is fascinating\nThey write and no one knows for sure why body and mind sometimes do not match\nBut being transgender is not a matter of choice Dr safer they quote this expert says ah it is not a fad or whim for transgender people it is generally an overwhelming sense that their gender is not the one on their birth certificates and gender is not about who they're attracted to it's about who they are\nBut see if they get the right to be who you are that doesn't mean that you have the right to demand that the government force everybody else to accept that\nCan we leave this deprive a choice and get the federal government out of this and at the very worst have some kind of state policy concerning bathrooms but for God's\nSake it's insane to think that anyone gains by having the federal government in Washington [noise] uh
