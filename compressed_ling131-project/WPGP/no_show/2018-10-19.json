junior senator from Nebraska who I think has become by a large margin of advantage or one of the most indispensable voices in the United States Senate his name is Ben Sasse a senator Sasse it's great to speak to you\nMichael but are there and you're right about those words if I said anything like that it might be asked me to what Bill off I wouldn't be able to pretend you can save the world by politics but my wife would just like we have bad\nOkay and this is not to say that politics is unimportant in your new book which is hosted up at our website the book is called them\nWhy we hate each other and how to heal and it's already a best seller and it should be because the very important book but one of the points that you make again and again and again is politics didn't get us into this mess and politics isn't going to get us out what do you mean by that\n[noise] yeah so I'm sure we're gonna talk today about politics\nDoes matter so I don't want to mislead an have your audience and saying but it doesn't it surely does\nBut what we're going through right now ... even in the chaos in our politics really didn't originate in our politics I think we need to know kind of where we are an economic and cultural history and we're going through a digital revolution which is awesome and lots of ways we're going to\nProduce more total goods and services than the world has ever known and all of human history a partly because of the digital revolution but one of the things that it does is it enables humans to think that we can be ruthless at exactly the same time that we have lots of social science literature now confirming what people have\nKnown for millennia a through philosophy of the allergy which has been rooted makes you happy do you have a family or do you have a few deep friendships do you have meaningful work do you have shared vocation do you have some projects with co workers and your community the local were spin community\nIf you have those things you tend to be happy that's about rooted nuts and yet our technology of letting us be ruthless and we haven't figured out the habits for this digital age this this rootless age and so traditional tribes good tribes family friends workplace et cetera there and collapse\nAnd so we're trying to find meaning grand good and evil meaning of politics and it's not going to work\nAnd and this is I think an important point that I can of emphatically agree with is that part of what has happened here with a Americans believing that you're either on our side or you're on the other side and the other side is pure evil and our site is pure good\nThat kind of political talked flows from the fact that people don't have more what used to be called normal\nUh relationships in support systems and so they look to politics I was thinking and did you follow the story senator I'm sure you did a of New York in Portland, Oregon there were fights in the streets between Proud Boys and anti thought\nAnd and the two groups of of dogs who seem to get great pleasure about actually being violent with one another and you follow that story\nI heard little bits and pieces of it but it's just so weird [noise]\nWell it it seems weird because again the question is what are you going to accomplish how does it make life better if you beat up some uh if you're from antifa new beat up somebody from Proud Boys or if you're from ... and you beat up somebody from antifa\nHow does how does that help anybody it's kind of like the jets and the sharks except those gangs were kind of lovable\nRight exactly and they could sing uh it it turns out\nThat you know if you if you beat down people who disagree with you about politics you don't necessarily accomplish anything that's lasting by doing that but the great quick hit a takedown is good to just sort of\nA pontificate in front of an audience of people who already agree with you but you don't persuade anybody's right and so when people use all these war metaphor for politics I think it's sort of miss understands what we think any American tradition politics are supposed to do\nPolitics maintain a framework for ordered liberty so that the really interesting communities can thrive and flourish the things that matter are the communities of love and your neighborhood where you persuade people to join with you in a project and there's a lot broken in our politics politics isn't serving those local community as well\nBut a lot of the political chaos and discord we face really is downstream I think from the collapse of these more natural or tribes of affection and community and you know your your point about um\nThe loneliness aligned New Year's there are half as many friends in America are in the last twenty seven years what does that mean social science data showed that in Nineteen Ninety the average American had about three point\nTwo friends the average American today has about one point eight friends half as many forty percent of Americans have either zero or only one confidant into all there was a loneliness like out there and a whole bunch of people go to politics say at least I can figure out how to have a\nUm an enemy with somebody else and that will make me feel like I'm On a team but it doesn't really work\nWe're speaking with Senator Ben Sasse a senator a Republican conservative Republican from Nebraska his book a new book is called them why we hate each other and how to heal\nUm let me try to make a case and you can ... down if you choose a that that part of the healing process has to be making sure Republicans when the house of representatives this time I think we're going to hold the Senate\nOr where you work but we need to hold the house of representatives and the the reason that I Would put that in terms of healing is the Democrats have already announced that if they take over the house they're going to be pushing the impeachment of justice Kavanaugh they're going to be pushing the impeachment of President Trump\nThat we're going to have investigations and politics of destruction and this incredible hateful bitterness then we all saw during the Kavanaugh hearings\nThat's going to go on and on and on some of the only way to prevent that is to make sure that you don't hand over the house of representatives to these ... mean spirited hostile and very destructive votes\nYeah Philip be a overwhelmingly agree and then also offer one week so the the overwhelming agreement is I'm I'm Out there raising money for Republican candidates I'm I'm writing checks I'm campaign and what people are so I absolutely want the Republican I Want us to not just\nAh expend extend our majority and the fact that I Want the Republicans to win and the house um\nBut at the ... and I'd also say I'm the second or third most conservative voter out of a hundred in the U.S so that so if you look at anybody score card on on who the most conservative senator I'm always on the top half dozen of everybody scorecard\nSo I'm not in different uh on political matters and this is not an argument hey let's just offering to buy off and have a much metal there's really nobody more conservative than I Am\nBut I think we need to recognize that because the Democrats in the house might\nDo something incredibly stupid and tried to impeach everybody under the sun or if they take the house stopping that from happening is not actually the same thing as healing it's just stopping a further slide into this political tribalism I think that the healing that's gonna satisfy people is\nIn a world where job duration is getting shorter and shorter and by the way economically that's pretty great we're producing more and more just smart humans with brains are figuring out ways to produce more goods and services\nAre more cost effective way that anybody has in the past that's great but it means average duration data from I was born in Nineteen Seventy two average tuition at a farm in the seventies was about two and a half decades for a primary breadwinner today it's four point two years and getting shorter one of the things that means is\nYou don't have relationships with your coworkers that last over the course of a lifetime\nAnd nails in particular aren't actually good at forming new relationships after about twenty five to Thirty years old and so we've got a lot more loneliness and the country politics can fix that problem rebuilding your neighborhood is what we have to do to fix that problem and this book is about fifty percent constructive about what do I do to rebuild in my neighborhood I Do I Do I joined with\nA local civic organizations that made them more likely to know the person who lives two doors away from me because that's actually highly correlated with being happy\nAnd and that's one of the big focuses in them or the new book by Senator Ben Sasse it's post at our website at Michael midday dot com\nOr a senator you you're also a very outspoken very deeply committed Christian man of faith\nAnd you do talk about uh the the need really for people to go to the center of communal affiliation which traditionally has been congregations here in this country\nWhat's gone wrong with the church do you think and with with synagogues or have that that has caused this sort of this affiliation particularly among young people\nYeah ... well fed so I think there are two or three different things happening at the same time I'm In\nIn the same way that the friendship and stick a nuclear families and shared work are heavily connected to place worshipping communities are as well that we we know in the literature now what makes people happy do you have a family do you have a few friends do you think your work is meaningful\nAnd do you have a philosophical theological framework to make sense of depth are suffering that drives happy that but one of the other things that happens in your local worship and community is you're with people in an intergenerational context overtime\nAnd it turns out that I've got two teenage daughters and the younger son as well but teenagers live the most generationally segregated lives that anybody has ever lived in human history\nThey really think the accident of birth year defines almost all the people they should associate with\nHow do how do we think that I Want to get to that with Senator Ben Sasse his new book is them\nWhy we hate each other and how they feel there's so much in this book about where we can go not just in politics and force but in our personal and economic lives will be right back with Senator Ben Sasse [noise] [noise]\nFor some of our political addicts and Washington to try to act like blood sport politics or forever more is what they want what they don't really love

fight and that's not going to work in a republic\nYeah I mean somehow World Wrestling entertainment is not what you want for uplift of of your kids or for the American future I'm speaking speaking of which is one of the things that last night I I I gave a talk or to a neighborhood group we had a couple of hundred people there was great\nBut there's this general sense that our politics is broken and I found myself ... when does it mean to you today\nA talking a little bit of a would I be wrong to say that the Nebraska Legislature which is non partisan and you and a camera on there is only one house and the legislature\nThat things work a little bit better in your state than they do and many others\nThey do a ... there was less than ... printing constantly for the cameras and even though my state is you know one of the four or five most conservative state for the union and that's one of the reasons I as one of the most conservative of either of you know it's that molecular from here\nEven though we're a very conservative place probably two to one Republican or the legislature people do not officially pockets that are really parties in our unit camera all our one one house a

they're less certainty that you're going to find the line between good and evil of for people who might have slightly different priorities of which bridge in which highway to find it's a much healthier thing to do bridges and roads by politics\nInstead of trying to do a good and evil heaven and hell by politics if if federal politics do what they should America constitutional hooked up with your maintain a framework for ordered liberty a broken the idea that people are created with dignity the image of God and they have rights by nature and government is our shirt project to secure those rights\nGovernment the author of sorts of right then government could do a small number of big things\nOr we need to build the fiber of strategy for the digital age et cetera but then most of

Bloomberg an increasing number of birds happen outside of marriage signaling cultural signaling cultural and economic shifts that are here to stay according to a major new report from the United nations\nForty percent of all births in the U.S now occur outside of wedlock\nThat is up from ten percent in Nineteen Seventy was that means to put it in context is that in in less than fifty years the rate of out of wedlock birth has gone up for a hundred percent\nWhy would that be\nThis a report was issued by un FDA that is the United nations population fund it's the largest international provider of sexual and reproductive health services says\nThe number is even higher in the European Union and the European Union already sixty percent of birds occur outside of marriage\nThe eat eat you report says likely sees more births out of wedlock because many member countries have welfare systems that support gender balanced childcare\nSo said the senior advisor in economics for the un FDA his name is Michael heroin and in an interview he said a public health care systems paid paternal leave early education programs and tax incentives given where\nParents support beyond what a partner can provide\nAnd is he saying from the un this is a good thing in Europe that you have sixty percent of kids born out of wedlock\nThat a good thing you think developmentally the government can do a better job than parents\nOr even the government can do a better job than some parents by providing these services one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six look the problems with a single parent families\nAre fairly obvious but one of the things worth\nNoting here with these numbers the reason that I'm indicating to you that that forty percent number born out of wedlock\nThe maybe a bit overstated at least in terms of meaningful consequences is because that includes couples who are actually living together but have decided for whatever reason not to get married\nAnd it is unclear what percentage of people who have a baby outside of marriage then follow that up by getting married\nIt's not a small number it's at least twenty five percent\nAt least one out of four people were a baby is born to a couple of outside of marriage end up getting married and particularly if they do that while the child is very young and has no recollection of and it it can provide some of the same benefits of marriage by we what are the benefits of marriage\nThat was one of those things if you've spent any time at all in your life around the baby you understand immediately\nIt's an extra pair of hands and extra pair of eyes it's a extra love that can be provided to the child and\nYou have one person who was also going to be responsible for trying to ...\nIn an income well what happens to the child or two children\nAnd this is not to blame a single mothers it's not to say that single mothers are terrible people or that because obviously there are wonderful wonderful results that do occur sometimes with single mothers but it's very very difficult\nAnd single fathers same thing it can happen that that things will work out beautifully but the idea that there should be brought up as an ideal or isn't acceptable ideal\nI think it's very destructive and if you take a look at the vastly greater likelihood of being involved in poverty\nCriminality self destructive activities like opioid abuse every risk for bad outcomes with the child is increased by a child who was raised in a single parent household one eight hundred nine five\nFive Seventeen Seventy six and somebody could say well what about gay marriage why uh what's what's been the impact there the fact is that gay marriage his remains so rare in the United states such a small percentage of the population one of the stunning things in this from the Census Bureau\nOf the marriages that have taken place in this country since ... since the decision that basically authorize gay marriage for every state in the union\nLess than one percent have been same sex couples yeah it's a shockingly low number and that's shockingly low because a lot of people\nIt assumed though there will be pent up demand there will be all these couples that have been waiting to get married still less than one percent the the highest rate for gay marriage and the country was there'll be shot San Francisco Seattle was second\nBut even in San Francisco their dream about one point for nine percent of all the marriages actually were marriages between a same sex couple\nThe data shows such births in the U.S in in the EU are predominantly to\nUnmarried couples who are living together rather than to single mothers the report says the data suggested societal and religious norms about marriage childbearing and women in the workforce has changed\nSaid Kelly Jones the director for the center on the economics of reproductive health at the Institute for women's policy research\nIs it a good thing is they've changed I I I don't believe that it is in other words it was it fairly common in American Life to have what we are cold shutdown weddings where a couple\nActually concedes the baby before they're married not recommended that they do but then there's social pressure for them to get married so the baby is welcomed into a married home\nOf course that's more desirable and and by getting married you were making a commitment to that child into each other this someone\nDown the idea that in most cases then of course I understand there are exceptions there are some times spouses who are abusive and self destructive and terrible and that can be a terrible situation for child but in most cases\nIt's better for a child to deal with both a loving mother and a loving father\nLet's go to your calls to Andrea in Columbus ohio and ray you're on the ... that show\n[laughter] thanks for taking my call you back um so um for me um I have a wonderful husband and um I I think that parents have to be\nMentally president we have to be physically present they have to be mentally president and whether you're a single parent or whether you're fortunate enough to have as well\nUm you have to be there for them and and unfortunately when it's just one person that have you carry the burden of thing they're physically and emotionally and spiritually um you can't do it all\nAnd you you cast specially if you're earning a living and deliberately and look at its it's very difficult and this is not to say the preschool is important and doesn't represent an important alternative\nIt's just that you see if we have in this country such a a an inclination to not make value judgments is that leads us to be\nBlind to the fact that it is more desirable for each child to come into the world in a married household if we can establish that\nAnd agree on that\nThen we've lost the whole idea of constructive social norms one of the constructive social norms that is\nWorth maintaining it seems to me is not applauding open racism or open anti Semitism or open racial or religious hatred of any\nKind so why are Democrats still applauding an open hater we will get to that question to coming up on them and that show [noise]\nMaybe you have to live with her grandma parents or relatives or other relatives show I think this can be done successfully as long as we are open minded and end up capture these translate\nWhat does that mean I Know it sounds good and adapting to trends of sounds very open minded and terrific but what does it mean\nI Would say that we need government programs horse that would help\nThat would uh specifically be tailored to kids living in a single parent situation\nOkay what kind of programs are you thinking of you want the government to send babysitters even when I was down by the government day care centers\nI think the gay character would be one way I think mariners where are you there your pay people who are professionals to go in and spend time with these ... these children and help them out\nOkay how do I let me just mention something to you Bob\nI I understand that sounds very generous and very nice\nBut you know what there are some times families who are married to each other who are raising children sometimes multiple children and their financially press is it fair that people like that who are having a tough time financially with their own kids at home should have a bigger chunk taken out of their income\nTo provide for other people who may be struggling with only one parent\nI yeah I Know you're going to hate the fish but ah I I I'm going to say this we should cut defense spending because it's just\nIt's just not necessary and we should also raised taxes on the rich\nOK well of course when you say I'm going to hate this on my shelves you down but the idea that cutting defense spending is going to be an answer right now we are spending more on interest on the national debt\nThan we are on defense and in my opinion I think the ended opinion most Americans the defense spending that we spend is the best investment we could possibly make\nAnd some of the very ambitious social programs are the worst one of the things that has happened in this country and has been shown by a wealth of books and information\nAh there is uh Charles Murray wrote the first book that the blue the lid off the welfare system in the way the welfare system has been designed particularly by Lyndon Johnson the great society actually encouraged\nOut of wedlock birth and they're Democrats who have written about that Daniel Patrick Moynihan who was a moderate Democrats [noise] road about the problems with family structure in the United states and he predicted exactly where we are\nThe government's role wars out of wedlock birth of course they're going to get more of it we'll be right back uh with when does a a public figure go over the line and expressing hatred\nWe'll get to that coming up on them as a child [noise]\n\nWhat's the

policy against than me\nI'm not married to the members of the Jewish community that don't like me\nA she she still it to to allow him to be associated in any way with someone respectable is a very

a recent Franklin's funeral he was just a few seats away from\nA former president the United states Bill Clinton and uh I Do not believe that Bill Clinton is anti Semitic in any way I don't believe he is a racist\nBut you you simply can't all of a sudden sale because Louis Farrakhan is old at this point and because he associates himself\nWith um with with black people and as a representative black people that anything that he says that is filled with racial hatred and its racial hatred by way against white people in general and it's still toxic instill don't deserve some kind of sanction go ahead like yeah I\nI I understand that Michael connected one more point go\nOkay so my point is that where this is coming from where they misled or in my opinion a a black people who are very hatred of the mayor capable of of wide where it's coming from ... in a kind of a revolution are fighting back\nAbout what happened to them as a people over time\nWhereas the other direction when it was the Nazis or whomever it was attacking people not because they did anything to them they made up conspiracy theories and made off that these people were doing stuff against them ... it really\nOkay I look I I understand but if you're talking about this goes into the for instance hatred of Turks against Armenians and the Turkish genocide against Armenians one of the justifications for that genocide which was real and it happened in the last debate knowledge of Iraq and so the Armenian people\nWere cruel to the Turks and they were undermining\nThe it doesn't matter if you were going to express
