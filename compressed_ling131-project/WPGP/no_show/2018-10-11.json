G.

mean it ... you look for taking time out of a radio show every night to talk about alliance defending freedom I appreciate everybody who stepped up with the contribution but do you ever wonder why I'm so strongly urging you to help\nIt's because of alliance defending clients like Kelvin Cochran\nThe Atlanta fire chief who lost his job for a starting a men's Bible study in his off duty hours in his voice you can literally here um his strength of character\nI Would gladly lay down my life in service to save another life because that's what firefighters and do the one thing we should not have to sacrifice is our God given freedoms the\nFreedom of speech and the freedom of religion these freedoms for which so many in our nation have sacrificed suffered and that we shouldn't be forced to surrender I Know you\nAgree with chief Cochran a and alliance defending freedom is fighting on his behalf bought alliance defending freedom is providing free legal support\nTo chief Cochran there defending him they're fighting for him for free and they do this with everybody who's religious beliefs are under attack\nTale and a bunch of other stories about how men are trying to obliterate women\nReally or we will we will get to that on the Michael method show also talked to Bobby Jindal one of my favorite commentators and one of my favorite former politicians uh Bobby Jindal former governor of Louisiana former star of the Republican House of representatives\nAbout why beyond this election we desperately need a same Democratic Party we do I even assuming Republicans manage to hold the house and hold the Senate it doesn't do any good for the country when the other side is just completely off the rails\nAnd and bizarre we will get to that with Governor Jindal and uh I also want to speak to you about the proposition\nOf revolution and the civil war their voices on the left\nAnd on the right\nWho say we're in the midst of a civil war or a cold civil war and may not be actual bloodshed but when you have people ranging from Carl Bernstein to on the left\nAnd Thomas Friedman of New York times on the left\nTo people like Victor Davis Hanson on the right and they're all saying yeah civil war is here we're on the verge of fighting here is uh what Carl Bernstein had to say on CNN about why he believes were in the midst of a civil war listen\nI think one thing we need to understand is larger context of all of this and that is that we are in a cold civil war in this country\nA than these two events are both lower investigation and the Kavanaugh nomination are almost a the the Gettysburg and and feeding the the\nThe absolutely essential battles of this cold civil war in both the Democrats and the Republicans unfortunately uh own understand that and are exploiting their\nUh instead of having two parties committed to finding out the truth in these two important matters we are now into serious tribalism ear\nOkay Gettysburg and anti them\nGettysburg over the three day battle there were over fifty thousand casualties I mean fifty thousand or anti them bloodiest single day in American history there were twenty five thousand casualties in a single days battle and by the way\nBoth of those battles for people who know your civil war history and I know a bunch of you to\nDo both of those battles resulted in the union successfully\nTurning back and invasion by Robert The late\nRobert de Leon the sounds in the army of northern Virginia had invaded uh Maryland and we're headed toward Philadelphia and maybe Washington DC\nIn the Eighteen sixty two in September of Eighteen sixty two when and heat them occurred the union stopped them ... by the way and that's part of the story in my book the American miracle and a battle of Gettysburg July of Eighteen sixty three\nOr just a less than a year later another invasion of the north this time of Pennsylvania by Robert de Leon the army of northern Virginia and again the confederates were turned back okay here's my question\nIn today's civil war if you think we're in the midst of one who's invading who wears the invasion occurring\nBecause see that's what you had to do it Gettysburg and emptied them you had to turn back the other side they were attacking your territory where is that happening in the United states right now one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\nThis is not easy stuff to me and and again it it it represents both sides I'm very glad that want to pose this to our to our website over at National Review\nThere is a a very useful piece by Jake cost who explains why Alexander Hamilton could be the best source of\nWhy we are not in the midst of some kind of civil war and now look\nOne of the points with Victor Davis Hanson makes and and ah vt age who is a a fellow at the Hoover Institution and Stanford and who have been privileged to me and I'm very glad he's been a guest on this show he's a brilliant historian\nAnd the one point that he makes that I think is worth considering is that the reason he believes we are headed toward real civil war in this country is because unlike previous eras in which there were very very grave divides in the United states I just saw this new movie called first man\nWhich uh with rock star break Tomlin we went out and saw that\nFilm last night and it's a terrific film ... will be reviewing coming up but the the the point about that era\nOf the Nineteen sixties and all of a terrible divisions that that wrecked the country and there was actual bloodshed and riots and destruction and all of that\nBut it wasn't geographical it wasn't so clearly delineated no there was one of the things that the civil war people say is the California should secede\nBy the way they're a ton of people who don't live in California who would say bravo go for it or send California with its thirty eight million people\nAnd uh let them go elsewhere by the way here's an interesting thing and I would just we're just having this discussion over the weekend it at our Sabbath table\nWhich is that if you look at the numbers without California not only the Trump when a genuine electoral college landslide but Trump would actually have won the popular vote by over a million and a half\nHillary's three million vote margin\nWas provided entirely by California and it's just California's different from the rest of the country didn't used to be it is now a and\nAnd by the way it part of the ideas different states seceding Massachusetts in New York maybe two\nAnd the Connecticut not yet but uh okay so you have a non contiguous country if they can all be independent countries there's a new revival up in Canada because of the true though administration of people calling for Quebec to be a separate country so why not\nLook I'm not serious about that and for the same reasons that Alexander Hamilton would argue in federal is number Lebanon number twelve\nHamilton says we are by nature one country because we're financially integrated with one another we're making money on one another we are not separated a in a meaningful\nWay we're we're going to make war on one another because we're all\nFinancially and injure locked we we had a story like that yesterday\nWhere there was a bar here in Seattle ... cheese and a group of college Republicans over at the University of Washington had said they wanted to celebrate the victory for Brett Kavanaugh by\nStaging a beers with Brett party at this uh at this particular bar\nAnd the bar responded to those plans by posting something on their website saying we try to be totally non political we don't want to be involved in politics at all and therefore are the people who want to stage eight beers with Brett or for Brett party or not really welcome\nOkay there\nWas talk that they were going to sue the bar 'cause you can't discriminate in the city of Seattle based upon political point of view\nAnd a cooler heads prevail then instead of suing they just went in and had their celebration they weren't thrown out\nTheir money was still good uh they didn't insist on everybody putting on a magazine that they didn't insist upon a heck during are bothering the other clients they had their party and maybe there are some other people who are literally crying in their beer about Kavanaugh's confirmation is fine but meanwhile\nThe reason ... did not make a federal case over this was because they wanted to make some money that's a very good motivation now you could ask and this is a very profound question so what happened with the civil war\nWhy was it that these cells in the north were financially integrated the answers they weren't that financially integrated the south had a completely different economic system in the south\nNearly half the labor force was slaves\nAnd everything in the south in terms of criminal law in terms of religion in terms of politics in terms of the economy was based on defending the institution of slavery\nAnd that was the brutal reality it was profoundly different in a way that California I'm Sorry is not that different from Texas if you disagree\nAnd you think we are in the midst of a civil war well I'll\nI'll give you some citations from people who agree with you and we can talk about it they're also one of the characters is civil war it was rather against rather well right now there's a congressional race [noise]\nWhereas brother against brother and sister [noise] will tell you about it and more coming up on them that that show one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nTwenty nine four five seven genes Seventy six zone Michael Savage [noise]\nOkay and you'll give me can you give me one indication I understand what you're trying to say Melvin I Do but let me ask you this can you think of one law that either a justice Kavanaugh is going to shore up\nOr a law that he's going to strike down where he is going to act to keep power concentrated for white males which which laws are you most concerned about their\nUh what I signed a law start with fair does act equal right um\nWell that's that's the that's the fourteenth amendment to the constitution and that's where the fourteenth amendment was passed to gene guarantees every citizen regardless of color or national origin regards the equal protection of the law right and let me go ahead\nNo small part of it how we ended up on our watch\nYeah but when you ... what what laws do you think right now concentrate power in the hands of white males and your name one because that would be unconstitutional\nRegarding what what was right that that's been the last in Nineteen sixty three\nRight but that's not being put me in a lot\nOf course is of course it is if I look Melvin if I dared to uh offer a different salary for someone based on his gender alone\nOr if I Would be struck with a lawsuit so fast and they have lost its like this all the time but the the point is and this doesn't mean that there aren't cases where sometimes people are opposed to hiring men by the way\nThere are cases where people are a whole post hiring men in some other imposed hiring women but the idea that that this gender gap in terms of pay is because of discrimination it has been answered so many times Lenny suggest you go to the website of Christina hot summers\nAre a woman by the way who's written about this so persuasively and and the idea that right now this is a problem for our world will get into that a little bit more close to two thirds of all graduates of four year colleges and universities in America are female and uh I suspect\nThat by the time my granddaughter is Twenty one right which is a little while but by that time women will be earning more than men on average\nUh we'll be right back on the ... civil war or not [noise]\n\nThe one thing I loved about working with him we got to pray with our patients and I could do that without feeling like I was

hour about particularly spectacular divide with a political family out in Arizona\nI Will get to that and just a moment but um in in National Review Victor Davis Hanson a writes how when and why has

nightmare than than before even because then you have three California's not just one okay\nUm but the fact is the the initiative didn't qualify for the ballot was ruled off the ballot by the courts in California at seriously it is very very small numbers of people who actually in California one to succeed even with Trump is president\nAnd it is not true the Governor Perry said the Texans should succeed when Obama was president President a and this kind of talk\nOne of the things that people\nSaid about the civil war and it was literally true it it was rather against brother\nMary Lincoln the first lady of the land wife of Abraham Lincoln had a brother who was in the Confederate Army\nIt was a real division she was from Kentucky and ah in Kentucky particularly that that was a it it turns out he did not officially leaves the union but there were a lot of Kentucky Confederate who personally did\nIn any event that idea of family division has been highlighted in this crazy situation

I'm\nAnd basically it is worth remembering how much worse it was\nIn the in the Nineteen sixties and\nWhat a long way we've come\nIn America in the last fifty years and made that continue\nLet's go to a your calls to John in Seattle John you're on the Michael ...\nMichael I Love your love your show you that the balance great American but younger numbers are way off in the percentage of people who absolutely crazy man\nI'm I cannot drive around with any kind of a bumper sticker I cannot express my views and we have people sending Weissman for the president you have or senator um Schumer to nine due process the cabin on issue\nI Know every woman I Know has had three or four cases of unwanted roaming parents very simple misdemeanor as a way to solve it and nobody's talking about it but the bottom line is what happened with cabbage is the rate of due diligence in this country we have to fight back those people should be mentally sentence\nSchumer took a vow\nTo defend the constitution in nine states and he specifically said cabinet does not have the right to be ... that is outrageous and it's criminal\nAll even a few months ago\nBut I'm surely surely something is going on that might be worth our attention\nBut that's something else that is going on\nA that is very much worth our attention is the forthcoming mid term elections where we elect all four hundred and thirty five members\nOf the house of representatives and I believe we're electing thirty five new U.S senators because there are a couple of special elections there in the mix and uh\nHow's it going to go well it's a toss up\nAnd it's close but there is some very very sound advice it seems to me that is given to Democrats by a leading Republican and somebody who is one his own house elections by huge margins one two terms also by huge margins as the governor of Louisiana\nHis name is Bobby Jindal and he wrote a terrific piece that appeared in the wall Street Journal under the headline Democrats try some self restraint governor Jindal thanks very much for joining us again are always great to talk to you\nLike Oh thank you so much for having me back on your show it's always great to talk to you and your audience as well\nI appreciate it one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\nWhat you say make so much sense in other words just to give people a flavor of what you're saying you were Democrats Democrats you write can support gay marriage without forcing small business owners to violate their religious beliefs and participate in the wedding ceremonies\nThey can defend abortion without opposing the sorts of restrictions common in Europe including waiting periods and bans on midterm abortions they can fight global warming without making obsolete many Americans livelihoods in lifestyle\nIf all of that is possible why do you think the Democratic party seems to be moving in the other direction\nWell Mike I think this is really an important moment for the Democratic party and they have to decide are they going to listen to their vote extreme base or\nAre they going to try to become and remain a mainstream political party in the United states now look I lift those another policy positions that they're certainly not going to kill the conservative Republicans like me and I suspect many of your listeners\nI think by by trying to come to the middle of the Democratic party can actually recapture some of those voters who voted for Trump who weren't consistent traditional Republican voter or they can make the decision they want to become angrier and even more radicalized\nAnd what they really have a choice if they pursue things like trying to impeach President Trump or trying to each\nBrett Kavanaugh insist on open borders they insist on abolishing ice or Medicare for all\nThose are great talking points in a fight their base and they can write a lot of money from George Soros and folks like that\nI don't think they're going with a lot of elections I think that if anything there to help that President Trump winning re election I think the worst thing they can do is to continue to go to the far left but I think they've got a choice to make do they want to come back in the middle or they want to continue to be the angry far left party\n... ... one of the things and I heard this a a theory from a friend of mine is a long time activist in in Republican affair she has a theory that what the Democrats are trying to do is to go so far to the left\nThat are there has to be set up a middle parties somewhere that would run some kind of quote bipartisan ticket\nAnd uh they feel that that that kind of middle party with a celebrity taking the middle with take enough votes away from President Trump to ah to to give Democrats victories in two thousand twenty what do you think\nI think that if they decided that their plan President Trump\nCan start measuring the drapes already I mean a plan on being an office for another six years the reality is that there is at least thirty five forty percent of voters they're going to stick with President Trump to matter what you're showing that time and time again he had those voters in the primary against running against several Republican ... the head of voters\nThrough his highs and lows the campaign against Hillary Clinton any that voters\nDriving tier two years the reality is look the Democratic party should stop focusing obsessing with President Trump with Republican Party they should come up with a real solutions to the problems that are\nConcerning the American people if they continue to go to extremes you know the problem that the Democratic party has right now is that they're trying they're trying to persuade anybody they're simply trying to fight and motivate\nThe most liberal members of their base\nAnd they practically given up on the middle class but working class voters that so famously went for President Trump now these are not always reliable Republican voters\nAmerican Party cannot get complacent we don't only voters they're not going to be loyal voters but they will vote for President Trump and they will vote for Republican officeholders as long as they continue to deliver so as long as you got to cut taxes and cut regulations he's done what he promised they move the embassy in Israel to Jerusalem is standing\nWith Israel and the international stage is defending their Second Amendment rights is defending the religious liberty rights he's pointing conservative judges\nSo you know these are the voters that will go and follow and vote for leaders that are actually going to do what they promised that we're going to do\nPresident Trump is done if the Democratic party really wants to win back the blue collar voters many of them are union voters and many of them living in the heartland in between those two cos if they really want to get back those voters\nThey've got to stop the the crazy rhetoric they've got to stop the extreme policies I'm not optimistic they'll do that but I I wanted to leave lay out the choice that the party faces\nYou can already see the Democratic candidates they're gearing up to run for president twenty twenty they're already trying to run that they're competing to see who can go further to the left and their policy positions are becoming even more radical but one simple example you listed as a few examples\nThey can be for multiculturalism that doesn't mean they have to reject faith or traditional values from the public square\nOr patriotism for that matter ...\nRight that they've almost made it into a ... for some reason the Democratic party thinks it's a winning issue to put down that the American flag or or put down patriotism are being proud of being an American and I just don't think that's a winning formula to be being a majority party in this country\nBy the way that's one of the reasons I think is so important that Ted Cruz windows race in Texas because ... is really bad the entire farm\nOn his support of a kneeling during the national anthem for pro football players and again this whole idea that we can have American innovation or I mean you're you're a child of immigrants my mother was an immigrant to this country\nAnd uh one of the things that's great about most immigrant families is patriotism love of country loving America\nBut the Democrats by running against that\nUh it it's it's a disaster let me give you a challenge governor Jindal which is that\nUh would you write about the Democratic party I Know a lot of our critics there are a lot of people on the left who would say it's even more true about the Republican Party they've gone so far to the right they've lost the mental they've given up on the middle or what do you say to people like that\nOr I think a couple of things I think both parties are absolutely guilty of thinking they're permanent majorities and I hate us in the column and the reality of the voter always have to remind them unfortunately if you think about the middle east everybody remembers who hurt them yesterday and they would they want to get their avenge tomorrow and in both parties are certainly guilty of that but\nJust look at the Kavanaugh hearings as a great counter example look Brett Kavanaugh was not the most conservative justice that the president could have nominated he he's a fairly moderate establishment figure a Republican now I Am not a moderate ... between the two parties\nYeah law graduate yell undergraduate or graduate you know he went to a very good schools work in the Bush administration\nAnd even before the allegations came out against him he looked at the Democratic history on existing extreme reaction\nAnd I think what you see it as easy to the extreme overreaction from the left I Would argue that looks certainly there are folks are in both parties that that go to extremes\nBut I think when you look at what the president is actually done in terms of cutting taxes cutting regulation in terms of the growth we're seeing the American economy\nThis is what a majority of the American people want it you know the the reason he won the election and this is a very important point you didn't say one thing get elected and do something else everything that drives the Democrats crazy about President Trump he absolutely promised on the election trail he was going to do these things\nAnd that's why he want the reality is it's not that voters or or you know it's not that Trump voters are disappointed in him or what he's done they're actually getting what he promised them on the campaign trail so\nBut I I think the Democratic party has got a fundamental choice\nI think part of the problem is that when you look at the activist base you look at the donor base they will punish Democrats don't want to compromise you know look at the Democratic party already made up their minds and cabinet before the hearing started they they tore person on that committee and almost every one of the month ago came out and said they were going to oppose them\n... and I think they're trying to appeal to the most liberal donors most liberal activists\nWhat they forget that was that's not where most American voters are most American voters don't want to abolish ice most American voter\nDon't think that the police are across the board you know out there trying to hurt innocent people most American voters want to stand for the ... the American flag and most American voters are to your point patriots I'm reminded when asked President Obama about you know he did he think America was accepted on and remember that kind of wishy washy answer\nYeah he said yes we're exceptional the same way that Greeks thing Greece's exceptional and Brits think Britain as ... as an exceptional in other words we're not a but I'll tell you is exceptional ebbs Bobby Jindal his piece Democrats try some self restraint\nAddressed appeared in the wall Street Journal and it's terrific a governor I Know you have to run we will look forward to talking to you next time and we'll be right back on self restraint and politics on them in that show with your calls [noise]\nYou know the rest of the right has been in this place for many many years\n... water poll moles that ... that comes on frankly during your show in Houston it talks about war it's all about we're in a war and so and if ... if you listen to talk radio call silly talking about how the war we're having with ...\nI I think as as you know I I agree with you that does happen and I think it's unfortunate and I don't think you will hear that rhetoric on this show because I think it's wrong I don't think this is a war and I'll tell you one David and that said this many times of the goal of a war is to destroy the enemy\nTo kill him basically and uh the the goal of politics is to persuade people\nMichael is your friends who it is so don't know I'm a yeah OK you particularly don't see it but if you're going through the people who you are\nOkay you know what I you probably have some friends who have some strange ideas to right\nThat's right [laughter] I just wait a minute wait a minute what about Beto O'Rourke\nIs not my friend I I'll probably go for 'em but they're not a friend of mine\nOkay we'll do vote for him a because again if you do that you're encouraging this left were drift of the Democratic party David ... I'd like to sit down I imagine that you and I would find a lot that we would agree on it and by the way I Do agree with your basic point that's why I went to your call first\nIs because I think it is true that this tendency also exists on the Republican side\nBut I'll tell you it was very refreshing to me and I think it's one of the most important speeches in recent years when Susan Collins spoke on the Senate floor\nEvery word she said about a justice capital\nWas measured it was balanced it was persuasive it was none of this rhetoric is the other side is all wrong and we're All right and this is the basic point because even if you leave out the independent voters the people who vote regularly and they go back and forth between Republicans and Democrats\nThe biggest group of prospective voters in America the people who don't vote on who aren't interested the people who represent this uh Daniel Tosh who are dumb as blank and don't vote and don't pay attention to try to get people to pay attention it it doesn't\nWork to say that we're on the verge of Armageddon and and we're all getting ready to kill\nEach other what it actually works better seems to me saying well we have some good ideas about how we can change things for the better and in the midst of a big down day on Wall street today in a horrible horrible hurricane about the strike the panhandle in Florida\nMaybe we can remember that we all have bigger obstacles and enemies than [noise]\n\n\nThe average person considers estate planning just for the wealthy attorney Michelle Conti host of countries law honesty planning for the everyday person there's a lot that goes into it people take more time picking our\nCar they're going to buy where they're going to go to dinner as opposed to what\nTo my children the state will dictate who gets what if you don't indicate to is to recede yourself on your passing we want to make sure we planned appropriately so that they get the best of both worlds they continue to receive the benefits and they get the inherent in\nThe other thing you have to think about is planning we try to be proactive and the approach\nThat we minimize any type of tax consequences when somebody dies depending on the value of the state these taxes range anywhere from four and a half\nTo forty percent so we try to make sure that the beneficiary ruler Steve as\nMuch as they legally are able to hear more on countries will on Sunday Morning at eight thirty here on the answer for immediate help visit county law P.

will start to be civil again if they take control the house in the Senate\nWhat's happened to the Democratic party the party that was for the working people the party that was the blue collar the party that was true civil rights and women's rights what's happened to Michael and I was a kid my buddy and I fought through line so that we can shake hands with John F. Kennedy which we did\nAnd then a few months later he gave a talk that Democrats said that's not what your country can do that you would ask what you can do for your country and as corny as it sounds six months later I joined the air force and spent four years serving I\nKind of stuck right from the Democrat Democrat that I Would support\nYeah that's not corny that's that's a that's an American that's an American uh\nAnd that's a Patriot's day and it is in court incredible in what I Love about the reminder of a Mac because you guys are fighting for the values that so many of us so many millions of Americans hold near and dear our hearts I mean we're watching this stuff play out and Dan it's hard to even\nComprehend with Maxine Waters urging people to get in people's faces and Cory Booker and all these huge Democrats\nAnd each crucial November six\nIn many ways is every bit as important as November twenty sixteen watch\nYou got to look at the results what are they doing this starting up to people is starting up hatred they're not trying to unify us\nAnd that's the problem is what's wrong with them they lost an election come on ... worked together there are people that Democrats and were urging them not to let the radicals continue to take over your body you got\nAll kinds of groups\nExtreme is people who start fires start fights\nAnd that's not the America we love than we wind down let's work\nDan let's remember and I'm Sorry if people say well my politicizing this again but it's a fact they're all Democrats ...

but isn't that part of the but isn't that part of the the the the the reveal about today's Democratic Party isn't that the fact that there there's not one that's willing to condemn this behavior isn't that because that reflects who the Democrats are today\nAnd then they attack Susan Collins who has been a friend who was voted for them for a lot of issues and the attacking her like she's a mean laid\nNo just he has terrorists going after ... after who are calling her a phony feminist and all this crap it's unbelievable I mean the stuff we're witnessing is just something that is\nThat is

distant third and you're about to see why\nThey put their faith in a guy like Don Lemon who ... just as it becomes on glued when a guest rightfully points out that Democrat\nActivists in protesters who chased a U.S senator out of a restaurant are indeed a mop Don Lemon doesn't think that's mob mentality\nDon Lemon is a Democrat period\nBut let's listen to the lady who almost became president ever so close close she could she could feel that she could taste\nBut alas\nShe didn't make it across the finish line the American people rejected Hillary Clinton and she still can't quite get over

I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... the only thing that the Republican whom who\nRecognize ... strength and you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell\nReally demeaned the confirmation process\nDo did you hear the lady who would be president just threaten the country does that's what she's doing she's threatening the entire country you better\nUnderstand she's saying ... you can't be civil with Republicans not until Democrats gained control of the house and the Senate she almost became president\nWith that kind of mindset and of course thankfully the voters saw through our hurt or call them deplorable hurt or demean more than half the country with the wave of her hand\nKnows who she is and what she is\nBut you're not going to have a Democrat in today's party condemn Hillary Clinton's comments you're not going to have a Democrat condemned the behavior\nOf these protesters who are hounding Republicans and conservatives in the public face chasing a Fox News channel personality through the subway in New York\nHarassing him trying to get people to to try to incite people against him\nTo know what would happen if these two so called Democrat liberal comedians who harassed Brian kill made on the subway with the video rolling 'cause they think they're so cute if somebody stuck a knife and Brian kill made what they'd be saying that they took the video down by the way from their stupid\nNo nothing cowardly site but these are Democrats here's a Democrat Don Lemon look check this video out last night he's got Matt Lewis a Daily Beast columnist talking about the behavior of today's Democrats again don't get don't get\nFooled or snow covered by labels like antifa or\nFascists or even protesters right these are Democrats who are ... hounding and harassing people in public listen to Don Lemon with Daily Beast columnist Matt Lewis listen very carefully\nTo what a liberal Democrat host like Don Lemon has to say about this mob behavior from the Democrats\n[noise] is it my behavior no it's not moderate for that and they're angry about the way the ... the way the country's going and the policy we know that before you jump into okay I'll make a point I Can't make it interesting that\nYou're hearing they're making a point I hear the moderator or the host or are you are\nGiving a liberal lotto writer and a host of this call tell you that you're giving lot on tell me why they didn't think\nThat I'm like look up the word mob and then they sit there and yet I\nLooked up the word modern the dictionary and you should also as a Republican look at the count the times I ever felt and look at the ... or whatever it is you are whatever it is you are look at the constitution of the United states and it gives people the right to protest\nYeah and it doesn't say where you can only do we know man I met clean like I said\nOkay okay I have a drink so you can do whatever you want and you can leave that so if you want but let me ...

Louis for daring\nI'm doing fine thanks my good\nMy position is is um ... it specially with the comment on Lehman that you can protest anywhere any time a this is I say we should take on a stronger

back bench house member will be three a long serving highly recognize Republicans in a primary to become governor\nUm she was popular in there and then she was she actually supported Rubio in the
