worse than Saudi Arabia because he ran is a far greater danger\nTo the west and to Israel and Saudi Arabia is which is a danger more to itself although I fully acknowledged the shouting contribution to a fundamentalist awful McGraw says around the world so on what grounds but you think otherwise\nThe group that did nine eleven was from Saudi Arabia the um the money they want to I Will never to

President Trump's approval rating is the highest it's ever been\nOkay don't get too excited it's forty seven percent\nBut forty seven percent to forty nine percent disapproval it means that President Trump has actually closed the gap between disapproval and approval is now basically tied the Americans or even evenly split\nAnd one of the things that I found stunning I Am by the way in the midst of a battleground talkers tour I'm tonight in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania [noise]\nUh and uh then on Thursday I'll be home God willing in between and on Thursday I'm going to be in Minneapolis where there are also some very hot congressional races and the governor's races and Senate races and more\nBut right now it's all so tight your vote\nReally really matters one of the things that I've found stunning is that um I was watching CNN in the airport when I had I had to change planes about six this morning\nIn Washington DC I flew from Seattle, Washington DC and from there to Pittsburgh and um\n[noise] in the airport that Tom Perez on who is the Democratic national chair and uh they showed in the new numbers about Trump soaring approval rating\nAnd ask them why and he had no idea he couldn't answer it\nAnd the answer is very obvious is that Americans have gotten used to Trump\nThey um and most Americans like the economic situation where in President Trump gets very very good marks on the economy and for most people the economy is the most important part of the job\nUm meanwhile with an election this close vote fraud is a huge problem we will be talking about that later in the show there's a new book the suggested it is far more common than people on the left ever wants to lead on and far more threatening\nAnd uh [noise] there is also a um an issue lurking in the deep background which is the issue of marijuana\nWe did um [noise] a segment on the show\nA couple of weeks ago about a a a guy who said look I'm just a normal I'm middle aged a stay at home dad\nWho almost ruined his life through marijuana addiction\nAnd this individual by the way is for legalize marijuana\nIs going to be joining us on the show to tell his story you have to answer your questions and to take your comments that all coming up on the Michael ... a one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nIf you can answer the question that a Tom Perez could not answer why President Trump's approval rating would be going up so dramatically the last couple of weeks [noise]\nHonestly part of it as the Kavanaugh situation part of it is the caravan situation anybody here who thinks that we should simply opened the gates\nAnd and lead in all the people from the caravan\nHe even those of us who support him immigrants and immigration reform in ice import immigrants that I support immigration reform\nThe idea of simply saying that you get seven thousand people together and they are marching to the United states and they're all waving Honduran flags well of course you let them in because they're having a tough time in Honduras but there are a lot of suffering people right\nBut the notion that that uh\nThat that somehow one of the Democrats said about this what is the right thing to do\nI think the right thing to do is to make it clear that before they walk the other two thousand miles they have left to walk before they get to the United states border they get a very very clear idea that President Trump and most other Americans who actually can think about this with anything like an open mind\nAre going to say no this is not a good idea\nYou don't simply a let people into the United states without authorization without security clearances or then have them flood the system for processing asylum applications one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nMeanwhile somebody who seems to have a position on everything\nBut I don't really think he has a position on the caravan because how could he he is a battle or work\nAnd one of the questions I Would ask here\nIs what is so great about that's how he is he is now inspired people\nThis the Democratic nominee for US Senate against Ted Cruz President Trump is going down to campaign for the guy who once called lie in bed and people say oh to Trump such a hypocrite this happens in politics all the time\nPeople who were opponents to run against each other then come together and work together\nIt happens all the time of Ronald Reagan and George to a age W. Bush George W. Bush running in the primary against Ronald Reagan in Nineteen eighty attacked him pretty harshly he said the Reagan was practicing ... economics\nAnd then later he embraced Abu to economics a Reagan chosen to be as vice president and uh they honored and came to like each other or this is\nAll remarkable what is going on that the election is so close but that hasn't stopped people from breaking into song\nOver the great Robert O'Rourke that's his real name known as bait so the Democratic wonder boy of this election cycle who was inspired melodies like this\nPast them God selling\nGuy is totally [noise]\nMuslim men so\nOn the mega burned by turning this new\nPeople\nAnd you know now and you know [noise] [noise]\n[noise] I mean\nMen no I'm\nStill still that little that little bit [noise]\nOkay the last time I think that anyone sort of inspired this many songs are in a campaign was President Trump\nYou remember we spent several days playing the various Trump songs I like the one to get on the Trump train 'em in any event the better our work and the the ex to see about that token someone explained to me\nWhat it is exactly that is so inspiring to people about Beto O'Rourke\nWhat what it is that that stirs the soul and and makes people so excited that even though he is almost certainly going to lose his challenge to Ted Cruz who's been a decent hardworking senator\nAnd he's a conscientious than substantive conservative\nAnd by the weight knows so much more about the issues than ... ... what is it the better our work is going to do for the country\nThat inspires reactions like this and and basically with ABC News telling him he's not just a candidate he's a rock star listen\nWe of one of the most\nObvious strategies that I've seen them more than a in a modern campaign to show off everywhere all the time for every one\nYou can be without interruption in from the federal back\nMuch I Love your thinking well you know there's so many\nOkay I'm or they're going to be a lot of disappointed folks in Texas are coming up on election day Fifteen days from now one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number of President Trump\nHas his own response see as a new video out about uh the Democrats offering mobs not jobs or we will get to that and uh we will get to\nWhat the election comes down to there is also a a a a very alarming piece in New York Times at least has meant to be alarming I didn't think it sounded so bad\nIt's by David Leonhardt and it's what if the Republicans when\nEverything the fact that\nThe New York times even thinking about that that shows you which side has momentum at the moment we will be right back on the Michael ... that show with your calls [noise]\nMichael you rock Michael [noise]\nTwenty nine four five seven genes Seventy six Michael Savage [laughter]\n\nOkay there are two reasons I think you might be wrong I I watched a Beethoven performing and it is a performance that sort of a performance art as they say when he was doing a town\nHall in or\nNear El Paso which is where he's from and you are very friendly crowd and very friendly moderator Dana Bash from CNN [noise]\nAnd uh she she asked him very directly about running for president and he said no if he gets elected senator he'll serve all six years of senator now of course he can throw that away but he said it's so definitively\nThat it leads me to believe that\nNo he he didn't rule out running ever but he I think he ruled out pretty well running in two thousand and twenty said that if he loses the race is going to want to spend some more time with his family of course they all say that\nUm [noise] and some of that it might even be true okay the the other reason that I think he wouldn't be so solid for the race\nWas he was pushed and pushed\nOn the fact that he has said before the race even began that as a member of the house of representatives he thought there was enough evidence of obstruction of justice inclusion that he could vote to impeach Trump now and he was asked about that as a U.S senator and he didn't back away from it\nHe is for impeachment he he believes even before the Mueller investigation is wrapped up even before it's reported anything and\nYes they've indicted some people and they've uncovered some stuff and I I I think the Mueller investigation needs to finish and maybe it'll take some time to finish it needs to finish but better or doesn't think so he agrees with a lot of those people on the far right the devil just forget about the investigation let's impeach him anyway\nAnd I don't think that's a popular position and I don't think it sets them up well for a future presidential run or anything of the time hey I appreciate your call um I I'm a I Will get back to this and to David Leonhardt piece\nWhat if the Republicans when everything will we now know President Trump has made a couple of statements and I think one of them at least to sort of flummoxed some of his age or there's talk about another tax cut\nThat may be announced before November first that soon\nAs very soon a and he says it's people are going to love it it's going to be a big middle tax a flat tax cuts middle class tax cuts\nAnd a and then there's this whole matter of a transgendered support by government [noise] is this a political ploy ... substantive we'll get to

other than military so that's very important but we're going to get to the bottom of it\nUh we we uh there's more to that and we really it's a lot of our country not our our our battle anywhere I called to talk about the uh the planned invasion\nYou are you calling the caravan of planned invasion\nYes sir\nWell eight Ito given the fact that we've had so far this year I think we've had about twenty\nTimes the number of illegal entries into the country this year the illegal entries are way up because the economy is very hot right now people are getting across\nAnd uh this I'd only constitutes an invasion I think it is a challenge to our whole immigration system\nIs basically an attempt to raise the border and say that um we have to let in anyone who wants to come in and most Americans don't believe that law doesn't say that so [noise] but when you say in a planned invasion what do you have in mind\n\nUh I think it's just a part of the the war or the battle between conservatives and left us that are trying to take down America and this is the latest strategy\nExcept if you look at those people and I've seen ... and of\nCourse they play a lot of very close compassionate a video showing some of these poor people\nWho I think are hungry or scared I'm hopeful ah they they do not appear to be actors or manipulated their just desperate people from\nPlaces in the world that are deeply deeply dysfunctional look I I think that President Trump is doing the right thing to basically make a stand and say no we simply cannot just open the doors to anyone in this country that's not going to be our immigration policy\nBut I think he makes a very big mistake when he threatens to cut off foreign aid and I'll tell you why the best way to prevent other incidents like this and so the seven happening every week or every month\nIs not to cut off foreign aid to Honduras it's to coordinate more foreign aid to Honduras to take these people these seven thousand people I think that's how many they think there are right now\nAnd to bring them back home where you can work with them to try to make Honduras a more livable place because that's really going to be

that that the um the reporter that got killed I I feel that that really not are right it lots of guys get killed all over the place we're not we're not up in arms about it both\nSure it's a bad situation that happened but why are we getting involved country insolvent\nBecause we are and we are involved with the country I mean the the argument is we\nAh we have a lot of financial dealings with Saudi Arabia\nNow of Saudi Arabia is not a country we give foreign aid to their one of the richest countries in the world but it's a country that we saw a lot of arms to him as President Trump says we have a pending one hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal and if it doesn't go through with us if we cancel it for some reason they'll turn around and by the arms from\nOr China or Russia and I mean\nWhy does that have to do what is apt to do with this guy can say oh\nWell ... what's left is trying to do and I think it's despicable frankly is to suggest that somehow um Mohammed bin Solomon the prince crown prince and Saudi Arabia got the idea that it was okay to kill reporters because President Trump is always so critical of the press\nAnd I think he ... obviously President Trump has never called on anyone to kill reporters\nAre and ... do I think it's unfortunate that President Trump made some reference and it was a joking reference to Greg Gianforte in one of the worst

regularly for\nMore than two decades\nAnd I would say at least the last Fifteen Years or so I I overdid it so a long time how do you know you over did it\nWell now that I'm Silber I can look back on some of the money have years when I was high and realize that uh that pot was causing a lot of my problems you know I was having\nA public meltdown African or even a getting into fights or I was doing crazy stuff in public that I probably wouldn't have done if I'd been sober you know and I also\nWasn't sleeping normally I I was I was at a ... and in addition to that I spent a lot of my time thinking about marijuana about how to get it about how to consume and about the consumers with\nAbout trips I could take that revolve around marijuana and you know it just kind of became the center of

Eighteen years and I have a son and the whole time I was still you know I was a you know basically like a professional hipster right I've read I published a capital is ten bucks\nI had a couple of a

on that and what advantages\nDo you see now that you're not smoking pot on a regular basis\nYou know it's kind of ... because in some ways marijuana was a creative force in my life I Would you know I I wrote almost\nAll my book I all the time and I I Can't although in retrospect there there's a lot of there are a lot of scenes and the novels that are about getting high and I I think there'll be fewer of those but you know I ... it helped me come up with certain like fancy indecent jokes\nUm and he was a creative stimulant in some ways but uh so I've actually been I Would say like in some ways less creative since I stopped smoking pot but everything else in my life is so much better I mean I'm just I'm more present\nFor my family and my friends um I'm Better organized a I I I Can't ... making more money but I feel like life is in order professionally in a way that it was with\nIs that as much chaos and I'm and most importantly I'm not having the emotional highs and lows that it's happening when I was using marijuana you know I'm not I'm not super up all the time and and then when I when I bought 'em out I don't bottom out it there's no there's no high or low like I said\nSo I'm not having those melt down that would characterize a sort of my my addiction cycle\nEight to nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\nSpeaking with Neal Pollack who wrote about how marijuana almost ruined his life yeah one thing you\nYou mentioned you've been married for Eighteen years did your wife ever share a your enthusiasm for a lead\nNo in fact you know she says the opposite does she she has no interest in it at all um and\nShe many many times tried to tell me that I had a problem or just you know I Would just shovel or off I you know 'cause the the myth is that marijuana is an addictive it in some ways it's considered a health food um and so I\nJust you know even though I had a history of alcoholism in my family\nUm and obviously had the addiction gene I just did it it just didn't register with me um maybe it should have you know if I was stuck in behind the dumpster on the weight walking to the gym it's like you know take a hit like it'd be high wall of working out there that's not the sign someone who is\nNecessarily healthy but uh you know I just\nI ah I didn't see it she did and she's so grateful when I finally made the decision to quit\nYou know I ... you use the figures in your um in your piece and I I I think they're generally accepted figures from the journal of the American Medical Association and based on studies done in a number of countries they suggest that ah some nine percent of people\nWho ever use marijuana end up getting addicted and Seventeen percent of people use marijuana is teenagers did you first use a weight as a teenager\nYeah I smoked once at a party when I was in high school but you know when I was when I was a teenager and this was you know the Nineteen eighties I was\nI was sort of a a go getter do good or student council type sort of a modeling myself maybe not politically but like at least in terms of my lifestyle on Michael J. Fox the character from family ties uh-huh I Know that was my model like I Will go rank all it would\nBe successful I was going to be a great American citizens and um and so part didn't really play into it\nUm you know college I kind of um I I went a little uh I I I I'm a member of generation X and so you know I I I became kind of a a a grouchy pop culture cynic but I still wasn't doing a lot of drugs\nOr it wasn't until I was in my twenties that I um\nThat I really started a consuming it\nSo it was an adult onset addiction\nRight right and I had a view I'm ever tried to calculate how much money you invested in and buying we'd over the years ...\nOh I mean it was probably a few thousand dollars you know the the thing is and then you know and this this isn't a brackets back you know I there was a time there where I was a ... you know well known writer and people would just\nGive me drugs uh or or smoked me up and I I'm I'm\nKind of I'm inherently cheap so I Would look for situations where I ... I knew I'd be around people who would have it so I wouldn't have to buy but of course still with them you know when I Lived in LA I had a medical marijuana card I Would go up to Colorado are weak and it's been a hundred two hundred bucks\nSo it didn't bankrupt me in that sense but it you know it's still it was still even on a month where it was really good at ... at least fifty dollars not a hundred bucks and I\nKnow you you you've written a since you've written a speech sentence obviously causing a great stir have you done some negative reaction from some of your old friends\nOr do people have been very supportive I've had a few people who wonderful go\nYeah yeah I mean generally when someone announces that they're an addict the reaction is that like you're faking it or\n[laughter] you know you're ... it's not you know or or you're not an addict I mean if you if you go through what\nIf you go through the twelve step program guided ... there's no way you can anyone can say that you're not as an addict I mean I wouldn't have done it if I wasn't but uh you know there was some sort of anonymous\nEmails and comments on line that said that there is no way without describing could possibly be true but I was fictionalized thing that I was somehow working with reactionary forces who want to continue can contribute to the drug war but don't those comments were wider five percent most\nPeople because you you may get you make it very clear in your in your\nColumn that you believe that marijuana should be legal given the fact that you recognize that it's dangerous a that's a fascinating position a tank we will get to that and much more with Neal Pollack\nLink to his website as well he's um a written a powerful piece about marijuana addiction we'll be

visuals side\nBut I feel that it's it's certainly are struggling and my main question was what are for the show was what finally made you quit\nYeah that's a good question and to address the thing you were saying it's like it just\nMarijuana is kind of creeps up on you right it's not like I'm you know heroin where your job if you get addicted very fast I'm so ... you can use it for a number of years it's sort of a low level gradually increases as for me that my moment of clarity game ... ironically enough\nNow that the Dodgers are back in the world series that actually came at the world

smoking weed stumps people from drinking as they're\nAbsolutely not I mean I I was much of a drinker when I was getting stone but I Know I Know people who do both in in ... they go together pretty well\nSo now the reason to believe that but there you know there is the thing with driving while stoned right there was this other live in a in this donor community that um it's actually a much\nSafer
