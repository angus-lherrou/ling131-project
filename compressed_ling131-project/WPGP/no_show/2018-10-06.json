let's go a very quickly to Danny in um Palmer, Alaska than a year on the Michael Mann that show\nTo respond to this moment in history this historic hinge and I think it is that this is the most contentious Supreme Court confirmation battle\nIn history nothing close no not cars well or hands worth were actually voted down not Bork who was voted down\nThis has been the most ferocious battle

you take this as important a moment as I Do\nCertainly is a turning point a for America historically and on the short term I think it will have a big influence on the boat coming up in November\nSo it's hard to say that there's not an more important story I mean this was it um which one do you want to check first\nWell let's let's first or take a look at what you think the impact is likely to be on the vote November\nWell I think it's going to be a tremendous backlash against people um who espouse no presumption of innocence which is the Democratic party\nThe only one Democrat voting for capital on a show managing the senator from West Virginia one so now you know the other what forty seven are basically saying look we're with a mop\nWhere would the people who accused Kavanaugh without any corroborating evidence with the FBI all ready now said there isn't any\nAnd we're still with the more we we want to get the pitchforks and the and the fire porches and march up the hill okay so Americans are getting that they're getting it\nAnd they say well what if this happened to my father or brother or how would I Want no presumption of innocence would I Want the man to be destroyed by allegation and of course the answer is going to be no thought the Republicans are smart and that's a big\n[laughter] tell you that they run on two things the economy and the Democratic party rejecting that presumption of innocence and I think that both of those things will be helpful to geo care November\nI'm One of the other things we now have officially the lowest unemployment rate in a forty nine years with three point seven percent\n... you have to go back to Nineteen sixty nine\nTo find and unemployment rates is low that's that's noteworthy to I ... I ... you talked about the presumption of innocence now again you're in a unique position talking about anything having to do with the hash tag me two were accusations about\nMistreatment of women because that's had a very big impact on your life in your career\nOr do you think we may be reaching a turning point in this whole narrative that says that anyone who makes any accusations at all\nShould be a ... instinctively support it do you think that is likely to begin to change\nYeah I'm constraint or what I can say because uh I Believe the legal action in play to restore my reputation and of course it takes\nA lot of money and a lot of time to do that so I Can't really get into my situation I can tell you the same people who are now paying demonstrators to disrupt the capital or will behind um my accusations and they paid people to stand out front on Fox News would saut same exact people\nRight same groups and it's outrageous it's an outrage the problem with the accusation industry and that's what it is now Michael than industry right and it's run by two four six\n... lawyers who are shakedown auditors to know they can uh get money from individuals and corporations just by the obligation because the corporations and individuals don't want to publish\nA shakedown industry has been in place now for decades but now you have the allegation industry used by political All right so if we don't like Kavanaugh we can't defeat him on the merits\nHe was going to be confirmed so we're going to put out a a a letter from a woman who says well he he uh molested me when I was Fifteen Years old okay so that's what happened that's what happened that's what they did\nAnd of course the wild card in this was the press and the press is the driver primary\nDriver of the political allegation industry because depressed doesn't care what is true\nThat you know searching in my case at all none zero and we provided fresh salads with its called Victoria evidence that in print it they wouldn't even use it I mean CNN and use the word rape in conjunction with a cabin all more than a hundred times\nMore than a hundred times CNN are associated cabinet with rape\nAnd none of these accusers uh ever even alleged that he raped anyone did they\nKnow well one one did a ... ... that that\n... sweat and they said is is sweating and said she thought he participated in a drug gang spiking punch and things\nThat girls could be raped by a a a line of boys right and which is that in the beginning the cabin always in the line and then she hold back on that\nOne out what I'm trying to get across is and this is very important for people understand is that the corrupt American media and it is as corrupted has ever been in our republic doesn't care what happened they want the salacious headline alright they want to tag powerful people with this\nOkay got let me just interrupt you for a moment and a rather momentous announcement a Joe mansion just share vote yes\nHe will vote yes on Kavanaugh which means that he is a sure now of fifty one votes he will be confirmed he needs fifty go ahead [noise]\nMentioning you know if it wants Collins came across mansion then had nothing to lose so I'm not I I thought I thought Collins was sincere and somewhat brave but mansion I liked match and I like drawing on\n'em but he just waited back and say oh well now it's the issue with things while say yes\nBecause as you know if it's a pie in the Senate the vice president breaks the tie in a capitalistic right matches up with any currency on the line now because Schumer the Senate minority leader threatened all the Democratic senators by saying if you support Kavanaugh will cut off all your money\nSo when you run for reelection not getting any money from the national committee\n... Schumer did don't you think this is gonna Heidi Heitkamp was already running I think nine or ten points behind a in her race North Dakota I holding them back and and she'll lose in North Dakota\nYeah but but again it's hard to understand\nWhy you see this this was a point when you listen to senator Collins\nShe brought out the point that that look up a Brett Kavanaugh is not some extreme legal theorist\nHe's a respected judge he's right in the Republican mainstream ease about as a moderate an appointee as they could possibly hope for from Donald Trump so what's what is behind this dish hysterical this\nIs what democracy looks like no no ... got to go\nThe demonstrators and the craziness that they're not all rent or demonstrators Amy Schumer got herself arrested what does she have in this fight\nAbortion and what it is the progressive left knows that the state of Mississippi is the latest and Missouri is\nIn there as well are trying to limit a timeframe on abortion abortion clinic access things like that\nMany of those cases will go to the Supreme Court\nAnd a Kavanaugh will most likely come down on the side that the states have a right to regulate commerce which is what abortions come down to now Planned Parenthood a they have a constitutional right to regulate caught\nA commerce within their borders so the far left the progressive who control the Democratic party and the media\nBasically say we can't have this guy because he's going to come down on the side of the states to limit abortion we want unfettered abortion abortion under any reason under any circumstances at any time that we want Schumer watch what Hillary Clinton walk\nAnd that's what that's why\nThe um Kavanaugh train a picked up speed once it looked like he was going to be confined beats all about abortion\nLet me also mention a Bill O'Reilly is my guest he has a new bestseller that is going to be released next week it is called killing\nThe ss the hunt for the worst war criminals in history\nOr it's going to be available next week you can find out about will link to it at our website and Michael med dot com\nAnd another fascinating read on a dramatic an astonishing chapter in world history we will be right back with more reactions pouring in ... where on the apparent victory for Brett Kavanaugh\nMore coming right up thank you Bill O'Reilly\nEighty five ... she's dying breath areas or why he's seven a year to\nYeah he's he's yes I think he may be Seventy nine he's yes they're they're both\nThese are too liberal lions and um the as you said and it could happen any time so but the court now is uh where Trump wants to debate till you're going to be a Republican you voted for him you know like um you know like a style you know like you're handling so now I'm the court is a traditional court again\nBut if he if he if Trump and let's say that Justice Ginsburg resigns and President Trump a points Amy Coney Barrett who apparently was the runner up to ...

exception of Lisa Murkowski voting yes that means fifty one vote yes on confirming Kavanaugh\nAll the Democrats with the exception of Joe mansion voting no and uh the Democrats are joined by the one Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski so pretty much a straight party line vote with one switch on each side\nUh fifty one forty nine vote it's one of the reasons that it's so important to get a better majority in the Senate\nOr today Brett Kavanaugh wrote\nSupreme Court must never be viewed as a partisan institution the justices do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle they do not caucus in separate rooms as I've said repeatedly if confirmed the court I Would be part of a team of nine committed to deciding cases according to the constitution and the last the United states I Would always

Lee right and and the senator Sasse is right and I share your feelings completely\nA look you know what the most damning thing wasn't senator Collins brought this out in her speech is that Dr Ford said that she didn't know that chairman Grassley has offered her to testify in private and\nThis goes to I think what Bill O'Reilly was saying the lawyers a Deborah cats and ... I think the other one was named brown which are two lawyers are big activists and they wanted the public testimony to basically try to smear and defeat Kavanaugh\nThe private testimony would have been so much better and chairman rationally offered they even offered to come out to California and testify her there if she was afraid to fly\nTo apparently she isn't really a face for you to fly look this was not malfeasance by Dr forward it was malfeasance by her lawyers who abused her as a pawn we'll be right back on the message [noise]\n\nCBS Sunday after sixty minutes one got a friend request from guy\nTo any of these world upside down I don't know who's behind that turned out to the God and then I kind of amazing story\nThe neutral guy friend in me\nAnd I guess LA is all new wife\nThe Madam Secretary season for me or he's breaking the\nLong run for president feel pressure Madam Secretary for the new trauma God Forbid me and a new in the I guess LA CBS Sunday [noise]\nWay you get your medicine prescriptions is now changing across America governments dot com can deliver your medicine right to your door past your doctor to send your prescription to ... dot com once you Bill in your information is in the system and your prescription is delivered it's\nJust that easy go to Google Maps dot com and use the ...
