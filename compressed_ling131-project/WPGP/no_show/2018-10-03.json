Sheldon Whitehouse and I don't know if we can have temperament like that on the court and blah blah blah blah blah and was finally twenty people who are all twisted off about the ... side shows the irrelevant sees\nThe ridiculous mess\nAnd the you know what's driving every single\nOne of them they don't want him on the court because he's a constitutional list [noise] they don't\nThey don't care about how he might have treated women when they were Seventeen years old because the people who are telling you that thing about probably had no problem with Bill Clinton probably have no problem with with that candidate\nBill Clinton fine no problem Ted Kennedy find no problem but Brett Kavanaugh ooh no surgery can't go there that that's when you know that something else is driving the train\nAnd what's driving the train here in in this really is so simple and once you understand it becomes easier to grass and you know what's going on here this entire episode has\nNothing to do with women are concerned about who did or did not treat our midst treat women properly in the eighties or any other time every single bit of this\nIs smoke is smoke and what's behind the smoke is the true motivation\nAnd that is that the campaign against Brett Kavanaugh is being launched by and embraced by\nPeople who do not want a constitutional list on the Supreme Court\nThat's because constitutional lists do make stuff up in their rulings they don't make up right that don't exist like no right\nTo terminate a pregnancy which was absolutely fabricated from whole cloth and roe v Wade in Nineteen Seventy three and this is extremely important I don't want roe versus Wade overturned because I'm pro life\nBrett Kavanaugh will not vote to overturn roe v Wade because he is a conservative or a pro lifer and by the way I've no idea what he'll do but if he's a genuine constitutional as the will absolutely vote to overturn it not to forward his political views or his political agenda\nBecause judges should keep justices especially should keep all those things out of there ... all that matters is is there a right to abortion and the constitution of course there's not\nLet's talk about the over ... versus a Hodges the twenty Fifteen gay marriage ruling thanks Anthony Kennedy for that\nThat this was a completely unconstitutional ruling that said the state not only that states could offer gay marriage equality because of course they can states can do whatever they want in terms of the definition of marriage but over versus Hodges said they had to\nThey had to\nYou've got to to make sure that women can abort their babies you know you've got to make sure that states a rule that to a marriage that you guys is the same as my marriage to my wife no they don't if a state\nWants to end by the way that that conversely applies to abortion is what little constitution one on one if you need at the moment roe v Wade is overturned and that they cannot come fast enough the moment roe v Wade is overturn what happens\nWhat happens is\nThe first thing if there was close to nothing and immediately the answer is nothing but the landscape that then left is every state can have whatever abortion laws they wish would over fell versus Hodges overturned every state can recognize the marriages that they wish\nYour state number one wants to have full marriage equality to do two ladies ... without whatever you want to do it's all marriage to us that's great but at the state next door says not so much one man one woman that that they get to do that\nIf state aid wants to have a ghoulish ally permissive abortion laws I Will lamented if I Lived in that state I'd fight doggedly against it but they can do\nAnd it's a state next door says new we're going to be very restrictive we're going to absolutely protect the unborn\nIn many many ways that we haven't even been able to do before that state gets to do that all of that that I've just described hope it didn't make you wrecked a car or anything that's Cohn respecting the constitution ... this is the kind of America that Brett Kavanaugh will help bring about in other words ... the left\nAnd removing their ability to legislate through court rulings to get from the judiciary that which they cannot get from legislatures this has been an ongoing game of the left for decades and it is over when constitutional is reached the high court\nBrett Kavanaugh is just such a person God Bless him\nAnd um that's that's what it's all about because that that is the garlic too of empire that that is is kryptonite\nTo the left\nSo that's what it's all about him getting nothing new there everybody's concerned about Dr Ford listen we're all concerned about that for some math but our when Brett Kavanaugh's hands that I Wish her well I have no ill will toward her whatsoever or go leader good happy and prosperous life oh I bet it'll be prosperous her calendar will soon fill\nWith a with meals and I'm\nSpeaking engagements plenty I'm sure that I Wish you well I don't begrudge or any of that so I tell you what it does have it on the court are we going to do that is that going to happen to you feel like we're closer today than we were yesterday or could it all just go sideways answer is yes it could and I'll tell you why next Mark Davis in for Michael advent stick around\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nOf something that you may not be guilty or you could be somebody that was her figures higher life had somebody accused you of stuff that doesn't necessarily have to be a woman as everybody say but somebody could accuse you of something\nAs you're automatically guilty of this route you are certainly guilty until proven innocent that's one of the very very bad thing that gets light\nThat's the president and and it is just so how 'bout concern for everybody that women's stepping forward to the accusations of should be evaluated fairly and openly and and guys being falsely are baseless Lee accused of it can we harbor some uh some empathy\nFor them as well we're in Tacoma, Washington let's begin some phone action Elaine hey Mark Davis in from Michael how are you\nI'm fine thank you I

there when she you can't put all the time\nOh well that was how you prove you was\nThat the ... negative temperature possible situation and then she can prove\nThat that would be the alibi a bit but

taking place and I I think that we had the bottom and people are just are they're done I mean they're ready to go read and it's gotten to out of control some that's everybody I talked to feel that way more than I ever\nOffice are well I I mean I I've I've talked to the beginning of the show about what's what's our bubble and what's wishful thinking because I'm having a lot of the same conversations as well and yet then I'll take calls from people who go no he's he's demon spawn you must be a\nUniversity kept off the guard and it and we totally believe Dr for Jesus thousand project credible and

with their every breath\nFive four thirty three eighty eight or just go to Michael ... dot com and quite prepare already a one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six one eight hundred nine five five one southern seven six we've been talking about a ... what what does it look like and what the real fear of the left is why we're even involved in this entire\nYou know crazy mess with a a judge Kavanaugh's because the left fears of ... with a with every fiber of it's being a constitution list on the Supreme Court and so what was that looked like what kind of ruins would you have in many many things like roe v Wade which established a phony abortion rights\nA overkill versus Hodges which established a phony obligation for all states to have a gay marriage equality\nThat it would be a state by state patchwork vats what honoring the constitution looks like a with a question that we had Judy out of the city or in San Antonio Ron Hi Mark Davis in for Michael how are you\nOh great great I I guess I Need a little bit of attention on this they deciding state by state basis\nHow does that work because I kind of back and uh when you had interracial marriages which can be illegal in Texas but illegal in Oklahoma or legal or in Arkansas but illegal in Alabama or on\nThat I Am I\nRight here's here's here's here's here's exactly here's exactly how it would work marriage one oh one\nIf two people get married there three levels of of of marriage marriage is religious which means something up above promised they make before God but the couple does before God second it is so show a meaning does your into your people\nAround you your family your friends consider you to be married to him and if so that certainly has the vibe of being married and the third is government recognition of yet that's the only one that's everybody's business the other to the social the religious or none of anybody's business a gay couple can get married today\nAnywhere they wish anytime the only question is will the state recognize that marriage there's no such thing as a marriage ban nobody will ever bang on the church you you you guys getting married in there they would they absolutely can get married the only question is will the state recognizing that\nThere are some ... odd and whatnot are almost out almost out almost on almost done when the constitution has offered some states will recognize those gay marriages in some will not go ahead\nOkay so I went and traveling across the country that they're in a state the ... when they got to recognize it I don't know what kind of travel that even if you go on abortion first state to state one\nOh no no well what well back back back back back back up to marriage back back up to marriage because let's say a couple is married in\nConnecticut a to do to marry and Connecticut and their marriages recognized or you just talk about there vacationing there driving across country or they suddenly not married as they pass through Kansas [laughter]\nNo of course they are but the state of Kansas doesn't recognize it but it doesn't matter 'cause they don't live there the only thing that marriage to the government recognition of marriage only extend that\nTax benefits in certain laws in certain ... certain that there are still married in the most important ways religiously and socially snuff they move to Kansas well that's another kettle of fish 'cause they're still married absolutely\nBut it's not a marriage that the state recognizes with certain perks that come with marriage recognition so it's not really that big a deal [noise] now what was the abortion ... you want to make ahead\nWell at the same thing or are they young ladies in a state where ... is legal and she gets her you know right Peter Done legally another young lady that they were illegal which he get that done illegally she can be tried for murder for the maximum I did in another state\nThat it happened to be legal Iran Iraq I\nI I like states right but it looks like there ought to be\nMore than ... that that's what it looks like that's that's exactly what it looks like if a if a state has as ghoulish leap permissive abortion laws well there you are if another state protecting\nThe unborn and the young lady violates that violates that law and the doctor violates that laws and whatever is on the books for violating that law would happen\nThat that this is what the founding fathers so early intended is and that's why we're not a\nOf a homogenous just America where the United states of America we're living in Florida is supposed to be different than living in in Oregon living in Texas supposed to be different\nThan living in Wisconsin with some and listen to some things we share completely constitutional basic rights various properly written federal laws but a whole lot of other things that have to do with the various angles and ins and outs of life are left to the states to govern according to what the wishes are

you\nKnow this is no longer just a Supreme Court confirmation a cabin on could fail it can be with you could withdraw himself he can be withdrawn and we could just offer up Amy Coney Barrett are ... and be just fine constitutionally\nBut these people cannot win the fabric of America is is is at risk here ... laws of basic decency basic human conduct basic behavioral norms they're all at at play here I Am am I being too dramatic\n[noise] I think what you're having the latest chapter in the saga of an ongoing disease which is our government has grown so powerful so all encompassing so able to bend the power of government to favor one group for people to another\nThat this is just the latest example of how our problem in politics is not too much money\nThe more the why it's another try and whether we're at our problems too much power POW we are the founders never intended for the Supreme Court to be this powerful to decide things on the national scope with a single too often the five to four vote\nAnd as a result because all the power in my thumb on some issues especially the hot button social issues is concentrated in Supreme Court people will do anything to get that power anything and that's what we're seeing in the capital okay [noise]\nWell that that is where we are because legislatures can legislate a chief executives can do executive things and pilots certain programs through presidents are powerful Congress is powerful\nBut they're all I'm a mutual and they're all about biased by the Supreme Court and and that means that just when their disagreements they win and that's just all there is to it\nOr is it or we mistaken about that\nWell the Supreme Court is are unelected branch and as a result um in the court that for the life tenure or we're term limits on the president we have um you know elections every two years well house of representatives every six years in the Senate\nBut I'm Supreme Court especially because the it's only nine justices someone gets on the court for life\nOr that can be in a lifetime of your side losing five to four decisions we'd be a whole lot better off if you remember that you know the first that no Supreme Court nominee ever appeared before the Senate Judiciary committee until Nineteen twenty five\nBecause the court wasn't that powerful now and in fact they didn't consistently started appearing until Nineteen fifty five now of course the Supreme Court is so powerful and so invasive in all of these areas of our life we treated like you know World War three whatever it is a TRACON the\nIt seems like an event horses out of the car and isn't it a ... I don't I don't see any way that we can ratchet things but in fact I'm thirty seconds on a conversation I had well here's a little name dropped that I Do on purpose\nMy friend Tom Jovan ... at the Institute for policy in the nation I mean I Know where they're wonderful people\nAnd and he and I were having a conversation about it she said this whole thing about court supremacy Supreme Court supremacy if you will is just a mess there because they are co equal I have a term equal should survive their co equal it meaning that that if the Supreme Court said something okay fine\nAnd if a president disagrees with it\nShe can ignore it but then rather than chaos and breaking out the public can figure out whether we like or don't like the president that ignores the Supreme Court and we can impeach or an elect him\nAnd there's a certain rough balance to that unlike what we've had that you've just described which is this all powerful tribunal that just runs our lives on their will\nWell I Know that Abraham Lincoln Andrew Jackson location we talk about ... the Supreme Court\nAnd you know those were and they bring in this case the civil war was around I Would much prefer the Congress exercise of power it's almost\nEvery year which is Congress can pass a law saying the court does not have jurisdiction over this area of our lives in other words we're going to take back the power we created we've constitution created the courts the court's powers that in for that we take back some of it we limited jurisdiction\nI'm OK I'm singling now with with ah with with potential a list of making it might be in it\nRare case of the Nineteen sixties you know the Supreme right out of nowhere said Madeline Marie O'Hare is right you can't have a Supreme Court you can't have a a prayer to a Supreme Being in a I guess today we we couldn't go out for Muslims progress nominee what else given how things are going but you can't have a prayer in public schools\nWell there was a big move in Congress and I think that if the times had been different had liberalism hadn't been renting renting Supreme back then Congress could have said no this is not the court's jurisdiction we take it back so the decision was null and void\n[noise] I and that's okay that's satisfying up to a point because I saw Madeline Marie O'Hare it should be as repugnant a person\nA but but you couldn't someone rightfully step forward and say a while of doesn't the pesky First Amendment when Ken a legislature come in there and say they're like you can argue all day with her parents school is the first amendment establishment clause violation or whatever but that doesn't that it's the kind of envy argument before it begins\nWell again\nUm what the\nWhat the court had said the fair case was this was a ... this was a violation of the establishment of religion claws well if you disagree with that Congress can step in is the people's representatives and say no we have a different view\nSo again that hasn't happened if I'm likely to happen but I'm simply saying that we are going to have to appoint a whole bunch more constitutional is people who were judicial\nRestraint people to the court because you know there are five people on the court if Kavanaugh is confirmed who don't have this expansive view of the Supreme Court's power have a more humble view\nAnd I think that that's the best way to handle this put people on the court who don't want to be played comic rulers of the rest of us\nPrecisely and and that is why a distance he would be the fifth that's why the left is is having a whole you know what's sad about that and that's what's great about talking to John Fund is as we can go very macro and now let's come back and go very micro or I Am feeling a little better about Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski a little\nBecause I think they were willing to vote for him before the FBI we should placate them Jeff Flake is a wild card I have no idea what amount of ... he's going to want to rush the will of course I can throw him\nHe will ultimately vote yes why what makes you so sure I Know Jeff\nAnd I also know that a lot of this is a well let's just say McCain disease I'm you know I think that Jeffers enjoying some of the media attention [noise] you know\nI I Hope that I Hope that the worst that's going on I I really do but if you and God Bless Senator McCain but if you coined of the pathology that led him to go thumbs down on Obamacare repeal way why wouldn't ingest lake arrowhead\nWell because there can be there you know diseases don't always take their full course sometimes they stop before you know you go over the class a look at it like flake voted for the nomination to go out of committee assembling\nNothing dramatic is revealed the FBI probe he would be very strange for him will know on the floor having voted for uncommitted than almost never happens\nIn I've I don't think it would be strange at all because I don't trust him I'm going to defer to you however I Am seeds or the personal experience and and and you and and be and sleep better a little bit because that is what he said\nIt is what he's made me crazy politically in the past during the Trump hatred has made me insane but he he he does he did say that he said give me a week and and I can be willing to vote for it on the floor I'm going to hold into that and it sounds like you don't think I Would be unwise and doing some\nUh I think I think they're there to truly weakest link is actually looser Murkowski\nIn thirty seconds why [noise]\nAh because if she didn't face the Republican primary in Alaska and twenty twenty I think she'd be the most likely to vote against Kavanaugh the only thing of preventing or promoting against Kavanaugh is the fact that she faces a Republican primary electorate you've already lost one Republican primary and I had to come back and win the writing independent\nAs of right and that's right oh well this is that what John is on the show just got three times better because of you thank you on Twitter at Johns ... National Review every play just go get every book he ever wrote just wonderful guy wonderful writer the great John signed on Twitter at Johns I Would certainly make sense thank you sir appreciate hearing very much\nOkay thank you you bet [laughter] All right big exhale a\nJohnson says Jeff Flake is gonna be okay and he won't screw us I'm checking back to the bank [laughter] I'm taking it to the bank don't mess with me man Mark Davis is from Michael back [noise]\nI thought it was just part of the whole of his very defensive\nAh and on a [noise]\nYou know unconvincing presentation on [noise] and I\nI told someone later boy I'll tell you they give us a lot of credit\nThirty six years ago I\nWe started this again I guess I mean if it is\nBack at Yale that yeah well even before in high school apparently um [noise]\nSo I I I don't you know look I Want the FBI to conduct as a thorough investigation as they possibly can within whatever restraints are in public upon them um but I think for anyone who believe there's such a thing as a judicial temperament and that we want\nJudges particularly those on our highest court to approach issues approach plaintiffs and defendants with um a sense of fairness that there's a lot to be concerned about right\nDo tell I think that a judge Kavanaugh displayed exactly the right kind of radar for fairness because fairness ... is a huge from his every judicial pour\nIt it radiates from every ruling he has a very strong sense of fairness basic fairness basic decency\nSo that when those concepts are dashed against the rocks when those concepts are ex bloated\nRiding a vehicle of character assassination from the left\nIt is exactly his sense of fairness that infused his personality they're under questioning from those Democrats is Democrat torment doors and in his exactly that righteous indignation that human instinct that anyone would have\nTo sit on national TV and imagine the woman you love and the\nDaughters you love at

good behavior\nThat is like no I think it was about ...\nHow how how do you mean what who I mean what what are you what are you suggesting\nArticle three articles ill everybody saying it's a lifetime appointment it's not\nWell there I mean ... years you presuming number ... ... who ... the Supreme Court justice be removed yes\nYes but but I mean so I mean the president has a four year term but it can be shorter if there's misbehavior in somebody's in beach Supreme Court absolutely is a lifetime of in the designation unless something happens to have the person yet\nAnd if it occurs to you have you has this guy written a book holy cow yes I have\nA couple of them in fact there was another checking me about it now [noise] ah there was one in twenty four\nTeam the good people that rag Noreen a which we now own which is funny I I I wrote a book for regular human Salem Media group ... so that's a good book deal to have a little thing called Lone Star America how Texas can save our country the idea we're all in the uh the purgatory the Obama years\nAnd the I Am I felt was hey if if the entire country was run more like Texas we'd be a lot better off and you know what lately looks like we're kind of doing that so that proved I won't say prophetic could as hopefully with sensible that's Lone Star America from twenty fourteenth then in twenty six team in the election here\nIt occurred to me to do about a hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty some talk show topics of of subjects that the left has been getting away with like guns are bad\nHuman productivity has definitely warming up's planets the constitution is a shape bubble malleable living breathing document and other nonsense and and just a way chapter by chapter to gently McCain maybe not so gently but at least civil Lee and constructively push back against that\nAnd I put it together in a little thing called upside down how the left turn right in the wrong truth and lies in good and bad\nThat's a lot of subtitle just to Mark Davis upside down on a Google or Amazon or a Barnes and noble or whatever and ah there's a book and the hope you enjoy it All right\nSo the last gentleman and it took a little while to get there was talking about how about about Supreme Court justices and boy you could say we've been talking about Supreme Court justice is a lot like late I'm\n... and how it's so important and powerful because it's a lifetime appointment and the gentleman said uh it's not a lifetime appointment as a yes\nIt is but I I kinda got his point article ... section one judicial branch judicial power judicial hours it's easy for you to say\nI'm the judges of the Supreme and inferior records show hold their offices during good behavior\nSo I don't really know what he was getting at if if it seems like there were things that they were offensive is that a lot like maybe deciding wrongly in roe v Wade should have gotten a few justice is just tossed out onto the curb\nOkay um [noise] it's a lifetime appointment or barring impeachment and and that gets ... eat so and about ... what led to do here is ... there there are two things that people have talked about\nTerm limits and age limits the get the more\nUnfair age limits scene [laughter] 'cause I'm sixty and I'd like to think I'll be around for a couple\nOf do three more decades and uh and and I I Know a ton of people\nWho are sharp as a tack smart as a whip strong as a box cutter eighty five I also do some people who are forty who are total idiots so um it just seems ... wildly arbitrary no term limits\nTerm limits boil down to one thing turn over for the sake of turnover [noise] I think the founding fathers envisioned a I'm a citizen legislature\nBut you know uh they didn't put term limits in there I guess they left that up to us while we finally did it uh for the presidency FDR was president for thirty seven years or [laughter] I Do in a in a bridge over Thirteen but\nWe didn't we did that and I guess I did that [laughter]\nI think we're probably all on board for presidential term limits turnover for the sake of turnover especially these days seems like a good idea\nUh everybody talks about term limits in Congress oh we we get and I hope I can fill up the lines right now everybody just banging on the table for term limits here's the dirty little secret you're already\nNot enough people want him oh you do I do\nYour friends do the people you hang out with do I can fill you know forty seven hours of talk shows that people who do you know what if everybody was so good data about term limits we had um a long time ago so here ultimately has the bottom line of the journey the dirty little secret\nWe liked the idea of term limits it sounds great but then when you realize that that means you got to get rid of your congressman\nJust to be under twelve years and it's usually the deal is six terms in the house two terms in the Senate both equally twelve years but that means you that you know what that means I mean I got to get rid of Ted Cruz after one more term I don't want to get rid of Santa Cruz every one more term oh I Want to own Ted Cruz to be a center Jillian Ninety three\nSo that uh that's why I term limits never goes anywhere\nIs a ... and it shows in the polling\nApproval ratings of Congress are terrible approval\nRatings of people talking about their congressman tend to be pretty good so everybody else should have to get rid of their congressman you don't want to get rid of your bears so there's the whole cut on room of term limits so at at the judiciary level I mean what do we do a a\nThirty Years' Twenty years I don't know\nI don't know um [noise]\nI guess I'm really thought about it that much turnover for the sake of ... I tell you what I Would sure make 'em as if this is even possible that would make elections more interesting wouldn't it can you measure the election coming up on an election in a given year\nAnd they're like three justice is about to get term limited out for the very next president\nOh my heavens\nThat his than gut wrenching tension\nI don't know maybe we got the best of maybe the best system right now\nAs horribly flawed as it is okay speaking of horribly flawed here from Hillary audio um oh bless her heart she's I I'm In the process of forgetting Hillary was ever born she's never going to be president I'm just over its you know ... ... a lock her up prosecuting your grade if somebody wants to do that\nLord knows it seems appropriate in view of the the obvious which in handling of\nNational security materials but even even as I put those sentences together my brain starts to leak outta my ears and I think about both Clintons about the same way just go away just be in private life kind of like the Obamas are\nUh just just go be in private life and be happy and prosperous I don't care you can't screw up my life anymore and I'm I'm moving on\nFrom you [laughter]\nBut here [laughter] I've never get that out of my\nHead I get scrubbed my brain of that but uh but here's here's a little more Hillary audio because they asked her\nOwn here's a real suspenseful question hey what did you think of that Dr Ford testimony in her reply was deaths\nYou feel a hundred percent certain that the events that she described\nTrue and are there weren't as qualified\nBut I I watch as much of our tax money as I could\nFound her very credible you have to ask yourself why would anybody\nPut themselves through that if they did not believe that they had important information or to convey to the Senate she basically said that she thought it was her civic duty ah so I found I found her presentation I found her a\nWillingness to say I don't remember that but I remember

teenager so we kind of sort of apples in Apple's 'cause it's all this sort of have an odd Seventeen Eighteen so a permit us high school girls\nAnd so and and I don't I don't even want to invoke Amy Coney Barrett let's not make it her because that happened and uh she was in New Orleans and I still believe in\n[noise] you know this is a good time for me to say something\nThere are Democrats who I think are wrong about everything but you may have a certain ... of Joe Biden a very bad I almost can't not like the guy you know of any club which are I think is a um acquitted herself with a ... with some degree of\nOf rationality and decency um no I I Lived there ... there are plenty of Democrats about whom all I Would say is I disagree with you about everything Mazie Hirono is it an Barris meant\nSomebody asked her the stupid ice questions like well that's why we needed FBI investigation this is ...\nElephant oh and by the way that goes back to the moral precept\nOf that I wanted to touch on it in the last time I mean this really is important because it's all about you know the constitution Supreme Court and judge Kavanaugh and and the smear campaign against him and et cetera et cetera but of all the lessons that I Hope to come away with that are ideally taught and taught well and taught broadly\nPlease let us all move forward with the following moral\nAbsolute no\nDecent society Danes and cars a human being in his or her fifties because of stuff that person was doing as a teenager\nNo one does that no one does that\nAnd Democrats or a funny lot here in my state of Texas Democrats me forget forget a beta award DWI when the police say he left the scene after every could've killed somebody\nBut we're supposed to forget about that you know but Brett Kavanaugh stuff\nUsed when he was Seventeen that's just qualify to ridiculous\nAbsolutely ridiculous and speaking of ridiculous here's some more Mazie Hirono or because of there there's a lot of attention paid to Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski and we're all kind of waiting right we're waiting for the week to pass\nAnd reasonable rational people will be expected in the Republican Party to go ahead and vote for judge Kavanaugh is nothing disqualifying is found\nMazie Hirono as different expert expectations for her sister's senators [noise]\nIt's not just what the FBI is looking into although I Hope that the FBI investigation will reveal various inconsistency and what that Kavanaugh testify to and all of the people that they have one that's the case but\nThey need to look at in my view is his record a and his outcome to than a\nToward the cases beforehand then they saw where they all areas of inquiry from all of us than myself included\nIn our age I have enough and he has a pattern of making decisions that limit unless I Choose to be a major concern\nTo civic ... attitudes about native people that should be a major concern to the summit house he was and so we can ... I Hope that they're not just banking everything on the FBI before there's enough evidence\nOf this pattern of decision making not to mention is very extensive use of a presidential protection because he has the only one who wrote that the president shutting down from any kind of coming ... of it I'm sure this president really paid a lot of attention to those you\nKnow that he did that I did too and everybody should 'cause guess what he's right and I and\nAnd listen to you know don't drive the car of the road if Hillary had one he's sorry if Hillary had one I don't think\nThat she should be ... you you can't beat her either I don't think you can be subpoenaed lane or indicting\nSitting president said that that just puts too much power in the hands of some local yoga da ... to ... the president will dig may the solution for punishing a president for wrongdoing is one thing and peach but that's it\nSo if that judge Kavanaugh's view it's not because of you know you love Trump or if if if if he's around long enough and if Trump as a Democrat successor God help us he'll feel the same way about uh about that president to [noise]\nAll right so we we we reached close to the end of the line so let's do let us a let's come back for a couple of final moments together and I have um some ideas marinating on how I think the rest of this week may go\nAnd ultimately I don't know\nBut I'm just seeing some things in there and we've been told some things on the today show I Will refresher memory on some of those er or shared details on that and then I'll get out of here and make room for Michael to return to the show that bears his name he'll be back tomorrow I'm Mark Davis in from Michael in the back of about three minutes [noise]\n\n\nHi Michelle mocking here if you follow my work you know the one of the biggest outrageous I reported on was the trial of abortion doctor Kermit Koch now\nAnd how the woman goes into a clinic comes on data there's no police report and\nI helped both the crime the mainstream media tried to cover up\nWe had instructions directly from governor in ...\nOf it's not like the ... when the producers of the guy's name was he came to me for help I\nJumped at the chance I personally donated to make sure that film got main God now movie opens October twelfth the main thing Cormac God's know is perhaps the most promising serial killer in American history dean king and the entire kept doing her job bringing the powerful story of good versus evil to the big screen nothing\nThat man did protect women or children and you don't have to be approved by the fact of the things that you might be worried moving to carry it on the other two I promise you you can and should bring your teenage children bring friends and family do not want to have the unique opportunity changes hearts and minds about abortion\nDrugs no rated PG Thirteen [noise] you know the moment the homework and dishes are done your family responsibilities had been met\nThe shoes slips off and do you live back\nIn that end of day that's they're relieved feel feel when you read on the body comforting orthopedic made locally at the original mattress factoring relief from middle man mark out the hard day's work\nThe original mattress back during thoughtfully made honestly pray [noise] original match dot com\nTruth is timeless [noise] at the original mattress factoring our business philosophy is based on honesty and truth and it never change\nSimply stated we treat our customers the way we want to be treated ourselves this means we treat people with respect we educate rather than manipulate and we offer genuine value in substantial savings simply by saying it but by proving with kind of ways of our mattresses\nCompared side by side with the mainstream Brant [noise] somebody one of our store location or visit us original mavericks dot com to see the difference for yourself\nThe IRS doesn't mess around if they want your money they'll take it they can take your paycheck and bank accounts to even threaten your home or business and it's about to get worse the IRS just tired an army of new tax enforcers so if you owe backtrack says smartest thing you can do is call up much actually\nOptimum has access to a special IRS tax assistance program called\nA fresh start initiative and their clients that qualifier saving thousands even\nTens of thousands one call starts the process just up the demand letters stop aggressive collection action and stop at army of new enforcers from targeting you but don't delay it's important to act now while you still have options stop them is a rated with the better Business Bureau optimize already resolved over a half million dollars a pack for their clients get your life\nBack call now for your free consultation\nCalled eight hundred Ninety six eight Ninety twenty two eight hundred nine six eight Ninety twenty eight hundred Ninety six eight Ninety to ... to\n...
