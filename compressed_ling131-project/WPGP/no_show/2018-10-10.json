United nations\nWill also talk about a new poll which shows what seems to me to be a contradiction to CNN poll and it shows that support for President Trump is going up and going up fairly dramatically at the same times\nFor for Brett Kavanaugh's going down so what's the story\nThere we will get to that and also to the arrest of a a teacher\nFor something he tweeted\nAnd it's something

to a a\nStay at home dad middle aged sounds like a very nice guy who confesses that um he's a pot addicts\nThat's right I marijuana addict and he makes the case that marijuana is a profoundly addictive drug or we will get to that as well but first the reactions to\nWhat is going on in our country right now to the swearing in ceremony last night I judge Kavanaugh was already sworn in as justice Kavanaugh on Saturday Night so he's been an official member of the Supreme Court for a while\nBut President Trump I think very rightly wanted to stage a formal swearing in and it was a wonderful occasion\nHe had a judge Kavanaugh's family their head all the justice was the Supreme Court with their Ruth Bader Ginsburg was there dancing and celebrating and wasting a few Bruce gays\nOr no that's not\nTrue that part but she was there and uh that's that's appropriate and that's important\nAnd I think the judge Kavanaugh justice Kavanaugh spoke very well and President Trump\nA President Trump did not speak as outrageously or as badly as a liberal media try and suggest and we'll get to that place over for you and tell you why but first off on this issue of civility which remains a very very big and divisive issue in the country\nThere was a contribution to civility from a contributor over at MSNBC and this is very much appreciate because it puts the situation and such good focus of this is a big contribution from Eli missed all\nAbout making a deal with the devil is that the devil\nBacks up his Vargas alright the devil does not Trump has delivered for these people on the things that they care about most\nThe of delivered racism for these people see the liver massage any for these people and now he's delivered the Supreme Court for these people which is something that they've been trying to get for a generation we're going to see if\nIf this way but they now have control over all three branches of government we're going to see if this rain last for three days for two years\nFor sounds like\nA thousand you're right\nThat's a ... a guy that's of course what a Adolph Hitler proclaimed than his house and she I lasted exactly twelve years\nA look at ... ... ... when he says\nHas delivered for these people are we back to the basket of deplorable is that we're telling me who are the people to whom President Trump is delivered racism and massage any and where is the messiah Janine American Life right now\nIs it a the idea that there is a lack of civility on the right how was it civil to suggest that a President Trump\nIs making a deal with President Trump is a deal with the devil\nOr the the people to whom he has delivered massage any and racism and corruption and horror and misery and and just general awfulness are actually diabolical one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and then there's this\nUm Tom Steiner who was invested\nI think it's upwards of twenty million so far I think it's way above twenty million might be upwards of fifty million so far he spent on ads pushing the impeachment of\nDonald Trump he spoke out on who to blame\nFor everything that is going wrong in America here's Tom Steyer\nA group of very rich very entitled white men wanted to tell the rest of the country we are going to have our way and if you don't like it that is too darn that as far as I'm concerned\nThe only thing everybody else can do now the the rest of America is go to the bulls eye November Six Flags tell those bridging titled white men\nThat we exist and democracy exist\nOkay just a question um is Tom Steyer a man\nAnd so yeah he is I think he currently identifies as a male\nEven assist gender to me is she white yeah he's white is the rich yeah is he in titled yeah so I\nI don't understand this is this is all the fault of rich entitled white men\nAnd with this kind of thing going on on the left basically suggesting that its rich and title white men who were controlling things against the public interest\nOr does it seem a little bit bizarre for the defeated presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to say that what we need now is a new civility but there's only one way to achieve civility you know what it is\nHere's what she had to say on CNN\nCannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the Senate\nThat Flynn's civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republicans seemed to\nRecognize and respect as strength\nAnd you heard how the Republican members led by Mitch McConnell\nReally demeaned the confirmation process\nDemeaned the confirmation process\nWhere they are the ones who brought up a drinking games in high school\nWhere they are the ones who are brought up obsessively looking at a high school yearbook and even a general references in the high school yearbook\nHow is it that Republicans demeaned the confirmation process and and what about this notion that the only way that we can restore civility is um\nIs somehow to or have the Democrats\nBack in control heaven forbid one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six she also in the same interview Hillary said what was done last night and the White House was a political rally\nIt further undermine the image integrity the court and that troubles me greatly it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional government\nUm okay\nIt was she watching what wishy washy me she was watching the Saturday Night live cold open\nWhich showed people celebrating in the ... locker room if you actually watch and we should posted on our website Jeremy if you actually watch the ceremony with President Trump and justice Kavanaugh and Justice Kennedy very much in evidence the mentor of justice Kavanaugh who sworn in again\nWhy was that an suitable I I honestly\nA jump was asked about this briefly and about Hillary saying that the swearing in ceremony was no good it was a political rally it was inappropriate here's the president\nBush is going to say\nI guess that's where she lost she doesn't get it [noise] she never did I knew that a long time ago\nHillary never got it [noise] that's why she lost\nAnd and by the way when you talk about political event [noise]\nWas uh what judge Kavanaugh said political about wanting to be a justice who was fair [noise]\nHe said all nine of us just as the Supreme Court review of the constitution and yes that includes Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan Steven Brian [noise]\nWe will be right back with your calls coming up on one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\nAnd the Iran deal bringing

then try to encourage the president shouted moving the embassy and showing the rest of the world [laughter]\n[noise] you know all those things have made a huge difference and the U.S\nAnd the U.S is the way they should make all American very proud\nI this is I'm about as a strong case as you can make and none none of what she said can you argue it it's all the truth and yes she was\nPart of it but all of this didn't happen under President Donald Trump\nAnd this is one of the reasons I suppose that on the CNN poll or despite the fact that there has been so much hysteria on the left about having on and the the various horrors that are alleged to have been perpetrated by old white males led by Donald Trump\nThe President Trump actually saw his approval rating rising look as far as Nikki Haley is concerned\nThere's a lot of talk about her replacement\nAnd some of the talk that as most inflammatory is the idea that the president is going to appoint his daughter ...\nWhy would that make

Alcoholics Anonymous started in Nineteen thirty five\nMuch of the reason that was two years after the end of prohibition alcohol abuse became rampant in the country almost rank itself off the rails\nWell the same thing happened with marijuana\nNow by the way this is really important because it's historically true most people think oh you know prohibition was a gigantic failure people drank just as much under a prohibition\nAnd then they ended prohibition and everything was happy this by the way it was a big Republican democratic issue was one of the first things that Franklin Roosevelt did when the Democrats came to power\nA was end the prohibition amendments to uh go ahead and repeal the prohibition of men\nBut the truth of the matter is drinking did go up when prohibition went away it did go down when prohibition was imposed now was it worth it I'm not suggesting prohibition of alcohol I'm also not in the midst of fighting a war here to reimpose prohibition on marijuana in Washington state\nBut here's the message from Neal Pollack says marijuana isn't alcohol or an opioid you cannot die from an overdose it doesn't really events physical cravings so is it better to call

because they were good sharp guys you know\nWell again age is the one thing about this is and and I know\nThat there are a lot of people out there are reaching for their phones right now and saying hey I've been smoking pot for years and years and I'm a sharp as ever\nUh let let other people that that it ... whenever whenever we do this this issue on the air and it's an important issue because right now there's a very very big industry that's involved in trying to get people to think oh this is just harmless good fun\nAnd I looked for most people who use marijuana I understand but you're talking about Seventeen percent that's one out of five people who take even a puff\nThat I learned that I Want to share with everybody and it's a lesson about\nWhy some people are so indignant\nAbout fake news\nAnd that's not to say that I'm not in the ignorant about 'em and digging in about this I just that we've had bias in the media for a long long time but sometimes it's\nParticularly egregious and I'll give you an example I um had watched the news coverage early this morning about the ceremony last night which I had not seen a lot\nAnd the ceremony last night was in the White House with a President Trump welcoming the whole Kavanaugh family the two daughters who are so proud of their dad and his wife Ashley\nThat sent judge Kavanaugh his wife Ashley and are just surfing all the judges justices of the spring court were there\nAnd\nWhat I heard about this event was oh it's too bad it was supposed to be such a nicer than from ruined it as he does because what he said was outrageous and he was self the rails any ruin that never before any spoiled that and it's disgusting and horrible\nAnd you know what when you watch it that is simply not true and let me\nTell you one area where I honestly I think most of the coverage that I saw on NBC and very much on CNN which is deliberately misleading they made it sound\nAs if a justice Kavanaugh spoke and spoke with dignity and then Trump spoke afterward and then ruined everything that justice but it wasn't like that because President Trump spoke first\nAnd he welcome people introduced every they all walked in together and then the president said thank you very much thank you members of Congress members of the cabinet honored yes and fellow Americans at my privilege to address you tonight from the East Room of the White House\nAnd then after a welcoming everybody\nHe said joining us for tonight's ceremony as every sitting Supreme Court justice chief justice Roberts thank you Justice Thomas thank you Justice Ginsburg thank you justice prior thank you Justice Alito thank you Justice Sotomayor thank you Justice Kagan thank you and justice Gorsuch\nNow why in that order that's the order at which they were appointed to the court\nAnd\nThen he said this in setting up how his particular performance of his duty and ... helping to watch the swearing in of there just to see it a a appointed how this was going to be different\nI Would like to begin tonight's proceedings differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude on behalf of our nation I Want to apologize\nTo Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure\nThose who stepped forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception\nWhat happened to the capital of family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process our country a man or woman washed always be presumed innocent unless\nAnd until proven guilty [noise]\nOkay and then he goes on to make the most controversial declaration he made in this state and then he goes on to say that that justice or capital was proven innocent now okay he's not proven innocent\nBut he was certainly judged innocent by anybody who's reasonable enough to look at this and to look at the preponderance of evidence upon runs of evidence was that\nAnybody who was there at the time any of the name the witnesses\nAgreed with him\nNot in saying that I Know this didn't happen but in the saying no I I don't remember this at all and I don't remember it at all like the way that\nChristine afford described it here's what President Trump said that you share\nUnder historic scrutiny were proven innocent thank you [noise]\n\nMargaret analyze your father is a great man is a man of decency character kindness encourage who is devoted his life to serving his fellow citizens and now from the bench of our nation's highest court\nYour father will defend the eternal rights and freedoms of all\nAmericans you know [noise] [noise]\nOkay this is just fine and it's touching because you can look at the way the Kavanaugh family his\nDaughters more written lives out we're looking up at him and his wife Ashley when when President Trump was saying these words and what he says saying he's a man of decency character kindness and courage\nThere is no one who has stood up to say anything different no one ... and you know that if\nThere were someone who said oh yeah ten years ago he cheated mayor ten years ago I saw him beating up somebody areas drunk or is that\nThey would have come forward they wouldn't be publicized a great deal the best they could do was to get three different women none of them had any corroborating evidence\nWho were charging him with being a jerk freshman year of college\nOr in high school and [noise] sorry\nThat doesn't take away the idea that he has lived a lifetime showing himself to\nBe a man of decency character kindness encouraged President Trump\nConcluded\nMargaret his allies as presidents tonight reminds us a lot of his historic event all about your father is all about\nIt's about what kind of a nation we're going to be and what kind of a country our children will inherit\nIt is up to each of us and to all Americans watching tonight to answer that question is up to us to reclaim our heritage of equal and impartial justice is up to us to re dedicate ourselves to the traditions and wisdom\nOf our founders and it is up to us to renew the bonds of love loyalty and affection\nThat leads us falls to gather as one great American family [noise]\nAnything wrong with that it it doesn't seem to me there as it seems to me that President Trump was in the right spirit for the occasion as he was with these last comments introducing the actual swearing and listen\nJust is Kevin ... left by Anthony Kennedy\nSoon Justice Kennedy will administer the judicial both to Brett Kavanaugh\nJust as you did last year for justice Gorsuch\nThis will be the first time a Supreme Court justice has ever sworn in a former pork to take his seat\nA beautiful moment which reminds us that freedom is a tradition passed down from generation to generation and that's a big statement and I want to thank you for that so much so\n[noise] it is beautiful uh if if there's someone who really believes that this was a disgrace somehow that that President Trump ruined this occasion\nYou can give us a call and tell us why 'cause I don't see it one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and judge Kavanaugh\nSpoke particularly beautifully\nAnd yes I I think that some of his inter changes with the senators at his hearing were more testy than they needed to be\nAnd yes he didn't answer all the questions about as high school yearbook\nPerhaps perfectly but you know what in the sweep of history I think President Trump is right the entire\nProcess year as manipulated by the likes of Dianne Feinstein and an issue and uh and Spartacus and Mazie Hirono and a Richard Blumenthal and Sheldon Whitehouse and the rest of them\nThat entire process will be remembered\nAs a sham and a disgrace and not a positive thing for the country so this is a good place to turn forward and move ahead when we come back we'll we'll go to your calls one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nAnd we'll also play most\nOf a judge Kavanaugh's justice Kevin O's brief but I think very moving and very well crafted remarks or we will be right back on the dawn of a new day and a new term for the Supreme Court of the United states coming up on them that that show [noise]\nPresident Trump concluding his remarks said um is that the U.S to read that gay or sales to the traditions and wisdom of our founders and a desire to us to renew the bonds of love loyalty and affection that links\nThose are gather as one great American family\nOkay he acknowledged that it was unusual what he was doing\nBut I Do think that the process that victimized both Dr ... forward and justice Kavanaugh that the process was unusual and not admirable\nLou in Cherry Hill New Jersey Lou you're on the Michael Mann that show\nYour eye Iran right yeah um I mean I I don't know when I look at what what he did he said he was completely um yup proven to be innocent um he didn't he didn't investigate\nAll the people who were actual witnesses that we're likely witness that would have more information it was not a thorough process so for him to go around and do that slap it in our face\nOkay with the law they voted in two thousand twelve for Obama didn't get Merrick Garland I mean you're slap it in our face and say it's proven innocent didn't even have a really the only investigation\nThat way when you say when you say phony investigation what do you mean who who are the witnesses or that\nThere were several there were several witnesses that the Ramirez woman\nI I understand they decide they made a decision they made it it'd be a because that was not their job\nWhat they were asked to do was to investigate Dr Ford and as far as Deborah Ramirez concern\nI mean come on come on it's\nIt's the idea but in other words what they didn't do the FBI and I think we're right now to do it will just go through a whole investigation of a Brett Kavanaugh was drinking habits when he was a freshman at Yale\nOr when he was a senior in high school why because it was irrelevant\nThe question was if Deborah Ramirez has some magic witness that you could put a from the fact which she even said by the way Deborah marriage she said I was too drunk to really remember this is what you saw it happen and it's a recovered memory and it was after the fact\nAnd this is pathetic what relevance does it have to his qualifications to be on the Supreme Court low\nSo my feeling is you were treated and times better than Obama but and then Merrick Garland was\nOkay I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I guarantee you that Merrick Garland would prefer what happened with him which was great respect no one spoke harshly about him no one's smearing him no one came up with things about his high school days or college days\nAnd probably because there is nothing but he did not get a hearing\nThat doesn't mean you're treated horribly we'll be right back\nDesign at the festival
