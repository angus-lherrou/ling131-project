Thursday it seems like another era where you had testimony from a doctor Christine Blasey Ford\nAnd then you hadn't testimony from Brett Kavanaugh very very high profile everyone's watching on TV a lot of interruptions from demonstrators\nNo I don't think there were any there weren't whether Germany nobody nobody knows that now somehow they were able for that to control\nThese idiots and I'm Sorry I think people who are screaming about murder and things like that are already it's indeed\nHonestly if they can control\nIt in a high profile situation they shouldn't ... every day\nVision is like a banana republic it is not appropriate for the world's greatest constitutional republic that people should be able to come on and into the galleries and screaming shout and by the way one of the things that has to happen is really prosecuting these people\nAnd I'm making them feel that disrupting Congress when doing its job and by the way I Would include\nAll of the conservative demonstrators who do that kind of thing\nAs well why do I say that because there are not I mean this is not some conservatives do what can you think of the last time that some right winger\nInterrupted a the

wonderful building and that Greek temples style all based upon the person on an Athens and classics because again the founders of our country\nIdentified with the creators of Greek and Roman law they did I Know ... more white males though again there are people and African studies departments who claim the ancient Greeks were really not white but leave that aside um\nMeanwhile these folks came up to the doors of the Supreme Court building and the doors are those heavy metal doors that with carvings on them and big handles\nAnd so a group of demonstrators came up to the doors spring court building banging on them literally budding their heads against them screaming shouting and sounding like this\n[noise]\nWhat\nWhat is the [noise]\nWhat is the the clear message here that we're

up a month from now you you do because the Democrats will guarantee much much much much more of this with impeachment investigations and lots of investigations and lots of hysteria and the end of the republic as we know it\nUh and basically some of the Democrats on the Senate floor wait to hear Cory Booker Spartacus\nOr who really has jumped the shark I mean it's it's just if this is your hysteria\nAbout Brett Kavanaugh ... you think he's talking about for ... you think he's talking about uh uh he even analogize is the ah the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama\nWith people getting their heads bashed in we're has there been some cruelty or some salt on the individuals who are expressing their opposition to Brett Kavanaugh\nI I mean what are we talking about here why is this

his appointment because of when it was announced and but there was no attempt to smear him in any way and nor do I know of any basis to smear him but go ahead\nWith it nothing about the fact of the matter is actually a few sexual or a a folk\nNo no there were not it was only I'm Sorry and this is very important that um\nThere was nothing injustice Kavanaugh's record nothing\nInvolving sexual

Charles Blow thinks is the key issue in his column that he writes liberals this is war and by the way the next day or actually it was the prior day the liberals this war that this morning\nOn Saturday the time that a big article ... courts legitimacy crisis is by Michael ...\nAnd he makes an interesting point which is that for justice Gorsuch injustice Kavanaugh they're the only two justices in the entire history of the Supreme Court\nWho have been nominated by president who didn't win the popular vote and confirmed by a majority of center senators\nWho when you take all the votes of the people who voted for Gore such an all the votes of the people who voted for\nJustice Kavanaugh and you put them against\nAll of the votes gathered by the people who voted against them well there were more votes for the people who voted against\nCheap but this is craziness because that's not how the way we choose US Senators\nIt's true that Wyoming gets two U.S senators there too fine conservative Republicans so to California\nAnd Wyoming has a population of about six hundred thousand in California has a population of thirty eight million they have the same representation in the U.S Senate that's how you find them more votes on the other side but this deliberately is the way they set up the constitution to protect smaller states\nSo that you don't have a situation where everything in the whole country is irrelevant except for California and Texas and Florida and New York everything else doesn't count I I mean this is very obvious\nAnd yes people who vote in California you get to be counted in the popular vote and they certainly have a big say in the electoral votes because you've got fifty five electoral votes in\nBut here's here's the basic point his complaint is not against the legitimacy of the court\nHis complaint is against it constitutional system that does work pretty well for two hundred and forty years what's wrong with these people\nYou're going to challenge the legitimacy of the court not based upon the qualifications of justice Gorsuch or justice Kavanaugh\nBut based on the fact that the senators who voted for the most of whom are Republicans represented states with smaller population than the people who voted against them one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\n... really it's foolishness a deep deep foolishness it seems to me and speaking of deep foolishness one of the um most outspoken opponents\nOf the confirmation of justice Kavanaugh was part it gets uh the one and only Cory Booker and he was out campaigning in Iowa why was he campaigning in Iowa is it because he has just enormous\nPopular in Iowa does he have a family and I I don't think so I don't know maybe this but why was Cory Booker and I always in Iowa because that's where the Democratic nomination process begins and his plan to win the presidency as he is going to be the most hysterical\nOr the most over the top the most ridiculous of all of the Democrats

move forward together\nDetails under events Murray's bill done this to some Michael\nStretch the\nOn the Michael ... show are talking about the ongoing fallout about\nOne of the a truly great confirmation battles and all of the history of the U.S Senate and in fact I Can't think of anything that has produced a this this level of of negativity and craziness and hatred the board battle was close\nThe Clarence Thomas battle was close\nBut what's interesting about that is there were a bunch of Democrats who voted to confirm Clarence Thomas they weren't\nThere were unfortunately a bunch of Republicans who turned against\nJudge Bork\nAnd here it was such a strict party line thing but Susan Collins I think spoke so well for people who may be in there are a bunch of Americans who are genuinely undecided anybody who's still undecided and you don't know well how do they handle it and what what is really count on that she's listening Susan Collins speech\nShe made this clear I'm OK we will get to that in a moment she made clear that she believes that Christine Blasey Ford was assaulted\nBut she believes not by a red Canada\nAnd this is what Mazie Hirono the gentle lady of Hawaii I actually the most pathetic of of all of the Democrats\nAnd the Judiciary Committee this is what senator Hirono had to say about Susan Collins\nCan you think that senator Collins is insulting to professor for what to say that she thinks that back and forth I think\nThat she left her ... what is that is the focus\nOf [noise] see I have a vaccine for so many survivors\nAre from her ... and now for all of us have been very sorry have an across from survivor of going back many many years where they kept all these phone calls him out at a cost to themselves and says what happened with with a Fox survivors that they did not come forward I found out that in you\nAnd if that she kept saying that there was no cooperation\nCooperation on having a ball a fair chance that he didn't do it\nWell it's probably a pilot study 'cause it was only one point four million dollar only now overall every year ha Jeff Dole's out about four hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of grants to put that in perspective\nThe U.S military every year at the department of defense their total budget is six hundred billion dollars\nWow wow a at ... it in terms of what you were talking about with open the books dot com\nYou have a a basic approach which is the transparency is the only way to solve this is letting people know what's going on and President Trump doesn't have to get this through Congress he could do it on his own right\nWell and that's that's the plan of the strategy that we outline first that the wall Street Journal than at USA Today and it's a three pronged attack and as the commander in chief at this moment that our nation's history when we feel that spending is a crisis\nThe president can take this three pronged approach and he should lead by example issued posts all White House expenditures and then step to\nCut the federal agency waste and step three and this is my favorite part Michel he should report the American people\nShow us how he's defending the American taxpayer by cutting waste fraud and taxpayer abuse and we believe that he should do Twitter to do the reporting\nI think it's a great idea and by the way you also suggest here that there should be an across the board cut in every federal department beginning with the White House and this was something I wrote a book about the White House staff years ago\nAnd man is there a lot of waste and ridiculous in us in terms of the Fifteen hundred people who work in the White House staff\nAt the President Roosevelt one world war two with a hundred and six White House aides total and what is it that we need Fifteen times that number for today\nI I don't I don't get that at all what what about can you give us some background on the um the two hundred thousand six hundred one dollars that our government spends on a new condom design with a additional lubrication why why does the federal government's minimum that\nKnow the economist history it's a very competitive industry but I'm a two hundred thousand dollars flowed into a Boston, Massachusetts is a private company for new condom design this is just one of the grants now they're\nObviously a small company we did identify Michael\nAt the fortune one hundred these are our most successful companies in the entire world certainly in this country that over a three year period they received three point three billion dollars worth of our money American taxpayer subsidies and they cannot argue that they need our money uh\nThere's another one here which is a cigar taste test in Virginia for a hundred and fourteen thousand three hundred Seventy five dollars how could they hold the spending to just a hundred and fourteen thousand dollars for the cigar taste tests\nAnd there's a lot of studies like that one point one million dollars of our taxpayer money went to prepare America's religions for the discovery of extraterrestrial life one million dollars went for a study on where it hurts the most to be stunned by be\nOkay ... I guess is the theory is that if the government doesn't prepare you for the arrival of Esther extraterrestrials who will then we also spend money looking for extraterrestrial only government my\nWell I think that was an inside deal that was twenty million dollars that the one that went to one of Harry Reid's friends and they went out looking for extraterrestrial life\nOkay people should should get involved with this and what I Love is the three pronged approach which is number one President Trump began by showing how every penny is spent in the White House and a number two he touched the White House staff\nBy ten percent and then orders every other federal departments caught by five percent and then number three he starts giving us updates every month on this war on waste because this is a war we can actually win\nIf you want to find out more about this uh go to our website to Michael midday dot com will link you write to open the books dot\nCom that's open the books dot com or Adam ... is the founder and the c._e._o. and I think you're doing the Lord's work my friend and I hope you continue and have great success with it we will be right back on the Michael ...

right now is vote vote vote vote vote and fine and good luck I don't think they are very effectively appealing to voters and the reason that this whole idea of a war doesn't hold a Jeff is look John

were twenty five thousand people\nAmericans who died in that war but uh we don't have that the percentage of people on the left who uh want to go ahead and how people out of restaurants or want to
