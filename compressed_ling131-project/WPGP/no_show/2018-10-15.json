scientific study\nIt makes it clear that marijuana does more damage to teenage brains for teenagers who use marijuana\nThan alcohol\nBy the way it doesn't mean that alcohol is a good idea for teenagers as it is it and no don't somebody bring up Brett Kavanaugh look at it most parents understand that it's not great for kids at fourteen Fifteen sixteen to be using alcohol\nBut it's even

extraordinarily powerful I mean seriously powerful he says that there's a reason than Alcoholics Anonymous started in Nineteen thirty five\nWhat's the reason that was two years after the end of prohibition alcohol abuse became rampant in the country almost rank itself off the rails\nWell the same thing happened with marijuana\nNow by the way this is really important because it's historically true most people think oh you know prohibition was a gigantic failure people drank just as much under prohibition\nAnd then they ended prohibition and everything was happy this by the way it was a big Republican democratic issue was one of the first things that Franklin Roosevelt did when the Democrats came to power\nOr was end the prohibition amendments to\nUh go ahead and repeal the prohibition

participant was about Thirteen Years old the students took yearly memory tests and self reported their alcohol and marijuana use those reports were kept confidential\nBy the fourth year three quarters of the students have consumed alcohol at least occasionally well only about thirty percent use marijuana regularly but the study observe more daily marijuana users and alcohol abusers the study found some of the marijuana as negative effects were lasting\nA particularly troubling finding young cannabis users may cause long term damage to a brain function associated with substance abuse\nWhen

age the the one thing about this is ... and I know that\nThere are a lot of people out there are reaching for their phones right now and saying hey I've been smoking pot for years and years and I'm a sharp as ever\nUh let let other people that that it ... whenever whenever we do this this issue on the air and it's an important issue because right now there's a very very big industry that's involved in trying to get people to think oh this is just harmless good fun\nAnd I look for most people who use marijuana I understand but you're talking about Seventeen percent that's one out of five people who take even a puff\nThat I learned that I Want to share with everybody and it's a lesson about\nWhy some people are so indignant\nAbout fake news\nAnd that's not to say that I'm not in the ignorant about I'm indignant about this it's just that we've had bias in the media for a long long time but sometimes it's particularly egregious and I'll give you an example\nI um had watched the news coverage early this morning about the ceremony last night which I had not seen allies\nAnd the ceremony last night was in the White House with a President Trump welcoming the whole Kavanaugh family the two daughters who are so proud of their dad and his wife Ashley\nThat send judge Kavanaugh his wife Ashley and\nJustice Kennedy was there ... all the judges justices of the spring court were there\nAnd\nWhat I heard about this event was oh it's too bad it was supposed to be such a nicer than but Trump ruined bed as he often does because what he said was so outrageous and he was so off the rails any ruin this event never before any spoil that and it's disgusting and horrible\nAs you know what when you watch it that is simply not true\nAnd let me tell you one area where I honestly I think most of the coverage that I saw on NBC and very much on CNN which is deliberately misleading they made it sound\nAs if a justice Kavanaugh spoke and spoke with dignity and then Trump spoke afterward and then ruined everything the justice but it wasn't like that because President Trump spoke first\nAnd he welcome people introduced every they all walked in together and then the president said thank you very much thank you members of Congress members of the cabinet honored gas and fellow Americans are my privilege to address you tonight from the East Room of the White House\nAnd then after a welcoming everybody he said joining us for tonight's ceremony as every sitting Supreme Court justice chief justice Roberts thank you Justice Thomas thank you Justice Ginsburg thank you Justice Breyer thank you Justice Alito thank you\nJustice Sotomayor thank you Justice Kagan thank you and justice Gorsuch now why in that order that's the order at which they were appointed to the court\nAnd\nThen he said this in setting up how his particular performance of his duty and ... helping to watch the swearing in of the justice see it as a appointed how this was going to be different\nI Would like to begin tonight's proceedings differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude on behalf of our nation I Want to apologize\nTo Brett and the entire capital of family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure\nThose who stepped forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception\nWhat happened to the capital of family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process our country a man or woman wants to always be presumed innocent unless and until\nProven guilty [noise]\nOkay and then he goes on to make the most controversial declaration he made in this statement he goes on to say that\nThat justice or capital was proven innocent now okay he's not proven innocent\nBut he was certainly judged innocent by anybody who's reasonable enough to look at this and to look at the preponderance of evidence the honors of evidence was that anybody who was there at the time any of the name the witnesses\nAgreed with him\nNot saying that I Know this didn't happen button saying no I I don't remember this at all and I don't remember it at all like the way that\nChristine afford described it here's what President Trump said\nThat use are under historic scrutiny were proven innocent thank you [noise]\n\nMargaret analyze your father is a great man he's a man of decency character kindness encourage who is devoted his life to serving his fellow citizens and now from the bench of our nation's highest court\nYour father will defend the eternal rights and freedoms of all\nAmericans you know [noise]\nOkay this is just fine and it's touching because you can look at the way the Kavanaugh family his daughters Margaret in lives out we're looking up at him and his wife Ashley when when President Trump was saying these words and what he says saying he's a man of decency character kindness and courage\nThere is no one who has stood up to say anything different no one ...\nAnd you know that if there were someone who said oh yeah ten years ago he cheated mayor ten years ago I saw him beating on somebody or as drunk or is that\nThey would have come forward they wouldn't be publicized a great deal the best they could do was to get three different women none of them had any corroborating evidence\nWho were charging him with being a jerk freshman year of college\nOr in high school and [noise] sorry\nThat doesn't take away the idea that he has lived a lifetime showing himself to be a man of decency character kindness encouraged President Trump\nConcluded\nMargaret allies as presidents tonight reminds us flood his historic events all about your father is all about it's about what kind of a nation we're going to be and what kind of a country our children will inherit\nIt is up to each of us and do all Americans watching tonight to answer that question is up to us to reclaim our heritage of equal an impartial justice is up to us to re dedicate ourselves to the traditions and wisdom\nOf our founders and it is up to us to renew the bonds of love loyalty and affection\nThat leads us fall to gather as one great American family [noise]\nAnything wrong with that it it doesn't seem to me there as it seems to me that President Trump was in the right spirit for the occasion as he was with these last comments introducing the actual swearing and listen\nJust is Kevin ... is the place left\nAnthony Kennedy soon Justice Kennedy will administer the judicial dose to Brett Kavanaugh\nJust says you did last year for justice Gorsuch\nThis will be the first time a Supreme Court justice has every sworn in a former clerk to take his seat a beautiful moment which reminds us that freedom is a tradition passed down from generation\nTo generation that's a big statement and I want to thank you for that so much so [noise]\nIt is beautiful uh if if there's someone who really believes that this was a disgrace somehow that that President Trump ruined this occasion you can give us a call and tell us why 'cause I don't see it one eight hundred nine five five\nSeventeen Seventy six and judge Kavanaugh spoke particularly beautifully\nAnd yes I I think that some of the gender changes with the senators at his hearing were more testy than they need to debate\nAnd yes he didn't answer all the questions about his high school yearbook perhaps perfectly\nBut you know what in the sweep of history I think President Trump is right\nThe entire process here as manipulated by the likes of Dianne Feinstein and and asked you and uh and Spartacus and Mazie Hirono and a Richard Blumenthal and Sheldon Whitehouse and the rest of them\nThat entire process will be remembered\nAs a sham and a disgrace and not a positive thing for the country so this is a good place to turn forward and move ahead when we come back we'll\nWe'll go to your calls one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and we'll also\nPlay most\nOf a judge Kavanaugh's justice Kevin O's brief but I think very moving and very well crafted remarks or we will be right back on the dawn of a new day and a new term for the Supreme Court of the United states coming up on that show [noise]\nWhen President Trump concluding his remarks said um\nThat the U.S to read that gay ourselves to the traditions and wisdom of our founders and a desire to us to renew the bonds of love loyalty and affection\nThe link altogether as one great American family okay he acknowledged that was unusual what he was doing\nBut I Do think that the process the victimized both Dr blushing forward and justice Cavanaugh is a process was unusual and not admirable\nLou and Cherry Hill New Jersey Lou you're on the Michael Mann that show\nYour high high Iran but yet I'm I mean I I don't\nYou know when I look at what what he did he said he was completely um you know proven to be innocent\nUm he didn't he didn't investigate all the people who work actual witnesses that we're likely witness that would have more information\nIt was not a thorough process so from that go around and do that slap it in our face okay lead lawyer they voted in two thousand twelve for Obama didn't get Merrick Garland slap it in our face and say he's proven innocent didn't even have a really the only investigation\nThat way when you say when you say phony investigation what do you mean who who is the witnesses or that\nThere were several there were several witnesses that the Ramirez woman\nI I understand they ... they made a decision they made it it'd be a because that was not their job\nWhat they were asked to do was to investigate Dr Ford and as far as Deborah Ramirez is concerned I mean come\nOn come on it's it's the idea but in other words what they didn't\nDo the FBI and I think we're right not to do it was go through a whole investigation of I'm Brett Kavanaugh's drinking habits when he was a freshman at Yale\nOr when he was a senior in high school why because it was irrelevant the\nQuestion was if if Deborah Ramirez has some magic witness that you could could have for the fact which she even said by the way Deborah married she said I was too drunk to really remember this is what you saw it happen and it's a recovered memory and it was after the fact\nAnd this is pathetic what relevance does it have to his qualifications to be on the Supreme Court low\nSo my feeling is you were treated ten times better than Obama but and then Merrick Garland was\nOkay I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I guarantee you that Merrick Garland would prefer what happened with him which was great respect no one spoke harshly about him no one's smeared him no one came up with things about his high school days or college days\nAnd probably because there is nothing but he did not get a hearing that doesn't mean you're treated horribly we'll be right back\n\n[noise] don't pay double for your next home improvement project many companies are simply asking

I'd love to be educated on this school me telling me the most scandalous charge that was made against Merrick Garland either falls\nOr a true charge what was the the detail of his past the
