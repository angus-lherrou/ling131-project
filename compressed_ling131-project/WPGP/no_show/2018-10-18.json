know his story he was fired for his religious beliefs um after he wrote a men's Bible study on his personal time\nWhile she's Cochran prevailed if his firing could happen in the Bible belt of the south man it could happen to you where you live where you work and there will be more battles ahead according to alliance defending freedom senior counsel David court meant\nI Do I see more challenges in the future and I think the reason for that is and it's quite ironic it happened\nIn the chiefs case and then all of these other cases you know we hear so much today about tolerance and inclusive ... it was the exact reason that the city of Atlanta gave for firing a chief and it's quite ironic to say that we're being inclusive intolerant I firing someone who disagrees with our official views the that's what actually happened\nThat's why it's so urgent that you help us support alliance defending freedom\nThe first time in a very very long time we will get to that story\nOr there is also very good news just rose moments ago\nUh from the White House about fulfilling something that I had been pushing for for a while on this show\nAnd I'm very glad to see it it's a cold and across the board\nBudget cut spending cuts for every federal departments that President Trump is apparently planning to demand\nAnd as president he can demand that are starting tomorrow and that is appropriate meanwhile continued ramifications about this horrible murder\nIn Turkey and it appears pretty obvious that it was a murder is Trump responsible that's what a lot of people on the left and in the media sometimes means the same thing are saying uh plus uh we we really do need to\nTo go to some of the other media stories\nAbout media malfunctions including an attempt to us lime a great American just moments after he died a we will get to all of that on the med show one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\nFirst off this very positive story or and and again it's a story not based upon\nA conservative source is based upon the world Economic Forum which every year does rating in terms of the most competitive countries in the world\nAnd the U.S had not been doing badly compared to most other countries in the world we've been fairly competitive but we moved up very dramatically and we are now number one of the story is it's covered in uh on line of the wall Street Journal\nOr is US's world's most competitive economy for the first time in a decade the last time we were the world's most competitive economy was two thousand and eight\nWhat us two thousand and they'd have in common with a two thousand sixteen Republican presidents and yes that does make a difference when you have a pro business guy in charge\nThe U.S is back on top of the most competitive economy in the world regaining the number one spot for the first time since two thousand eight an index produced by the world Economic Forum which said the country could still do better on social issues okay\nAmerican climbed one place in the rankings of a hundred and forty countries with a top five rounded out by Singapore number to Germany number three Switzerland number four and Japan number five or five countries scores rose from two thousand Seventeen with us not seeing the second biggest gain\nAfter Japan's\nNow all of this is good news is good news for us that Germany is more competitive that Switzerland is more competitive particularly that Japan is more competitive\nThese are American allies and I know Swiss Switzerland supposed to be not aligned neutral it's effectively because of trade and economic matters it's an American ally it's tied into the west\nThe top spot hasn't gone to the U.S since the financial crisis of two thousand and eight sold output and triggered a global economic slowdown\nEconomic recovery is well underway with a global economy protected to grow almost four percent in two thousand Eighteen in two thousand and Nineteen said the report that uh was published\nA last night by the organization that produces the Davos conference on global politics and economics okay you may say well what does this have to do with my life everything because a more competitive economy means more jobs it means higher wages\nAnd means more prosperity it means more freedom\nBecause frankly if you have more options in terms of the jobs you look for in the way that you are in your living in the way that you can invest what ever dollars you can save\nIf if you have more choices that is the equivalent to more freedom\nAnd then there's this uh President Trump actually just talked about this at a a White House meeting and a ... this is uh what what President Trump made gives me it was just tells you\nAnnounce in advance that he was going to make the demand from his cabinet secretaries and here is what that demand sounded like just moments ago\nI'm going to ask each of you to come back with a five percent budget cuts [noise]\nFrom feel very as the far friends whether it's a secretary of the British straight or whatever I Would ask everybody to come back with a fiber says God for our next week and I think you'll be able to do is they may be a special\nExemption perhaps I don't know who that exemption would be if you can do more than five some of you will say hey I can be much more of a you know I've heard about the penny for Fifteen Years one penny every year for a dollar one very every year\nAfter four or five years the countries in good shape of a say with the ... of the five but it but I think you can do it\nSo I'd like to have everyone city around the table you're incredible domains you've presided over so bravely in some cases some cases very well some cases where there's like a I Would like you to come back with a a five percent cut [noise]\nGet rid of the fat get rid of the way and I'm sure you can do it I'm sure everybody has to say look at those\nOkay this is terrific and this is one of the best moments for the president so far in my opinion\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six the only thing that I Would add and and I feel kind of an Bolden to do this because this is something that we've talked about on the show was of that recently we've talked about a month ago it was necessary it was great the president is right on target\nThere's one thing you could add which is I'm going to set the example and I'm going to cut my White House budget I'm going to kind of right now\nAnd we're going to come back to you at the same time on all of you to come back and show them not cutting just five percent on cutting ten percent and by the way it is easy to cut the White House budget by ten percent there too many darn people who work in the White House and they were stumbling over one another by the way\nOne of the good things about Trump is he has an appointed people to fill all of those useless jobs at the White House when I say useless jobs\nYou have a whole offices with a director and then and associate director and then various secretaries for things like the office of White House liaison to the disabled community now this is not that this the disabled community\nBut there is no reason there are other government departments to deal with that health and Human Services has a huge commitment to that you don't need a special White House office there is a special White House office was established by President Clinton\nTo deal with the ... T community why it's not necessary that doesn't mean that act that should be divide do are denied the algae beat the people look there's this special White House office to deal with the Jewish community\nAnd I benefited from it because I during the Bush administration they would have a Hanukkah party and it was a lovely thing\nKeep up the Hanukkah party but you don't need a special White House liaison you don't need a special White House of bone teeth you don't need somebody drawing a government salary\nThey can tough this back we have a deficit right now seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars it went up Seventeen percent since last year it's not the cause of the Republican tax cuts\nIf you actually look at this and you read some of the hysterical democratic articles\nThey make it clear revenues have not gone down sharply if anything they may have gone up very slightly they basically been stable what's gone up has been spending\nAnd yes it's true as Mitch McConnell made the point yesterday that much of that spending about half of it is three big federal programs Mitch McConnell made a little bit of misstatement he said that the Seventy percent of the federal budget is Medicare Medicaid and Social Security it's not Seventy percent it's about fifty percent\nIf you add on an interest on the national debt and a bunch of other social program than it gets up to Seventy percent but still the point is that there is room for cutting the federal deficit we're really highlighted some of the programs some of the stupid spending that has really crippled our country\nNow that does not include however spending to get a new ambassador to Saudi Arabia this is something that President Trump could look into or do I believe that President Trump is to blame for the killing of ... of course not\nAnd this is a ridiculous ... liberal\nBasically incantation and if they say it off they say it enough it might be true and now it's not true do I think President Trump is doing a great job on Saudi Arabia and not so much but it's going to be okay it's going to be OK if he keeps in mind certain facts and priorities about our relationship\nWith his desert kingdom out by the way that desert kingdom one of those enlightened play tonic wonderful blend no this is a brutal and corrupt autocracy so how do you deal with it will get to that and your calls coming up on the ... [noise]\nA cut if you cut the rate of increase but you're entirely correct I think what President Trump has in mind here\nIs each of the federal departments is a lot of a set amount of money and let's say you have a a government bureau department is is a has a budget of a hundred billion dollars well that budget cut would mean you find five billion dollars the safe\nBut you're you're right to bring this up to and thanks for the call let's go to I'm Mark in Columbus ohio mark you're on the Michael ...\nThank you sir I really appreciate your ah your\nBipartisan a cross Yarnell you or your ah your regular view of America really appreciate thank you\n[noise] um yeah when you say a President Trump should lead by example he really are [noise] ah I mean once you've got yourself a ... he's already left opposition was open on the field as the\nAs are some people would say and and ... alone I think she she uh I mean the numbers are incredible it's something like a a the previous administration had a hundred and twenty five\nAnd go away to twenty five I was going to bring us point up the your ear entirely on the right track uh Michelle Obama had a staff of sixteen the twenty four people depending on when and her eight years as first lady Lonnie has a staff of\nNine but you don't want ... Milan you could make do with a staff of seven [laughter] don't you think and and and seriously because this whole thing about getting first ladies big staff is\nIs relatively new and a ... and the point is you're right Trump has left a bunch of White House positions unfilled and good for him but I'm ... the whole idea when people talk about turmoil in the White House\nThere would be less turmoil if there were less people working there fewer people working there and I I I think that's very very clear I um\nI wrote a book about this a long time ago\nIt was at the time that it came out which was a very long has forty years ago the time it came out as thirty nine that time the shadow presidents came out it was the first comprehensive history of the White House staff\nUp to that time and it's shocking a President Lincoln won the civil war\nWith the White House staff of two that's right too it was him and to assistance because he had a cabinet as well and I'm not saying that presidents should try to deal with the White House staff is too but he could probably make do with White House staff of two hundred and we'll be right back [noise]\nMichael ...

shouldn't have done you shouldn't have tweeted about Stormy Daniels she's not worth it\nBut the idea that this is somehow associated with Trump is ridiculous what President Trump has done since he's been president has been to encourage exactly the kind of change in\nSaudi Arabia that we have known that we've needed for a long time and you know who acknowledges this\nIt's a Tom Friedman doubled

donated money for the cause look I I first of all his grandfather was one of the masterminds of the Munich Olympic massacre it's his grandfather and he used to praise his grandfather\nAnd their stuff on the Internet about him pulling his grandfather a legend which he assumes deleted and now he apparently converted to Christianity good for him but even since his conversion to Christianity\nOr he is continued to give money to donate money\nTo uh the council on American Islamic Relations\nWhich is not a terrorist organization but it is an organization that justifies and sympathizes with um Muslim

us down in San Diego county where there's congressional seat is I've I've been very critical of Duncan Hunter I don't think he has a big future in politics he he he does need to respond effectively to

I Wish she went in case like that it has diminished says what is the proper victory a set of hitting home runs that headed up\nNow I I don't say this to be disparaging about our our Fleischer I think he's a nice man I met him a few times and ah he served of course in the Bush administration\nI'm so he's a an establishment guy\nHe knows the establishment world very well but don't you find it fascinating and again I don't mean this disrespect fully towards Ari Fleischer\nBut isn't it isn't an intriguing to listen to a pundit and that's what ... is now he's up like ... like me I mean he's ... he's ... he's a guy with an opinion we all have some of them have some of us have platforms whether it's Ari are appearing on Fox News\nOr maybe with the radio show we're we're we're basically just guys\nAnd gals with opinions so we are we're not we're not really that we're not certainly elected leadership were not in the government we can impact people I guess I suppose it's fair to say we can change hearts and minds\nBut in the scheme of things we're certainly not as well certainly not as important as the leader of the free world don't you find it fascinating that Ari Fleischer thinks he can tell\nThis phenomenally successful president\nHow he's making mistakes in\nOther words those who writes or who opine\nCan sit on the sidelines and say oh you're making a mistake you're wrong here for doing that\nListen I wouldn't call a woman horse race I admit it I'm not like Donald Trump I don't have this kind of personality frankly most of us don't the guy I keep\nCalling him as a ... call him the beach forget name in the ... the limousine that drives that he drives around in the stretch Cadillac limousine called the beach that's the secret service nickname\nHe's the beast but here's rule is kind of simple you come after me I'm going to go back after you tenfold I don't care if you're a woman\nI don't care if you're a man I don't care if you're a gold star family I don't care if your Mother Teresa I can see him calling Mother Teresa a name if she said something derogatory about him every\nBody he attacks\nEverybody he calls a name everybody he disparage is has disparaged him first\nAri Fleischer knows that Lindsey Graham knows that\nThat's what Senator Graham at when he started out the clip I don't know if we had to we have the Lindsey Graham cuts somewhere guys I just kind of rushing around in the hotel room was mourning a here in Florida on uh on TV religious said he's a fighter he's a fighter but he ... he shouldn't do this you shouldn't say that when he was the president\nOr we're not going to accept the fact\nThat he's not going to do things that traditional past presidents have done meanwhile oh I don't\nKnow there's a couple of pieces of news you might find interesting if you're worried about the president calling a porn star a horse race but you asked his back on top of the most competitive country in the world regaining the number one spot for the first time since\nTwo thousand and eight it's an it's the index produced by the world Economic Forum America climbed up ... one place in the rankings of a hundred and forty countries\nWere now head of Singapore Germany Switzerland in Japan we are the most we have the most competitive economy in the world\nAnd the fact of the matter is it is likely due to all the economic policies the terrorists that are starting to pay off more good news about the tariffs\n... terrorists are controversial we can have that debate I get it All right to have the dialogue but United States steel Corp workers or about to get the biggest wage increase in at least six years under a new deal negotiated with the company and according to Reuters\nThat's a sign that the games from President Trump's clamp down on foreign imports\nAre starting to trickle down and impact American workers so he cares about American workers so he cares about American companies solely cares about Americans wow what a what a novel idea an American president worried about American workers oh wow\nIt's been a long time since we've seen that it seems wages were frozen in the last contract with US Steel Pittsburgh based company Trump's trade policy\nCoupled with a strong economy has sent domestic steel prices soaring helping US Steel posed a near sixty percent increase in pre tax profits in the June quarter now the less they hate that they hid companies making money but he companies passion that profit on to their workers\nBut normal Americans normal people appreciate the fact that the thousands and thousands of US Steel Corp workers who are about to get the biggest wage increase they've gotten in six years are thrilled\nWith that news and guess what that's due to that's due to\nPresident Trump's economic policies including the tariffs including international\nTrade including domestic policies that are making a huge difference so while the media gets all hyperbolic and hysterical about something like the president counter punching a porn star\nWho he defeated incidentally in the courts remember this week and the reason there's been such animal is is a court of a federal judge ruled that stormy\nDaniels lawsuit against the president tweeting about her her defamation suit was thrown out and she has been ordered to pay his legal fees which according to the president are substantial [noise]\nThat's why this has got this got such a contentious ms around [noise] hold while the media slapping about horse race [noise]\nOh yeah at first I Want to keep up the
