the number one eight hundred nine five five one seven seven six go ahead and get in line now you might as well I have a feeling it's going to be a a hot an active three hours\nBecause and ever since ... to the middle of the talk show day friday\nOr all kinds of things have busted out and we need to talk about all of them so why don't we take them in sort of chronological order and uh and I have questions for you and are just less just share thoughts and see where we all are because this this is not just a confirmation hearing any more [noise]\nThis is not just a battle like the ones we've had in the past contentious things like that of slander of Robert Bork by Ted Kennedy in Nineteen eighty seven the at the battle\nClarence Thomas or just a short period of time there after that was of course acceptable [noise] uh but when the Supreme Court is a very very big deal and the battles over it or a big deal\nAnd the moment Brett Kavanaugh was named as President Trump's election I knew I was in ... in support of his nomination because I Want constitutional is on the high court ah I I was thrilled to have Gorsuch that was a replacement\nFor the late Antonin Scalia a V. Anthony Kennedy vacancy ... was a kind of a fifty fifty Justice Kennedy a lot of rulings are came down on one side of the bed he woke up on and and he's been replaced by solid constitutional issue which is a a a wonderful thing\nAnd and now we have a a situation in which ah\nWith with with Kavanaugh here comes another constitution list and there is no way in the world there there is no way that the today's left is going to allow a\nAnother constitutional list I'm On the court flood of people said they didn't get this bad for Gorsuch Gorsuch somehow made it in what seems like a walk on the beach now compared to today's standards and and\nBecause they'll give you one you know there is that old precepts that when you win that election you've you've heard this a million times elections have consequences right and they do that's why ... board knows Morocco Obama's election consequences and one of those consequences or Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan\nOn on the Supreme Court two constitutions shaping judicial tyrants because that's what you're going to get when Democrats main people at the Supreme Court but but it was Lindsey Graham said in that magnificent Thursday or\nA moment of his it said it as as as he said as the Democrats and as as as she said to uh to judge Kavanaugh when you get on the court when you see Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan you tell them Lindsay said hello\nBecause I voted for them and I would never do that what these people are trying to do for you I still wonder William Jessup four days later after that Lindsey Graham moment\nI I've I rarely them as a\nI I may have leapt to my feet sharing I'm Glad I wasn't driving cars I it was it was so magnificent it brought such moral clarity\nAnd moral clarity is what we need moving forward in this crazy week this crazy week uh we made necessary by Jeff Flake and we're going to talk about him in a minute and in fact we're going to hear from him in a minute because he is at some\nEvent in Boston some radio station is doing something and he was just a it in one and they have an interviewer was asking him a bunch of things and since you know Jeff Flake runs the world now I guess we'd better probably you know figure out what to\nWhat the oracle says and believe these days but the moral necessity of this is something that I Am addressing in a town hall dot com column that ah that will run tomorrow and that is that this is not just a a Supreme Court\nBattle anymore this this is not just a victory that we should seek a because we want to constitutional issues on the Supreme Court this is\nA moral assassinate because it's not just about him reaching the court anymore these kinds of tactics these kinds of things that you've seen these these despicable\nBottom feeding tactics by today's left from actual senators to cartoonists to column writers to two pundits to people to to all walks of left his life\nAnd they can't they simply cannot win they simply can not when they have dashed against the rocks the basic precepts of jurisprudence and\nNot even jurisprudence thinking about a couple of concepts innocent until proven guilty not just on a federal law school precepts that's not something to justify courtroom ideal innocent until proven guilty\nHe's a basic human decency it's what you were forty anybody who's accused of anything same thing with requiring evidence\nAn allegation is made well what's the evidence that's the first question you don't accept an allegation on face value this believe women saying it is a scam\nIt in his political bullying Jeff Flake was bullied him that elevator and and and folded like a skinny seventh grader on the playground\nAnd and we're now in this needless weaker FBI\nProbing what's the latest hang on the White House has authorized the FBI to expand its investigation interviewing anybody it seems that even it deems necessary as long as the review is finished by the end of the way oh did you hear any bugs today that the FBI I don't know what kind of we can just go to their advantage of that an FBI lake\nBut there was buzz earlier today that the FBI might be ready to wrap this up like tomorrow\n[noise] okay whenever you got till friday you're got killed friday that is what ... told us a last friday as you know how old are you can have my vote you'll have it in committee but you can only have it in the full Senate ah\nAfter a week of a a further probes and and look the best case scenario\nThe best case scenario is that this week\nGives throws a Boehner to the Democrats who had demanded it\nCreates a comfort zone to ideologically vague people like Jeff Flake\nProvides a year I Would say cover ... provide comfort of for the Republican votes of Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski\nAnd maybe here's recovered comes in and maybe provide cover for some Democrats who I think we want to vote for Kavanaugh I think they want to not because they like him anymore than Cory Booker does but because they really need to wind up\nAs you know there are dead you know Democrats famously running\nIn states that Trump won and won big Joe Manchin in West Virginia Joe Donnelly in Indiana Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota these are people they don't just want to vote for judge get they probably don't want to vote for judge Kavanaugh but they need to vote for judge Kavanaugh because I'll tell you right now\nIf Joe Manchin votes for judge Kavanaugh he takes a big bite out of Patrick Morsi's attack on him Patrick Morsi is the west Virginia attorney general he's a magnificent man\nI think he's going to win and that and that that would be fantastic that would just be a wonderful thing to Patrick Morrisey be the senator from West Virginia and set of Joe mansion and I like Joe ... Joe Manchin is one of those Democrats who does not make your teeth sketch\nAh he's a left of center you know big labor but socially conservative sort of tired of sometimes West Virginia a guy and I know that territory very well as the first place I ever worked in radio back forty something years ago and and loved it then love it now\nUm love it so much that I Want them to have a conservative senator [laughter] so let's so let's go Patrick Morrisey and Patrick Morrisey his blood Janine Joe manager right now I like ... him to vote for a for Kavanaugh which mansion may do\nAnd this week of FBI\nFoolishness may may give them cover and so if we get to the end of this week in the deck is cleared and the nonsense says that is as old as all played out and\nWe have a successful full Senate vote on Kavanaugh is confirmed it will have all been worth it right it will have all\nBeen worth it but first we've got to get there first of all that but I just that has to actually happen\nIt may not it really may not have you met today's last have you seen these people have you seen what they do have you heard what they do\nThey will move heaven and earth to prevent this ... not just this nomination their goal is to stretch this election win back the house so they can impeach Trump and when the Senate so that even if he they they don't impeach him which they won't\nUh he'll never get another nominee on the court\nBecause when you boil it all down there is all about making sure that they're sacrament of abortion\nIs untouched that's what this whole thing has always been about you know that right if not I'll help you out with that [noise] so um some of the lowest things have happened over these last few days I'm gonna share the money because my my thought is some folks may overplay their hand smart Davison for Michael my bed happy Monday\nIs Jeff ... job and I and and by the way I'm not trying to turn them into Ted Cruz her turn him and to me this is what a responsible Jeff Flake ought to have done that occasion ma'am I\nI Am so sorry for anything that happened to you and I honor your experience and I'm hoping to your experience and you have every prayer and every good wish for healing and ... that's all I have to say about your experience your victimization I of exactly the proper deference than anybody should have for that\nHowever you identify judge Kavanaugh as someone who sexually assaulted someone that is simply not been born out in the fact it may in some investigation may play out but next week but it hasn't been yet my decision my vote needs to be based on what the evidence shows\nAnd what testimony reveals and not based on anything anybody tells me no matter how passionate they may be about something that might have happened unrelated in their lives\nNow please get out of the elevator I gotta go that's how it goes on but it didn't just now we have this week of hell but wait a minute on that wait a minute on that\nWhat is this week going to do when you're together today and tomorrow I'm enormously grateful but once again it's all Joe God you're smiling a Michael's back Wednesday Thursday Friday of course and then moving on a permit [noise]\nBy the time we gets Wednesday Thursday Friday we was friday being the supposed a deadline for this entire FBI dog and pony show\nI I think there's a possibility here because as bleak as it may look and as a twist it off as I Am about a ... doing during this week you realize we are talking about today's left right we are talking about today's Democratic Party right\nI I think the air hang sit with possibilities that they may overplay their hand so profoundly\nThat they may reveal such a deep bug guide hatred in the things they say and I do and I'm not I'm Talking about a cartoonist columnist and United States senators and everybody in between\nThe the pendulum of empathy may swing toward judge Kavanaugh has millions of Americans just a good grief enough enough this man has suffered enough then there is still no\nEvidence of the type of wrongdoing that originally created this problem for him I think by friday that may be the landscape I pray that it is\nOkay ... with the LA Times he would talk back to their one eight hundred non five five Seventeen Seventy six Mark Davis in from I commend mentality on Twitter at Mark Davis M.

was raining us to do okay we did it are you happy now the answer\nOf course for many will be no of course they're not going to be happy now some people will never be happy because you know exactly what the game is delay delay delay attack attack attack a lot of people who said we just want to we just take it to friday and next week are going to be the exact same people\nWho are then going to say what's not enough it it's an artificial deadline I mean why in the world where we are just trying to get the lottery to fire people afraid of the truth oh my gosh you'll hear all of that garbage you'll hear all of that\nNonsense and so just hopefully other Lindsey Graham in the court I played last hour\nA look at it I think he might have heard some of what I heard a little bit of bugs it's\nAnother be FBI might be about rapidly so they had a nice full weekend how long to talk to five or six people how long does it change you know I mean how many questions you have to ask\nSo ah the I don't know when the FBI is going to ah to to make its findings known\nI I Will tell you I Am comfortable asserting that I have no expectation of additional damaging information vis very FBI has looked into a judge Kavanaugh's six times dishes time number seven\nAnd so what's the likelihood oh my gosh ... is a gang rape is what how did we miss that\nI don't think that's going to happen [noise] real quick [noise] uh you're hosted talk show you take calls and then there's a little tape loop in your head that sometimes rolls of a previous call\nI Want to go back to a gentleman uh it was a very uh it was it was an invigorating voted called gentleman from Columbus in fact I think for his call\nHis main points were Republicans don't want the truth cabin all the liar ah it's all terrible and you know it and where we're just trying to get the bottom of this and it's an instruction game going on and or or a a cover up going on blah blah blah so\nI asked him several times what is the evidence what is the evidence that Dr Ford is telling the truth what is the as the ... and saw that pesky evidence\nThat ah the doctor for it as properly identified judge Kavanaugh as a as her attacker\nGentleman replied with a sentence that began\nWill judge Kavanaugh is lying dot dot dot and someone will know so that that's re stating your premise you're not telling me the evidence that he's like you're telling me that you think he is life I Want to get the gentleman over the benefit of that I think the idea of where you might have been going\nAnd this is a concept that I I think is going to be heavily played just this week\nI think the gentleman's the end of his sentence would have been\nThat he's lying about some things so maybe lying about others okay a concept in law the juries are free if you find that that a witness if you find that a witness has indeed factually lied about one thing you may then cast whatever amount of debt you walk on everything else that witnesses said oh that could be interesting\nSo perhaps the gentleman's point I Want to get I Want to give him full shrift ah ... is that he found judge Kavanaugh not believable on some other things and that struck him as evidence that he's lying about everything\nThat that's far from a from a gracious interpretation but it if if it ... but it's something that the gentleman his is entitled to however here's the thing\nHe has not caught judge capital in a lie about anything\nAnd nobody will no one will that precept only applies if you find that someone absolutely provable he has lied about something that we have now is ...\nKevin are talking about some drinking episodes and there are some people from his pass to go ... you might be under play in the drinking episodes usually is getting a little harder than he let on\nAnd then there's all this year book code language of you know the ... or ... says they said it was also learn in your book a ... channels trying golden booze and this and that that's so stupid but here's the thing\nAre in there and and everybody started Googling stuff is rule I don't think you do lose the truth about that was a key might be soft peddling that we're never going to know okay\nWe will never not this week or any week ... ever learn the judge Kavanaugh was\nFactually misrepresenting anything about his way word moments at Georgetown Prep\nAs such there will not arise any basis for that legal precept of if we caught your eye and about a and B you might have been lying about the Indy\nSo with that are in a moment a boy in the United states to be in the Senate gallery today because there's red hot Senate action actually there's not really actually there's red hot Senate talking [laughter] there's no real\nAction we're waiting for action we're trying to take action we thought we were going to take action but Jeff late sudden that he took action he and Chris Coons got our closet and and took action to bring the whole thing to a grinding halt thanks guys [noise]\nUm but but Chuck Schumer refers to some of exactly what I'm Talking about there that now they're moving the goalposts and it is not that there's any evidence that judge Kavanaugh\nIs is a horrible cereal sex criminal but rather they're going after and going after his credibility on other stuff and you'll hear a Senator Schumer attempt that in a moment the one thing I said I wanted to share as the last hour of the evaporated\nWas this amazing quote\nFrom a woman named Elizabeth last us I think we have a rich Lowry to think over National Review\nIt is an excerpt from a book that she wrote called witness for the defense\nOr she is an expert in psychology law human memory eyewitness testimony I saw another article treated somebody in the New York times in like the year two thousand or I'll find it if if I Need to ah it was just a very compelling eaten a essay written by a woman\nWho was raped I guess some time prior to two thousand 'cause she wrote it in two thousand and she said I I I there was a lineup identified my attacker I was one hundred percent certain\nThat that was my attacker and I was mistaken and her courage you're talking about courage that takes courage to admit having blown call but as morally\nNecessary to shore and ... and you know what else is morally and intellectually necessary\nFor us to recognize that this can happen to anybody to anybody even Dr Ford so here is the excerpt from Elizabeth Loftis in her book witness for the defense\nFor how can we disbelieve the sworn testimony of eyewitnesses to a crime when the witnesses are absolutely convinced that they are telling the truth why after all\nWould they why but there's the word\nLie that's the word that gets us off the track you see I witnesses who point a finger at innocent defendants are not liars\nFor they genuinely believe and the truth of their testimony the face that they see before them is the face of the attack of the face of innocence has become the face of guilt that's the frightening part so truly horrifying idea that our memories\nCan be changed inextricably altered and what we think we know what we believe with all our hearts is not necessarily\nThe truth man that's a paragraph that is a paragraph from Elizabeth last us in her book witness for this at a woman with ... and psychology law\nEyewitness testimony human memory things like that\nI never ever ever actively believed that this entire thing was a trick so dirty that they find a woman who would under oath make up stuff and intense and only lie\nI never believed that and as I watched a doctor forge testimony on Thursday morning she you know let's let's go let's go\nTo the dictionary on another word she seemed to what's the word everybody uses credible\nBut what is credible mean to me it it was I mean it means somebody who's the believable machines believable yeah but it means more than that and we'll examine that takes more your calls and looks more audio of this busy busy day Mark Davis in from Michael ... stick around\nOne eight hundred nine and five Seventy Seventy six Michael mad vigil [noise]\nI I guess I mean I'm ... I mean this is Saturday Saturdays this week ... I'll be ... this week this work week\nYou know [laughter] so do do do tease me much don't tease me [noise] so uh it's it's when will this FBI thing wrap up I don't know so let's let's continue to um take a look at your thoughts as we had to Los Angeles Robert Mark Davis in for Michael how are you sir\nYourself Hi great [noise]\nYeah I'm just now that there's no evidence that there is Kevin ... fellow code and it\nKept fading about what the witnesses said it didn't happen that's not what they said they said they're going to remember\nA ...\nTo get Dr Ford delegations quote from judge Kavanaugh are not merely uncorroborated their refuted by the very people she says we're there you will have I guess you know what someone the other one is that there are no no I understand I I and I understand completely and judge Kavanaugh pointed out the various people who have no memory of having been there\nAnd he suggests that the refugee ... aims\nYou know that's not what he said he said\nAll the witnesses stated it they have to go back and look at it step by step\nThat that I'm actually I'm looking at the court right now and to quote from Dr from judge Kevin a doctor forwards allegations are not merely uncorroborated each refuted by the very people she says we're there and we can have a semantics game all day and some ethics is important to the meaning of words mazer people\nI I ...

get it okay let me read a little closer to home honey [laughter]\nDoes this dress make my bud look man see I see you understand me completely now you understand me completely now ally is something you said that you know isn't true with the intent to deceive show credibility what his credibility credibility means more than just\nPresenting well credit judge Kavanaugh is not credible because he brought passion to his testimony he's not credible because she\nSpoke with clarity and conviction of Dr Ford is not credible because she spoke with with with conviction and she spoke with passion she spoke with her own identified certainty\nAnd you ... what do you remember what I understand it's up to ... that's a thoroughly fair question I Would indeed and if you're asking me the day after or the month after I absolutely would if I get on it for thirty some years is there a possibility that I remember the wrong person yes there is\nOkay if the parking within your family your white right act like about a man or something or a year ago when you get why\nRight what you act like he was some kind of political a job or something\nGotcha gotcha could go to another another very another very fair question another very fair question the first thing I don't want to do is hunt him down and kill 'em so for being honest with each other that Bush so [noise] but but you do your actual question would I Believe her I Would listen to her love her care for her but here's the thing\nIt would be my job as just as a rational human being if she says something and let's say she is saying it about a public figure and nobody else can corroborated in any way shape or form I mean I might very well just\nDefer to her because I Love her and it's my job to support her an honor her\nBut I could not blame the world if the world remain skeptical because of the world must require evidence this is not allowed to religion is not about whether Russell Ford believes Dr Ford is about whether we all can and without evidence we can not\n... that's your opinion and in\nThe front page that that's all that's going to ... that's called the way life has to me that's the way life has to be we cannot believe people we try investing people's stories with no evidence we can't you know that right we can't that's a crazy world\nWell if you're going by the world in\nA very [laughter] that's a crazy crazy

Republican Louisiana's got to join us live right out of the box in the next hour some sit tight for that but meanwhile Senator Cornyn was talking about viewing all those all of this testimony through a very personal Lynn's\nWill Lisa Murkowski do what will Susan Collins do us fought in the world will Jeff Flake do moment by moment and this week contains questions about\nHow long the FBI probes going to take her there was bus I mentioned earlier making rent this thing up tomorrow that seems quaint a visit to develop and from the White House today was they've essentially said look\nWe've not limiting the scope of this in any way examine what ever it is you want to examine just so long as you're done by\nFriday and so there's a quarter of a jar reliably from the Democratic side saying wait a minute why does this artificial uh a limitation on the scope and timing of the investigation ... woman your buddy Jeff Flake\nWho who established is no longer than a week\nAnd and no further than the scope of what we've been testifying about so far but in a in an environment where the goalposts are always moving and the terms are always changing lettuce heading into the United states and the state of Louisiana has been very very well represented\nOf late a junior Senator John Kennedy is on the Judiciary Committee you've seen a lot of hemp senior senator is Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana who joined us right now what a pleasure that user welcome to the Michael ... that show\nHey mark thank you for having me\nEnormous pleasure thanks for being here let me ask you the thirty thousand foot question first and then we'll we'll start to dig deep uh how how does how do you spend the weekend how did last week strike you and where do you see this drama right now Monday October first\nI was so angry last week the way the Senate Democrats sacrificed doctor for its confidentiality the way they abuse the approval process where instead of allowing a confidential vetting they deliberately put out this letter afterwards I was furious\nSo I went home and enjoy my anniversary and didn't think about it at all [laughter]\nAnd if you are a smart man you're a good senator and a very smart man and it was probably a very mentally healthy thing to do good for your health and good for the marriage so now we're all a oh how many years may I ask\nTwenty nine\nWell congratulations to both of you happy wife happy life is good for user so now we're back at it and I've been listening to from Chuck Schumer to Mitch McConnell to John Cornyn whoever comes after him and it seems like we're all just sort of biding time waiting to see what the FBI finds what do you think they're going to find\nI think they're going to find exactly what has already been found that Dr Ford made obviously Dr Ford has some terrible experience and she has made allegations but all for people who she says should know about it do not know about it she has a backup statement well they weren't really involved so maybe they didn't know about it\nBut at some point in our system of life not just government not the law but life\nIs for people say something didn't happen in one person says did you go with the four\nParticularly want a man's whole reputation is on line or a woman's reputation or anybody's reputation it's not about male female it's about fairness and for people said it didn't happen when she said should know that it did ah you just got to go with the four and so I think they help\nYou out there and and I think there'll be a vote for Kavanaugh and I think you'll be approved\nCentered Bill Cassidy with us from the great state of Louisiana is there any inside buzz in the hallways about what the heck happened to him it tight space with though with Jeff Flake and Chris Coons as they walked out of the hearing room the other day\nNo I don't know that um I in fact I Know they're on sixty minutes last night but I just saw them and I didn't look at it um you know I saw on the screen it was muted neither none muted\nOr because the reality is is that for people said it didn't happen and there were there for people to be witnesses and by the way by the way it's like it's like having a live to live in such a sterling character\nUm that that doesn't fit a pattern either and and the Dems are trying to come up with things that would suggest there is a pattern wrongdoing but frankly none of when Michael ... is your is your spokesperson you know you got you you know you got and grew to go after somebody\nYou have the quote of the day it was muted and I didn't earn muted span sense once you get another lesson in life from Senator Bill Cassidy so you have a break my piece was pretty interesting in and it seems to be that if if we got FBI probes on our mind gym things we want the FBI to look at it everybody wants to investigate everything\nYou have an idea or two about something that might be investigated and that might be collusion that actually exists among Democrats to smear judge Kevin I'm\nTotally so Democrats are trying to make out like this is some sort of organic uprising of people coming out to say the judge Kavanaugh was not\nNot not credible even though the for people that they said were there set it didn't happen\nBut this clearly is a tactic a strategy with tactics or would you smear him you create doubt you create doubt and therefore you know way they want to take back the Senate they being Senate Democrats at which point they would block a future Trump appointee by the way there was already a website\nFor the woman Coney Barrett that was nominated it's stop\nI'm I'm\nA considered I'm Sorry I considered it stop Kony ... dot com and it says Web site coming\nSoon so if the Trump comes up with another appointee and Kavanaugh for that reason I got a point and they already are preparing\nNow this has collusion this is a strategy and its fooling them and if they're trying to fool the American people that just have the FBI going after people wait a second was this part of a strategy\nYou seek out someone to testify against\nHaving all that you deliberately not released a letter\nAfter you knew you sacrifice doctor for its confidentiality that you do it as part of a tactic is part of a strategy to smear judge Kavanaugh in public as opposed to having dealt with ... that is find out\nMark you know I mean here of American people or they're trying to see the American people that should be turned up that should be you know if you will like cast appointed\nIn ... by all means if if we got questions everybody wants to be asking all these questions we got a couple of questions we liked to have asked ourselves\nHey I've got a couple of remaining couple of minutes let me get greedy when he will cause some real Cassidy is also on the Finance Committee big day of the White House I don't know about you as a conservative DNA and me means that terrorists are not usually my favorite thing\nBut don't go there there's maybe on the list of stuff to Trump's made me a believer I'm years Canada here's Mexico saying okay we're ready to play nice now how did they strike you\nI think the president said he ran said he wanted to redo NAFTA me read it NAFTA it's one more promise that he made that he has subsequently kept I think now has worked well for American workers in my state we have a positive balance of trade with Mexico and with Canada um uh you told me or from Texas\nYou go on the border with Mexico there's so much prosperity where they want was not\nIt's created a lot of jobs for a lot of folks in my state and across the country but it didn't need to be done and the president has already done it and he's going to take care of the American worker\nAs well as have a trade with Mexico and Canada I think it's a good thing\nHow's your what your I'm crystal ball in the midterms\nYou know if the if the people are focusing upon the economy and upon the fact that President the president made promises kept promises that I think Republicans will do okay if we're focused on things that are peripheral or which\nDemocrats are trying to keep a focus on things that are not in a pocket book not in the kitchen table then then we're avatar time so I'm hoping the American people are focusing on my gosh my life a lot better now than it was three years ago when I go with the pain that brought me to the better life\nAnd finally back into the halls of the U.S and I don't know if you have a chance to run into a bit of Joe Manchin Joe Donnelly Heidi Heitkamp believe strike you as the kind of people they voted for Gorsuch all three of them who might ultimately they're looking for a reason to get some cover to vote for Kavanaugh so that they don't get killed in their own
