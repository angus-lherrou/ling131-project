talking a little bit about the new TV series God friended me are coming up with one of the producers we will also be speaking about I'm a potential presidential match up\nThat a lot of people are excited about would be a Nikki Haley on the Republican side\nVersus Beto O'Rourke on the Democratic side more that's how I mean the the media love affair with this guy is something to behold\nDoes he deserve all the hype and then we're going to be speaking to Stephen Moore the author ... new book called ...\nThe ... about some of the lives about the economy and what happens next\nAfter the November elections to help Trump fulfilled his America First vision of economic reform one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number but first up\nLast night the president gave a a a rally speech and he was an extraordinarily good spirits using extremely jolly\nThe one aspect of his speech that has gotten all the attention I don't need to play for you because it's in in a CNN and CBS and NBC or all over it and let me just acknowledge\nI think it was unfortunate I don't think it was a good thing that the president said that it was a praise worthy or a vet that\nBasically congressman Gianforte Greg Gianforte of Montana he was in ... in Missoula\nAnd congressman Gianforte and at the time I thought that John forte handle it very well he lost his temper he body slammed the reporter he knocked off his glasses\nThere were charges brought against him he pleaded guilty he apologized lavishly he made a legal settlement with the reporter read assaulted and I've spoken with Congressman John forte this was one of the most embarrassing moments with his wife\nAnd I don't think it's a a good idea for president from to make light of it I don't mean Congressman John forte would think that however what struck me about this is this is that that was a tiny segment of a very long and very substantive speech actually with Trump was doing and I think in a fairly effective way\nWas laying out\nThe way he's going to be campaigning and very close Senate races in very close governor's races as a Republican try to help other Republicans and Trump last night was in Montana where the Senate races become unexpectedly close\nBetween our candidate Rosendale and the incumbent Democrat Jon Tester who pretends because he wants to last a finger in a farming accident\nNo there's no solidarity there was to show the we're not talking about it because he was lost a finger in a farming accident he's really a moderate Democrat he's a a good old boy and said he's not he's a big liberal\nAnd a Trump was speaking on behalf of Matt Rosendale another Montana Republican and he had this to say and defining what this election should be about\n[noise] I Know a lot [noise] of Kavanaugh\nThe caravan law and order and common sense that's what it's gonna be\nIt's gotta be election of those\nOkay he's talking about the cabin on the caravan and common sense and I think he threw in awe of script the idea of law and order but that that do fine I'll look in terms of Kavanaugh\nObviously because of the treatment of a justice Kavanaugh\nThat has mobilized lots of Republicans and there are lots of congressional races they are now the official people who do the polling and the betting and things like that say there is a one out of three chance that Republicans hold the house\nIt used to be down to one out of six so right now Republican prospects there surging even in the house of representatives and that's a good thing and part of it is because yes\nWith their response to justice Kavanaugh the Democrats show that they're not the party of jobs\nThe party of well we'll let the president delivers on line\nBut the choice would not be more clear Democrats ...\nRepublicans reduced job [noise]\n\nMan see pullout [noise]\nBrian ... [noise] and the radical Democrats they want to raise your taxes they want to impose socialism on our incredible nation they did Venezuela because that's what's going to have [noise] they want to take away your health care because you won't be able to have in our country will be able to afford it\nDestroy your Second Amendment and throw open your book deadly drugs and vicious gangs because plenty of them are coming across a lot of drugs\nOkay and this is a problem for President Trump because guess what he's president United States Republicans ... in the house they fell apart of homeland security they control lights\nAnd he is right that there are a lot of people coming across the border I just looked at the numbers and their set\nOf the number of people entering the country illegally is not going down and went down the first year of Trump's presidency or the first part of the first year of Trump's presidency\nIt sound like tripled where it was when Trump became president of the rates in September ... the angry\nAnd that's why I think President Trump is absolutely right to make an issue of this caravan and by the way the evidence appears to be as of a half hour ago\nThat there was some progress getting Mexican authorities to move troops to try to block the advance of of what looks to be over four thousand people waving Honduran flags by the way\nWe're marching their way through one of my line then through Mexico and they say they're headed to the United states what do Democrats say we know where Trump's stance\nFrom stands on a common sense principle which I honestly who who could disagree you cannot let this caravan in you can feel sorry for these people\nBut if we go ahead and say oh well you march told his way will come and we'll process your your applications for asylum there will be no end to it\nIt will encourage more and more and more and more and look it's it's a question here not of whether we rearrange our immigration system to make it more sensible maybe even more compassionate\nBut right now the question with this caravan is what do we have an immigration system at all\nOr whether we simply raise the borders any kind of meaningful distinction\nAnd ah I think frankly President Trump is looking at this thing going on how is this going to work out either as he is going to win victory and turn the caravan back\nWhere there's going to be some kind of awful disaster and I think the incoming president of Mexico on race Lopez Manuel Obrador um has a ... actually shown some willingness to work with the Trump Administration on stopping\nThis caravan\nWhich is crucial\nI've been a Trump ... said this about the economy and related it of course of the fact that there are more and more people coming across the border\nBecause I have such an incredible autonomy I have some money\nEverybody wants their trying [noise]\nOkay probably the rhetoric I've created so much I have done this and you know and that's not ideal rhetoric but look the fact is the economy has done better that's what we're going to be talking about with Stephen Moore coming up and in just a moment\nThe point over here and I think it's very striking is everybody knows what Trump says everybody knows where Trump stands everybody knows what Trump has to say about this has anyone heard a any kind of meaningful democratic response on this issue of the caravan\nBecause I've heard nothing all they do is they attacked Trump and that's not a policy being anti Trump is not a policy and last night they don't work the new democratic superstar the great hope for Democrats not just for two thousand Eighteen but for two thousand twenty and beyond\n... who's a talented politician but he blew up his his own campaign and\nFrankly I think his own future with a one answer that was just appalling we'll get to that and that to your calls coming up we'll also be speaking with Stephen Moore\nThe author of a new book Trump ... of course one of the leading economic thinkers at the Heritage Foundation behind the America First economic reform we'll be right back [noise] one\nEight hundred nine five five seven genes Seventy six the Michael men vigil last one eight hundred nine four five Seventy Seventy six [noise]\n\nThey claim that the tax cuts that you helped to write and help to design that those tax cuts that have been passed have caused this exploding budget deficit because they've reduced revenues that's just a flat on line isn't\nYeah red revenues are actually out of this year so we passed the biggest tax cuts Thirty years and we actually have a slight increase rather is not what I Would like to see revenues higher and I think by the way as we get you know as we continue to see this economy uh continue to grow you you know the best way to get tax revenues headed\nFor people to work at ... businesses profitable and move businesses back to the United states which is happening uh but yeah like the problem is spending\nAnd you know people say oh you're just a Republican I'm not a rubber Republican the Republicans I Am a Democrat sort of a bipartisan spending spree that's going on my caller both parties deserve a lot of blame for this\nAnd you like a President Trump's a idea a vast amount every department to cut five percent yes\nI Love that you know that's where businesses do\nYou know that that's the thing if you're running a business and you don't have enough money coming in and your expenditures are too high you got to go to your agents and this is what businesses did during the recession they talked\nIn their stomach they tighten their belts they got rid of an efficient workers and an efficient services and things they didn't need and they save money and they became profitable again we never do that

and you mentioned this in your book Trump ... posted up at our website at Michael ...\nThe one aspect of Trump's America First program that he talked about in the campaign was infrastructure that he's really done pretty much nothing to implement a where's the money going to come from to do the big infrastructure improvements that we need\nWell let me go back to what I was just saying about this construction boom that's going on in this country factories and warehouses and and apartments and that that is a structure and what\nWe need pipelines we need ... terminals we need oil refineries we you know the point I'm making is a lot of that infrastructure and we need in this country you know rebuilding our ports a lot of that Michael I think can be could be done with private money it doesn't why what where does it say that the government has to pay for all this stuff\nI think that's a great ... points for President Trump to borrow from other book from ... from my friend and guess Stephen

playing again [noise]\nA a Greg if we can because Nikki Haley spoke with the Al Smith dinner and her humor has gotten a lot of attention but she also had a serious message\nAnd the message was that one of the things that has to happen\nIn American politics is stopping the idea that if you disagree with somebody over a political issue that person with whom you disagree is necessarily evil that is not true I Do not believe that the Democrats are in general evil\nAnd maybe some but I Can't even\nThink of any off hand who who's an evil Democrat don't call me on your nominations for an evil and we have a lot of undeserved to lose\nActually I Hope that all of them lose this time they want all lose because we have a two party system in this country that's a point about this is it there's a difference between evil and foolishness or even corruption\nAnd here's what a Nikki Haley had to say about that\nBut the Al Smith dinner and she said it so well that well let's just have her say it herself\nWe've had some laughed and I can find at ourselves and at our political rivals\nThat really they want to share some things I Believe is important\nThat they had a lot when I think the high school students and the college kids\nAnd our toxic political environment\nI've heard some people in both parties\nDescribed their opponents as enemies or evil\nIn America are political opponents\nIn South Sudan where rape is routinely used as a weapon of war\nIn Syria where the dictator uses chemical weapons to murder innocent children\nIn North Korea where American student Otto Warmbier was tortured to that\nWas evil in the last two years I've seen truly\nWe have some serious political differences here at home\nOpponents are not evil\nWe are blessed with a political system that allows us to resolve our differences peacefully\nWe must recognize\nThat we are all Americans and we are stronger and healthier when we are United\nOkay I think it's tough to disagree with that and particularly in the context of what I began by talking about which is the case of a Christian Woman whose name as a C a bb\nShe's illiterate but then a lot of people in Pakistan are particularly women\nAnd by the way that's not an anti woman comment that's a pro woman comment I mean one of the things that is deeply dysfunctional about a lot of the Islamic countries in the world is that that they don't provide any education for the women\nIn any event she's Christian and uh\nShe has been on death row in two thousand ten what is her crime well here is the other way it's described in the wall Street

on the right who\nWant to say that to show the at one time in his life had been sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood he clearly moved away from that if you read his last column that he wrote before he died that was just published earlier this week and the Washington Post\nHe was no Islamist he he was calling on Islamic countries to allow more press freedom ironically\nThe the idea that anyone would try to justify or minimize the hideous nature of what apparently was done to Mr show he is sad I actually think President Trump and secretary palm pay on particular have been getting it about right\nYou can't go off and say well are we support other reforms that Mohammed bin Salman is doing therefore this is okay we have to look past it\nBut you also can't say we're going to blow up our entire relationship with Saudi Arabia which is a regional power and as a very important ally the United states over this one episode\nAnd it's it's a remarkably important that we move forward we will form of some unity and not make this into a political issue one of the things that the Democrats do wrong as\nThey want to make every last thing about Trump and or do I think\nThat Trump made a mistake or comparing well saying that they he should be innocent until proven guilty it's like Brett Kavanaugh comparing\nThe potential murder to the uh legit and I believe imagined a song by a Seventeen year old high school guy who had an end to end it was all that the Coleman aided in groping\nUp to compare that to a brutal murder and dismembered men and torturing a guy in cutting off his

me most about the show the story\nIs that stupidity and sometimes more frightening than arrogance or pure evil and how stupid do you have to be if you're planning to murder some journalists\nTo try to do it in the consulate in a foreign power what do you think is going to happen how can you imagine you're not going to get caught maybe they wanted to get well if they wanted to send a message but that's evil\nTo send a message through murder and torture is hideous and it's evil and that's wrong these stories the one from Pakistan which is hideous the one from Saudi Arabia\nAnd or the murder if it occurred and I think it did is actually from turkey they're very alarming but they have\nOne lesson that's profoundly important the lesson is\nThat's exactly right so ah the school district was relying on a an old guidance issued under the Obama department of education that it's it's been rescinded and we brought this to the attention of the department of education and they have now launched an investigation that were encouraged by that we're glad to see the federal government taking this seriously\nLooking into whether the school district has violated federal law as a result of this dangerous transgender bathroom policy\nOkay and so a ... in the best case scenario or what happens next what happens to address the concerns of this brave mother in Decatur, Georgia\nI think first we're hoping the department finds that the school was violated federal law and hold them accountable for that and to the school has to revoke this policy is is not working it is causing harm like what happened to ... daughter there are better solutions\nBut the common sense solution should be never allow a boy into the girls restrooms or vice versa I those are supposed to be private intimate places

pulled out of the song one day when they were changing it's bathing suit\nAnd wage Asian she's twelve and I assume he's Nineteen\nYou know some of my daughters actually thinks he's at the age range is that the kids are about twelve to about Seventeen or Eighteen I think the boy is all I think the boys all says the team but the girls that phones before getting into the pool and shower after\nSo your your daughter was uncomfortable with is what happened next\nI when they finished diving and that got out of the water is our he was in their souring girls and so instead of Ben pulling debating sits

did not I think he ...\nThe okay and I just do the stupidity here it's just so unnecessary so she spoke to the uh people at the diving program and what they say back to her\nWell we did actually at

special place for them for people who have gender confusion or gender identity issues or our transgendered however you want to say it\nBut the idea that that small number of people should be made

and we're not going to go there right now I'm another bit of political correctness I Can't believe it I you know dear Abby has continued despite the fact that Abigail Van Buren\nA desire to the column anymore the original dear Abby now on the call has been taken over by genes Philips who was the daughter of the original dear Abby but she was asked a question about a very complicated elaborate foreign sounding name\nThat someone was considering giving a child and dear Abby said this\nNot only can foreign names be difficult to pronounce and spell but they can also call a trial cause a child to be teased on mercifully\nSometimes the name can be a problematic word in the English language and one that sounds beautiful in a foreign language can be grating English by the way when I read that I immediately thought of a a problem that some Israeli Americans have\nA very common popular a Hebrew name Israeli name is ... and a ... or more on I mean but seriously you don't want to name your daughter\nOr your son moron and not not in in this country and not in this culture they probably better named to choose now the point about fifty or everything is all\nHell has broken lose for dear Abby people who've claimed that she is affirming white\nPrivilege that there is a racial thing and there's no racial in what she said\nBut of course the New York times is ready to make that racial they have a column that says I'm the\nHeated reaction to the column which has been a staple in American households for decades and was started by missed Philips mother used the pen name Abigail Van Buren this she'd reaction has inspired a fresh debate about identity acceptance and racism\nAbby's column was deeply infuriating and also revel a Tory said a a a woman named uh Valerie cower\nHeavy as clean to an old America were white\nIs considered the norm and everything else deviant an inferior miscount were added that she and her partner believed it was more important to honor a child's heritage and to connect them to that heritage then for a name to be easy to pronounce\nOkay fine and he was not suggesting that anyone is just giving advice\nDo I think it's reasonable advice sure do we have very very dear friends who have given or their children very difficult names we do absolutely and you get used to it\nUh and now I'm not talking about you Greg a though Gregg is laughing here can I mention the names of your children okay they named their kids after inanimate objects penny\nA river and Jonas but none of those names or that hard to spell or they'll I don't know they would be probably people there are probably people's smell penny wrong but not many uh okay that's the point about the point about is it just seems to me\nIs why is everything about race well because people make it about race\nThey a quote someone named a non ... he's a writer who writes about socialism and about the evils of capitalism he says is the reality that a lot of this has to do with names\nBut more with white and is there a lot of complicated names from polish and Russian and Italian and German backgrounds that have become second nature to Americans\nThe unusual names referred to in the dear Abby column aren't unique in their complexity he said they're unique in their complex and they tend to come from places where people aren't white\nThat is nonsense I mean I I think it's very difficult if ah if somebody they're all kinds of names which could understand would be would be difficult and challenging and by the way my last name is difficult and challenging my father's older brother\nMy uncle ... uh uh his his name was Moshe method and he changed his name to\nMore stuff and that was the way he did business 'cause it was easier for business a dove Hebrew or the Hebrew word for beer is dog and the Russian word for bears ms it yet so okay\nThis seems to me inane but then we have we have this and this is a piece in the Washington Post\nAs sexual assault survivors continue

directly led to the shooting of that guy at the baseball field you don't make that evil and the person that said that is an evil\nOkay well you know as as Tim you're totally distorting things obviously the shooting at the at the baseball field was evil Maxine Waters made that comment about getting in people's faces months after that happened and after the shootout or they add\nThat philosophy all along anyway I don't I don't have a liberal for years okay if adding that made it through our great OK Germany cowardly to admit it\nYou know don't cut me off on this I have a lot to say that little girl in the bathroom you don't think about what happened that little girl that comes from politicians politicians are going we eat will do that now you don't have the gods now\nYou know guys now is evil the guns now is a killer and and he actually went to prison for being a killer look at him the the idea of equating one thing and another\nIs is simply wrong and I I Do believe that one of the terrible things have politicians do sometimes they don't take evil seriously enough and I think that's true with our whole criminal justice system we had here in the state of Washington\nA a terrible Supreme Court decision where the Washington state Supreme Court\nAh basically said that ah they couldn't give life imprisonment to people who had committed murder before the age of Eighteen no it's a life imprisonment that's the more reason they not only struck down the death penalty for people who are convicted of murders as adults\nBut for people convicted of murder as adults who are convicted for crimes committed before they're Eighteen\nYou can't give life imprisonment anymore\nNow that is a a manner of coddling evil and then you hear some of the stories of this that I think it's profoundly wrong but see we we lose the battle Tim if we lose the language and evil loses all of its meaning\nIf you're talking about silly stupid are irresponsible Maxine Waters\nAnd equating her with a these people in Pakistan who were literally committing murder and wanting to execute a woman because she said that uh Jesus died for the sins of humanity and the profit didn't\nI'm OK you can argue with her and that's fine but the idea of putting someone in jail and are threatening to execute her and then murdering politicians what a defender that it seems to me is a very different matter\nAnd this is also one of the problems that that people had an and there were\nPeople of this nature or Stalin was evil Hitler was evil so why is it that we sent millions of dollars billions of dollars worth of uh\nWhitman and support and supplies to stolen so that he could beat Hitler answer because it was necessary for saving the world and uh\nThere was one danger that

you don't know what's happened to a character and then\nYou see someone dropping a bunch of removed bloody teeth on the floor and you can hear them rattling on the floor\nIt's scary it's disturbing it's rated R A N Jamie Lee Curtis is outstanding she plays a grandmother ... oh yeah Kyle Smith over a National Review sees this as a right wing movie because it's about\nCertainly is about gun rights I mean that's part of what the film is about and it's about defending yourself and about how foolish it is to believe that the world is all full of sweetness and light and everyone is well intentioned there's also by the way of very surprising twist at the end involving one of the main characters\nAnd I won't even hint at it because the surprise when it comes to shocking to give away three stars

thousands of migrants marching towards the U.S Mexico border and the very image of that motivates millions of Americans the very thought this is what President Trump\nWas elected to do is deal with this kind of extra sensual threat segment last night on Fox News I couldn't get out of my head\nI watched a ... interview the aunt of a young man in San Antonio who was evidently\nBurned alive by any legal who he befriended or\nBecame acquainted with at his work and his workplace and\nYou could tell Laura was so rattled by it and she was getting emotional and the aunt was emotional this kid was

the body burned his apartment I don't even know I looked at some of the details last night on line and I got so upset because I could not imagine\nThe unspeakable anguish a family has to feel when their loved one has been taken from them by somebody who shouldn't have been in this country to begin with and this migrant trip right now in a a there's a Guatemalan Guatemalan border town\nI'm not going to pronounce your wife so my apologies my Spanish not so hot but it's checked coon boom on Guatemala members of the nearly four thousand strong migrate caravan\nHave gathered in this Guatemalan border town\nAcross the river from Mexico\nThe group began arriving early Thursday they're arriving on buses and trucks hundreds walking to the river's edge where they sang the traditional national anthems of Honduras in Guatemala\nNow the way the a P characterizes this migrant caravan V. exhausted travelers the majority from Honduras dispersed to the local migrant shelter and parks were volunteers offered them food\nAnd then they go through all the stories of a twenty two year old named Jonathan paralysis who ride with his wife Heidi and their daughters ages four and two they'd been travelling since four AM\nThey arrived at the border border after dark they paid for bus tickets they could you afford\nJonathan said it was a great sacrifice but it's all for a better life it's not all good were wet and we still don't have a place\nTo sleep now this isn't this is an argument at a debate\nThat we've been having since Donald Trump wrote down the escalator in Trump Tower and announced that he would be battling the problem of illegal immigration is president of the United states this is what he was elected to do is deal with a problem like this\nAnd frankly I look at the optics of it and I look at the politics of it and I I I Want to get pick your brain but from where I should the timing of this is perfect\nPeople have been saying well you know the timing is politically motivated this caravan it's all the Democrats are are are responsible for this and they're generally that that was all kinds of wild reports cash\nBeing handed out there is a video of cash being headed out to the migrants they don't know all the details between behind the money but it could be I don't know narco money whatever I don't know what's behind it I don't know if that's even accurate the video you got to be careful of stuff you see on the Internet but we do know\nThat thousands of migrants\nAre marching towards the U.S Mexico border with the intent of crushing the southern border into the United states\nAnd President Trump has made it very clear this will not stand we're all sorry for people who feel oppressed in other countries that does not mean we can afford to have thousands of people pour across our border and enter our country\nIllegally this is the ultimate blank due\nTo President Trump's desire to build a wall and secure our borders\nAnd frankly Democrats think this is great politically the optics of this are wonderful yeah I Do too I Do to\nAmericans elected Donald Trump largely because of the illegal immigration problem the last thing the Democrats need right now\nFor those who are undecided those in the middle of those who may not be motivated to go to the polls in November the ... the last thing Democrats meat is the image of thousands of illegals trying to march into our United States of America\nAt a time like this I guarantee you\nDonald Trump will respond accordingly I can promise you this country is not going to roll over for thousands of people who think they can be entitled\nTo march across our border against the law\nDemocrats don't get it because they don't want to border Hillary show place she played her hand she showed her hand when she was caught on tape saying she dreams of no borders they don't want borders they want people flooding into our country normal Americans\nDo not\nI Hope this story continues
