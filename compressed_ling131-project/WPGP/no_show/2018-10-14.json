my call longtime listener appreciate all find work are you a number in regard the new law a I consider myself a female so problem solved\nThere are a number of people who are just saying this is the end of the republic as we know it is the beginning of a new civil war\nThere have already been announced intentions by a whole host of organizations and some leaders in Congress on the Democratic side\nThat as soon as they take control of the house of representatives so says representative Jerrold Nadler who is a very very very liberal Democrat from Manhattan\nA representative ... says he's going to be the new chair of the Judiciary Committee if the Democrats take over and one of his first orders of business in fact his first order of business will be a full investigation and impeachment\nOf justice Brett Kavanaugh good idea you look forward to that\nCourse they also want to investigate President Trump or on the grounds impeachment this has been going on for a while look if you vote\nDemocratic and these upcoming elections you're voting\nFor this insanity to continue\nWhy is it good for the country what do you hope to accomplish when I'm Brett\nKavanaugh on Saturday was officially confirmed by a vote in the U.S Senate of fifty to forty eight\nIt actually would have been fifty one to forty nine except senator Steve Danes of a North Dakota\nWanted to participate in his daughter's wedding and look as somebody who last may participated in my own daughter's wedding and our own daughter's wedding I understand how the senator felt and Senator Murkowski who voted wrong on Kavanaugh in my opinion\nI was very gracious and saying look she will keep it so that it will be shown that I'm Brett Kavanaugh actually passed with a to vote margin the final vote would have been fifty one forty nine as it was it was fifty to forty eight because she just voted present alright\nFine I'm\nThis is what it sounded like when Mike Pence announced the final vote he of course as

what is it that the folks are screaming about and what are they aiming to achieve what's fascinating to me about this\nIs remembered that dramatic Thursday it seems like another era where you had testimony from a doctor Christine Blasey Ford\nAnd then you had testimony from Brett Kavanaugh very very high profile everyone was watching on TV a lot of interruptions from demonstrators\nNo I don't think there were any there weren't whether Germany nobody nobody\nKnow that now somehow they were able for that to control\nThese idiots and I'm Sorry I think people who are screaming about murder and things like that are are idiots indeed\nHonestly if they can control it in a high profile situation they shooting troll it every day\nThis is like a banana republic it is not appropriate for the world's greatest constitutional republic than people should be able to come on and into the galleries and screaming shout and by the way one of the things that has to happen is really prosecuting these people\nAnd I'm making them feel that disrupting congressman doing its job and by the way I Would include\nAll of the conservative demonstrators who do that kind of thing as well why do I say that because there are not I mean this is not some conservatives do what can you think of the last time\nThat some right winger interrupted or the proceedings of a Senate committee or the Senate and session making an important decision like confirming a Supreme Court justice of the Huffington Post\nPut together a collage of some of the truly eloquent and inspiring voices that had been raised

uh throw them out because\nAnd this is going to help why actually I Love it and I'm Glad to give it a tension\nBy the way let's a link to some of that that footage just wonderful to watch and I I Need to describe it to\nA group of demonstrators came up to the doors of the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court building in the United states in Washington DC\nIt's a wonderful building and that Greek temples style all based upon the parts on an Athens and classics because again the founders of our country\nIdentified with the creators of Greek and Roman law they did I Know ... more white males though again there are people and African studies departments who claim the ancient Greeks were really not white but leave that aside\nUm meanwhile\nThese folks came up to the doors of the Supreme Court building and the doors are those heavy metal doors that with carvings on them and big handles\nAnd so a group of demonstrators came up to the doors Supreme Court building banging on them literally budding their heads against them screaming shouting and sounding like this\n[noise]\nWhat\nWhat is the [noise]\nWhat is the the clear message here that we're supposed to be getting I Will tell you I think there's a clear message is overwhelmingly clear if you think this stuff is good for our country and then of course you want to vote democratic coming up\nAmong from now you you do because the Democrats will guarantee much much much much more of this with impeachment investigations and lots of investigations and lots of hysteria and the end of the republic as we know and\nUh and basically some of the Democrats on the Senate floor wait to hear Cory Booker Spartacus\nOr who really has jumped the shark I mean it's it's just if this is your hysteria\nAbout Brett Kavanaugh ... you think he's talking about ... you think he's talking about a a heaving analogize the or the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama\nWith people getting their heads bashed in we're has there been some cruelty where some salt on the individuals who are expressing their opposition to Brett Kavanaugh\nI I mean what are we talking about here why is this appropriate they they have\nCourse had a song or what would be a liberal occasion unless you actually go to the one of the protest from Saturday immediately after the vote it sounded like this [noise]\nBelieve me [noise]\nThat's right [noise] so do not take this today as the law [noise]\n\n\nAlready done so\nOutrage and I'm\nReal dismay I think it's a sad day for our country okay\nIt is a sad day for our country when you don't have both parties are\nCalling enough on that [noise] I mean honestly why would anyone vote democratic [noise] unless you want this stuff to continue and if you do tell me why one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nFor outrage it's outrageous what's going on out here the Michael ... is\nI'm like I I'm really disappointed I cannot believe you actually compared to get one one was actually accused of sexually sexual assault gotten it wasn't the use of anything\nSo I Know and that's exactly the point is wait wait that's exactly the point that there was he wasn't accused of anything\nHe wasn't called the radical he wasn't he wasn't cold heartless Merrick Garland a basically they postponed I'm considering his appointment because of when it was announced and but there was no attempt to smear him in any way and nor do I know of any basis to smear him but go ahead\n... nothing about the fact of the matter is actually a few sexual a folk\nNo no there were not it was only I'm Sorry and this is very important\nThat there was nothing injustice Kavanaugh's record nothing involving\nSexual harassment sexual assault sexual charges misbehavior there were no ex wives there wasn't enough thing a clean record until literally\nAfter his hearing had concluded and then they threw a Hail Mary pass and thought they'd make some hay with this one which is totally uncorroborated\nExcuse me you are not there so you can\nI say it is totally on robbery did you write I wasn't there but what what is it that you think should this be the new standard now I'll\nTell you exactly what we should've done we should have done it so investigation fairly is no reason for us run rushing a lifetime appointment with all due respect we should have just white ... and do an investigation investigation and then it actually done this or not\nOkay again again if there was any available evidence to\nConfirm any aspect of Christine Blasey Ford story even the existence of this party the witnesses that she named said they have no recollection of such a party they don't remember it she didn't tell anybody until Thirty years later\nThe the entire thing the whole idea that that well there were charges by within those charges clearly were manufactured in by the way\nThere was an important piece ends of peace not by someone who's on the rights of someone who's on the left or a writer for the wall Street Journal named Asher acute no money who identifies herself as somebody who was on the left who was unhappy with the Kavanaugh appointment\nWhich you know what the demonstrators the radicals have been have

literally into oblivion and it's come on to this is craziness right now\nAnd this is talk about a civil war there were issues and that's what is the issue here\nWhat is it that that Charles Blow things is the key issue in his column that he writes liberals this is war\nAnd by the way the next day or actually it was the prior day the liberals this war that this morning on Saturday the time that a big article ... courts legitimacy crisis is by Michael ...\nAnd he makes an interesting point which is that for justice Gorsuch injustice Kavanaugh they're the only two justices in the entire history of the Supreme Court\nWho have been nominated by a president who didn't win the popular vote and confirmed\nBy a majority of ... senators who when you take all the votes of the people who voted for Gore such an all the votes of the people who voted for\nJustice Kevin Hall and you put them against all of the votes gathered by the people who voted against them well there were more votes for the people who voted against\nOkay but this is craziness because that's not how the way we choose US Senators it's true\nThat a Wyoming gets two U.S senators there too fine conservative Republicans so to California\nAnd Wyoming as a population of about six hundred thousand and California has a population of thirty eight million they have the same representation in the U.S Senate that's how you find them more votes on the other side but does it this deliberately is the way they set up a constitution to protect smaller states\nSo that you don't have a situation where everything in the whole country is irrelevant except for California and Texas and Florida and New York\nEverything else doesn't count I I mean this is very obvious\nAnd yes people who vote in California you have to be counted in the popular vote and they certainly have a big say in the electoral votes\nBecause you've got fifty five electoral votes in but here's here's the basic point his complained is not against the legitimacy of the court\nHis complaint is against the constitutional system that has worked pretty well\nFor two hundred and forty years really what's wrong with these people you're going to challenge the legitimacy of the court not based upon the qualifications of justice Gorsuch or justice Kavanaugh but based on the fact\nThat the senators who voted for the most of whom are Republicans represented states with smaller population than the people who voted against them one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen\nSeventy six really it's foolishness a deep deep foolishness it seems to me and speaking of deep foolishness\nOne of the um most outspoken opponents of the confirmation of justice Kavanaugh was Spartacus\nOr the one and only Cory Booker and he was out campaigning
