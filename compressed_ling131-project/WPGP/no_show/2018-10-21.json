G. H. dot com you're having a more intelligent conversation Springer on AM to him for the answer\nTo [noise]\n\nWhen they Prager seven seven six oh let me pick a challenge here I Love that Bruce in ... Lodi, Ohio thank you for calling\nThere I I Know I don't have much time uh let me be clear um I Am really over every time I watched Trump on television I'm thrilled about the ... nomination also\nWhat I object to is I think that we're packing the weaker argument when we go after these crazy then the lab who are you know anybody can figure out why not anybody but everybody what\nWhat ah like minded miss can figure out that they're not playing fair they're not coming at it you know on on a on the right way where we show them on that how you feel a document I think is stronger than you know they are circling the whole uh\nGot all our justice system by by a heightened the person guilty without you know and kind of evidence or or\n... if I write for Bruce you may well be right I mean but you cold in about feminism and you didn't talk about it and you can't do that folks I feel I have here in his comments on feminism or wrong\nI thought he was going to differ with me and he didn't mention it folks please for the good of the show\nTalked to me about what you told the screener your calling in about I Know you don't mean wrong but it's it just takes time for the program I I Would like you to read these were going to put these columns up from the Washington Post I don't miss all three hours I have read to you from these columns\nIs the junior senator from Nebraska who I think has become by a large margin of advantage\nOr one of the most indispensable voices in the United States Senate his name is Ben Sasse a senator Sasse it's great to speak to\nMichael thank you for their ...\nAnd you're right about those words if I said anything like that hey might be asked me to what Bill off I wouldn't be able to protect you can save the world by politics but my wife would just whack upside the head\nOkay and this is not to say that politics is unimportant in your new book which is hosted up at our website the book is called them\nWhy we hate each other and how to heal and it's already a best seller and it should be because the very important book but one of the points that you make again and again and again is politics didn't get us into this mess and politics isn't going to get us out what do you mean by\nThat [noise] yeah so I'm sure\nTalk today about politics or why it does matter so I don't want to mislead and have your audience and thing but it doesn't it truly does\nBut what we're going through right now ... even in the chaos and our politics really didn't originate in our politics I think we need to know kind of where we are an economic and cultural history and we're going through a digital revolution which is awesome and lots of ways we're going to\nProduce more total goods and services than the world has ever known and all of human history a partly because of the digital revolution but one of the things that it does\nIs it enables humans to think that we can be ruthless and exactly the same time that we have lots of social science literature now confirming what people of\nKnown for millennia a through philosophy and be allergy which is being rooted makes you happy do you have a family or do you have a few deep friendships do you have meaningful work do you have shared vocation do you have some projects with co workers and your community the local worshipping community\nIf you have those things you tend to be happy that's about rooted nest and yet our technology of letting us be ruthless and we haven't figured out the habits for this digital age this this rootless age and so\nTraditional tribes good tribes family friends workplace et cetera there and collapse and so we're trying to find meaning brand good and evil meaning of politics and it's not going to work\nAnd and this is I think an important point that I can of emphatically agree with is that part of what has happened here with a Americans believing venture either on our side or you're on the other side and the other side is pure evil and our site is pure good\nThat kind of political talked flows from the fact that people don't have more what used to be called normal\nUh relationships and support systems and so they look to politics I was thinking\nI did you follow the story senator I'm sure you did a of New York in Portland, Oregon there were fights in the streets between Proud Boys\nAnd and the thought and and the two groups of of Todd's who seemed to get great pleasure about actually being violent with one another and you follow that story\nI heard little bits and pieces of it but it's just so weird [noise]\nWell it it seems weird because again the question is what are you going to accomplish how does it make life better if you beat up some uh if you're from antifa new beat up somebody from Proud Boys or if you're from ... and he beat up somebody from antifa\nHow does how does that help anybody it's kind of like the jets and the sharks except those gangs were kind of lovable\nRight exactly and they could sing uh it it turns out\nThat you know if you if you beat down people who disagree with you about politics you don't necessarily accomplish anything that's lasting by doing that but the great quick hit a takedown is good to just sort of\nA pontificate in front of an audience of people who already agree with you but you don't persuade anybody that way and so when people use all these war metaphor for politics I think it's sort of miss understands what we think of the American tradition politics are supposed to do\nPolitics may paint a framework for ordered liberty so that the really interesting communities can thrive and flourish the things that matter are the communities of love and your neighborhood where you persuade people to join with yet in a project and there's a lot broken in our politics politics isn't serving local community as well\nBut a lot of the political chaos and discord we face really is downstream I think from the collapse of these more natural or tribes of affection and community and you know your your point about\nUm about the loneliness align your used there are half as many friends in America are in the last twenty seven years what does that mean social science data showed that in Nineteen Ninety the average American had about three points\nTo friends the average American today has about one point eight friends half as many forty percent of Americans have either zero or only one confidant in ... there was a loneliness like out there and a whole bunch of people go to politics say at least I can figure out how to have a\nUm an enemy with somebody else and that will make me feel like I'm On a team but it doesn't really work\nWe're speaking with Senator Ben Sasse a senator a Republican conservative Republican from Nebraska his book a new book is called them why we hate each other and how to heal\nUm let me try to make a case and you can ... down if you choose a that that part of the healing process has to be making sure Republicans when the house of representatives this time I think we're going to hold the Senate\nOr where you work but we need to hold the house of representatives and the the reason that I Would put that in terms of healing\nIs the Democrats have already announced that if they take over the house they're going to be pushing the impeachment of justice Kavanaugh they're going to be pushing the impeachment of President Trump that we're going to have investigations and politics of destruction and this incredible hateful bitterness then we all saw during the Kavanaugh hearings\nThat's going to go on and on and on so the only way to prevent that is to make sure that you don't hand over the house of representatives to these ... mean spirited hostile and very destructive votes\n[noise] yeah so let me uh overwhelmingly agree and then also offer one tweak so the the overwhelming agreement is I'm I'm Out there raising money for Republican candidates I'm I'm writing checks I'm campaign and what people are so I absolutely want the Republican I Want us to not just\nAh expend extend our majority and the fact that I Want the Republicans stuck to win in the house um\nBut at the ... that I should also say I'm the second or third most conservative voter out of a hundred in the U.S so that so if you look at anybody score card on on who the most conservative senator I'm always on the top half dozen of everybody's scorecard so I'm not in different ah on political matters and\nThis is not an argument hey let's just all thing come by and how much the metal there's really nobody more conservative than I Am but\nI think we need to recognize that because the Democrats in the house might\nDo something incredibly stupid and tried to impeach everybody under the sun or if they take the house stopping that from happening is not actually the same thing as healing it's just stopping a further slide into this political tribalism I think that the healing that's going to satisfy people is\nIn a world where job duration is getting shorter and shorter and by the way economically that's pretty great we're producing more and more a smart humans with brains are figuring out ways to produce more goods and services are more cost effective way that anybody has in the past that's great but it means average duration that uh from I was born in Nineteen Seventy two\nAverage tuition at a farm in the seventies was about two and a half decades for a primary breadwinner today it's four point two years and getting shorter one of the things that means is you don't have relationships with your coworkers that last over the course of a lifetime\nAnd nails in particular aren't actually good at forming new relationships after about twenty five to Thirty years old and so we've got a lot more loneliness and their country\nPolitics can fix that problem rebuilding their neighborhood is what we have to do to fix that problem and this book is about fifty percent constructive about what do I do to rebuild in my neighborhood I Do I I Do I joined with\nA local civic organizations that me and I'm more likely to know the person who lives two doors away from me because that's actually highly correlated with being happy\nAnd uh that's one of the big focuses in them or the new book by Senator Ben Sasse it's post on our website at Michael midday dot com\nOr a senator you you're also a very outspoken very deeply committed Christian man of faith\nAnd you do talk about uh the the need really for people to go to the center of communal affiliation which traditionally has been congregations here in this country\nWhat's gone wrong with the church do you think and with with synagogues or have that that has caused this sort of this affiliation particularly among young people\nYeah ... well said so I think there are two or three different things happening at the same time I'm In in the same way that deep friendship and pick a nuclear families and shared work\nAre heavily connected to place worshipping communities are as well that we we know in the literature now what makes people happy do you have a family do you have a few friends do you think your work is meaningful and do you have a philosophical theological framework to make sense of death or suffering\nThat drives happiness but one of the other things that happens in your local worship and community is you're with people in an intergenerational contact over time\nAnd it turns out that I've got two teenage daughters and the younger side as well but teenagers live the most generationally segregated lives that anybody has ever lived in human history\nThey really think the accident of birth eater defines almost all the people they should associate\nWith okay so how do how do we fix it I Want to get to that with Senator Ben Sasse his new book is damn\nWhy we hate each other and how they feel there's so much in this book about where we can go not just in politics and force but in our personal and economic lives will be right back when Senator Ben Sasse white [noise]\n\nFor some of our political addicts and Washington to try to act like blood sport politics or forever more is what they want what they don't really love their neighbor they don't really care about your listeners kids and grandkids\nBecause they're not trying to solve long term problems there try to make politics the center of the gladiatorial fight and that's not going to work in a republic\nYeah I mean somehow World Wrestling entertainment is not what you want for uplift of of your kids or for the American future a speaking speaking of which is a one of the things that last night I I I gave a talk or to a neighborhood group bleeding had a couple of hundred people there was great\nBut there's this general sense that our politics is broken and I found myself ... when does it mean to you today I'm Talking a little bit of a would I be wrong to say that the Nebraska Legislature which is nonpartisan and unit camera on there's only one house to the legislature\nThat things work a little bit better in your state than they do and many others\nThey do a ... there's less sense of preening constantly for the camera and even though my state is you know one of the four or five most conservative states in the union and that's one of the reasons why I was one of the most conservative us rather than the United states elected from here\nEven though we're a very conservative place probably two to one Republican and the legislature people do not officially ... really parties and argue that camera all our one one house a state legislature and so\nWhat people are mostly doing is wrestling with ...\nGr term pragmatic question how do you get a good infrastructure and highway and bridges bill that's cost effective uh there's less certainty that you're going to find the line between good and evil or for people who might have different priorities which bridge in which highway to find it's a much healthier thing to do bridges and roads by politics\nInstead of trying to do a good and evil heaven and hell by politics if if federal politics do what they should in America unconstitutional system which you're maintain a framework for ordered liberty appropriate idea that people are created with dignity the image of God and they have rights by nature and government is our shared project to secure those rights\nGovernment is the author of sorts of right then government give you a small number of big things\nOr we need to build the fiber of strategy for the digital age et cetera but then most of what's meaningful can happen back in communities where people actually live next door to their neighbors\nWhat ... what a concept change from the bottom up not the top down that's part of the theme of them why we hate each other and how to heal it's the new bestseller by Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska\nAll I can say is keep it up senator we need you there in Washington and across the country of the

before by Lance moral\nLast morals says this and he's exactly right one obvious but neglected intangible as we come up to the midterm elections is worth noting\nThe country consciously or unconsciously has gotten used to Donald Trump\nTwenty one months into his administration Mr Trump has been processed or half process even subtly domesticated by the large complicated American mind\nWhich is improvisational on and on the whole incoherent accepted moments of national crisis even progressive to who Mr Trump fuzzy monster treat him now as it leads to familiar monster another many disruptive disruptive destructive realities the twenty first century\nLife as a matter of learning to live with monsters Mr Trump has been destroyed the world yet\nAs his enemies predicted he

fulfill her duties and she decided to step down without forbid something worse\nAnd ah now Donald Trump has another another nominee and so instead of uh going to somebody who is you know kind of strong uh from the conservative side if he if he nominated Bill Clinton\n[laughter]\nI I think that a Bill Bill Clinton having lost his law license um I think he's ... he's gotten his law license back um I think that would\nMake it ever actually ... away\nAnd we ate it he he lost his law license he was disbarred and after the after he left the presidency um of course Bill Clinton would love to be a a justice of the Supreme Court upped up I don't think that would be a a plausible new\nFor one thing a Bill Clinton is is also getting up there he's had some health issues\nOne of the things that I think that either a I'm a Democratic president if there is one ever again\nAnd or President Trump or any other Republican president any president is going to be cared caring about is appointing a justice\nWho was in very good health and is a young age\nAnd I think that alone aside from all of the scandals and controversies yeah I mean can you imagine there'll be other accusers who come out of the woodwork at Bill Clinton were nominated and I don't think Mr Trump wants to that um appreciate the call let's go quickly to Larry in Tacoma, Washington Larry you're on the Michael ...\nMichael you

Michael ... vigil are brought you weren't job creators network to actually go to work dot com [noise]\nAnd uh it's very important that people understand some of the truth about the tax cuts in their impact I win one things that you're hearing from the left right now is uh oh my goodness the tax cuts and created this soaring federal deficit we do have a deficit is going up at too much and going up dangerously\nAnd President Trump addressed at yesterday's asked every federal department to do a five percent cut would should go a long way to at least slowing the growth and the deficit\nBut one of the things you hear is a line which is that because the tax cuts the government is taking in less money than the tax cuts of a lead to less revenue actually revenue went up\nRevenue went up not much but it was already high but revenue went out of the most recent since the tax cuts of of come in by zero point four percent to name for it\nIt's not a reduction how do I notice it's in the New York times okay it's in the New York times in their official government numbers check it out tax cuts do work go to the tax cuts work dot com right now send a message to your members of Congress\nTo preserve and protect the tax cuts and or not to kill prosperity\nWith a heavy hand of government tax cuts work dot com\nIn the United states we are beyond forty percent\nAnd were perhaps approaching a day or\nThe statisticians say not so long from now where the majority of children will be born a into unwed families now there are a couple of reasons why this situation is dire\nAnd they're in a couple of other reasons why it may not be quite as dire as we would suppose\nBut let me at first I give you some of the background of it is put together through a new report from yup you've got to the United nations the United nothing and it also puts America's problems in the context of the rest of the world if you believe it's no problem at all\nThat we have almost half of the children born in the United states born into a non married couple or you can give us a call one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number\n... Bloomberg an increasing number of birds happen outside of marriage signaling cultural signaling cultural and economic shifts that are here to stay according to a major new report from the United nations\nForty percent of all births in the U.S\nNow with her outside of wedlock that is up from ten percent in Nineteen Seventy\nWas that means to put it in context is that in in less than fifty years the rate of out of wedlock birth has gone up for a hundred percent\nWhy would that be\nThis a report was issued by un FDA that as the United nations population fund it's the largest international provider\nOf sexual in reproductive health services says the number is even higher in the European Union and the European Union already sixty percent of birds occur outside of marriage\nThe eat eat you report says likely sees more births out of wedlock because many member countries have welfare systems that support gender balanced childcare so said these senior advisor in economics for the un FBI his name is Michael\nHeroin and in an interview he said a public health care systems paid paternal leave early education programs in tax incentives given where parents support beyond what a partner can provide\nAnd is he saying from the un this is a good thing in Europe that you have sixty percent of kids born out of wedlock that a good thing you think developmentally the government can do a better job than parents\nOr even the government can do a better job than some parents by providing these services one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six\nLook the problems with a single parent families are fairly obvious\nBut one of the things worth noting here with these numbers the reason that I'm indicating to you that that forty percent number born out of wedlock\nAnd maybe a bit overstated is least in terms of meaningful consequences is because that includes couples who are actually living together but decided for whatever reason not to get married\nAnd it is unclear what percentage of people who have a baby outside of marriage then follow that up by getting married\nIt's not a small numbers at least twenty five percent\nAt least one out of four people were a baby is born to a couple of outside of marriage ended up getting married and particularly if they do that while the child is very young and has no recollection of and it it can provide some of the same benefits of marriage by we what are the benefits of marriage\nWas one of those things if you've spent any time at all in your life around the baby you understand immediately\nAn extra pair of hands and extra pair of eyes it's a extra love that can be provided to the child and if you have one person who was also going to be responsible for trying to provide\nWell what happens to the child or two children\nAnd this is not to blame a single mothers it's not to say that single mothers are terrible people or that because obviously there are wonderful wonderful results that do occur sometimes with single mothers but it's very\nVery difficult and single fathers\nSame thing it can happen that that things will work out beautifully but the idea that there should be brought up as an ideal or isn't acceptable\nIdeal I think it's very destructive and if you take a look at the vastly greater likelihood\nOf being involved in poverty criminality\nSelf destructive activities like opioid abuse every risk for bad outcomes with the child is increased by a child who was raised in a single parent household\n\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six and somebody can say well what about gay marriage why uh what's what's been the impact there the fact is that gay marriage his remains so rare in the United states such a small percentage of the population one of the studying things and this from the Census Bureau\nOf the marriages that have taken place in this country since ... decision that basically authorize gay marriage for every state in the union less than one percent have been same sex couples yeah it's a shockingly low number\nAnd that's shockingly low because a lot of people it assumed though there will be pent up demand there will be all these couples that have been waiting to get married still less than one percent the the highest rate for gay marriage in the country was built a shot San Francisco Seattle a second\nBut even in San Francisco their dream about one point for nine percent\nOf all the marriages actually were marriages between a same sex couple\nThe data shows such births in the U.S and in the EU are predominantly to unmarried couples who are living together rather than to single mothers the report says the data suggests that societal and religious norms about marriage childbearing and women in the workforce has changed\nSaid Kelly Jones the director for the center on the economics of reproductive health at the Institute for women's policy research is it a good thing is they've changed\nI I I don't believe that it is in other words it was it fairly common in American Life to have what were called shots done weddings where a couple\nActually concedes the baby before they're married not recommended but they do but then there's social pressure for them to get married so the baby is welcomed into a married home\nOf course that's more desirable and and by getting married you are making a commitment to that child into each other just someone\nDown the idea that in most cases then of course I understand there are exceptions there are some times spouses who are abusive and self destructive and terrible and that can be a terrible situation for a child but in most cases\nIt's better for a child to deal with both a loving mother and a loving father\nLet's or go to your calls to Andrea in Columbus ohio and ray you're on the man that show\nThanks for taking my call you back um so um for me um I have a wonderful thing and um I I think that parents have to be mentally credits and they have to be physically present\nThey have to be mentally president and whether you're a single parent or whether you're fortunate enough to have as well\nUm you have to be there for them and and unfortunately when it's just one person that half he'll carry the burden of things they're physically and emotionally and spiritually um you can't do it all\nI guess especially if you're earning a living and deliberately and look at its it's very difficult and this is not to say the preschool is an important then doesn't represent an important alternative\nIt's just that you see if we have in this country such a a an inclination to not make value judgments is that leads us to be\nBlind to the fact that it is more desirable for each child to come into the world in a married household if we can establish that\nAnd agree on that\nThen we've lost the whole idea of constructive social norms one of the constructive social norms that is worth\nMaintaining it seems to me is not applauding open racism or open anti Semitism or open racial or religious hatred of any kind so why are Democrats still applauding an open hater we will get to that question to coming up on them and that you [noise]\n\nMaybe you have to live with her grandma parents or relatives or other relatives show I think this can be done successfully as long as we are open minded to tap to these tranche\nBut what does that mean I Know it sounds good and adapting to trends of it sounds very open minded and terrific but what does it mean\nI Would say that we need government programs horse that would help\nThat would specifically be there to kids living in a single parent situation\nOkay what kind of programs are you thinking of you want the government to send babysitters the ... government day care centers\nI think over ... ... would be one way I think manners where are you if you pay people who are professionals to go in and spend time with these ... these children and help them out\nOkay how do I let me just mentioned something to you Bob I I understand that sounds very generous and very nice\nBut you know what they're sometimes families who are married to each other who are raising children sometimes multiple children and their financially press is it fair that people like that who are having a tough time financially with their own kids at home should have a bigger chunk taken out of their income\nTo provide for other people who may be struggling with only one parent\nOr you know you're going to hate the fish but ah I I I'm going to say this we should cut defense spending because it's just\nIt's just not necessary and we should also raised taxes on the rich\nOK well of course when you say I'm going to hate this on their shelves you down but the idea that cutting defense spending is going to be an answer right now we are spending more on interest on the national debt\nThan we are on the fence and in my opinion I think the end opinion most Americans the defense spending that we spend is the best investment we could possibly make\nAnd some of the very ambitious social programs are the worst one of the things that has happened in this country has been shown by a wealth of books and information\nA there is uh Charles Murray wrote the first book that that blew the lid off the welfare system and the way the welfare system as it's been designed particularly by Lyndon Johnson the great society\nActually encouraged out of wedlock birth and there are Democrats who are written about that Daniel Patrick Moynihan who was a moderate Democrat rose about the problems\nWith family structure in the United states when he predicted exactly where we are the government will wars out of wedlock birth of course they're going to get more of it we'll be
