I just have to respectfully disagree I Believe those and the Democratic party are committed a late term abortions lied about traveling all try to destroy their lead committed to eagle acts and a regular basis I I don't know where you can draw the line but I\nAnd the message was that one of the things that has\nTo happen in American politics is stopping the idea that if you disagree with somebody over a political issue that person with whom you disagree is necessarily evil that is not true I Do not believe that the Democrats are in general evil\nOr maybe some but I Can't even think of any off hand who who's an evil Democrat don't call me on your nominations for evil and\nWe have a lot of undeserved eludes actually I Hope that all of them lose this time they want all the news because we have a two party system in this country but the point about this is it there's a difference\nBetween evil and foolishness or even corruption and here's what a Nikki Haley had to say about this at the Al Smith dinner and she said it so well that well let's just have her say it herself\nWe've had some last night poking fun at ourselves and at our political rivals\nThat really do want to share some things I Believe is important that they had a lot when I speak to high school students and the college students\nAnd our toxic political environment I've heard some people in both parties\nDescribed their opponents as enemies are evil\nAnd America our political opponents\nIn South Sudan where rape is routinely use as a weapon of war\nIn Syria where the dictator uses chemical weapons to murder innocent children\nIn North Korea where American student Otto Warmbier\nWas tortured to that\nWas evil\nIn the last two years I've seen through is\nWe have some serious political differences here at home\nOpponents are not evil\nWe are blessed with the political system that allows us to resolve our differences peacefully\nWe must recognize\nThat we are all Americans and we are stronger and healthier when we argue neither\nOkay I think it's tough to disagree with that and particularly in the context of what I began by talking about which is the case of a Christian Woman whose name as a C a bb\nShe's illiterate but then a lot of people in Pakistan are particularly women\nAnd by the way that's not an anti woman comment that's a pro woman comment I mean one of the things that is deeply dysfunctional about a lot of the Islamic countries in the world is that uh they don't provide any education for the women\nIn any event she's Christian and uh\nShe has been on death row in two thousand ten what is her crime well here is the other way it's described in the wall Street Journal\nUm it it it turns out that are troubles began and again this was eight years ago with a squabble over a couple of water on a sweltering summer day in Punjab\nTo Muslim women accused ms baby a farm worker and a a mother a mother of five and sang the accused her of polluting the top that they were all drinking from on this hot day because she drank from it and she's not a Muslim\nSo in the midst of this argument allegedly ms baby told them Jesus died on the cross for the sins of mankind what did your prophet Mohammed ever do to save mankind\nNow it's not even clear she actually said that because under Pakistani law\nTo talk about blasphemy is blasphemy\nSo all you're allowed to do is say she committed blasphemy you're not allowed to cross examining witnesses she's been condemned to death since two thousand ten she lives in a windowless cell there have been international efforts to free her\nAnd um [noise]\nIf it's just unbelievable they're already people who have died in her case a shortly after the spat villagers accused ms Bebe of blasphemy and they had her imprisoned the following year accord censored to death she lives in a windowless cells where she cooks for\nSelf for fear of poisoning by prison staff or a fellow inmates against this bankrupt a standing up for his baby requires courage in Pakistan and then two thousand eleven as a year after she was condemned\nThe governor of Punjab governor Solomon Taseer I've visited her in prison to try to show some sympathy for her\nAnd right after that visit and his expression of support for a sea of bb his bodyguard killed him\nTwo months later a gunman killed Shabaab bought see that's another a Christian politician\nWho also opposed Pakistan's blasphemy law it's an unbelievable thing this is a nuclear power now why am I talking about\nThis right now not only because there was attention to her case and there's a new president of Pakistan Imran Khan who says he's a reformer he's a former cricket star\nAnd maybe just maybe he will show some mercy on this poor woman the problem is that President con\nUh supports the blasphemy law the idea that someone should be executed for saying something that disagrees with the religious beliefs of Ninety seven percent of Pakistanis\nOr the entire thing is mad and it's difficult and it brings us to this um this amount to show the incident I uh I have been troubled by some voices on the right who want to say that to show the at one\nTime in his life had been sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood he clearly moved away from that if you read his last column that he wrote before he died that was just published earlier this week in the Washington Post\nHe was no Islam is he he was calling on Islamic countries to allow more press freedom ironically\nThe the idea that anyone would try to justify or minimize the hideous nature of what apparently was done to Mr show he is sad I actually think President Trump and secretary palm pay on particular have been getting it about right\nYou can't go off and say well uh we support other reforms that Mohammed bin Salman is doing therefore this is okay we have to look past it\nBut you also can say we're going to blow up our entire relationship with Saudi Arabia which is a regional power and as a very important ally the United states over this one episode\nAnd it's it's a remarkably important that we move forward we will form of some unity and not make this into a political issue one of the things that the Democrats do wrong as\nThey want to make every last thing about from and or do I think that Trump made a mistake or\nComparing well saying that they he should be\nInnocent until proven guilty it's like Brett Kavanaugh comparing the potential murder to the uh legit and I believe imagined a song by a Seventeen year old high school guy who had an end to end it was all that the whole ... roping\nAt to compare that to a brutal murder and December meant and torturing a guy in cutting off his fingers and and then slicing of his body to transport out of the country\nThis is not comparable and it's also not comparable\nBecause this was done in the name of government I'll tell you what scares me most about the show the story\nIs that\nStupidity if sometimes more frightening than arrogance or pure evil and how stupid do you have to be if you're planning to murder some journalists to try to do it in the consulate in a foreign power\nWhat do you think is going to happen how can you imagine you're not going to get caught maybe they wanted to get what they wanted to send a message but that's evil to send a message through murder and torture is hideous and it's evil and that's wrong\nThese stories the one from Pakistan which is hideous the one from Saudi Arabia and\nAh the murder if it occurred and I think it did is actually from turkey they're very alarming but they have\nWon lessons profoundly important the lesson is\nProtect religious liberty is absolutely crucial or we will get to that and some of the fight for religious liberty right here at home in which you can actually participate upcoming right up on them eventually\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six the Michael Smith VH\nOne eight hundred Ninety five five so [noise]\nOkay so are you in the best case scenario\nOr what happens next what happens to address the concerns of this brave mother indicator Georgia\nI think first we're hoping the department finds that the school was violated federal law and hold them accountable for that and to the school has to revoke this policy this is not working it is causing harm like what happened to ... daughter there are better solutions\nBut the uh common sense solution should be never allow a boy into the girls restrooms or vice versa and those are supposed to be private intimate places that are reserved for students that designated sex they're better solution than what the ... the cater school district it here\nOkay I'm speaking to match they matched sharp who is a senior counsel for the alliance defending freedom and he's one of those terrific attorneys that I've told you about who um I give heart and\nSoul to this cause now not everybody is in a position to give heart and soul and legal skill to this cause\nBut everybody's in a position to give a donation and it's really important because right now even with a much more sympathetic administration in Washington\nDC or religious liberty is still under assault and it's under assault or by bureaucrats by local officials by school boards\nIn many many different areas and right now you're on something of a winning streak over at ATF orange you\nWe have we've had some incredible wins from the Baker jak Philips to defending pregnancy care centers and most recently she Cochran also in Atlanta getting a one point two million

problematic word in the English language and one that sounds beautiful and a foreign language can be grating English by the way when I read that I immediately thought of a a problem that some Israeli Americans have\nA very common popular a Hebrew name Israeli name is ... and a ... or more on I mean but seriously you don't want to name your daughter\nOr your son moron and not not in in this country and not in this culture that probably better named to choose now the point about this dear Abby thing is\nAll hell has broken lose for dear Abby people have claimed that she is affirming white privilege that there is a racial thing and there's no racial in what she said but of course the New York times is ready to make it racial\nThey have a column that says I'm the heated reaction to the column which has been a staple in American household for decades\nAnd was started by miss Philips mother use the pen name Abigail Van Buren this she'd reaction has inspired a fresh debate about identity acceptance and racism\nAbby's column was deeply infuriating and also regulatory said a a a woman named uh Valerie cower\nAbby as clean to an old America were white is considered the norm and everything else deviant and inferior Musk our added that she and her partner believed it was more important to honor a child's heritage and to connect\nThem prevent heritage then for a name to be easy to pronounce\nOkay fine and he was not suggesting that anyone is she's giving advice do I think it's reasonable advice sure\nDo we have very very dear friends who have given or their children very difficult names we do absolutely and you get used to it\nUh and now I'm not talking about you Greg a though Gregg is laughing here can I mention the names of your children okay they named their kids after inanimate objects penny a river and Jonas\nBut none of those names or that hard to spell or they'll I don't know they would be probably people there are probably people spelled penny wrong\nBut not many uh okay that's the point about the point about this it just seems to me is why is everything about race well because people make it about race\nVote someone named a non\nZero right is he's a writer who writes about socialism and about the evils of capitalism he says is the reality that a lot of\nThis has to do with names but more with white and is\nA lot of complicated names from polish and Russian and Italian and German backgrounds that have become second nature to Americans the unusual names referred to in the dear Abby column\nAren't unique in their complexity he said they're unique in their complex and they tend to come from places where people aren't white\nThat is nonsense\nI I mean I I think it's very difficult if ah if somebody\nThey're all kinds of names which could understand it would be would be difficult and challenging and by the way my last name is difficult and challenging my father's older brother\nMy uncle mice or his his name was Moshe med vet and he changed his name to ... more stuff\nAnd that was the way he did business because it was easier for business a dove Hebrew or the Hebrew word for beer is does and the Russian word for bears method yes yet so okay\nThis seems to me inane but then we have we have this and this is a piece in the Washington Post\nAs sexual assault survivors continue to share their stories marking worldwide have to ask

gives up her voice for a man [noise]\nGod's Nell as evil but does now is a killer and and he actually went to prison for being a killer look or Tim the the idea of equating one thing in another\nIs is simply wrong and I I Do believe that one of the terrible things that politicians do sometimes they don't take evil seriously enough and I think that's true with our whole criminal justice system we had here in the state of Washington\nA a terrible Supreme Court decision\nWhere the Washington state Supreme Court ah basically said that uh they couldn't give life imprisonment to people who had committed murder before the age of Eighteen no it's a life in prison and that's the more reason they not only struck down the death penalty for people who are convicted of murders as adults\nBut for people to the victim of murder\nAs adults who are convicted for crimes committed before they're Eighteen\nYou can't have life imprisonment anymore now that is a manner of coddling evil and then you hear some of the stories of this that I think it's profoundly wrong but see we we lose the battle him if we lose the language\nAnd evil loses all of its meaning if you're talking about silly stupid are irresponsible Maxine Waters\nAnd equating her with a these people in Pakistan who were literally committing murder and wanting to execute a woman because she said that ah Jesus died for the sins of humanity and the profit didn't\nI'm OK you could argue with her and that's fine but the idea of putting someone in jail and are threatening to execute er and then murdering politicians what a defender that it seems to me is a very different manner\nAnd this is also one of the problems that the people hadn't and there were people of this nature a stolen was evil Hitler was evil\nSo why is it that we sent\nMillions of dollars billions of dollars worth of equipment and support and supplies to stall and so that he could beat Hitler answer\nBecause it was necessary for saving the
