that we have a desire to\nI could change if we have a desire to make good with people that we hurt I ... I don't think that that happens in all cases and I think that a lot of this issue it's just a broad general issue and\nIt specifically related to the topic that brought it up and it turned out that I'm Kevin I was guilty about something and then with not can try now he shouldn't be on the Supreme Court I personally believe that he's not guilty because they got to get them I didn't believe her story\nThe new attack which is really an old attack about\nPresident Trump dodging taxes and he isn't really a self made billionaire and there is it feels like about a two thousand page report seems to be very well research in the New York times so what is the relevance of this right now\nIt's obviously an attempt to shield the election in the direction of Democrats will be speaking with Stephen Moore a advisor to President Trump and the Trump campaign about that and about the progress on trade\nWhere there's been great progress in the markets loves it we've had this week uh the markets have just been on fire sky rocketing\nUm why is that happening we'll talk with us\nEven more about that will also be speaking with Juan Williams on Fox News he has a new book about President Trump and the black community it's not a positive book toward President Trump\nBut the question for Juan Williams will be what about the evidence and there is lots of it that there is at least in increasing open mindedness to the Republican message from\nAfrican Americans we will get to that as well on the ... show but first I just wanted to give you a little bit of perspective as as people probably recognize I was off for the first two days of this week because the conclusion of our Jewish holiday season\nAnd actually I Want to thank Mark Davis for again doing such an outstanding job and are\nHelping to carry the ball on this show while we were completing what is uh basically it's almost a month long um one holiday after another and they're all important holidays and they're all meaningful this one was particularly meaningful to me not just because our daughter was here from New York\nUm and and not just because there was a great time to get together with family and and big extended family began in ... but also because on this whole Kavanaugh matter\nI I was able to see a little bit of perspective and let me just tell you something that happened which I don't think I Will ever forget I mean normally I go to services I go to synagogue and a a an normally I talked to my friends\nI I was approached by a little kid and when I say a little\nKid and ten eleven years old\nAnd um\nIt ... ... he asked that I'm not even sure if we want it you know I was with the congregation a hundred people there and anyway so the kid comes up to me\nAnd he says I heard somebody say here that that Brett Kavanaugh through ice and somebody a Thirty Years' ago\nWhite lines at a big deal and I had not\nYet seen the story about the alleged a bar fight and one thirty in the morning when Brett Kavanaugh was a sophomore I Believe at Yale and then I later in the horrors of ice throwing\nAnd somehow it this is now reaching ... kids in America I mean under age kids this is where our politics is\nA is that just think about think about it think about it I mean not that it's okay to throw wise or not\nThat it's okay to be under age in a bar find that cetera et cetera and no one uh was damaged or charged or arrested in this a bar if they were arrested they weren't charge\n'em okay this whole idea where our politics is right now I really do believe those political consultants and girls in campaign people who are saying that right now the Kavanaugh thing is powerfully helping Republicans\nAnd I believe for one very simple reason if you like everything we've gone through with Kevin on four in the back in the forest and the punching and the pushing the nastiness\nAnd then you're going to vote for Democrats because I'm a Kavanaugh was not arrested okay let let me make that clear there was a police report about breaking up a bar fight and there was an allegation that he threw whites and a ...\nAgain I think it's more relevant to the Democrats want to throw ice out they want to throw out ice they want to get rid of the immigration and Customs Enforcement I mean it was anything is more relevant\nThan the idea that Brett Kavanaugh when he was at Yale I'm I\nWas a member of a hard drinking fraternity ... the whole idea that this is significant and that is worthy of our attentions is where our politics is right now if you want more of the politics of personal destruction if you want more\nOf let's go over every single detail of people's task to try to smear them and destroying them if you want more of this feeling of constant combat then sure you want the Democrats to take over the house because that's what you'll get you'll get impeachment you'll get in fact a Gerald nab blur\nThe radical from Manhattan and he is he's one of the most left wing members of Congress\nWould become the new chairman of the house Judiciary Committee and he's already talked about impeaching justice ... after he is confirmed\nIf you think that's where politics should go then first of all tell me why and secondly you are almost sure to vote Democrat anyway if you do want to change\nIf you are in politics that is a little bit more civil a little bit more respectful a little bit more about results rather than just destroying the enemy\nAnd results for the American people more days where the stock market is is up more days where people are working where people get raises\nI mean across the board it's happening now and ah and meanwhile\nWhat what's the focus the focus is on on\nPresident Trump not mocking but daring to question up Christine Blasey Ford and he did it at a\nRally last night and President Trump is a button and rallies and know this wasn't a speech but first of all people say well he ... he didn't imitate her he referred accurately to some of her testimony here was the\nPresident of the United states and what he had to say\nI have one right [noise]\nWell do you think it was always wonder\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many don't want I don't\nKnow [noise] what\nWas it and I don't know where [noise] where was I don't know what I Want [noise]\n\nAnd I'm at a map\nOkay um [noise] look I I did is it somehow out of bounds probably it would be better if the president do it didn't do it but isn't it appropriate to question her testimony or you can only question judge Kavanaugh\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six our phone number the I'm Sarah Sanders was asked about that today by John Roberts on Fox this is the White House press briefing about President Trump's comments about Christine Blasey Ford and here is the presidential press secretary Sarah Sanders\nWhy does the president said what he did last week the\nPresident was said in fact I frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was fading facts that were given during Dr forts testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified\nI hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been picked apart every single word second my second his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about the accusations\nThat have been thrown against them it's totally off limits an outrageous this entire process has been a disgrace and the only reason that it's been that way is because Senate Democrats didn't do this the way that it should have been done and they circumventing the entire system and frankly they undermine in our entire judicial branch by the way that they've acted\nIn inappropriate dishes which they've conducted themselves\nOkay I I Believe it is with that in mind that ah\nCertainly the Republican base people who voted for President Trump in the White House\nThat bases getting engaged and that's a good thing there's other reasons for having to do with the economy will speak with us Stephen Moore are coming out about the future of the economy and its political impact\nI don't know why they did it right now I was on CNN last night commenting on the show I I didn't I didn't make it through the ... march was thirty thousand a it was I've read a lot\nOf it I didn't make it through the whole thing I had a couple in Russia and I made this point on CNN last night and I'm ... and by the way they really beat me up on the first point I made was wait a minute this was like you know turning on the TV and saying you know it\nA hundred times you know friends episode re rod you know that you've already seen twenty times how many times with the New York times run the story I I really I worked on the campaign they must won three or four stories about Trump cheating on his taxes\nAnd you know then they ran one last year another running this one and there's not much different in this story than the one they've run multiple times so it's just like you know just by an old copy the newspaper because at the end of this movie before the second point I made us look there are alleging kept fraud tax there is a difference a\nMichael between tax avoidance which any good businessman them any good you know head of household will do you want to minimize the taxes you pay right I mean I don't know about you Michael I tried to pay the least amount of ... after you got the most I'm Out\nThere was a shock to me that's avoidance and tax evasion and they are they are accusing Trump of tax\nFraud went a lot of these like I'm not an expert on tax policy but it looks like a lot of these things were just legal ways of of minimizing your tax burden and is there any American in the last ... years has been it by the Iraq War than Donald Trump\nOkay but here's the question why won't he release his tax information he he's been very resistant to them I guess about this article is it's an attempt to try to force him\nTo make some disclosures about or his taxes and if if he doesn't that'll be a reason there are campaigning for Democrats the Democrats will force out the tax returns what do you think\nYeah once again you're all one hundred percent uh correct that's exactly what this is about and that's what you know the CNN a priest Cuomo asked me about last night as well why won't Trump a release of tax forms\nI advise Trump among many other people during the campaign do not do not really sure ... because if you think this report which were Thirteen or they they did Thirteen thousand words they don't even have\nYou know a lot of the tax documents that the man who has you know warehouses full of ...\nTax document through all the businesses he's running through the ...\nAnd all but I mean I I just think it would be up Pandora's

of the joint chiefs of staff I've seen the first black\nBillionaire you know people like Oprah Winfrey Bob Johnson or I can go on a record number of blacks in Congress black mayors\nThis we have black senators it's a you know I I joke in there that you know my dad if he was aware of my daughter and I felt that my daughter has a Georgetown Law degree\nHe played with Georgetown Law doesn't accept black people well that was true to the sixties but she does today and of course I could say hey bad you know look at me here I Am having lunch at the White House and you know who's the other black guy\nAnd I thought well that's the president Ronald bomb if you don't live in a different world you live in a different universe Advil there has been for has been this progress made in this country\nPresident Trump has invited to the White House no okay would you go if he did no\nSee I don't get that as just an end to the same thing with with some of the\nUm in other words it like you I Want President Trump I Want Republicans generally to\nUh be a more broad based party not just to be the party of older white guys a lot to be a party that reaches out to everybody because otherwise they have no future and uh so why why if the president invited you would you not go to the White House\nWhere I think he's insulting condescending and and so lacking in any sensitivity or knowledge of how American history you know central to American history has the story of black history\nSo when he says things like calling a black woman Omarosa a dog or calling another black woman a congresswoman Maxine Waters who is a tremendous Trump critic but he says extraordinarily low IQ when he engages in politically\nOr you know advantageous tactics I guess with his base like saying the first black president\nWasn't born in this country and then he uses that to elevate his profile I think this man is just about the fighting the country about beating people racial hate and I'm not going to be in his company\n[noise] okay [noise] ... when you say that your your nose and he's going to be you don't expect that he is going to be removed from office do you\nI don't know I mean I don't know what Mueller has in terms of the smaller pro if that's what you're talking to\nYou know I'm I'm just talking generally he's going to be president for another two plus years two years three months\nAnd I'm OK during that time period\nAnd and this is a part of the the challenge and for your book and let me back up for a moment because a lot of people may not know but one you wrote a courageous book they got you lots and lots of attacks on the left it was a book called enough subtitle is the only leaders\nDead end movements and cultural failure that are undermining black America\nAnd what we can do about correct and\nOne of the things you talked about was having um black leadership to talk more about achievement and a lot less of a constant sense of grievance aren't aren't aren't you coming into that trap that that you yourself described in your book enough\nNo in fact I Wish that the president President Trump would celebrate the idea of black achievement in this society\nInstead of you know always talking about black people in the way he says oh you know they live in circumstances worse than Afghanistan their neighborhoods filled with violence and poverty and joblessness and bad schools I'm thinking wait a second that your description of black American twenty Eighteen\nI mean right now Michael forty percent of black Americans on between thirty five and a hundred thousand dollars an additional twelve percent between a hundred and two hundred thousand dollars\nSo you can see a majority of black America is either in the middle class or beyond\nThis is one of the prime achievements of the civil rights era in addition nights they obviously the growth of black political voice in power as part of American society so these are tremendous achievement\nSo I'm all about looking at how people who were faced with such disadvantage in this society slavery legal segregation ongoing racial bias and all the rest nonetheless\nHave sought out the American dream and have kept it alive and and want to succeed ... you know like the Jefferson slogan they want to move on up\nRight absolutely good stuff but this president instead he focuses on a twenty percent who who are in\nPoverty disproportionately young people and kids often times because of broken families on the like and he makes that out to be the entirety of the black part like they're all gonna mug you are going to take your job or they're going to ruin your schools I think it is just so deceitful and dangerous because again it is racially divisive\nOkay I again I I ... some of the same uh comments by President Trump and gestures by President Trump I've been highly critical of on this radio show or because I'm not one of those people who believe that President Trump can do nothing right or nothing I'm ... and but I\nAlso I'm a believer not one of those people things President Trump can do nothing wrong and I'm not one of those people things you can do nothing right and he must be doing something right because we've covered on the air before\nThey're a bunch of polls and it's not just Rasmussen there six major polls that show that his approval rating in the black community has been going up\nAnd largely that's because we do have a black unemployment rate that is the lowest ever measured that people have been making the kind continuing the kind of economic progress that you're talking about right\nFirst of all the polls that you're talking about is a poll backed by its own admission has too few black people polled so once you get is a a distortion the reality is this and I find that this is so troubling about\nTwo thirds of Americans think race relations or worst today\nUnder President Trump than they've been in the past\nYou also get higher levels again more than fifty percent disapproving of how Trump handles race relations\nAnd the most difficult one for me to accept and I think this may surprise you Michael is it forty nine percent of Americans say Trump is a racist and the reason that bothers me is I think it just shuts down a power station if you say something so flat leaving people think oh I'm a Trump supporter or I'm not but\nI don't want that I really want people to think about how\nThis country is becoming more diverse\nYou're getting greater sense of global economic and cultural mixing and how do we deal with that when you have a president who's so I think the vice if\nOn racial issues immigration okay so let's let's approach that approach how other leaders can change and how the president can change to deal with this more effectively I Know what the hell do you have to lose that's the title of the new book by Juan Williams' movie right that [noise]\nWhere I think it's quite similar in terms of you know somebody leveling a charge against the nominee and the comic case it was a ... hill and you know it was very slow to come out but then the committee\nThe Senate Judiciary committee looked at it privately they myth that she wasn't put her name to it and then it got leaked and then he came out so it's very similar because look at for after four she sent a letter to a congressman ... many makes its way to guy and Feinstein\nAh and then her name is Lee or she does the interview with the Washington Post ... ... what ... think similar to me is the level the chart I don't think that anybody that\nUh you're Clarence Thomas throw on a better\nYeah but as a one there's a difference of touching the other direction the charges against Clarence Thomas had to do when he was head of the equal Employment Opportunity commission he was a government official and he was already yellow graduate the charges the core charges against Brett Kavanaugh\nHas to do with when he was Seventeen years old\nYeah but I think that the larger issue here is ... or a character for someone who is going to be on the highest court in the land\nAnd that's where I think he's open themselves to his critics and I wish you hadn't done it because you know the whole presentation of himself as a urging a choir boy needs to go to a book is the was and then all of the sprints like this guy was a big grin and he loved the parties don't count\nOkay wait a minute if you were a U.S senator and who knows you maybe someday I'm not really\nMy editor for folks are typically if Washington DC becomes a fifty first date which probably won't happen but not even\nA one um would you vote for ... confirmation no not at this point\nAnd the main reason would be because of the way he presented himself as a hearing\nYeah I think especially last week when he went off even making all sorts of projections regret Clinton conspiracy theory again and the Democrats are I'm thinking wait\nA minute you're ... you're trying to be a judge on the Supreme Court you're displaying a tremendous lack with an permanent or\nDon't you think given given the amount of money that was spent by George Soros and other than it's well known as it's now come out to the\nThose two women who corner Jeff Flake in the elevator were actually operatives of this open society project which is a Soros project or sometimes they can can you well I unfortunately I think we are\nOut of time of the book doesn't have anything to do with Brett Kavanaugh but of course\nAt the moment that is it an issue that seems to touch almost everything the book is called what the hell do you have to lose its

Nineteen Seventy so I've always known the civil rights struggle I'm I'm white and but just last week I saw a sitting US Senator say the white male to learn to sit down and shut up\nHas four or five friends around the table and they're reading the book of John or something from the Old Testament it's completely right I mean you think of Michael what's so frustrating to think of the impact of the Bible on western civilization\nIn here in this country people are wrongly saying teachers school administrators wrongly saying hey what are you doing with that that's illegal here that sounds like something from the old Soviet Union\nNot know it does entirely and see what what I ah I see from the materials that you prepared for this you\nAre emphasizing for kids they shouldn't be brandishing the bibles in front of people and saying unless you read this book with me you're going to go to hell\nOr or I I hate you unless you come in and join me in my face I you you're also emphasizing the kids who bring their bibles to school to try to bear witness winning and kind and a friendly way\nAbsolutely I mean one of the things I often ask friends who you know have difficulty believing in who Jesus was I say you know what what's the missing in his resume he was a person who exposed\nReally espouse loved joy piece goodness kindness mercy and those are the value traits that we like to teach the kids to express to their friends and to the people at the school that they bring their Bible\nTo one of the great stories last year we had a girl who was ... you know a little shy little embarrassed to do this but she did it\nAnd to her surprise all twenty eight kids in her classroom at a public school all brought bibles but they didn't even know each other we're Christians but the whole class was\nAnd she was astounded and that's the kind of thing we're hearing across the country that you know three or four or five or even the whole class will end up bringing their Bible to school and they go wow we never knew\nAnd I think Michael part of the problem here in our culture today for the left in the progressive to talk about the um you know the harm of shaming which is good that's a good message they sure do a lot of shaming for people of faith\nTo the point where these kids are embarrassed or feel they can't bring their bibles the school will talk about God and that's not a good in that environment for us to be in today everybody should bring their ideas their thoughts their opinions and their faith into the public square\nAnd again it can only enrich a at the exchange of ideas which is supposed to be part of education I take a gym daily a focus of the family you would have no objection if some other kids\nOn bringing the Bible to school day which is tomorrow or if some kids wanted to bring in all up ... Christopher Hitchens' book God is not great or some other atheist quote classic effect and child one is a counter bring the Bible to school day\nWas that kind of book you'd have no objection to that would you\nOf course not that people should you know go and work on their own thing but for us we appreciate the fact that over five hundred thousand kids last year\nDid bring their Bible to school on that first day of that first Thursday of of October and it's great you know you run a manual for example have made that comment a few weeks ago saying I Know it's politically incorrect but what we need and in our public square is more faith and family\nWe could ... around the manual send him one way to do and you know what I'm saying and marriage you know how America Argo\nI'm saying okay here's one way to do it let's let kids and encourage kids to participate and bring your Bible to school and that's that's one way kids can be proud of those\nAttributes those moral convictions that are good for our nation there's nothing to be fearful about people who want to love their neighbor\nAnd one would hope not um how did you pick October is the time to do this\nYou know it was just a day there's so many special days going on now that was the day it was available it's easy to remember the first Thursday of October every year and again this is our fifth year of doing it started with a thousand kids or the next year it was a hundred and two fifty two hundred fifty thousand it last year five hundred and fifty two thousand so\nAre we are grateful for the participation and people can go to the bring your Bible dot org website we have lots of assist\nA sheets there that even the legal assistant sheet that they could print off so they can take to school that day and there's information for teachers for parents for everybody to better understand what bring your Bible\nIs all about well I I think it's terrific and congratulations on it and I hope people find out more about it I like the fact that it's in October coming this year right after the Jewish high holy days and the whole holiday season\nUh we're supposed to be gaining perspective and that's the idea though to bring a your Bible website\nAnd you can find out much more about it we will be right back on my home eventually [noise]\n\nHi I'm Shaun mocking here if you follow my work you know the one of the

Christian charity that is trying to encourage people kids to avoid the dangers of drinking as teenagers\nKind of you think teenage drinking has been in and do a little bit recently yes it has\nAnd is it a good idea to try to discourage teenage drinking of course it is why is the ACLU against it\nBecause it's actually a Christian ministry and and the idea that somehow everything has to be opposed and they're going to go to court to try to block the message getting to teenagers about giving up drinking the rather have people\nDrinking then have anything having to do with faith standing up for

when\nYou're ready for another day of the battle you strap then buckle up and hanging on\nFor dear life what a week this has been what a week there shall be the media in complete meltdown boat over the president's comments about Dr Christine Blasey Ford last night at his rally\nThe media in complete meltdown over the New York times latest bombshell decades ago\nPresident Trump's late father\nAnd mother had some tax scheme he's not as rich as he says he is a ha we got him again\nMeanwhile the FBI Kavanaugh investigation might wrap up today which will of course be another reason for the Democrats who oppose Brett Kavanaugh just say\nWell this wasn't sufficient ladies even take a week they\nDidn't even interview Christine Blasey Ford we're already hearing that we know what they're going to do because they are predictable if nothing else [laughter] they're\nVery very predictable there's a headline above the fold in today's USA Today that tells you everything you need to know about what's going on with Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd the way the direction we're in in the country and I loved it I Love how useful to ships here's the headline and USA Today confirmation long and the cabin off fight\nThe article says the battle over Kavanaugh's nomination to the court is unlikely to end with his confirmation vote Democrat said they won't let go of the sexual assault allegations\nEven if he's elevated to the high court if they win control of one or both houses of Congress in November they'll be in a position to continue the fight it's almost like USA Today is unintentionally confirming\nYou better get out and vote [laughter] almost it's almost like they're saying do you see Republicans will happen if you stay home on November the ...\nThey're gonna they're not old and they're also going to do everything they can to roll back every single Trump policy achievement of the last nearly two years we know that it is up to\nUs all of this is up to us November ... put it on your calendar\nI don't care if you're if you're in the hospital have um wheel of a hospital bed into the ... the polling place drag your bought into the polls\nAnd vote on November ... for Republicans because the USA Today article is a is a very very\nPowerful reminder of what is at stake and what is at stake is to let the Democrats control the candy store we've got to keep the house we got to keep the Senate\nAnd this nation will breeze a huge sigh of relief it's up to you now let's let's take care of this\nBecause this was going to be tough because you're probably not going to like entirely what I have to say and that's all right hey you know I'm a big guy I can get somewhat thick skin [laughter] the president as you've heard by now\nHad a rally last night when he was all where he was again on fire\nHaving a great time or\nA pact tall and Mississippi after about a week and a half of being tremendously subdued about Christine blog before\nBeing very careful about Dr Ford and not\nCriticizing her are attacking her mocking her I was there was one tweet and that kind of blew over pretty quickly\nAnd other than that it's been pretty quiet about he was just kinda let this process play out he said the other day in the oval office to sound and credible\nAnd she seems like a fine woman that's what he said a few days ago well here it is cut ... this is what he said last night in Mississippi which has the media\nUm you know\nWatching their heads explode once more as it often happens when the president says something very\nProvocative\nI had one clear [noise] right I Want to be [noise]\nWell do you think it was it was one of them are good [noise] how did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago when I don't\nKnow [noise] [noise] [noise] what\nWas it and I don't know where's the house [noise] well I don't know but I Wonder if that's the only thing I remember [noise]\n\nAnd the man's life is in tatters a man's slices shattered\nNow are the first ... media take away is\nThat's Donald Trump being Donald Trump or he he goes to the drug dealer he responds viscerally he is he fights he battles\nAnd that's just him and and he that's what got him to the White House and he's going to keep doing it um until he leaves the White House hopefully in six years\nMy problem is that the base really doesn't have anything to do with this week my my concern is his ... his his supporters in a rally\nAt a rally in Mississippi really have nothing to do with played out how this goes it is down to the to to a handful of senators your your your plane to a handful of people maybe senators you can count on one hand\nAnd my fear is that if one vote is loss because a senator believes that the accuser has been unfairly mocked or taunted or attacked\nThen it wasn't worth I don't know what I don't know what the upside is so I'm not going to come to work and why do you and pretend\nThat I'm Glad\n\nThat he said something that I Wish you hadn't said I'm not I wish you hadn't\nSaid I've also always always worried about an uncorroborated accusation um not necessarily be untrue\nI don't know what happened thirty six years ago we never will we don't know if Brett Kavanaugh did it or not I happen to believe based on his life and his career and his record\nAnd his incredibly qualified resume he should be the next Supreme Court justice\nI don't believe that she has enough corroborate shouldn't just seal the deal in making the case that he's unfit I Know what the the the the filthy gave the Democrats are playing in moving the goalpost goalpost\nI understand completely\nHow vicious they've been and I do share\nHis concerns all along with the current concerns of millions and millions of people about their smear campaign and how it can ruin somebody without any any substantiate substantiate ... is a problem\nIt's a big problem and finally after a year of the the me too era\n... we're having a national conversation about what happens when somebody has falsely accused I have a story in front of me there were some dentists accused of rape and sexual assault in Las Vegas and it turns out of your user\nMade it up\nNow is your story is you don't hear often but they happen\nFor Dennis from California including three brothers who faced rape charges for the alleged assault of a woman to win Las Vegas had all the charges dismissed in court this week\nProsecutors dropped all the chargers or one of the lawyers said after river review the facts it was clear that the allegations were completely fabricated there for ... for professionals from California three of the brothers that faced\nRuined ... for what apparently was a completely fabricated claim misshapen\nAnd when President Trump said this week I worry about today's boys I worry about paying people being falsely accused I worry about like you said I've been falsely accused\nIt can happen and I\nGet it and I share those concerns in this case the case in this week and in this time we got to focus on the senators and get judge Kavanaugh cross the finish line and again for for for where I sat\nYeah it's imperative that the that the all the Republican or jump on him and then when we need a mansion and the other ones have got to even though senator man said they would never lose it real quick question point I saw Senator Graham and the airport yesterday and she has to be I I should have asked them I just won ... thumbs up but\nThere are real quick so it it's
