we're coming up to an election it's going to decide the direction we want to go and honestly I think that when you take a look at situations like this hurricane a lot of Republicans\nUp there on the Florida Panhandle but there are a lot of Democrats too when there are a lot of people don't really care that much about politics they all need help and support\nAnd I think they're getting that both

never paid in to Medicare\nWell plenty of places number one it's a much more efficient system so you're cutting your administrative expenses for over twenty two percent to about four percent that's experience in Canada\nWhere everybody waves but wait on health you're talking about right now there are literally tens of millions of people I think the number is well over a hundred million I think it might be close to two hundred million who are covered by workplace insurance at least in part yeah so uh where where do you get this money to put them on Medicare\nWell they wouldn't have to pay their insurance the employers wouldn't have to pay they'd be more competitive with foreign company companies have their insurance paid by a public sources\nSo is it isn't that a big give away during the ...\nThe tax system is crazy I mean you know and got corporations today paying ... percent ... percent tax look at the banks because apple and they're they're they're paying for nothing or some workers paying twenty three twenty five percent tax going to work every day\nBut the other thing is I get rid of corporate welfare I Know you agree with the U.S hundreds of billions of dollars a year\nAnd the other thing is to crack down on criminal fraud fraud on Medicare from these Ventura sixty million just on Medicare so we have to respect the corrupt inefficient discriminatory system and it's increasingly saying to the American people die\nOkay politically do you think any of these things can possibly happen say if the Democrats take over the house and the Republicans maintain control of the Senate and President Trump continues as well as our commander in chief\nYeah I think the the wage increase supported by Seventy five percent of the people without even a campaign because all these people\nYou're talking about increasing the minimum wage\nAnd you see Amazon is going up to a couple of loopholes saw a lot of these companies you know Wal Mart is growing toward twelve dollars of federal seven dollars and twenty five cents I think the Republicans against the message on that politically for twenty twenty\nOkay so you raise the minimum wage let's say the race for stage even all the way to twelve dollars I'm given the fact that in in most big cities in many jurisdictions have already raised the minimum wage or does that have a profound effect on the American economy\nYou're increasing consumer man people can buy more than ... necessities on the table you don't get many savings from increase minimum wage because they can't afford that got up and so I got to buy goods and services for the economy I mean the consumer demand is to find her kind of me\nUm what about economic growth or what happens economic growth they have all of a sudden uh you are in increasing or the amount of pay you're offering at a time when even right now there's a labor shortage\nWelcome to learn because millions of people have not come into the marketplace wherever smaller number of people have been paying jobs now than many years because of all the dropouts people just couldn't get jobs in prior years\nYou know the thing is you know I remember Trump criticized the unemployment rate when he's running for president called the fake now he loves\nYour point Twenty one hours a year or a wink\nMichael you're consuming employed can live on that song former just tyrants who for Twenty one twenty three charger consider employed so there's a lot of a lot of reserves wherever they are they going to market\nOkay um we're speaking with Ralph Nader his new book is called to the rampart she also calls for\nVery major changes and reforms in our political system including jumping the electoral college they're actually a lot of Americans according appalling who agree with that but I actually it is a complete fantasy because it never ever can happen\nOr I Want to get back to Ralph Nader and we'll talk with your calls one eight hundred and Ninety five five Seventy Seventy think about how exactly you get rid of the electoral college now basically ... the whole amendment process and the constitution movie rights and\nMichael Mitchell wants to marry this is\n\nBut part of what that means is that the ah the states the various states to sign onto it or would be pledged\nTo actually give all the electoral votes in their states to not to the person who wins the popular vote in the state but the person who wins the national popular vote so suddenly make the electoral college would still exist I guess but it will become irrelevant which\nDon't exist in North Carolina\nOkay I Do you know I I Do think there are people who are already preparing legal challenges to that compact idea plus right now all the states you mentioned are very very blue states very liberal state do you see any support for this compact idea from some of the more conservative states\nNext time Republicans won the popular vote for ... got the states and fly\nBy the way you know that's never happened the only popular vote losers who have ever been elected I'm actually are a Republican or and John ...\nFrom her because she's carrying guns fixing the boat and want to carry Ohio on the electoral college bottle or even on board got more votes popularly\nThat's true that's a danger I I like the idea Ralph and I've talked about on the air before of everybody going to the Nebraska and Maine system that you break it down by congressional district but in order to do that you would have to really make it a nonpartisan not gerrymandered\nApportion men of congressional districts what do you think about that do you ensure\nStep forward it doesn't go on for hours and her partner dot com yeah step forward I mean it's not going when you're coming from a popular vote in America and you're and you're winning the presidency what what country does\nOkay well our our country does and it's actually historically it's worked out a okay I mean and president Hayes was into disaster some of us think President Bush wasn't a disaster\nAnd are certainly hope that President Trump will continue to enjoy some of the success he's enjoyed so far Ralph Nader's enjoyed great success with his literary legal and even some political endeavors\nHis new book is called to the ram parts how Bush and Obama paved the way for the Trump presidency and why it's too late to reverse

going to a at ... show on Twitter that's at mad vigil one word on Twitter\nOkay this came in from John in\nAwful Washington he says yesterday a caller proposed that we are in the Cold War and a political sense she rejected it and he had trouble defining you stated that the objective of war is to\nDefeat an enemy actually I didn't say that I said the objective of war is to destroy an enemy is to kill your enemy and wreck his stuff just wipe them out it's not just defeat John\nSays this is exactly what is going on meaning to defeat an enemy not to destroy him the Democrats have decided to use any means necessary to defeat the Kavanaugh nomination\nThey've abandoned all decency\nIt is a Cold War because bullets are not being shot\nBut there is no question the Democrats mean too politically professional and socially kill Brett Kavanaugh it is a Cold War\nAnd now Kavanaugh and his family are getting death threats if this is not a Cold War Michael I don't know what would be a Democrats have Declared Political and professional war against this man looks the term Cold War is also misunderstood\nWhat people mean by Cold War is limited war\nIt was not bloodless we lost fifty eight thousand\nAmericans in Vietnam we lost almost forty thousand in Korea uh during the so called Cold War we lost countless other Americans in different hot spots around the world are there were very certainly an episode of the Cold War\nWas the Russian invasion of Afghanistan and the pushback against that\nA lot of people who died and I do think it is wrong to analogize\nThe idea of of trying to smear and discredit somebody and wreck his career I think it's despicable I think what the Democrats did was despicable I think their whole handling of the cabinet matter was shameful and unconscionable and wrong in his right to be condemned\nBut to call it murder is also obliterated\nDistinctions and I think sanctions need to be restored to our public debate I'll give you one example I woke up thinking about this is people are now talking about everybody has a survivor\nRight anybody who was ever complained about sexual misbehavior some guy no matter how far in the past or how limited that in this behavior is now a survivor of abuse\nAnd I was thinking of Anita Hill and this is not to say that if Clarence Thomas were guilty of the things he's accused of that it would be justifiable and defensible would have been wrong\nBut the idea that any of the hill a survivor what did she survived exactly\nShe survived um some rude comments that made her uncomfortable that song\nNo charges any workplace consequences to her work by Clarence Thomas and no charges that he ever touched her\nI I mean to say that\nIs a survivor and somebody who's been raped at knife point is

horizon for our country is a divorce\nIt's like you know that there's going to be a war you are yourself or just building this up with this idea that there'd be\nHundreds of thousands of people killed we have a great separation we have a mechanism available to us and I'm Wondering why what what is the mechanism what's the mechanism\nOh say they're just what I always say that we talked about before why would you deprive be one of the great rights provided to me in the constitution and that's the freedom of association\nKnow you'll have you'll have you'll have you'll have come to find any more than don't but you you live\nHundred with them you live in the same country with them there is no right in the constitution for secession it doesn't exist no and\nThat's like we discussed before it's not just session what it is is just solution of the union which has provided through article five the mechanism is available through article five would not be a war\nOkay how what how was how is the mechanism provided for dissolution of the union they never anticipated that and it's not there there isn't an article five a convention of the states is who proposed changes in the constitution that still have to then be approved by three quarters of the states the\nMike I called in about a year ago you had a constitutional scholar on and he agreed you you simply don't\nWant no no no no I it's it's it's if you believe a convention of the states could provide from the dissolution of the union or you'll just have to then get three quarters of the states to vote to dissolve the union and they want\nAs a student of history Mike I Want to quote something to you went in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the bands that bind them to another\nThat have had that ever connected them to another is not buying disconnected them but but go ahead okay so ...\nCorporation of independence and our great founding fathers realize that these things happen in the\nCourt okay so the challenge me telling me what you believe is the issue that is worth dissolving the union over\nWell you're in you push me on that before and a habit for you and you never want to answer and that is the killing the murder of over forty million American\nBabies now can't actually written into the Democrat platform\nOkay again that can be a reason you don't want to associate

extremely wealthy and doing nothing except tried it off to the courts work through the executive branch out to the last ...\nOkay well wait wait wait wait wait I again when you talk about some kind of establishment conspiracy was the establishment for Obamacare or was it against Obamacare\nSport\nOkay ah then what did you you will agree with me that there wasn't a very significant difference of opinion between Republicans and Democrats or was a single Republican not even one in either house and Congress we voted for Obama Care\nThere's an issue there but what about wait\nWait you're saying that they ignored this issue the last had their own approach to medical care which I think was the wrong approach which is the medical care needs to improve his more government involvement I think we would all benefit from less government involvement\nAnd and people having more freedom of choice and getting their own insurance arrangements that it\nIt seems to me is going to be one of the challenges for the next two years for President Trump and the Republicans if we maintain are majorities in Congress we've we've got to continue moving in that direction the idea that these issues that you bring up\nThat aren't instantly resolved ah it it doesn't mean that there's some kind of establishment conspiracy look there are a lot of people in the United states of America who are doing a lot better in the last two years and it is not just rich people\nThe ah the fact is that if you look at the wages that have been going up I mean even Ralph Nader\nAcknowledged it when we were talking to him on the economic growth that has happened in the last two years has benefited everybody in the country\nAnd look we've got two bad days on Wall street I Hope that won't be the end but you see the the problem with all these ideas about some all knowing establishment is it is trying to put some order some fake water into what is by its very nature a very just orderly and sometimes chaotic
