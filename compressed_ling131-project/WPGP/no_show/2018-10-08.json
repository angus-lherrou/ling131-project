when I saw the testimony of Dr Ford I felt great sympathy for judge Kavanaugh who was seeing a distinguished and spotless career all of a sudden trashed over issues about as high school year book and other stupidity that's utterly irrelevant\nAnd watching all of that the question is what do we do to fix the process because we really do need to get back to the sort of situation we had before where two justices who were confirmed unanimously\nYes Ruth Bader Ginsburg big liberal\nAnd yes Antonin Scalia one of the greatest conservative mine's ever to be on the court\nAnd they weren't trashed can

[laughter]\nI Will probably not even try to to find what ... means right ah we've really lowered ourself or in a new way when the members of the Senate Judiciary committee\nOr try to interpret a sixteen year old musing a in a high school yearbook it's beyond anything I've ever seen\nBy the way there are a a serious as a serious letter to the Judiciary Committee by ... and his association of

course earlier in life a very successful Baptist pastor\nOr are you richly encouraged by the new found democratic ah eagerness to make war on alcohol abuse\nOr you know listening to some of the Democrats last week I thought I was listening to the reincarnation of carry nations\nAnd uh I was expecting them to all bring out an ax and go and and a tear down the saloons of\nDC I I've never seen truck trip piracy in my life and it was it was embarrassing to watch and and to realize that the same party that are covered over people like Ted Kennedy and Chris Dodd\nWho once took a waitress at a restaurant in DC and literally through her on to a table while they were in a drunken state\nNever got charged for it humiliated the poor young lady ah the the party of those kind of ethics uh would dare try to ah to tell a Brett Kavanaugh that what he did in high school and then his college days made him on fit to be on the Supreme Court\nYou I I Know in both your racist for the presidency one one of the themes that that you stressed was trying to bring America together\nAnd to heal some of the bitterness and a renewal of the spirit the spirit of Brotherhood and amity and right now they're just I'm a part of the news coverage is the literally thousands of anti Kavanaugh demonstrators in protests were swarming over Capitol Hill\nWhat would you say to people like that assuming that we when victory or on this confirmation this weekend\nWell I Would quote to them two of their favorite a political figures I Would quote Iraq Obama who reminded us a rather bluntly that elections have consequences and he's right\nAnd then I Would remind them of the words of Hillary Clinton in October twenty six dangerous before the election when she said that it would be a real threat to our constitution and to our democratic system if someone lost the presidency and refused to accept the results of the voters\nAre these are two very important things that I Would love for ah people on the left to think about it and don't take my word for it or take the word of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama\nBecause Michael I Believe that the fundamental underlying issue that we've seen over the last few weeks with this Kavanaugh issue and frankly over the entirety of Donald\nTrump's presidency is this the other side has refused to accept\nThe results of the election and there are a lot of things our country this great Republican bars confer survive we can survive\nPendulum swings from the right and the left we can survive bad court decisions we can survive bad policy decisions and and even a spiraling debt that at times will threaten our economy but there's one thing that we can't survive and that is that if\nA group of citizens are significant group numbering almost half the country\nRefuses to accept the consequences and the results of a duly held election then now we're on the dangerous a thin ice\nOf destroying ... nation\nAnd we can't have it that way we're living the time or a lot of kids grow up thinking everybody gets a trophy nobody loses we better shake ourselves out of that yes we did was I've run for the president Xi twice I didn't lose I mean I didn't win a ... but can you imagine what would have been like a bunch of ...\nUh the remaining years of our life going around and saying I really one I'm going to go into the White House any way I should be the president of the one who's there is not legitimate\nOr they would put me away for life insurance\nUh-huh well ... ... again right now you're not in the White House but your daughter Sarah is she is the president's press secretary and the other day she was defending the president I think very appropriately and I I've been very critical about President Trump on a number of things\nBut I don't believe that he was mocking uh Christine lassie Ford when he he pointed out the truth which is that she has had very contradictory and evasive things to say when it comes to corroborating her story\nAnd uh your your daughter Sarah told the press that hey you had President Trump was just reporting the facts\nAnd then a gym accosted challenged her and it sounded like this in their final interchange\n... actually no I Know that they probably do\nA news think um that was in a moment that made you a pound papa\nA there are lots of moments that do and that was certainly one of them anytime that she uh puts Jemma Costa in his place [laughter] I kind of think that it's it's like watching her discipline or her three children\nThat are six five and three [laughter] and I I think dealing with the Costa\nIs a really easy for her 'cause she she's basically dealing with someone who acts like he's five or six or three years old\nOkay I one of the things that I wanted to get a quick response and this is not to get you in trouble Governor Huckabee but Lindsey Graham has inspired so many new admirers are so many new supporters because of his very very strong\nSupport I'm not just for a judge Kavanaugh but for the Trump agenda generally\nAnd part of the talk right now is I'm a ... Lindsey taking a more of a role\nNot just as chairman of the Judiciary Committee which I think is very likely I'm but perhaps as the next attorney general of the United states are given the fact that he does have a great deal of legal experience as a prosecutor\nAnd of course experience with the Senate he could also get confirmed as a new attorney general what do you think\nWell I think it would be a great idea I I Love Jeff Sessions when he was named I happen to be in Trump Tower when he was there and meeting with the president than the president elect we had a great conversation I told him how ecstatic I was and bought it was a wonderful decision\nUh but I've been very disappointed I Will be honest and say I just don't know what happened to the Jeff Sessions that I have known\nAnd a few like that or maybe he went night if he got over there on the agency and they captured him and he has experienced the Stockholm syndrome which happens to a lot of people who get into these agencies I don't know that's what happened\nBut I Know that he has not been the guy that I thought he was going to be and taking the Hoover vacuum cleaner to ah the D. O. J. and the FBI\nYou don't mean the J Edgar Hoover vacuum cleaner [laughter]\nGood ... um no but I just feel like that he's he is allowed the agency to run him rather than him run the agency and that's been very unfortunate ... Graham has become a rock star now I've always like Lindsey one thing I had liked about him is that he's a very straightforward\nHonest guy if he's with these with you and if he's not he's honest about it [noise]\nUh [noise] you know Donald Trump had their moments but [noise] you know what a once he's one of the greatest assets the president ...\nI I certainly agree with you about that a Mike Huckabee his ah TBN show wildly successful we'll be right back with your reaction to this moment [noise] uh we've had the Kavanaugh crisis whereabouts have the cabin off climax\nWe'll be right back with your calls [noise]\nNutty and strange if you want to\nSpeak for the demonstrators if you share some of their anguish and their occupation of the heart atrium Senate office building I clearly if they're going to try to disrupt the business the United States Senate they will have to be cleared away and arrested and what is it they are demonstrating for here\nWhat exactly one eight hundred nine five five\nSeventeen Seventy six uh Lindsey Graham spoke out clearly as he has been doing basically his whole career but he had this to say about the FBI investigation that was just completed listen\nI'm confident the FBI did a good job\nThey were not or hindered in any way [noise]\nAh the focus of the background check was all credible allegations before the committee [noise]\nUh I was looking for certain things to be answered by witnesses [noise]\nThat what the committee found is held up and then some [noise]\nThe main thing for me\nIs that you need to go to the FBI\nAnd you need to ask them [noise]\nDid they feel like they were able to do their job without it for us not the answer is shifts\nThey interviewed over a hundred and fifty facelift interview throughout the course of having all your life\n... interviews no evidence of that so manufacturers [noise] senators who requested the supplemental\nFBI background check out what they read [noise]\nOkay are they are ready to vote they are going to be voting tomorrow on a procedural question which is going to be to advance the nomination to the Senate floor and apparently the final vote on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to be adjusted to the Supreme Court will occur on Saturday\nSusan Collins and Jeff Flake both said they're very satisfied with the with the FBI investigation and that's an indication that they are probably going to be be necessary margin\nBecause that would give 'em even with down Senator Murkowski even without senator mentioned that would give Brett Kavanaugh the fifty votes he needs but wouldn't it be better if he won with sea to\nA ...

past\nIn a record number of them\nIs um been a very successful judge so far he's a good man the other reason is unified the Republican Party is because the Democratic assault\nHas been so despicable

getting all the facts\nHaving received a thorough briefing on the documents those fears have been realized for\nA second I disagree having received this the a briefing on all of the documents I disagree with Senator Grassley statements that there was no hints misconduct\nWe are reiterating our call given how limited\nThis these documents were and how limited scope of this investigation was\nWe are reiterating or call\nThat the documents with proper rejection be made public\nWhy shouldn't all of America see\nAnd second we are reiterated more call to make the directive that the White House and counsel McGahn sent to the FBI\nBecause we believe it greatly constrains the investigation from the get go okay ah\nAh investigate investigate investigate I I think one of the things that his clarifying about this whole process\nIs that it is giving people a little bit of a taste of what America would be like if the Democrats do take control of the house of representatives if you like this\nIf you like hearing from a various aggrieved Democrats making wild accusations trying to a practice the politics of personal destruction\nTrying for a massive and comprehensive investigations of what the terms booth thing in devil's triangle really meant to high school students in Nineteen eighty two if you believe this is the kind of endeavor\nIn which our representatives in Congress should be engaged Daniel votes the Democrats\nAnd cause you'll be getting lots and lots and lots more of\nThis and they win this thing the one of the reasons that I think that Republicans have been so unified and so energized by this whole process is because\nThere's an understanding people right now they're not attacking Donald Trump Donald Trump I mean he attacks back and he says things sometimes that are stupid says things sometimes that are not true but that is not Brett Kavanaugh for goodness sake\nBrett Kavanaugh's entire record is one of mainstream conservatism of judicial excellence of support from people who don't agree with them building coalitions and that's exactly why they're afraid of him on the Supreme Court\nJudge Kavanaugh has a good relationship with Elena Kagan\nAn Obama appointee associate justice of the Supreme Court how do we know because she says so she was the one when she was dean of Harvard law school who appointed Brett Kavanaugh to change their\nAnd if they're going to go after Brett Kavanaugh who does build coalitions who works with other people who has a life long record of impressing people positively men and women and black and white and liberal and conservative if they're going to go after Brett Kavanaugh and make him into some kind of cartoon villain\nMake him into some kind of serial rapist stumbling drunk I mean none of this is true\nAnd it's the worst kind of politics it's despicable politics and people talk about is that to democracy this kind of politics is more of a threat to democracy than all of President Trump's stupid tweets combine then there are plenty of stupid tweets\nAnd the idea that a President Trump is going to permanently alienate female voters it's it's not true President Trump\nIn the last election won a majority of white female voters truly didn't win his big majorities Romney did\nBuddy one majority and\nThe the idea that that the Democrats are trying polarization to separate eight women out\nAnd say ... women have to vote like women see how that worked for Hillary Clinton\nIt it is the answer is it didn't and I believe that this democratic strategy is divisive\nAnd awful\nAnd ah that the American people are waking up to its dangers and to um to to try to just stop at ... here's a disagreeing email that came in from Brian in Compton, California\nAh his message to me is judge K guilty where there is smoke there's fire you Republicans whitewash everything\nIt's clear as a twenty year investigator for the state which includes sexual assault cases rape et cetera I interviewed over thirty plus pick another candidate Andrew BS comment about his demeanor court versus private that's ridiculous my comment was this he was\nAt the committee as a witness not as a presiding judge there is no\nEvidence at all that as a presiding judge or as someone functioning in a courtroom capacity he has never shown any problems with his temperament\nHere's a functioning alcoholic pick somebody else\nHe set himself he is no we didn't\nBiased really\nAnd you are going to make him a judge long as the bias is for your side it's fine these are the fax cover up and deceit no hearing\nFrom Merrick Garland there we go that shows your bias and lack of fairness nothing can beat that [noise] um [noise] again a Merrick Garland good man by the way\nSomebody who's been a good judging will continue to be a good\nJudge on the appellate court we'll be right back disagreement day on that show [noise]\nIt you know that there is one of the things that is appalling in this country and that we need to continue to make progress on we've made some progress\nIs the high rate of crime against black people but nearly all of that\nNearly all of it or the overwhelming majority and it's over Ninety percent is perpetrated by other black people and that was the reason that I was speaking about that now let me go to your point about judge Kavanaugh\nDo I know that he is telling the truth uh in in terms of his denials about what happened allegedly to Dr Ford I don't know for certain diseases telling the truth\nBut I think the absence of any confirming\nEvidence at all is overwhelming\nAnd the whole way that her accusations against him came out or very suspect\nAnd ... and by the way it is impossible to remove this from a political context\nAnd the reason I feel so outraged about judge Kavanaugh is he really did appear to be the ideal nominee I don't know and I've never met him but I Do know people have worked with him closely and they have the highest regard for him including people who are only a left\nI'm a ... who was a guest on this show recently is a professor of law at Yale who has had interaction with a a judge Kavanaugh in the classroom and otherwise\nAnd he's a liberal he was very active in the Hillary Clinton campaign he strongly supports judge Kavanaugh's nomination and the notion\nThat he should be blocked from the Supreme Court based on auto early unsupported unprecedented\nAccusations against him seems to me a profound wrong because one of the things that you know about people who are sexual predators real sexual predators and people who commit sexual assault and rape\nAnd and uh ... and\nViolence against women most of those people do it as a pattern is on a one off\nAnd the idea that the other accusations against a judge Kavanaugh other than a Dr Ford are completely non credible and have been clearly the nine or that I think it's worth taking into consideration of coming up\nA a very prominent Republicans speaks to\nA group of protesters happened to be women [noise]\nAny urges those women to grow up\nIs that an outrage we'll play the shocking audio and more coming up on disagreement day on the ... one eight hundred nine five five
