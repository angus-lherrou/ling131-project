just need to do as well\nAnd uh this would be very encouraging and it also brings up the point that when you read the generic polls nationally and when they say well\nThe Democrats are have this big advantage and the generic poll\nThe reasons that doesn't matter as much as you might think it would it's the same reason it didn't matter alternately that Hillary won the popular vote by more than three well three million votes but you know what that was all in California\nAnd that's the point one of the reasons I think that Democrats may be doing well on the generic ballot there are thirty six

election fraud and he says we're in real danger of it will be speaking to him later this hour\nUm meanwhile\nI also want to hear from why this election is so important in the mind of someone who was speaking in Las Vegas just moments ago and it's a voice you might recognize listen\nNovember's election are more important than anything I can remember in my lifetime and that includes what I was about [noise]\nPoliticians say every time the the most important election this one's really that important [noise]\nThe stakes are high\nThe consequences of anybody we're not turning up and doing everything you can to get your friends neighbors family to turn up\nThe consequences of used staying home would be profoundly dangerous because it's come\nTo our democracy\nOkay\nI I Can't believe that Obama President Obama is saying uh this is the most important election of my lifetime\nAnd again everyone says that about every election and it's almost never true [laughter] really and this is a midterm election and it will not be a landslide one way or the other end yes I think it's\nImportant and yes I think everybody should definitely vote because this will help to determine the direction for the country for the next two years but then we have another presidential election and I think one of the things that happens is we're all so desperate to get people to turn out\nAnd then when an election happens and there isn't some kind of profound change how people get disillusioned how often get new cry wolf about that stuff one eight hundred nine five\nFive Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number a President Obama's successor was also speaking today and he had a a different tone he was speaking outside the White House and here's a President Trump said\nThey were putting in a resolution [noise] sometime next week or we could have to wait\nFor the footage we have\nA job you're doing it sounds a little bit of that some of the fact that we've already you\nKnow you got rid of it I thought it was a vote after the election\nOkay uh\nI'm not sure this is going to work and what he's talking about is\nTrying to do a ten percent middle class income tax cut sounds pretty good\nBut honestly I don't I don't think he will get the support he needs unless a and first of all he's right to say we're we're going to try to do the vote after the election when he's talking about now is a proposal to try to excite the Republican base and of course people should be excited about it you know how much money you spend in taxes\nAnd getting ten percent of that back that's pretty cool that's a nice thing however\nHe can't do it honestly unless he finds some kind of compensating\nA place for money to come in\nBecause it simply does not work it does not work that when you cut the tax rate\nThat automatically the revenues go up I mean it's true that the revenues didn't go down from the last tax hike but because we're spending so much more than ... continue to grow up we're already looking at a trillion dollar a year deficit\nAnd I think the president should a work as hard as he can maybe after the election with a Republican House and a Republican Senate to try to yes continue to cut taxes\nBut to do so by cutting spending one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six or in Nevada or President Trump spoke on Saturday and he was talking so much similar terms listen\nWe're located in a major tax cuts for middle income people [noise]\nAnd we do that it'll be somehow I'm prior I Wish I had are studying very deeply right now\nAround the block they may actually good for middle income people not at all really Kevin Brady is working on it all Ryan is working in the world war you know we're looking at a major for young\nI wouldn't say some time around at first maybe delivery for their\nOkay one of the things that we need to keep in mind is they're already was a tax cuts for middle income people you may not be aware of it but you will when you\nFill out your tax forms and everything because basically the exemption was doubled in other words part of what we have now is that the standard deduction the standard deduction that people receive was double\nWhich means that there's an extra twelve thousand dollars that people who\nAre middle class taxpayers are not paying taxes on\nThat's a good thing and that should save a lot of money all ready for middle income people\nAnd uh I I think the timing of this I may be could be a little bit better\nAnd also President Trump did something that provoked a ... usually negative response on CNN what's striking about this is not the light it sheds 'cause it she has no light at all on President Trump's proposed actions concerning the federal government\nAnd trans gender is um\nWhat shocking about it is supposedly journalism and honestly these reporters on air uh are sounding completely unapologetic plea partisan\nI'm Talking about John Berman and um and I'll Alison ... and that John Avalon on uh CNN listen to how they\nReact remember it was just over three years ago that same sex marriage became legal in this country\nSo now I'm a wedge issue has moved to a trans rock concerts I loved to lock the issue of identity gender identity civilized by Facebook's dozens of gender options\nI'm also liberal abrasive myriad of gender pronouns for many conservatives in some moderate it's a potent example the PC culture the Trump constantly attacks to great effect\nRepublicans want to benefit from this backlash and it's an easy talk just look at the numbers transgender folks make up an estimated zero point four percent of American adults or ... million people\nThat's still a lot of our fellow citizens but it's many fewer than ... million gay and lesbian Americans who most people now\nIt was friends family your co workers\nThis just simply picking on minority rights to try to win the popular vote last time I checked self determination it was a pretty basic American values rooted in freedom and equality not President Trump has also been playing up the care about of asylum seekers from Central America\nPushing it as a threat at rallies employees with plenty of amplification from conservative media this is just more played the bass panic rooted in fear and anger rather than any reality that these asylum seekers are going to rush the border\nOkay\nThere let's say they don't rush to the border\n[noise] what are they coming here to do they're they're coming here in Moscow to get into the United states\nAnd what they will do is flood our resources or submit applications for asylum and basically challenged this notion that the United states as a as a basically the core of our sovereignty\nGets to decide who comes into the country and who doesn't\nWe don't get to decide because we're not East Germany who leaves the country and people are free to leave\nBut this is this is bizarre this is um we have that can we go to this last uh ... uh we don't have time\nOkay ah I ah I Know we will be speaking about this later frankly what President Trump is doing is not taking away anyone's rights what he's doing is taking away a federal government position I actually believe that the federal government's position on transgender ism\nI should be neutral and in other words don't persecuted people were transgendered but don't\nFull of a sudden presumptive
