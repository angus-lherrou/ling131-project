... picked apart by most of you in this room but not no one is looking at ah whether or not the accusations made her corroborated whether or not there's evidence to support them\nUsually drift shows victim was\nI think those Dr Ford in judge Kavanaugh ah or victims at the hands of the Democrats I think it is absolutely disgraceful\nWhat they've done and exploited this process they exploited Dr Ford there exploiting all of the women that have come out to make any type of accusations this isn't the process that should've been done which is certainly everybody deserves to be hurt but that

go directly to David in Scottsdale, Arizona David you're on the Michael ...\nMichael how are you doing did well I have a question for you yeah so\nThey judge Kavanaugh gets confirmed today and uh which he showed a hopefully is there any kind of a lawsuit like not frivolous lawsuit any kind of a lawsuit keep ... you know impose on the food on the proceedings if it turns out it's just a false allegation\nUh but uh you can be sure that every single senator will show up and we'll be counted\nOne eight hundred nine five five\nSeventeen Seventy six and remarkably enough or the FBI seems to be close to completing its investigation a a an update over at the hill\nSays the FBI is said to be wrapping up its investigation of the sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nSo what do they found well we don't exactly know nor as the Republicans repeated again and again when they were resisting the idea of this extra FBI investigation\nWill they come up and say well we found that he's guilty as sin or we found that he is as white as the driven snow or or I shouldn't say why was innocent as the driven snow\nOr because I think it's very very tough when\nVirtually all of the principles in this debate are white uh it's it's very tough to find some means of making a racial issue but of course Democrats have been trying and trying and trying\nIt I'm\nSteve Gomez the former FBI special agent he's a wasn't special agent in charge of Los Angeles which is one of the most important bureau ah officers in the country\nHe said it wasn't unusual that the FBI was not going to be in viewing Ford\nThey were not going to be interviewing Christine Blasey Ford they're not going to be interviewing a judge Kavanaugh again\nI mean after all each of them spent hours\nIn front of the Senate Judiciary committee plus they have both been extensively interviewed by the staff of the Judiciary Committee apparently the um and and this by the way I think is a syndicated that judge Kavanaugh\nSpent more hours over thirty total speaking to the staff of the Judiciary Committee than any other nominee for the Supreme Court or for all of the others combined and with more questions asked\nI think it's safe to say that he is the the first nominee where where his drinking\nIn a high school and college has become a serious issue by the way that was not the subject of the the um FBI background investigation apparently they are speaking to Deborah Ramirez who had made those comments about his freshman year at Yale in the basement of Lawrence hall\nAnd ensure let let me speak\nPersonally for just a moment because as people know listen to the show I went to yell once upon a time and uh I did my first year at Yale Law school and so this was before a judge Kavanaugh or was anywhere close to the campus in New haven\nBut places like that are very tradition bound the culture doesn't change that dramatically [noise] and ... the idea that drinking\nIs a very big deal for a lot of people in college I think that's true I mean breaking news and once they're they're old jails songs including the ... song which is very well known it became a smash hit are all about drinking\nThere are there there are lots of ah lots of references and this goes back to songs dating to the nineteenth century\nAnd I I Will say that does that mean that everybody gets drunk all the time\nNo I I I was thinking about it and I I didn't drink in college sorry\nUm I Wish I could say I didn't look I turned out okay and where at least I think I did\nUm but no I um I I did not imbibe I didn't like the taste of beer at that time and a and most of the people that I knew\nSort of and I've read about this and right turns I I talk a little bit about my years ago\nAnd\nPart of what happened is in the late sixties there was a transition and people who have been very obsessed with beer became very obsessed with pot\nWhich I thought was more obnoxious I mean really more obnoxious because people made us so squeezed by religious thing of it with no flashing strobe\nLight says oh man oh wow this is so amazing\nAnd I don't really think that anybody know not Brett Kavanaugh are not members of the cage the\nNot not anybody or had the idea that drinking beer was a path to light and uh I Know\nI don't think that was the case so maybe at the University of North Carolina they've just published and this is part of the very needed role of a free press there's a website That's published some photos including photos of Christine Blasey Ford\nDuring her years at Chapel Hill and University of North Carolina and showing her as something of a party girl there\nIs a statement is covered now in the New York times today the New York times not just Fox News it's the New York times is covering the allegations by her former live in boyfriend\nWho says that all of this stuff about how she was traumatized they were dating for ... years they knew each other casualty averse to they were dating for six years between Nineteen Ninety two and Nineteen Ninety eight and he says a number of unpleasant things about\nA doctor glassy Ford\nNow is that off limits well he's still building rightfully questioning her credibility for instance on the stuff that she was afraid of flying and that's why she couldn't make it to the hearings to testify earlier when it was very obvious to everybody that well this is nonsense they they asked\nHer Rachel Miller asked her about her flying and she said oh no I'm not really afraid of flying so why did you tell that to the committee and doesn't this go to the issue of credibility\nAll all of this stuff it seems to me that if you are going to come forward about something that happened too long ago from what you feel you have never ever ever recovered\nWhat do you have to expect that there will be some pushback and um that was the way the New York times highlights their story\nA Christine Blasey Ford's credibility under new attack by Senate Republicans\nBut ah it includes the following the former boyfriend told the Judiciary Committee that he witnessed personally Dr Blass Z helping a friend prepare for a possible polygraph examination contradicting her testimony under oath\nDr Blass Z a psychology professor from California who also goes by are married name Ford was asked during the hearing whether she'd ever given tips or advice to somebody who was looking to take a polygraph test she answered never\nLet the former boyfriend whose name was redacted from a copy of the sworn statement provided\nTo the Judiciary Committee\nSaid that when they were together in the late Nineteen Ninety she saw Dr Blass a use her understanding of psychology\nTo assist her roommate of the time Monica el Micheline before interviews for possible position positions with the FBI or the U.S attorney's office that might require her to take a lie detector test\nQuote I witnessed Dr Ford helped make lean prepare for a potential polygraph exam demands and the statement Dr Ford explained in detail what to expect how polygraph works and help me clean become familiar and less nervous about the exam\nMeanwhile ms ... who is a former FBI agent denied the assertion today she says I have never had Christine Blasey Ford or anybody else hear me or provide any other type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam I have taken it anytime okay so here's a disagreement\nDo we know who to believe here know do we know who to believe between a doctor Ford and judge Kavanaugh well we're going to find out\nLittle bit more about the other witnesses and yes she identified it was Dr Ford who came up with a name BJ's mice and um [noise] a Kaiser legal in Kaiser her good friend who says she's never met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd so she couldn't have been at that party Brett Kavanaugh was in fact at that party\nAnd then mark judge and what is the FBI likely to say and how was the vote likely to go and who will decide this final vote will get to that with your calls coming up on the ... one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six [noise]\n\nHe was angry he was saying he was ...
