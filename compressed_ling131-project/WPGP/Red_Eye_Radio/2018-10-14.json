demonstrators\nAnd they are crazed\nWho continue to celebrate indigenous people's day what used to be Columbus Day\nBy um by what well by\nMorning and renting their governments and and talking about the horrors\nOf the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation\nTo the Supreme Court of the United states of Hollywood of courses offered to particularly gracious response to the defeat of the left on on this issue um remember Kathy Griffin\nWho had that quote hilarious example of carrying a bloody severed head of President Trump\nAnd then she got fired from CNN and she got fired from everywhere and her career is not doing so well\nWell she's back she said a lovely tweet\nTo um to Susan Collins and the tweet simply said F. and then the rest but with\nK. K. K. K. K. U. with while you are you you you you you\nAnd then that was followed by another tweet deer senator Collins to quote metal line\nThere is a special place in hell\nFor women who don't help other women go to hell\nUh-huh a balanced and kind reaction she followed that up with another one that said feckless and then see word two point oh that sounds like somebody who really respects women\nReally\nGeorge to cut tweeted out as a Buddhist it as my practice to have compassion for all people but senator Collins is really testing my limits right now\nAnd Alissa mulatto who was there at the hearing she tweeted out don't let this performance fool you is senator Collins believes in hash tag me to she would've open the door when I was in her office to hear stories of constituent

and Sarah Silverman so senator Collins either thinks that three women lied to their husbands and therapists and children about sexual assault or she just doesn't give a blank um\nAll of this is supposed to lead to what well to confrontations with us or are they telling truth to power and thank goodness Murphy Brown is backing up the job I actually watched this mercy brown episode or most of it I couldn't watch the whole thing\nIt was to the vicious ... of the original Murphy Brown show wasn't that great but the re boot on CBS is so embarrassing the segment\nThat gets a lot of attention I Want to play it for you to get a a a a sense of it\nUh it's Candice Bergen back as Murphy Brown that her son Avery\nYoung reporter has gotten a press pass to go into the White House press room for press briefing with Sarah Silverman and they do this by using real footage of Sarah Silverman answering other people and then they have a body double that they look over her shoulder\nAnd ah so Murphy Brown then sneaks onto the White House because the guard is out to lunch and she sneaks on should actually gets shot and probably be dead if anyone actually did this but it's a TV show says he sneaks in the White House press room and it sounds like this\nNext question [laughter] the we asked some new faces here today a very I look forward to taking your question but I think I'll save them for last well [noise]\nWas\nAround grabs on to my question [laughter] [laughter] so weird Murphy [noise] I don't know how you got in\nHere but it's inappropriate [laughter]\nNot really want to talk about watching appropriate [noise] how about the way you do your job\nJam on the role of the White House press secretary\nIs to create transparency in government and tell the American people the truth but that's not what happens in this room whether it's about a meeting with Russians in Trump Tower or a made up mandate that require separation between parents and their children at the border\nIt all comes down to the same thing so here's my question why do you live\nOh\nI think that's absolutely ridiculous [noise] she got him in\nAnd do more allies and use it for us to be closed the enemy of the people I mean how do we go back to our newspapers and magazines and our networks\nKnowing that the most basic principle of journalistic integrity to report the facts it's totally out of reach if we can get to the truth why are we even here I said we get out and walk out right now\nShown ministry we're not gonna take it anymore [noise]\nLast the last [noise] and then she has this\nLook I Know a lot of what I said you're asked to resonate with you I Know a lot of you\nPersonally [noise]\nSome better than others that's her son's you so maybe I don't know you as well as I thought I did [laughter] ha\nOkay this is so pathetic I mean even by the standards of a failed sitcom and slice away Murphy Brown\nVisible ratings it got one third of the ratings of NBC's re booted will and grace it got less than one fifth of the re booted Roseanne ratings less than one fifth as as a share the audience but can you listen to those line readings\nIt's like she doesn't even understand what she's reciting here which I she may be reading from a teleprompter I don't know it's it's pathetic and it makes me nostalgic my brother Harry\nAnd I wrote a book a long time ago way back in Nineteen eighty or and\nMy brother and I had to pull the golden turkey words and we gave out a life achievement award for the worst actress of all time Candice Bergen was a nominee [laughter] she was\nShe didn't win she didn't win but she was nominated and for goodness sake this is supposed to be funny\nWhat I don't understand is people are saying and actually Meghan McCain was back on the view today and she was actually moving she had taken six weeks off because of her father's death and funeral and then morning\nAnd she talked about uh\nThe country coming together and at least being able to talk to each other\nCouldn't Hollywood help with this process well yes but not if you're going to respond to people like Senator Collins\nWith basically the F you not if you're going to go after a former astronaut because he dares to quote Churchill because Churchill is now unacceptable um [noise]\nThe ... tiger thing the\nThe insanity about a civil war\nWhat is that civil war about if you're on the left and you think you need to keep protesting and you need to challenge the service of judge Kavanaugh will\nTell me how you're going to do that one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six some Democrats are speaking out on that we'll get to that coming right up on the message you [noise]\nAnd he's sitting on the Supreme Court and he's going to sit on that Supreme Court for the next forty years at least so go ahead\nFor the Democrats\nThe what was the other stuff that it does and I'm just Supreme Court there\nOh they said oh they're going to grab power and that's ... ...\nNo it is it is not war war is saying things like we have to mount armies and stock supplies and live off the land and drive them out\nWith the Democrats are saying right now is vote vote vote vote vote and fine and good luck I don't think they are very effectively appealing to voters and the reason that this whole idea of a war doesn't hold a Jeff is look John Adams said something very famous\nIn the American revolution he said a third of people living in colonies at the time wanted independence a third wanted to remain loyal to Britain and the third one and simply to be left alone\nIf you have a full third who are willing to fight and another full third who are willing to fight on the other side yes you can have a very bloody war and they were twenty five thousand people Americans who died in that war\nBut uh we don't have that the percentage of people on the left who want to go ahead and how people out of restaurants or want to make this a war\nI I think it's it's not anywhere near a third\nFrankly I don't think it's near ten percent it's extreme crazies and they certainly don't deserve to be voted into office let's go to Tom in Glen Dora California Tommy clear on\nYes I Do very much ... I'd like to give you a preliminary thirty second shameless plug\nNone of you thank you for for offering but you can't because you gonna run out of time\nOkay very good uh sorry okay you know Michael

serious it makes me scared\nArt is the mainstream public and I don't mean the base of the Democrats or Republicans mainstream independent voter I fear he or she is so overwhelmed by the bias of the media that they will not recognize the profound danger I'll\nI'll tell you Tom when we get them back I'll tell you why I'm hopeful and I [noise]\nUm because I think things are changing or is it

nine days from now when people go to the polls is less than a month it's I don't know\nWell the reason I'm hopeful as this is that the most recent polls show real momentum voters on both sides are getting serious about this election they kind of know what's at stake but there's been more of a change and there is clearly more momentum right now\nOn the Republican side and it's all about turnout midterm elections and generally if you go back historically there's just analysis was done that shows that if Republicans get within three points\nOn the generic preference battle in other words when

right okay except for Jennifer Rubin I don't know what her problem as but everybody else is very much for judge Kavanaugh who's\nStanding and deserves our support and um\nMeanwhile on the other side I
