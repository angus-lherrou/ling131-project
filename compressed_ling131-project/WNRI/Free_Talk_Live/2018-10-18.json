when we talk about those things that sounds callous\nBecause we talk about ending programs that exist that ostensibly help people and I'm sure in certain circumstances that people would rather have whatever crappy help the state is getting the no help at all but that's the false paradigm is that\nWithout the state that there would be nothing and that's what the people who are status want you to believe they want you to disbelieve and your neighbors so even though there was a lot of talk tonight about how people need to come together as a community and help each other out\nOr the state is not the method it's not a moral method to do that way right and so when the libertarians say and again this wasn't a really much of a back and forth conversation that we're at tonight's that's why I wanted to talk about this on the air because we can reach a lot more people than the you know two dozen that might have been in that room\nTurned out that would have been the candidates and then I'd say there was probably half a dozen maybe um I mean not that the candidates don't need to hear the libertarian viewpoint rice blamed well either but anyway it makes more sense to talk about it here because we can do it in detail\nUm when you talk about the idea of ending is a state program you also have to explain\nWhat it could look like in the absence of that state program so you don't sound like you're some cold court you know cold hearted snake that doesn't care about people\nThe reality is when you let people have the money that they earned and keep it and decide for themselves what to do with it they can be so much more compassionate with that money as individuals donating to different charities and different organizations that actually do provide help or to other folks\nBut the the difference between us and the people that rely on that believe in the state is we believe in the individual we believe that people are neighbors will\nHelp other people and we're willing to jump off that cliff and say you know what in the state programs entirely and the market the charities\nPeople who care will actually step forward and help and the people who believe in the state wants you to believe that they want they want you to believe that people are not good generally they need to be forced into contributing involuntarily to some sort of state run program to create the so called safety net to take care of what\nThe book on tax that settlement and I've helped thousands of people do attack problems and they thought might never be solved I can help you to if your taxes you can't
