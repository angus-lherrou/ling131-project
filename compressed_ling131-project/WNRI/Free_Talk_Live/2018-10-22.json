app spanked downright I wasn't using tinder I haven't ... profile okcupid well I see it on both of them\nI'll see the anti Trump stuff on on both of them but again I wasn't there really during Obama's yeah I couldn't tell you if you know the answer to Daryl question though dial in our toll free number you're eight fifty five four fifty free that's eight five five four times zero three seven three three I suspect that whether it was overtly\nAdvertised on a profile or not it was likely something that would you know divide people once they found out oh I'm a Republican I'm a Democrat I\nUnless you know they're really desperate for a date many people would just be like you know what never mind and your rights forget about it because I mean it does happen where couples have differing political viewpoints but it makes life a little more difficult to lose the\nTheir needs while you are a residual income which can last for years companies are buying and they need you\nEmail advertise

R. N. dot at them you'll need the discord apt to do the audio thing they're discord\nAnd then you'll downgrade sound almost like you're sitting here in the studio with us which includes me in and Daryl and Jackie liberty dot menu that is where you can go if you are an individual rejects the initiation of force and those are if you agree to abide by the ethics of the non aggression principle which means if you're conservative or liberal you don't belong\nOr at liberty dot menu not yet you've got to come to the understanding of what the non aggression principal is and then\nActually you know\nHave it means something to go to liberty dot menu and you can hook up with other uh hook up the wrong term we're talking about dating\nThat apparently means sex um you can connect with other people who love but every might be able to hook up with somebody using liberty dot ... is a very old for that\nThere is a bit of a social networking aspect to the site certainly not the focus of it but it does have that uh liberty dot menu is how you can put up information about the thing that you do maybe it's a creating content digital content maybe you've got an event\nThat you coordinate maybe you've got a business that you run or more than one of those things you can add listings for free and of course you can rate interview other listings as well go to liberty dot menu can use ... to get your special free chocolate listener badge because again it's free to use the site so we can't really give you a discount\nIt's free liberty ... menu head on over there and get interactive ah so we're talking about dating and if you've got a story you want to tell because the story originally that we brought up here was from vice and it's about conservatives having a tough time dating in the DC area\nWhen a women on dating sites or I guess vice versa can be the case but when the other you know whoever did you want to date finds out that you were a Trump supporter in this case then it's off or in some cases for for just people on the right\nJust finding out there on the right means it's off um you know people will jump to a conclusion about you\nAnd again I'm saying you talking to conservatives out there\nThis is probably true to some extent on the river so I Would\nSay are conservatives on these sites to find that they're you know the attracted to a liberal but then they find out that there are a liberal that might turn them off to that's just not what the article or in this case happens to be about so I guess I'm curious what your experiences have been as a libertarian because some people make\nYou know they jump to the wrong conclusions about us to somebody I Believe that libertarians are on the right others believe that libertarians are on the left and of course the problem is all of these sites is you're never going to find out what somebody thinks they're just going to not answer you\nWrite like you you send a message to somebody on one of these dating sites they look at your profile and they say\nOh this person is against you know filling the black government program this person must be a whatever liberal or conservative based on whatever their preconceived notions are and then it's just like well even if they thought you were attractive maybe you're right off the list anyway because of your politics so is it a good idea to hide that information\nAnd wait until you actually do get\nA on a date with somebody or hands on how important\nIt is to you ...\nYou know I like so is somebody that has taken up and running over the last couple of years you know I spend a lot of time doing that thing that I not put in a profile by the way I run a lot\nWell that's way less objectionable right like the idea that you run a lot somebody's gonna be like man this guy's fit um where at it so\nUh a couple of months ago I send a message to somebody and they were like oh wait so you're like running all weekend you're not going to have time to ever see me really yeah\nOkay so you know like if you spend\nTime doing certain things whether it be running or politics somebody could take it all Jackson too that I see that I don't think it's going to result in as many objections not necessarily going to be as many but you know if there's something that is important to you should you hide that\nBecause the question somebody else might not find that important to rebel right\nNormal person is going to have a moral object to just somebody running or doing for other time consuming hobby that doesn't really have any larger political or social implications I Would guess though that anybody who's listening to this show\nPolitics is probably a big enough part of their life that disclosing that and you're dating profiles a good idea\nI just want to know what your experience has been the toll free number here's eight fifty five four fifty free and of course you can bring up anything so I'm not sure what the free market penguin is calling about but he's on the line\nFree and of course you can bring up anything so I'm not sure what the free market penguin is calling about but he's on the line on our discord color line number four go ahead\nYup hum as raking in the new number four on working on\nYeah regret like clear um I wanted to call about actually I think you hit the nail on the head and bravo for bringing it up the or that it's talked for libertarians to ... just because actually the first person who's ever mentioned it to me as you in\nA new edition of how they're like oh just started listening to talk of live kinda regularly\nAnd you write a letter from a guy that was a ... at you had brought him to liberty and um yeah I mean that it it it really made it at ... and it's funny 'cause that's really never been brought up but you really made it for the past in case but why I put on the left really just a like Jackie said was to get a I'm a\n... economics listen I mean really people the people they're very so many well intentioned people that just wants what's right for society and we're one sided and people are uplifted did have you know people are are kind of a more equal footing in certain ways and that they overcome their advantages in it\nAnd the title problems and their their answers in ... in liberty liberty movement and ... and you know\nIn this side of the political spectrum to those issues to people with those kinds of concerns and not just the\nIndividual is all you know pro I'm kind of your your your your standard heavy individual is ... and ... kind of um situation kind of stand they know the right to the eventual very important and they are you know the sacrosanct to many libertarian but at the same time you know\nPeople most people have don't have a clue what libertarians were very soon after the libertarians a ... and and\nNo they don't have a clue um I remember hearing a there is a gun organization here in New Hampshire and half your firearms coalition as the believe what it's called and they do one of those ah you know candidate questionnaires that if you're running for office they send you a questionnaire and then they will\nEither endorsed you are not endorsed you based on your answers to the question at right like how you believe on guns and of course you know I did very well presumably I haven't gotten my raining yet but I don't know if they've come out with them\nBut the due wrote me back like really impress the organizer of this or this organization or the head of it wrote me back impressed with my answers like you don't sound at all like the libertarian presidential candidate\nA did basically their bill weld and Gary Johnson see specifically mentioned bill weld it seems like he really hates bill weld because he's from Massachusetts so he knows how bad he was a on guns apparently\nAnd I was like well you know there's\nThere's some people who are actually libertarian but people who understand what not aggression is and we talk about that and then there's people like Bill weld uh\nSo you know unfortunately that's just reality people don't know and especially if they're being confused by these liberty so called libertarians getting national press\nThen it's understandable why people will be turned off and disgusted by libertarians and then jumped to understandable conclusions thinking that all libertarians must believe what these candidates believe because why else would they be their presidential candidates if they weren't the standard bearer for the libertarian belief system\nWhere they are being all all the Republicans clearly but after like Trump does [noise]\nThat's what's going on here though right like that's the problem with uh these dating sites apparently is people are jumping to conclusions based on if somebody says the Republican or Democrat that get ... conclusions are jumps to and the same thing is true about libertarians which is why I prefer the term volunteer wrist I
