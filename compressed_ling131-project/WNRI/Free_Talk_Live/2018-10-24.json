Virginia I Swear to call about some kind of want to\nChange the direction of that for quite a bit and I was actually thinking about all this talk of the um the Democrat mom the leftist moms industry and and everything that people get so worked up about well I mean you know I I certainly disagree with ... than any\nBad tactics that habit pointed out to of occurred in some cases but let's look at let's look at these protests that have in this country and in and it may happen in overtime and all over the world what what are these um\nScary left is scary anarchists\nProtesting the police violence a global bankers which of course are the cap you know banks is pretty much are they are very obvious you know the state\nWhich many on the right in protested or the you know the Federal Reserve system for instance so they're kind of ... and good heart there\nBut do they get out in the street I mean that's that's the thing I mean they have to end the fed protest they weren't getting the streets but they did go out to Federal Reserve buildings and you know hold signs and stuff so they did do that\nYeah yeah okay I just thought it was just some common ground between the two the two groups anyway go ahead\nWell that's that's what I Want to get it actually that's actually where I Want to I Want to get it but um yeah you know police violence that\nHum and that's where I was doing there absolutely right on that\nAbsolutely absolutely and I'm you know I'm\nActually there was you know I mean they kind of\nJump the gun and I don't really agree with these people for a fire district let's say they were really opens\nPeople at a ... really ugly advocated fascism depending on your definition there aren't people doing that so I think that's a a worthy cause if if\nThe situation warrants that but what I what I see and there are other examples that you can't come to my mind right now what I see is what it meant a lot of propaganda is mobilized the right to come out and protest and what are they protest in favor of the police of law and order on Portland in favor of the status quo in favor of the president and the\nRolling or ... or they\nLeave their only a problem for the right when the uh left is in charge\nOr excuse me when the when the left is in charge then or the right are concerned with the police but when the rights in charge then it's law and order all the way yeah I think you're right about that\nAnd and so um something that they miss Jackie brought up left on that she was on a ... I I think ... I called the owners\nTired but hold on before you go on and that's probably also true about people on the left meaning that they will only protest police violence or some of them\nIt's not their guys who are in charge although that being said there were certainly some police protests during the Obama administration and I suspect\nThat some of those protesters would have to find themselves as a on the left any way more fun if you're a semi free market penguin I Know you had more to say we continue with you and your thoughts are toll free number eight fifty five four fifty free like freedom ... joined us here on the radio talk live\nTo operate a retail business and are looking for a solution for point of sale crypto currency except that\nIt's never been easier thanks to any pay ... global\nThere's no paperwork or approval process to open an account if you already have a tablet you're almost died just sign up at any paid on global drop your personal crypto wallet addresses on the set up a page and then lo Dee out that's it you're accepting crypto currency like the ... the ab your store get started out any paid on global\nAny pay dot global then cash has changed their name to her rise into better represent their transition from a crypto currency to a pioneering platform that protects consumer data they're working towards the day when anyone will be able to build privacy based applications on the horizon platform beauty expelling overrides that as a nod to their heritage and recognizes that they remain committed to the vision that\nTheir project was built upon their point an ticker symbol remain Lee and learn more at her rise in global enjoying the horizon community H.

on doing things like bringing people on board with crypto currency which we've been incredibly successful at\nA not only hearing team but also out of Portsmouth\nI we've basically created the crypto mecca where two currencies accepted in real life or\nHear more and more businesses per capita than from what I can tell any other city or in the world Portsmouth thinking or like the number one and

Hill who is making a documentary called I Want my sex machine uploaded photos\nOf a sex robots created by somebody who's made a ... a ... called harmony and shared those photos on the dating platform in an exclusive interview with Daily Star on line Jimmy revealed that a whopping fifty six percent of people who are polled said they would have intercourse\nWith a sex robots\nHe said quote I posted three photos of harmony including a description directly below that read quote Hi I'm an anatomically correct sexually capable robot but the most advanced AI available I'm On tinder to find out if guys are interested in me unquote\nAt first glance the sex robot looks like a real person\nWhich Jimmy credits Matt and his team for their hard work and making them as lifelike as possible\nAnd they actually do show or one of the photos here from this ah sex robots tinder profile it says she's Twenty one or her name is harmony and she does look kind of like your typical you know basic tinder girl are essentially you know plenty of makeup on\nA and I don't know if you guys have spent much time on on tinder jumped and you've got a girlfriend or at the moment for an engineer not spending any time there but were you on their previously I well yeah\nSo then you can you can kind of relate to this or that there's constantly pictures on tinder of women who use filters on their face now\nI don't know what the guys do 'cause I don't look at the the guys on on tender maybe they do the same thing but you know where they'll have like the dog ears the dog knows that they have like the animal filter face and then there's the other face filters that kind of stretch or squeezed uh the face of features in ... in certain ways you know it's like\nYou already have a platform here where the people on his platform do not look real [laughter] so yeah if you're on tinder and all of a sudden you see this picture of this robot\nShe actually looks I mean you know the lighting all that I'm\nLooking at the picture but I mean I can tell you I'd be swiping left on a robot\nOh yeah me too me too I'm just making the comment that I think she fits in on tender I think that you know at a glass or what if people are just looking at how quick do you go through these yeah when you're going through pretty fast\nI'm betting she's getting a lot of slave rights just because guys are swiping right not knowing not reading the actual profile and then find real\nQuestion is how many super likes\nIs now the super like is where you swipe up word and then that person gets ...\nPresumptive to assume the sex robots gender just because his ... or or a\nPresent as female [laughter]\n[laughter] so ah anyway that what they're saying here is apparently the the profile when he's using the profile showed a swipe right on everybody which means that anybody to ride on her gets an incident that\nHas a great piece of art art project that was done many years ago and then there was first becoming a big thing that was like a an actuary or is that what spin that had a class to it a ...\nIt's like a an actuary or is that what spin\nThat had a clearance to it a piece of a like a stick a piece of beef and ah it was placed over a phone so that would rotate and to be flip flop down on the phone creating the electrical connection and swipe right [laughter] it's just an art\nThese are it's just a piece of meat swiping right over it and it having a respected profile or they did I think it might have yeah and it was just a pain you know it just keeps swipe and right\nNow I imagine somebody reports those things at some point maybe but anyway going on here at first glance the sex robot looks like a real person a and then it says here in the second picture Jimmy used an image of harmony with her head open to reveal the computer brain so anybody that looked closely at the profile would notice that this is actually a robot\nBut I bet you a bunch of do just swipe right on this just the first picture and then got matched then found out they matched with a robot he says I ran the experiment for two hours on a friday night from nine to eleven PM on the lower east side of Manhattan\nYou explain to Daily Star he said I swipe ... a swipe right every guy that came up in the two hours I ran the experiment harmony racked up Ninety two matches Jimmy added that quote the real experiment though it was when I replied to everyone that harmony matched with one simple message one question\nWould you have sex with a robot yes no or maybe when the film director asked the question he received a range of responses with one guy saying you were discussing another person's said F. yes you're the coolest individual I've ever matched year well a third wrote F yeah get with the times [laughter]\nHave the fifty seven people twenty five of them said they wouldn't have presumably a fifty fifty something people responded because getting more than that match\nA twenty five said they would not have sex with a robot Seventeen answered yes and Fifteen replied maybe this means fifty six percent of data is claimed they would consider having sex with a sigh board now to be fair it's fifty six percent of them\nWho swept right and so we don't know how many people swipe left is not exactly a scientific study not intending to be but it's you know it's interesting\nHe says when I got permission to use harmony from Matt in March he said he hadn't put the dull on any dating site so I think this is the first and still the only time a sex robot has appeared on a dating app he said talking about the amount of attention to sex robot received on tinder\nThat said I was curious about how much response she would get the poor Jimmy conducted the experiment you told the creator of the robot and he was hoping to see what sort of response is\nThat the dog would receive so that's the story and I just thought it was kind of interesting because the whole topic of sex robots that's come up here on free talk live on a few different occasions the Daily Star seems unusually obsessed with it they're constantly writing stories as a sex robots\nOr promoting these companies and the most recent one was the Houston or the there was a guy who wanted to open up a sex robot brothel gray in Houston and apparently the city of Houston has actually prohibited\nA sex with robots now\nAs far as in a brothel is concerned\nThere is a a show based out of the u._k. called the humans um that's a sigh fi about a\nRobots becoming service you know since actually you know him and so it's almost like um [noise] if you've ever seen the matrix a\nSeries of videos um where there's a transitional period between um you know human like robots and the robot uprising that became the matrix of anyone see the matrix movies where humans are enslaved by robots I\nThought well this show humans are sort of like ... would be one of those in between faces and there are some Russell robots in that show does
