credit\nWelcome well well thank you thank you for having me a founder do so there were many found was that one of the founders wonder wearing a very fancy jackets so you look very important you got like just super silvery kind of jacket on I Love it\n[noise] so so the jak it actually has been a bit of the mainstay at this point conference here we go to we try to you know out swag you know the our thoughts are flashy than everybody else is is working so far to bring my shoe this time\nOr they also silver ... they're actually blue and light up in different colors and react to music therapy pretty ... oh my God how do you get those oh\nSo that that is actually the actual the only trade secrets to grab that as we can all be out swag\nAmazing so did you decide not to make new bottle openers that way they wouldn't outlast your new company the wall so I I'm actually hoping that he currently going to be around for the next couple of decades but ah but yeah\nBottle openers is one thing that we have not bad but he's a ... a\nOkay so bring bring us up to speed Tikrit I'm new to it honestly I just heard I mean not not that I hadn't heard of it before but this week I'd heard that you guys put a proposal system out and I'm like okay well let's take a look at this thing and see what the credit all about I mean there's a zillion crypto currency is what makes the Critz special\nAlso what really sets it apart is governing system so and it is the topic is really heating up in the uh you know the clip of currency is you're right 'cause a lot of folks talking about it and it means different things to different people but I'm much from it you know to be\nWhat it really brings to you if you implemented ride is longevity so with ... you can have a very long term investment horizon a because we are going to be able to do with the future because of this a governance system doesn't make sense so that's really what sets us apart is is the ability to be around for the next decade or two\nOkay so unfamiliar with governance systems in that are free talk live has been sponsored by dash in the past uh and dash I don't know if they were the first but they might have been the first they were the first one to roll out one like that I Believe more Marco actually said that he may have started on his before that [noise]\nUh they you know they were on this thing out and in the in their system it's only the master and how do they call them which are the people who have a thousand dash tied up in a in a note which is a lot of money you know it's over a hundred I think over a hundred thousand dollars cash or whatever it is\nAt the moment so the average person its way out of their race right now I mean it would have been within the average person's reached\nPioneers yeah when it when it first last one you know it was a senator or whatever for her dashed but now it's impossible to get involved in that and so there's about forty five hundred of these mass roads and are they all get\nWell to get involved in that and so there's about forty five hundred of these mass ... then they all get on and they argue with each other over what you know people should be spending this money on\nAnd it's a result into show you've been a sponsored movement in your lungs are for about two years now I mean it took about a three month break for a little while but other than that you can and you know we're proposing something as well to dash and it's been tough like even though we were on for a year and\nYou know we've got almost two hundred radio stations that we can basically sell the advertising for\nThe costs they pay for maybe one radio station and they're ... they're just you know they're not into it for whatever reason I say I am I'm it's beyond me why I mean I Know like what we do a little bit beyond just advertising as we you know hit the road and were there and and really being part of it but where we're not doing that yeah I mean I'm wearing a hat right now so what or\nHelp us get every baby of lightning so the more babies\nCan come home only learn how to march of dimes dot org [noise]\nThis is talk live Collins all free agency five four fifty free that's eight fifty five four fifty free\n[noise]\nDanny Says some from the crypto show show dog owner if their show to cut that close to her you know how to your show dot com you should know how to use the microphone always better as a little different\nThough and that you guys are actually right next door to us as usual you should cut your\nAh your system down I'm ... I left it in Vegas I just want to carry it on the plane her normally you get all these fancy like arms and every now and you always outdoors and it's like oh you finally like a free talk lifestyle yes so anyway the show's great show and you guys are still weekly correct yes okay\nI'll be sure you check them out and also check out liberties stickers other great Austin based company if you want to

check out the vast selection of witty poignant pits the down right bombastic liberty oriented messages\nOver at liberty stickers dot com or the marketing of Sudan ours skin I Believe it or the tough or Marco pure boom is with us from the ... or ... what's the website ... out or go to uh go there and check out the credit it sounds like it's getting pretty exciting we were just getting into atomic\nSwaps which is a topic we've never really I don't think discussed in any detail here on free talk lived up keep in mind mark hope we do a general audience radio show I don't really talk about these crypto concepts we ought to do our best to try to communicate them to people who are like new to bitcoin rights and they're not they don't know how much change work and\nYour own ... still good [laughter]\nSo uh so uh so the idea of the atomic swap is to cut out the middleman as you're talking about with these exchanges which you know I mean they've offered a valuable service they've allowed people to until this point trade crypt those but unfortunately they've been hacked\nAnd they've lost people's money and there have been millions of dollars worth of crypto lost because of these exchanges to bad people are so if we can cut them out then let's cut them out so how is it that I mean what's the magic behind atomic swaps how does it work to where I can exchange you were saying like calling for was credible\nSays one of the parents that we have the buffet Fifteen bears up there so I'm going to a theory and by the way these are all between one another race was not just ... it's it's you know if you want to do miss going through a theory and then also runs through our code so people can use ... to do that so and whenever\nA new project show up and say hey would you guys mind adding us we can do that you don't just bring the goat book will mergers and then you can become apparent with everybody else has already on the system\nSo is this different a centralized exchange\nWell so this is actually centralized exchange done a lot of BS going on about that in the in the world is what people call things ... ... ... and they really are not broadly are um they make it sound like they are but I like a token sitting in the middle business literally person to person\nThis business intermediates everything and it is secure because you run a smart contracting both changed mhm so um and if you don't fill in your parameters correctly be contract is not going to execute so you're not going to lose your um\nYour crypto currency and it'd be the counter party does something wrong again the contract will not execute enough when nobody's going to lose a\nClear value so you're back in charge a at your own Chris Tucker and so you can exchanges with whomever I'm On the world you just have to agree on a price so the the ... and execute so\nHow do you find the buyer if I Want to sell if I got you know a light Klein and I want to get ... you know normally you just go on an exchange and then there's a market there and there's ... and there's you know five and how do you connect with this other person myself so that\nIs actually be the complexity honestly in in the entire system so currently literally or you need to find somebody who who wants to do this with you so one of the proposals that actually has been gone up on the on a bigger proposal system is how do we do price discovery right how do we hook people up and he wants to do this\nHow do we do price discovery right how do we hook people up that he wants to do this\nWithout a compromising their security and and that's actually what we've been working on on a system to\nBasically do price discovery and a and actually execute trades between a boat from all over the world and we're trying to do something along the lines of you know the the last couple of the ... the ... to ... mental where people just basically put the beds and asks\nAnd you match 'em up and you execute and they're putting them where ... is not going to be as much as\nHe was going to be cereal potentially right so you you broadcast to the network the ... the network picks it up keeps within you know memory really to network\nTo like be what I learned that snap or credit going to create its own decentralized a real sorry about a real real decentralized then there is again and again people are going to actually have to run their own oh I'd like to do with it would be credited with bitcoin you would have to run your your\nBe centralized exchange note is enough people do that then can also not be stomped out right and then you get the same\nUm benefits so we're trying to basically mimic the way uh you know getting the credit of bitcoin works today but with exchanges resolutions to set up transferring value you what transferring a or ask some business and you know try to hook people up interesting so\nWhere would I go if I wanted to learn more about that particular project\nSo that particular project is highly and development at this point so we're still designing it will figure out all the the the kinks but I'm actually if you go to the ... and there is a ... channel where this stuff is being debated actively today so if you want to involve you want to ride go we want to help out done\nOn this has happened and this is being built now has always been that would be a great tool for Venezuela or somewhere like that where the government might try to get in the way they would have a really hard time doing it you can stomp it out such that's essentially what we're trying to get to write which is one of the ... another problem with the decentralized exchange not only can\nIt be targeted by hackers that they can be targeted by governments\nAnd we want to cut out all of those right I'm old Arnold factor\nSo it's a big red has a mission to cut out all the rents are spreading all the middlemen I don't know it's all about\nA ... language Marco I like to be to be the thing for us that's that is really one of the things that actually you know let's call it a religious leader ... who is you know enabling people to become sovereign and do their own a release their own lives the way they want to\nStop or announce another where this guy's got all the uh the good good good lung gave him the free tough have handled before he came over here [laughter]\nSo I mean I'm definitely interested I mean I Want to know more when this when this decentralized the real decentralized exchange that you're talking about here will offering these atomic swaps\nWhen that becomes the thing I mean we definitely want to talk about the middle east is fed coin ah well I won't show up and go sure which one which one is fed point there is a field [laughter] so so you can't\nDo that right oh so it cannot be a ... exchange no but no you can't do it it's got to be critical currency [noise] um no actually the thing to realize here do is there's no money for us in this right in the because we are actually actively cutting out one of the rent seekers so there is no money this ... this is going to become a voluntary thing to run do service\nYeah well there's no money directly but I mean over time if you can cut out of the alliance right for the bigger project there's no money to be made we want to bribe the software and disrupt the system right well that's what I'm saying it's not a direct reward but over time if you can cut out the middleman then everybody gains for short if you look at it yeah on the line but again so we don't have a financial what does it all this business you know\nLet's call it did not religious ... we we have to do this absolutely it's a calling yeah it is a group called\nA little bit [laughter]\nWell I'm Glad you came on free sock live here because I think you know we found a good match and\nI'm looking forward to hearing more about the ... in the future of course like you said the proposal system and stuff now do you credit dot org ah you guys have your own wallet I Know it's in ... as well\nAnd are you guys are on some exchanges I'm sure the big ones right really we just don't listen to finance now just now days ago that was interesting story yeah we did a ... fee so it took a long list in July on merit basically I like doing excellent congratulating Margo had some uh racy pictures of a ... you know I ...

I say all of our marketing and focus has been on the new app edge to edge wallet and ... will Airbus is not as actively support also update it with a few fixes here and there\nBut for the most part you'll start seeing especially going into twenty Nineteen but that will stop supporting major updates to that so really will recommend people start transitioning over to a Dallas\nAnd if you are if you had the Airbus while at which was the best\nI think all done quite a while and um then the stain log in works for ed so there's actually no I'm transitioning oh that'd be raising an edge it allows you of course to use more than one crypto currency Airbus was bitcoin only now you've got several it's actually quite a bit of your future him an arrow in there recently which was a surprise\nYeah in June ... both narrow it acts are piece of ... to the complete polar opposite of that or is this your first we're going to have one and then the other and more like you know let's has to do such as I go both and just show that you know like we can we can do all the experience but yeah we had been arrow in there\nAnd when it was kind of a big deal because they're really can't do that right there hadn't been a mobile ... narrow wallet of any notes\nYeah there were a community apps basically by the ... community that supported no other crypto is the narrow we're the first name and the only especially at the time and definitely novel that supported marrow and anything else so is the first opportunity for people to have a lot\nOf the war with them in areas that they could do things like shapes you between or have the ability to buy from you know make a credit card because we had all of the features and they're already so it was a great addition for the\nJust the general space her from a narrow\nAnd you were just telling us right before we went on the air here that uh it was actually at Texas bitcoin conference when you guys officially launched edge yeah but it was so we're launching debate it that you're gonna work it was exactly a year ago so we launched edge as there were three branches of company\nWe also launched edge wallet as a made a product of the time and we went into full released in February of this year and so even if all released Africa\nOver half a year ago which was the last time I saw yeah that was was that I could poke around that time or whatever and it was around like Valentine's Day that we had launched into full production and they are good times at our ... that is a great conference we're looking forward to going there again next year you guys uh it was as well or ed secured a deal but you've got a better you are oh no\nThey had actually as to edge thought out you know the the ...\nThat tell these just went out and we got an email back

free\n[noise]\nWe've been here every time it's been great\nAlways meeting new people and see an old friends are as well so we bring you a sampling of what it's like to be here talking to some of the more interesting vendors and there's a bunch of 'em here and then of course some of the speakers\nOld friends that we've seen a million times and all these different ... conferences like Francis is a new face or to me and was talking with one of your co workers at fracking minor and like your the c._e._o. of this ah what sounds like a mining company what are you guys do it's a ...\nThanks for having me on a very nice to meet you as well fracking miners platform that we developed so our company is actually distributed ledger and\nUm we're actually based here in Texas and not really [noise] so\nWe as a company\nBought into the bar Chan crypto currency world and you wanted to be involved so we started mining ourselves runny nose road getting involved with projects\nOver time built a platform internally to manage all our stuff you know our our nose in our mining and they\nReally kind of a light bulb eventually went off that\nWe built a platform that no one else had so\nWe decided we needed somewhere to release it and we chose this conference I'm\nAlmost a year ago okay so where are you at the previous a conference or\nHow we just did some research on orange conferences when we thought were attacked us based company ... this was a good place a great opportunity Austin's really help and all and you know so we thought our our fracking minor guy was also hip and cool so he fit right in here\nNow where does the Alabama's fit in because you're the guy was talking to before was from their mobile area in Alabama and he made it sound like you all were also based in Alabama\nI personally went and the little town called pharaoh Alabama okay and I have an office and another company are with our headquarters and Daphne, Alabama\nRight but so we have offices in Texas and Alabama and Florida and and it goes into al yeah were you know south east\nSo a fracking minor I mean you guys have a big display here a fancy graphics semi what is it that are you guys bring to the table obviously there's a zillion for mining companies so what's different\n[noise] so we are\nFrom an enterprise world [noise] so\nI had to us it's about sufficiency scale ability and then something that someone can actually use\nRight so what I personally got involved in ... um I was very interested in the hardware and mining and watch it at work and I spent a lot of time compiling software figuring out what hardware actually did what and testing different things and I mean you should say in my basement with all kinds of stuff\nYou know my wife was like what are you doing\nI'm actually found a guy that worked at intel and he had written some code that worked on a special processor for mental ... by\nSuzie I'm five are very very good a parallel processing because it has a very fast memory built on board to the processor show doesn't have to go outside of the process or to do the calculations so turns out it's super fast super efficient for um\nAnything this memory lock like white men arrow like have a low key kryptonite corrupt and are they going to [noise]\nWe took this and we we purchased quite a lot of servers ourselves and put them in one of the data centers that we operate in Montgomery, Alabama and\nJust started building a platform\nOver time that platform turned into the fracking minor says man now we're in a position where\nWe can sell a server club the that's it's tested is a Christian and it's got the operation to someone and\nYou know we can sell it to an end user it's very very scalable all they have to do for you to end it connects are clouds and then you create your account you're registered to servers that assures and your account\nAnd then you tell her what to do so in a lot of the coin you want a minor yeah man um [noise]\nSo we have some features like automatic mining white water reminding so you can just automatically told drop your servers into\nUm a group that automatic and we'll mind the best thing based on our ... profitable or [noise]\nOr if they're there are some different parameters you can set the whole point of it is so you can make business decisions and no longer have to try and make technologies decisions that that that matched with your business\nThere have to try and make technologies decisions that that that matched with your business decisions\nHunters may cause a so when you're studying up on a crypto currency mining operation it's kind of a a technical process right areas you know you've got a a usually there is some sort of a command line interface you got to use and I've done a little bit of it myself so I have some idea about what this is like\nAlso use the online mining pools but you still have to know where to connect to and there is some there's some steps involved so what you're saying is your simplifying you're taking out some of those steps making it more more graphically pleasing for a more of an like an administrative type who's not really\nNeuro is that what you're doing\nYou got it man so anyone that wants to be involved in the business can utilize our platform\nAnd it's tested this fast is sufficient [noise] pet pet supply foreign built so\nAnyone can scale right um so just like you said like if you're running if you're running one server to servers are a couple of basics or whatever you're writing [noise] that's not that hard to manage well ten twenty fifty a hundred thousand\nThat's a whole game trying to manage all that stuff right oh that's why we built is extremely scale I mean it could scale the tens of thousands of machines\nHum and with a simple interface that you can run on your phone\nNow one of the biggest challenges in in mining I've known a few people who've tried it and they fail a one of the biggest challenges is you kind of got to keep up with the Joneses right like there's constant upgrades going on because\nYou know when more people enter mining it makes the difficulty increased and this is one of the way that the ... for listeners who aren't familiar with the process to more people that enter the more difficult to mining becomes which means you've got to have more powerful computers in order to hopefully find these blocks so you can get a mining rewards [noise]\nI mean how often you have to keep buying new equipment like if I buy a server from you guys coming back six months\nLater or you know how often you have to do that so\nThe server platform that raising here's our first generation of hardware and we expected to last probably five years really\nWith the speed and efficiency and what is doing and then what the recommendations that we make on the west to mind trading um\nAnd so we're taking a lot further than just mind\nSo we have we have analyst says a company that are on board that are constantly [noise] they're monitoring the different projects were working at stuff or recommending to to our\nInternal teams into our clients liking what they should be mining and more we feel are good products to be involved and\nAnd you probably know is that if you get involved in something early on and that's a great project going to be that I really love her murky and have and I think they're excellent projects to you know and we started mining them early on and burned quite a lot as a company I'm\n[noise] very cool so fracking minor and the website was what fracking minor a calm down [laughter]\nSo folks and go over there they can get involved again it's you know I've always seen mining is kind of a high risk thing that people you know really need to be understanding that there's [noise] there's a lot of competition and the space right like it's not an easy space to get into but it sounds like you guys are trying to make it a little more simple for we're\nRunning an entire division or a company also that says that we generate from our own mining operations kind of a ... and all we're doing is taking naps\nAnd giving it to someone else so they can utilize and do the same thing\n[noise] very cool Francis the thank you very much for coming on free talk live really appreciate your time today we're here at the Texas bitcoin conference and are still not too late for you to

right right so whereas when we were at this conference last year less than half of one percent of ads that managers were in ...\nOkay now this year five percent are going to be in ... and if they're going to nine thousand and ten fold number yeah that's right and let me go and goes to like say go even something modest pretty crazy like eight thousand mhm gate the number of that the measures that are going to need to start moving in that I start moving up rapidly and write\nSo those five percent if they're in and I are you talking about their own um after I got off by what they're meant\nTo be an asset managers that are out there so\nI'm ... I'm going to apply with our men of the of asset managers that are out decay so those five percent um you know see an increase of let's say from six thousand to a thousand they're going to see an increase of\nA three thirty three percent and they see that kind of increase it then bumped up the performance of their overall portfolio than the other asset managers are like oh I Can't believe I missed out on this I mean this would have been a great opportunity fired swelled up higher but I mean\nOr or I ... I have to get in or I'm fired\nMm right well that's how they're gonna feel yeah and so crypto IQ is going to hopefully be there or go to to learn\nSome other stuff rebel crypto IQ is designed for both you know the common man\nAnd for the institution but it's mostly for the common man to understand\nBig picture all the things that we just talked about this narrative right this is reaching the average crypto investor via Twitter\nCorrect so Charlie wants professional stuff out there um you know where we give people not only the latest and greatest like a professional understanding of what's going on\nSo is a I mean what how do you guys make money heh crypto IQ or their subscriptions as free as are free level they there's a couple\nLayers I think there's like a thirty dollar a month description mhm\nAnd then there's like three hundred dollar a month like more sophisticated chat room for traders so you know if somebody wants to know what's going on right now our habits has a specific question [noise] you know that's the way the more sophisticated trading crowd\nIs coming in [noise] um and then they're they're working on spreading the business model out we've been the NBC has picked us up we're doing we're doing work with the money show okay during some commentary like talking I'd kind of stuff are\nReally I think they're looking at sort of like almost syndicate us really have all the talking heads on a regular basis that school um we're going to do the original experiment in Vegas on November fourteenth [noise] what's that uh uh the crypto competent OK okay added John ... and Charlie will be there okay and\nUh that's going to be that's when they're rolling out\nYou know how to understand crypto [noise]\nAny contacts like stocks bonds asset managers etc [noise]\nFeel noble from crypto dot I.
