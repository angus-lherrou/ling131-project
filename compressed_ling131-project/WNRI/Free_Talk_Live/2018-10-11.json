O. B. R. Y. dot I owe or we're going to tell you more about that here but I Want to make sure I give credit to any\nPoor sponsoring talk live we're at any pay global headquarters uh yesterday here in downtown port Smith\nHanging out with Derrick Jay Freeman who I just saw walk in with his partner Steve in a few moments ago you can go to any paid on global if you want to get started on accepting crypto currency you're hearing us to talk about how great it is to be able to go out and spend crypto in real life well you can help make that happen where you live\nIf you're a retail owner or manager if you're somebody who is in the world of actually selling things in real life\nOr you can use any pay and make it super easy for your customers to pay you with crypto currency yeah they got big point they've got dash acceptance we just found out then cash Roseanne rather it was just launched correctly on the ... platform and I think the cash and like why corn are also available and there's I'm sure more coming up with just we don't know what they are\nAnd ah so go to any paid on global it's super easy to get registered user name and password you're in you put your crypto addresses in the back in and then you load the apple on your point of sale device that's it I mean we're talking about ten minutes\nThat you know to get this set up and I think Adam's expensive though no that's right and it's free for the merchandise or you get actually get to keep a hundred percent of everything that gets sent you it's really great I recommend it and he paid off level so um library\nWe of course have talked about library before here on free talk live and published an article or two about it over freaking dot com\nLike live and published an article or two about it over freaking dot com specifically when library\nUm became the a decentralized mirror for is a freaking videos that we've had on YouTube for years uh over nine hundred videos were imported by library into your system tell our listeners first Jeremy what is library you know in ... to the elevator pitch\nDeath row and I mentioned that that nine hundred of we recently crossed over five hundred thousand or out mostly videos available on the network but not all that is why I so I guess I should explain what what we're doing the yeah\nThe library is to create a a a decentralized digital content marketplace which is kind of a fancy way of saying we want\nServices like you know an Amazon Video or a YouTube to exist but in a protocol based fashion so in a way that there's not a company controlling the system there's just an open set of technologies that's powering an end to end\nSo anyone in the world can publish something the a a\nR technology anyone else in the world can access it and that system works and to and including modernization without any single authority any single point a failure\nMonitors Asian meaning that somebody could charge for access to their video correct and it's hosted by just decentralized so it's it's hosted by multiple people on this this network is it people now the way it works right it's where if you select a video to watch it downloads and\nThen you become basically a a seat to the network right correct\nThere's so there's a between like aspect to it where people who are acting that content or also participating in the network\nIt that the network is not entirely dependent on just this end user consumer usage there are there is also an ability to sort of participate in a more um let's say industrial role where you're just acting as a host and maybe a contributing a lot of space and bandwidth ah yeah is there a\nRole I like so I Know in a lot of crypto systems there's you know this term of a master node um is that sort of the other like that no no so what does um are they getting any kind of rewards for that or is it just like we want to contribute so here's all this disc space and ...\nYeah so this is um this is one well for your audience this concept will probably come naturally that this is one that I sometimes ah sometimes struggled to to get 'em\nBuilt around right that the that the price of data in libraries that by the price of the market right so the data is a commodity so there's not a fixed price there's not an necessarily even a known price right\nWe can expect it to be cheap right it would be really surprising if we went to the store tomorrow and all of a sudden bread was fifty dollars alone we but we kind of have a sense of what that price is going to be but there's not a\nIt set by the market's up by the laws of supply and demand\nSo this has been a a success from what I can tell I mean you're talking about five hundred thousand a piece of media available on this this platform memory or you're pretty satisfied with the times has gone so far I never saw that are just getting there at\nNight yeah we are just getting started I mean that's the truth like it's it's like if I Would say it's encouraging right like it makes me want to do more it makes me want us to grow more but there's still so much more to do it on a thousand is nothing I I Want a billion items law library\nAll right yeah like what is your to get five hundred thousand a day or something like that and\nOther yeah where where where we're on a path like the technology is working it's getting better every day like I'm very happy with the progress that we've made but I wouldn't say that I'm satisfied with where we are\nSatisfied with participation people are actually getting involved they're excited about it it didn't fail yet\nYet I still like last week I think um that we had more than thirty thousand unique a people and it's also talked attract advertisers up your turn off track of good which case we don't do\nAh but yeah at least thirty thousand people used to that were clustered\nYou've got a nice looking G. U. I. interface graphic you graphical user interface that people can use that the bail bond windows it's available on Linux where else\nAre available on Android now a beta or do you do have to have your play store like set to the show you beta software I bet you find that if you if you do that a and we're actually going to do a Web version maybe that will be ... by the end of the Aristotle B.

guys want to\nLike a franchise the bitcoin shot because I just think the ... the coolest thing and it's so cool it was so cool to just sit in there and watch you know complete strangers walked through the door and just start asking questions about going on all day long was what they are they would do this and they were like you know what would be better\nInstead of a franchise in the few guys started your own bitcoin embassies in Kenya and I\nActually is a really great ideas that worked so Chris here who you've just met for the first year I'm Jeffrey he's a the proprietor at what's called route one local goods yep and that's like a little gift shop in Keene where we sell things like\nNew Hampshire crafty kind of like New Hampshire made crash right things that are pretty much may within about fifty miles so we may have some stuff from Massachusetts or from Vermont or localized but physical epic basically yeah there you go\nUh and so you know we already had a space that a sharp ... church which I'm involved with a bad purchased a few years ago and so they rent that that space I'm into decided you know what let's take half the space take a route one when local goods part and

the free state block chain\nDigital assets conference you could come on over here we got bumper stickers we get there James victimless crime spree uh\nDVDs and great guest Jeffrey Tucker who's here at the end and Chris in a remote studio on the number one of the two days chock full of great crypto related speeches and topics and ah Jeffrey Tucker what were you talking about I caught some of your life I was talking about the ultimate foundation of block same technology and\nAnd they the the history of it because I think we can get distracted by the ups and downs in the market thinks it's tedious and boring and and you know this is two thousand aids has been a tough year for for ... tough year prices declined to okay that's a tough year if if you told me four years ago that\nYou know the market is activated capitalizing vitamins right now it just that you're on science so but it doesn't matter how how high the price goes ... be incredulous will still not believe for sure uh you can add ... you know one zero to zero three zero to the existing market cap and as the critics would not believe it and\nSo anyway I talked about that contact a little bit of a socio psychological elements of the ... price and then the uh the uh\nHow ... blocks and technology relates to our aspirations to document ownership claims and and provide Providence and a lot of trails and history has talked about I have to say this about this conference is a really nice relief after going to all these conferences with two three four thousand six thousand people laugh and then everybody\nOn stage given their crazy new products you know over ten minutes you know with with with Brigham fancy power plants and and buy papers and it's like too much\nFor being here we've got a lot of stakeholders in the industry and a lot of really nice people in it or it's more of a peak conference and I feel like we're going to get more it's much more intimate I like I Will you should be willing to pay more money to come to it and actually I'm more horrible it's actually it's actually a lot of\nHorrible but you should be willing to pay like twice as much as your paper I don't know what a North American become uncovered them but I wasn't as big high end ... go consensus conference was I think like three thousand dollars to it\nThey had like four thousand people start doing it they only pointless becoming here it is it's a small conference of just tremendously knowledge of ... people everybody was really nice and you can have actually get to know people and I have a really nice [noise]\nHow do I say intellectual a experience here\nAnd I can't say that probably every one of those ... it's a real complement you weren't at the last one where you know\nThis is my first one I mean there's so many ... you know I got like invitation to things that you know they all day and I talked to everybody wants to do your sweet but when I came to this one is that it is close by my off by which I mean three hours away but I knew that I could fly into ... of\nThe Boston are heading Manchester Airport and that just drive here it's like an hour and then I could just drive to my office and then\nI have to drive them to Albany 'cause I'm going to um I guess Bermuda next week or something like a nice name for gas\nSo we were talking about the er the embassy the bigger an embassy in Atlanta with you open up in January of this year I'm In its hosting a different events that you talked about the so sort of a wind event that here we have like free events and paid about so many of them that we are both of the relationship is that we\nWe have this weekly cocktail party or how the cocktail party would have people there and sometimes we have other free events and we've had as many as three hundred people there\nAs he was Fifteen you know three hundred yeah that was for our our our launch launch party like three hundred people there there was a madhouse there was really great how big is the space of\nOurs was what we did is we rented a booth space in one of those ... that that can we work I don't know if you're familiar with that I hear that are the U.S but uh yeah and so we got a fourteen person office and that we work ah have so that works really nicely for for a co working space 'cause there's a lot of people working in the ...\nUh blocks in industry who live in Atlanta\nBut don't really have a office to go to him right so they come and work there you know a throughout the week so we probably have a total of twenty twenty five people that that chair the fourteen percent off as them you know just on a rotating basis and they all get ... we were cars and they come and go so I'm\nBut when we have three hundred but then we go to the common areas that we work itself as sometimes\nThen we have three hundred but then we go to the common areas that we work itself\nRight as sometimes have to spread over two floors but with an adaptable space and this is your thank God for free enterprise I we figured out how to have these co working space is\nSo you only need to temporarily other people can use it at other times is what you're saying the well the larger space yeah the larger space right anybody who is part of the ... can use the largest space as long as you know you commit you either have to register for it and that sort of thing you knew reserve the time\nAnd you don't have to pay for it I don't know yeah so it's sort of works out economically that we rent the fourteen person office all the time\nBut then we have access to the pull off post and with that comes really math community so and so they have beer on tap\nWow and you think wait how does that work how's the work I think that I you know it's it's a mystery right because I like how do you have to have free beer on tap all day all day and not have\nOut and I tell you pay what happened that after we worked\nIt comes down to the if you get too many beers\nBefore or five people are going to look down on the ice that's it has all its self regulating what you're saying the whole mechanism of control that somehow they allocate it yeah it's a little bit like I Do it I Would\nLove to keep keep the beer ... always amazing amazing\nOr a teal bitcoin embassies out or or you can go to learn more\nAbout the Atlanta bitcoin embassy you also mentioned that you're involved heavily with the American Institute for economic research we didn't give the website so I Want to make sure we have a a yard or ... or is\nIt like a believable amount the researchers sometimes I think it's\nLike an article this morning by Mike moon gr and it's in the history of the relationship between craving storage platforms are between ... between throwing goods or services and creating platforms for the more\nUniversal distribution of those goods and services so I think I forget what I called and I figured I'd call it the kind of a revolution of platforms his original title was storage versus platforms and he goes through like the history the Sears catalog that Amazon and ... things that I don't remember catalogs yeah\nAnd I like catalogs were actually an amazing thing we're all thinking about this or do this you had to go to a physical place and they had their stuff now you have a catalog that can distribute more common so he he he has a kind of in this one article theory of the platform as being an essential tool and the development of prosperity and and\nEconomics of cash in them\nAnd complexity through hundreds of years it's a short article\nIt's pretty high and you have to real slowly but once you get it in my mind on so sometimes I Am a are published and things like a lot of things like this I Know I'm never going to go viral right right so this is not a Twitter economic research yeah\nSo you have to kind of like okay well\nDo you just wanna dumped on everything so that it's you know just to pay frog you know as long as they're\nThis well this is our future [laughter]\nThey were trying to push back on that I\nThank you my survey right arrived some Hi Andrea third said actually requires you to think a little bit of time that I'm not everybody can do about
