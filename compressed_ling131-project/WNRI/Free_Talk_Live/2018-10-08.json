R. N. dot of him and I've been to earn a nice house and I've sat in on his show live from Phoenix\nRight well what he does with his a recording of the show\nIs will a record not just what a what he's talking now while on the air but you also or conversation that are being at a during the break so you guys feel like [noise] back on ... ...\nIf I did that I Would only do it for amplifiers and ... yeah I I I\nI think what Ernie does he connects through something called a ... to the liberty radio network and most of his guest aren't in his studio they're connecting to him via phone call\nAnd he's just sets up his recorder and the heat record at the beginning of his show at nine o'clock eastern and he'd stopped that either at noon or whatever his conversation with the person winds up\nThe ending the conversation which he's had shows go until like one thirty in the afternoon because Ernie likes to talk\nYeah I've noticed that he puts out a lot on an ... like I Can't lift things all the elite elite\nBut you're telling me to go about doing something that you delete [laughter] not\nNot necessarily just like you guys are you guys would that put out\nOr not the same amount of uh like you could put on ... and uh that you normally do with the show it's just that instead a you'd be putting out extra stuff that no one\nNight so basically you want the pod cast to be forty minutes longer and contain a lot of silence\nYeah 'cause that's the thing is that I'm a ... or early talker here in the studio I I\nIt's it's kinda rough for new folks like Laurel were just even looking at stuff on your own laptops or whatever having pretty boring during the banks yeah it's boring on guys aren't\nActually having like other generally were not better now okay so anyway ah to the top\nUm that was like\nUm okay so the topic is what I Would call the unanimous consent are now yesterday you guys were talking about a voting and how your vote doesn't matter which is absolutely true your vote\nDoes not matter because at no point will you ever have a circumstance where your votes make or\nBreak and I'll watch or anything else that map however and before I\nAnd I'll watch or anything else for that matter however and before I ah like for like the profits that this is essentially nothing ... nothing less than like a pipe dream I realize that ... that\nI have to ... you know when you when you start using terms like never I must to point out that I've had two instances I'm In the town I used to live and where I in fact was the deciding vote to different times in one case I was there in one case I wasn't in one case something passed because I wasn't there none other case something\nDidn't pass because I was\nAnd so it's possible if you have a small enough group of people write it when it's a town right teen hundred people and it's a town meeting on a budgetary concern and two hundred and fifty to three hundred and fifty people are in a school gymnasium then it's possible statistically that there might be\nHysterically possible but a very improbable\nRight and this wasn't a fifty ... vote it has to be by a sixty five sixty six percent so that makes a ... a little more likely that you're going to have an effect it has to be only five percent it's even more likely so\nBut but here's here's the so there's like three hundred million America in that in the United states you know what I'm saying\nAround the hundred and twenty yards honestly thought okay you're twenty three thirty yeah and then there are different approaches\nUm lifespan or spinner laid it out very well in a constitutional authority that\nPeople that claims to represent you don't actually represent\nFor numerous rate they don't have our attorney it they they are not responsible for any of the action\nAs enemy he wrote that action or Eighteen\nSeventy back when there was still a mandate I'm having a certain amount of representatives per per\nA certain number of citizens\nUm now they don't write and I'm the only way that that a a so called representative could actually represent you is that everyone um\nIf if everyone had unanimous agreement on who their representatives would be\nAnd then those representatives was you're\nOn the point of that I mean we all know the politicians can't possibly represent us one hundred percent so\nSo the idea I again that's the pipe dream to bear with me on that God but the idea would be that\nUm have you what would be called the inanimate tense and act which would essentially no fight any laws that were passed with out you know consent prior to being put in place\nAnd then uh all other acts or after a or all all legislation after the act think place would have to be passed unanimous consent any uh any votes in the sense that the act or to further acts um\nWould basically put the brakes on things and and it would not be up to\n... or I you know I\nI used to be a Quaker and everything in the meeting house had to be done unanimously and we never got anything done we could never reaching a unanimous decision on anything\nNot to have kind of the point here either to me is that Congress could not pass any laws like the Congress shall pass no law or my five favorite words in the constitution unfortunately there are a bunch of other words that follow that\nYeah there's there's nothing like a\nI'm a big settings for a meeting for business or the Quaker Meeting to uh you know this abuse you of those notions [noise] it it can take a long time to get things done but one would presume if the most August legal minds are in our nation happened to be sending a together in a room that they should be able to come together a unanimously in and make the very best laws are\nRight and and it sounds great higher [laughter]

manner or another but\nYou know like it's a real [noise] it really thrown up your hands and said well there's nothing we can do with this twelve year old if you're sending off to prison there has to be something else they can do anyway Senate bill for thirty nine\nWould keep most kids younger than twelve away from the juvenile justice system unlike Twenty one other states California currently does not have a minimum age limit for juvenile courts which means children as young as five or sometimes prosecuted\nIn a recent op ed supporting SPF for thirty nine Laura ... chief probation officer for Santa Clara county described a ten year old same age as my son\nWho had been detained a juvenile hall for a minor offense the justice system has no place for very young children we had to give him a box to stand on so he could pair out of the window of his cell\nHe couldn't reach the privacy curtain to sell to uh use the toilet\nAnd he felt alone and scared um that we brought him stuffed animals to comfort him\nLast year six hundred and thirty seven kids younger than twelve\nReferred to probation in California mostly for minor offenses curfew violations and misdemeanors that bill on browns' desk would encourage law enforcement to release kids their parents or guardians instead however young children who are accused of murder rape and violence sexual crimes could still be brought to juvenile court\nI presume they should be but I feel like they're so few options for judges out there having been in a in a prison I can say this is a this is like it's not just giving a man a hammer is giving a man only a hammer\nRight and like there's nothing else they can do basically there's prison and nothing else that judges can do they can try you know at home detention but certainly the villain attention facilities anymore you're either a juvenile detention facilities but what is that\nTo prison for young people I mean it's really no different\nRight but it solves the problem of having a twelve year old and locked down next to a thirty year old yeah I\nI could tell you that in my experience um you know the people I talked to I I've never been to a juvenile detention center
