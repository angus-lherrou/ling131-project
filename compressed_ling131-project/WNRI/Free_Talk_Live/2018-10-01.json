Merrick Garland right the Republicans swore up and down that ah they were prohibited from voting ... election year\nThis is how I understand what happened there that came about because of a speech from Joe Biden in Nineteen Ninety two when he was a senator and he insisted that an incumbent president should be the one to pick his Supreme Court nominee and after that they made the Joe Biden\nAnd that was and the and the election year that they were talking about with the presidential election not mid term\nYeah hey I just heard them say you can't vote on judicial nominees daring any election\nYear well um so the Senate is that this August body right and they make they claimed to be so important that they have all those sort of unwritten rules and how senators are supposed to behave with each other and all these sorts of things they're not like iron washed house of representatives\nAs ... as they say I mean really what are they they're just a house of representatives I have no particular claim on any kind of a behavior other than that but that's the idea\nAnd going back to that speech by Joe Biden in Nineteen Ninety two there was not even a Supreme Court vacancy in Nineteen Ninety two\nI guess I heard the speech the other day on another talk show\nWhere he was talking about it\nSo it was an audio he made a speech every day I'm not sure that he made a speech but I Do call it divide and rule and if people have a ... like you know ... if you if you put it ruined place or whatever that might be or suggest to rule and then that rule gets implemented you really can't\nSo um whatever that might be your suggests to rule and in that room gets implemented you really can't argue that it was not implemented the way you wanted to implement it\nA you know it's not called divide and rule okay I'm simply stating that\nWhat he was talking about was not even something that they were facing in Nineteen Ninety two\nI get why the Republicans would choose not to uh you know to confirm nominees or does that close to the end of a a lame duck presidents I'm a tenure I get why the Democrats\nDon't want to see Kavanaugh in office it's politics political games and if they
