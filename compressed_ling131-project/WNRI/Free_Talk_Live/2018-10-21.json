N. I. S. go ahead Steve\nHey thanks for taking my call Yes sir I'm I'm completely with you guys as far as uh as far as like freedom of movement and everything but when I think about that\nYou got to got to think about it within the confines of the store and now because right now we're not completely free we're not we're not in a completely free right now right or give me what I worry about it is is\nIf it's someone undocumented unfair and they go to somewhere where they don't check butter ideas or maybe they're even given the privilege to vote\nThey're not going to vote for freedom\nWoman she's a woman will say that yeah and which party exactly is the Freedom Party on\nWell I Would say neither the freedom\nParty okay but that's how my more harm done so they're basically just like everybody else who's not voting for freedom in that case yeah\nAll right I I I don't I'm just kind of learning about some of the stuff I'm I'm a recovering conservative I guess\nYou okay [laughter] that's okay I'll start somewhere I did too I I've\n... I've discovered is that fewer of voices on the libertarian and I guess you could say ... of the anarchists point of view and I mean it until we live in a in a free says though I mean\nI Would say either of them are for freedom no but it it it would definitely vote for Democrats and ... while those are the more they want to take your freedoms away I kind of theater there is at least right now that there may be a little bit more on a nickel or\nYou know historically what am I this is Sara Lee the case right a lot of migrants from Mexico for instance our Catholic conservatives huge conserved a yeah I Would have been more likely to vote for the Republicans but then the Republicans took the sharp turn towards you know being anti immigrant and so you can't blame somebody for you know\nFinding out about that and being a little turned off and\nThe Democrats I think I've done a great job of demonizing the Republican Party and you know basically saying they hate you I'm than they've done the same thing I think with race you know the the the the Republicans hate you because of your nationality you because of your color and\nIt or it's not our nor did all the Democrats though that did that I Know is the Republican some of the things they say I mean they definitely play ride into that\nI'm I'm gonna say yeah it certainly it is certainly part of the national dialogue in you know I don't think I I don't think the Democratic party I'm really wants to let go of racism and immigration because it's one of those things that they can rile up their base with\nYou know that's that's what riles people up and and I I\nI'm a recovering conservative too so we usually start by saying Hi Steve Hi [laughter] get your coffee and don't weigh end of the meeting does a twelve step program exactly I'll be outside smoking cigarettes later um but I I think you know politics plays into it I mean I think we we tend to down\nBut I I think you know politics plays into it I mean I think we we tend to downplay how how much of an effect it has but even this this immigration issue with all being played out on the national stage\nUm by predominantly Republican spokespeople and democratic spokespeople and they each have their his ... it is it is\nRight people are being used for political gain on both sides of course and they're they're they're hungry and starving and just trying to get across the border so they can make a better life for themselves and these people are taking advantage of that in the meantime both of them see it as an opportunity to gain votes yet painted our cede any other comments go ahead\nI'm I Would just say that\nI mean I Would agree with it but if we were talking about dissolving the U.S government ... lately be one hundred percent for it\nFor hell and yes there you go to the action is an idea whose time has come again thank you for the call Steve I appreciate it or you know I don't really care if you dissolve it or not let's just get out of this [laughter] how\nCan I just leave if enough people only if enough ... you know state governments say All right we've had it this was a an interesting experiment it didn't really work out and you got to be able to admit when something's not working out so you can try something different yeah and this hasn't worked out\nIt hasn't worked out the United states is not a free country nobody says it's a free country anymore you almost never hear that\nA decade ago on the show we get people calling in now and then saying it's a free country it was it then he either or but you don't even hear it anymore stuff for his country on earth the and I just had a Democrat or cameras entertainer sixteen there was a guy out canvassing during the Democrats today are\nHere in Keene New Hampshire was not actually nice and warm out I was on the front porch hanging out here going a little work done and uh do comes up to the porch and asked me if I'm going to be voting and you know got into a conversation with him turns out he's pretty frustrated by both political parties as well and this is the guy who's canvassing for the Democrats\nAre I mean there's a palpable level of disappointment and I think frustration at the very least on the national level with a lot of these ah these major political party people yeah\nAnd I told you about our coffee parties things that we've got going up and and the town that I live in it's basically\nA the idea that you get a bunch of people both Democrats and a bunch of conservative Republicans together in a room and we all practice how to talk nicely to each other [laughter] I'm the token a libertarian in us but really it's it's the idea is to to discuss national issues\nTo a brainstorm ideas and practice civil discourse because civility is really something that's been long enough\nUm but even now it's still going on it's always been like a year and a half and he's always working hundred twelve people showing up getting along and on fighting one another no fights no shooting like I got a good nobody's trying to immigrate\nInto a little communication goes a long way between people we can build bridges find things that you agree on rather than focusing on things you disagree on let's continue like we do here in ... oh let's go to Justin in Virginia listening to W and I are cello Justin\nHey how's it going hey what's on your mind\nUm well\nWhat I say that\nWhen it comes to the border security should be using technology instead of an absurd expensive wall like um\nTell me more what do you mean what kind of technology\nWell like you know how and well around like areas for the one they use sensors ... ... ... people\nAnd I presume I mean I've never been there okay well well that's how they do it I mean here's been documentaries\nI've ... yeah well\n... and things like that if that well the order walk and be defeated with a ladder or tunnel right it's\nJust absurd to build this gigantic brick\nWall I mean you know how long it is a long way away when you get to the Gulf of Mexico\nIt's going to be a government wound dog all it would be a you know they're going to say it's going to cost ... and it's going to cost ten times acts because that's our government does things hang on I Want to bring it back here I just thought of bring it back when I hear more about your ideas for technology because I'm Still not interested in techno police states whether it's a wall police state er techno police state or whatever I'm not interested in that\nArea and if you care about freedom you shouldn't be either

they're they're a libertarian training right now\nAnd I just had like the whole thing and I go we don't need technology um technology and the government really tense around and and I was for evil it is it's more often use to spy on us than it is to defend against the U.S where we keep in mind all the NSA programs\nWere designed to keep us safe they were only to go after terrorists and things like that and then we find out through Edward Snowden that no we're monitoring your communications\nAnd uh I just don't trust them\nI said well there's no need for trust because like\nAll right now there's

have to\nBe\nThat he was the thing you're missing here is when you turn something over to the government right they're going to use it against you and you may I think you're you may think you're
