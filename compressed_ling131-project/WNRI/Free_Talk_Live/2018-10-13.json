it's a rare show where both Christians are actually on the same show together even though they weren't actually goes crazy Eddie lives have every right because you know that that would be a ...\n... we don't want that to happen All right so we got stuff to talk about it's been a few days we've been pretty crypto focus over the last uh Seventy two plus hours here on TALK live yeah times day Wednesday Thursday part of tonight more than maybe more than that but uh\nThe big news which I think all three of us wanted to talk about here tonight normally we can compare notes before we start to show the live show and ah we see if we all happened to bring in the same story or two of us happened to bring in the sense tonight it was all three\nAre different versions so you got one from the LA Times I Do yeah um I have one from the free thought projects\nI've got your PI plus the blog posts from Facebook and everybody has been mentioning\nShould we start with a blog posts from Facebook and just analyze what they have to say because what happened for our listeners Justinian apparently\nThere was a major purge of a bunch of pages on Facebook now pages are these things that they're not your profile your personal profile there some sort of a you know if you like free talk loud has a great age of you have a saying a business or a media show or whatever it is that you want to have a page for\nOr you can do that well apparently you can't have it for whatever you want because they just deleted like eight hundred or something like that\nAre though it was five hundred fifty nine pages two hundred fifty one personal accounts\nWow ... total of eight hundred and ten and one of them was caught block which is a an organization that I've been affiliated with Chris you as well\nUm we've now all of it and I did a search earlier and it appeared that all of the uh state and local affiliate pages of ... block remain active it's\nLikely because they were nothing ultimately as far as like you know they probably weren't even they didn't have enough likes for anybody to have a report them for anything that would be my guest and I'm not having actually audited the list to see you know does any of them have more than a thousand or two thousand lakes or something like that 'cause ...\nThe actual Facebook page had I remember it had more than one point five million at at one point in a few years ago so it might have ... eclipse too I I'm not sure but it was always a very very popular page so they seem to be major pages that had been\nI've yeah I've got a list here I don't want to go ahead and try to love to share some you know so called the ... page was a unpublished\nA free ... projects a page was on both another big one yep the liberty principle though consent from the governor has been unpublished never heard of policing the police has been published legalizing candidates has been unpublished voluntary us a veteran so it's been unpublished and I\nGet out of that and the war on drugs has been unpublished hemp has been on a pile up so hemp\nUh drugs has been unpublished hemp has been on a pile up so hemp hemp\nYeah I mean it seems it it it comes off to me as censorship for political reasons but it's interesting how at least the story I brought in from the LA Times has\nPortrayed it differently [noise] All right well I'm interested in hearing that yeah so it's going to be interesting to see what the ... project I say about all we know what they're going to say about it I mean they're how they're going\nTo loosely uh touched the facts and then put some kind of spin on it because that's what they do it's true and uh the let's\nSee here according to the free time project dot com which is by the way a very you know pro freedom a website that I Know the guy behind it his\nEditor of freedom but find free and I felt like the way they do they're a writing yeah because it as I said it's a very loosely connected to the facts and said\nIf that really any different than uh the LA Times like standard operating procedure for any major publication these days as\nWell\nWhen I get news or I go to you know like large news sources that report the facts just the facts of sometimes they get\nThose wrong yeah sometimes it right but I\nI had to manipulate the fact I'm going to have somebody more\nCredit of trying to get things right with out a very clear bias well free than Russia\nHeading to the thing that they portray themselves as what do they you know yes you know I think he does a better job than most publications is also not a really an bothered by the end times where we've broken news but you can't get your news at free kitten without getting some appear right right okay and I'm not going to say that for\nAll the the people who write for freaking but at least some of the people who write for freaky and I think it has\nA much less biased right up then no for making as biased as hell but at least were honest I mean we're\nAnd I think for a thought projects project they're\nUp front about ... or they're biased but a lot of times they like I said they've very loosely touch the facts and then they come up with a bunch of speculation about the facts\nKind of like info planet Mars or where you know like they might might touch on a fact and then they totally construe it to not be in any way related to reality well look uh\nI'm not a shareholder or something in retail project I think that they're writing isn't the greatest in general like as far as the quality of the writings so I have a similar critique of a ... some of their writers as well yeah right threatened very simply very basic\nUh but I think that I almost feel like they're ... and I've never asked the editor of this and maybe I Will if I see him at an archipelago again\nIs is the site specifically written simple like you know in kind of like targeting in elementary school or because it's a worldwide kind of targeted site you want to be able to have people who are international audiences maybe reading it\nAnd I've heard that or if you're writing for a general audience you know you don't want to right above like an eighth grade love right\nUSA Today is just a you know men noteworthy in the past because they don't read about the seventh grade aren't there aren't any minesweeper is targeting fifth grade\nI'd heard seven for USA Today but that was probably a decade ago so who knows maybe they lowered it to my well my understanding is newspapers tended to target in fifth grade reading level basically\nOr it could very well be in this case or just to be clear though you said there are new sites they don't even use the word news on there about us page so I mean I don't think I yeah but you know maybe it's the people that site them saying very new site yeah oh certainly people would believe that\nThere are definitely one thing for our project is good at good at getting are doing is getting the word out about they're gonna click bait libertarian head of headlines that have you know you can call it click bait and I think there's some truth to that\nBut at the same time they're getting people to click on very pro freedom opinion pieces essentially about the news and\nWhether you agree with how well they're written or not the fact is they are being shared fairly widely although Facebook's going to allege that a bunch of those shares are fraudulent\nRight trying to jump into this Facebook post I feel like we should just go ahead of course we've got so many different news sources on this I Do want to hear LA Times but let's let's hear Facebook and what they're well\nIn a moment when they have to to say about that and of course our phones are open as they always are here on TALK ... except when we're on location as we will last

not not a uh yeah but it's not a bug\nYou can't use this if you don't have crypto so that's the only thing\nIf you've got dollars well you'd better turn them into bitcoin orbit quaint cash because that's the big news is now they can accept bitcoin cash as your deposit currency your deposit crypto over at ... at say the ... All right let's go to your calls and thoughts we got more on this Facebook debacle what you know it wasn't really a debacle is to be expected I mean this is\nPeople are mad about this but a year should have seen this one ... let me say this I hear your family\nOr my thought is you start having I saw it coming with mice so what are you talking about Facebook let let let me say this\nSimply and very clearly don't trust third parties\nBut that's what it really does feel like if you're\nObviously if you're paying for a service mhm like a paying to host a pod cast on SoundCloud or paying for Web hosting\nThen certainly you should run that they are going to provide you with just serve it may be but they they also by the way you're going to come out even if you're paying I'm so ... I didn't say that you know they're going to share your same values yeah\nBut still cancel your agreement yeah but and then with a ... service\nYour product is correct I if you're not paying your the product don't be surprised aware that they wind up you know they give it they take it away [laughter] yeah I think the I think the mistake to only mistake you you might see somebody might make a from what you said is interpreting that as\nIn order to you know get privacy or security or something\nYou have to pay for it and I I I think you have basically if you knew in one way or another yeah I have to pay in time spent by doing the privacy thing yourself or you have to pay by hiring some some case I'm not even talking about privacy I'm Talking about there were these people that were based things you know\nFor the Blackstone tailoring and dry cleaning shop\nA website ... dot com that Dan poll dot com Dan ...\n\nThis is talk live college bowl free they fifty five four fifty free that's eight fifty five four fifty free\nOf the airways here our number is eight\nFifty five four fifty free that's eight five five four or five zero three seven three three yeah it's no fun to rely on centralized platforms which is what we've been talking about here tonight or the Facebook and apparently now Twitter coming in and a swooping into leading a bunch of cats I haven't\nSeen any of the numbers about Twitter yet I did check the or the cop block channel on Twitter which has been a junk channel ah ever since it was sold to whoever it was ... I'm not sure why but the cop block Twitter channel has just been posting like music recommendations\nWhenever whoever it is that owns that channel now like cliques like on a space unlike a Youtube video\nThere's some kind of noticed noticed that goes out saying I like this video on you know whatever and it has nothing to do with police accountability is not like it's liking cop watch kind of videos or anything like that it's just music is so ah but bizarrely\nThe account is still syndicating posts from ... block dot org so amidst all these posts about music videos there is like oh there's a post that he made from you know a month ago I ... I mean\nThat they probably somewhere in their Google Account died somehow either accidentally ... or ... forgot to check the auto share of the things I like I knew to yeah\nSomething like that that definitely would ever happen it's a it's a mess so they didn't take that one down for whatever reason but the take towns are have been major on\nFacebook we read the Facebook excuse a they're a press release about that\nAnd we're going to get into the mainstream media's coverage here in a moment Chris you've got that but first I Do want our listeners to know about liberty dot menu if you are an individual rejects the initiation of force and you agree to abide by the ethics of the non aggression principle\nYou can put your voluntary us ideas into action at liberty dot menu and let other libertarian type you know that you exist that you have a business that you have an event that you have a digital a piece of content that you want to share\nTheirs listings for all of those things just basically a big libertarian business directory based on a map and it works well\nIt works very well in fact and unlike things like Facebook or this isn't some sort of mega corporate company\nIs run by a guy named Patrick and we know him and he lives here in New Hampshire so great so it's you know it's still you can't get away from most websites being centralized right but you certainly get away from them being mega corporate\nCentralized ... sites that have been you know some sucking in all these users and destroying the quality of service that they're offering to them all at the same time\nI'm so go check out liberty dot menu it's a great site it's been on a\nI guess it's been available for more than a year last ... last year during the summer there was every lunch last year right and uh and that was when it really took off and it's been great so go to liberty down menu it's free to use it so there's no reason not to put yourself up there on that site liberty\nDot menu and you can use ... if you like and you'll get a special free chocolate listener batch All right so the LA Times\nMajor um you know mainstream media publication is reporting on his Facebook take down what do they have to say about oh yeah\nAnd I think the story is a little bit of a probably a little bit earlier ... came out I suspect a than some of some of what we've already read so much maybe you should take into account here but Facebook a title is baseball purged over a hundred of the towns and pages ... are pushing political messages for profit is how they've they phrased it\nFits because there is a purge whether they had to do a ... an account for flooding users was politically oriented flooded and flooding that violates loyalty on policy flooding\nNow I Know what flooding is I've been around the Internet for oh yeah I Know what that term is a flooding is when somebody comes into your chat room and just\nStarts just putting in chatter chatter chatter as quickly as they possibly can of just a bunch of characters or a letter you already said that you couldn't do that because it would limit the number of posten such they may not make on Facebook\nOh yeah yeah they'll they'll restricted they'll say oh you look like you're a robot here's a check to make sure you're not a robot or or whatever you're posting too often lead on red like I said a strict I\nKnow people that they've had the ability to share in groups are restricted because they've shared too much according to Facebook\nBecause they've shared too much according to Facebook\nWrite editorials foot Facebook's rules they have shared too much just violating Facebook's role I got was the only way that they can't share bread I got hit with out on ways I was sharing of ways is the Google app or you know reporting like police on the road and you can rent roadkill\nWell here in New Hampshire the squirrels have been going insane world and they have been like running out in front of cars in an insane erratic fashion like more so than normal like you can't travel between\nThat have been several articles that I've seen about the increased squirrel population which is why you're seeing more of them really doesn't have the world's have lost their mind and started trying to run into try like no man they've been raised the air they hire a squirrel population were in the car with\nMe I think when we were going to a liberty Thursday's the regular event here in New Hampshire and there's the southwestern corner\nAnd ... like there were so many squirrels\nThere were squirrels and the way they were behaving was really strange like there was one girl that was more than once grow those actually running down the highway and jumping up in the air and like tweaking out as it was jumping up it's like he was on some sort of drug users on crazy I've never seen that\nHappen before and you cannot go from one town to another in New Hampshire without seeing multiple dead squirrels and it's crazy carrier for between here and are more than that\nI can go for a ride without seeing dead squirrels yeah\nIt's it's crazy we're still predators I guess I don't know why we're talking about it that's great [laughter] ... flooding apparently something foot loudly flooding is where you put your posting too much in an area in which it's not want it right so you put the same post if you're in a chat\nRoom usually it's unrelated to the topic of conversation or the channel or whatever\nCould be but even if it is related to post the same damn thing twenty times in a row your flooding around nobody wants to see that crap you know and if you're following a page on Facebook you have said I Want to see these people's posts right\nNo matter how frequent they are and if they're too infrequent you and find out I get ... ... what ... what Facebook is saying is that people were taking the page post and then sharing them into dozens or hundreds of groups yeah but that's what I'm saying that you're supposed to do on Facebook yeah\nSo they're just saying oh needs to happen\nOrganically right as opposed to just share at one time and then everybody's rattles Eddie at which they won't let happen because they throw out all your post down or you have to pay them and you won't be able to see it that way all about Facebook does say in this thing that the accounts that were removed\nHad been warned about the activities so it's not just out\nOf nowhere and have a a piece on that you want to read\nWell I have the one section or maybe\nSo there's nothing from the free thought project and I didn't think that they would say that don't ... something in there that you said that they all they say here's they didn't give a reason for the suspension okay\nUh we're actually no I think they're referring to Twitter [noise]\nSo yeah it's a it's not clear but regardless even if they're giving out warnings ah this is just more evidence of control on the part of Facebook and what I Would consider to be lame excuses for what they're doing here which is eliminating particular political perspectives based on the claim that older driving people near websites to try to make money that's a bad thing\nOnly Facebook should be able to make money off of your post is what they're saying here they want to keep you on Facebook and any sites that are effectively getting people to leave Facebook are going to get ... like going to leave Facebook on I ... I have to\nWonder is this thing is to do with CNN and other major news I get these ...\nI get these bans do they could have I noticed outside of Facebook became right they do anything you're damn right there are there monetize in those links as well because although I thought you were coming up here are eight fifty five four fifty free like freedom this is talk live\nThe United states that empire is a boost their claims the United states is the empire of the world\n[noise] George Washington had warned us against more and more is your ... space of empire shows the world\nWars one answer relapse England broken its former colonies are us had to save the empire\nWe fight for the deep state began with\nFor United States of empire by James ...\nOf a a little at Amazon Books\nMost of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S what if I told the for fifty four Ninety five a month you could fight against heart disease naturally at heart and body extract we've been helping thousands of people get back\nSo you know to eliminate the problem of having 'em half a dozen big companies that everybody must joining one or more of them in order to communicate with other people\nIf it could be an open source of a code to write these things so that that anybody could create a little you know a I don't know what they call it but I think in creating a\nLittle community that day you can join in and that community can can communicate with a as readily visible to and can communicate with any of the other\nIs it readily visible to act and communicate with any of the other hundreds or thousands or millions of communities out there that have been created that are not exactly that aren't the same\nRight none of that I was actually what lasted on does so mounted on a allows and thank you for the call tonight David I appreciate it or what they do is that's the other terms I brought up so I just I explained decentralized by also mentioned federal and so what that means for my understand is\nThese servers that are running mastodon can decide\nWith whom to federal aid which other servers or they want to allow connections to right and this is this is the part that I was talking about when I said censorship if there's two different communities are a little bit on so represents socialist sets up their own server and social doesn't want to communicate with libertarian see can disconnect\nI Believe you can still communicate individually but not at some other level or something to that effect I think that the some of them if you're disconnected you cannot use the search I think that's one thing like yeah I could search for somebody's name\nAnd it would normally ... show me that if there was a connection between those servers but if there is no connection between the servers then they well like if Chris can't will starts a Nazi mastered on then delivered on server could disconnect from that and you wouldn't see any of those people so they wouldn't have to you know make your experience crappy or whatever\nBecause they just wouldn't be there whereas if by default you everybody's connected and there's no reason to disconnect then everybody's connected so it's all up to the individual server admissions in the case of mass about\nSo there's a heck of a lot more decentralization there I don't I actually just went to look real fast year to see if I could quickly pull up some kind of lists\nAnd well I can find a list of the mastodon instances which is a term for one of the surfers out there\nI it doesn't total give me a total number so it's one of those lists where\nYou scroll down a page and it's like load more and they just go down but it would take a while to actually look at how are you know you're trying to figure out how to me it's right or right I Can't ...
