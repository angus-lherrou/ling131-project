people\nAre too many people I think when they joined the Republican Party even if their liberty can sometimes they drift towards more mainstream Republicanism and get turned into like a machine

Party in New Hampshire was able to get ballot access at the same level as the Republicans and Democrats for the first time in more than Twenty years that happened in twenty sixteen so your\nTheory it's on the same level or their their issues but All right uh so we had issues during the primary uh which I don't even want a taxpayer funded primary but were forced to have one that you are and we

days ago a saying that the libertarians can't even\nClear this very low bar and see we had a debate with eleven people before the primary for Congress\nAnd that debate proved that we need to set

attendees and the great speeches and everything\nWas the after party\nOr if it was kind of a surprise that was an army of fish will you know schedule there was something that was going to happen on the official schedule and then Bruce ... the organizer here the creator of at the conference got up at the end of the day and said hey look there's this thing it's you know maybe what was it like twenty but not not even that Fifteen minutes\nHour or is it that long you know it's always out there well anyway uh we went out to a really nice kind of lake front ah or river front property I'm not sure if it was I didn't look at the the big on that later ocean the guy that was the O. J. O. Y. ocean okay ... well it was beautiful and there were there\nA and it was a great party or they had a nice really nice after party it was great to kind of out of downtown Portsmouth and going and see something else here on the sea coast yeah and it was a you know like like any about like bad I mean what am\nI've experienced as people tend to climb been with the same people they've been talking with for the last couple of days your last last night I was a at least an opportunity for me to uh you mean a lot of different people from a lot of different backgrounds\nWho were doing a lot of different really cool things in the crypto space I totally agree and toward the end of the night we met a very interesting a person would got actually a little on Dick Cheney with us and uh your purses mother yes I Am\nAnd I came up and you were talking to us and of course I don't know how he got on the topic of Africans scammers targeting older women\nBut somehow we got there and you have quite a few stories about it how do you mind if I can you say like how old you are or\nYeah I'm I'm Seventy eight years old okay and I had decided that I Would build up my friends on Facebook\n... and what it was a very short time I had five thousand friends wow and I thought I was going to stop published a book sell it on there I didn't realize it really worked\nThat I took a picture on king said you got to take a picture on yep\nAnd then I ride away I get a message from a very handsome young man from Nigeria telling me that uh\nYou know you say you beautiful you have wonderful smile\nYou know you say you beautiful you have wonderful smile\nSo I send a message back and I said I don't do personal messages just contact man public that get another message for him he says why I Love you I Want to talk to you need to and then he would send pictures the flowers and things like that and I was thinking\nWhat why would anybody fall for that why why would anybody think that somebody would say your picture even if you were Eighteen and gorgeous model for how could somebody fall in love with you just because they saw your you know your picture\nSo then from then on probably three or four times a week I Would get some kind of a come on right from some young\nWants to help me I should be a long\nEight could be a big help to them\nThey all purport to be from Africa or were some saying they were elsewhere or\n... they ... they didn't say non ... usually that actually not gotten so many of them now that I can tell you almost word for word trust their kind of say how many years to have you been receiving when did you START I started it just may be five years ago okay for a while yeah\nAnd uh I mean I had to email all along but I I didn't have a big Facebook following or anything like\nIt seems like the messages are almost word for word the same you know as I Love you you know I Want to meet you\nI miss you if they write another sentence after that it's going to have misspelled words right that's right and I'm unwilling to there's always a picture and then when I turned them down then I started getting military pictures\nNow this is really interesting because you know you might have heard of the first one where others that these guys trying to scam old ladies on the Internet but this is an approach I had not yet I Would get a picture of\nA you know maybe a five star general or something and right and my first thought the first time I saw one on there and said you know how are you there and I thought oh here's here's one of our military people you know serving\nCan make you know my life better I mean they want you to I could source bond with him once in a while I'm not going to fall in love marry him or anything that we could correspond so I did answer you at least have a country in ... yeah you you both rectify answered the first ... and then the thing that came back\nWas the same misspelled you know I Love you and I think I don't think so yeah so I I shared my experiences\nWith you a little bit on this topic and and in my business we run a crypto currency vending machine people can come in and they can put cash in and they'll get crypto currency like bitcoin out and\nIt started a couple of years ago but I Would have um elderly women come in and say I need to buy bitcoin\nAnd I would help them out and show them what to do and things like that you know here's how the machine works and sometimes they would do this they would um bring out a bitcoin address them say this is who I Need to send us to ... and that is a flag for us we ... one of our rules one of\nRules is that we will send it to a bitcoin wallet that you control of and I have ... you say you know this has to go to this person okay that's outside of what we do we don't need to be tied to that and in talking to them we would find out um\nWell I've met this gentleman on the Internet and he's going to school in Africa\nBut he really wants to come to America and uh this is to help him out\nAnd and it would eventually sometimes it would come out sometimes I'm I'm just speculating with Ninety nine percent accuracy speculating\nUm that that it's the same sort of scared and they would talk about how they're you know it's he's my baby and I love them and we've we've found ourselves over Facebook soul mates\nI only bring this up because New Hampshire is not a big place it has a relatively small population and we live in around a town of twenty thousand people want a couple of thousand people\nAnd I could honestly say that this has happened seven or eight times\nHold that thought guys or if you can stick with us we're gonna come back for another segment here moments or we thought Luanda here and this is the free state block chain digital assets

because his name is being well of course the regulator guy\nAnd when we talk to him he said this he said\nWe just don't really understand it we don't know what it is mhm so I Can't really in good faith sign off on so I don't even understand it and they are required by law to understand it correct right\nNow we have a great conversation with him and the idea was actually really productive or because he didn't definitely leave with a greater understanding and was genuinely interested and not a fan of regulators but it is what it is absolutely those guys are forced to forest for sure right when you started talking about last night um creating this special purpose bank\nUnderneath state banking laws yeah uh\nIt was really interesting to me just because I liked the idea of I'm a big fan of secession I liked the idea of getting out from underneath the federal government as much as possible\nI mean I don't love the state government or anything like that but the very least I can go and see those people you know I can go to the state house building yet another benefit of New Hampshire usually not much more than an hour or so away from the state and yeah I mean where you're on the uh in the state\nAnd tell me what a special purpose bank is\nWell it is a state chartered bank that not\nFDIC insured so it is therefore\nNot going to be a retail bank\nOr because you're not if there is no FDIC insurance for our our three states that already authorized these Connecticut new ...\nAround Vermont and Maine so you're you know New Hampshire's kinda surrounded by a little bit of one of those tuition yeah well I you know there's no reason why New Hampshire can't perceive this as well I ...\nI haven't been able to figure out why does three states historically have state chartered banks but once we figured out that was a possibility that we can have a non FDIC insured state chartered bank\nThey're perfect for your buck outside or story in your vehicle yourself and your loved ones is the excitement and tradition of seeing a new frontier in archery\nAnd truly modern twist on this primitive survival tool feels the thrill of the vote dot com\nThis is talk live call into free

October twenty seven and twenty eight that's happening in Austin, Texas as it does in fact it's the fourth year\nOf the Texas bitcoin conference and free talk labs had the pleasure of broadcasting from that event every single year so we look forward to seeing you their Texas bitcoin conference dot com you can go there and get your tickets now\nOnce again Texas ... conference dot com October twenty seven\nAnd twenty eight so we've got Caitlin along with us here from Caitlin with a C I F in long dot com\nWe're talking about the idea of this special purpose bank or that there is some legislation that hopefully will be going through in Wyoming that will create will create be the entire concept of this banker will somehow authorized something that already exists this is a completely new thing\nThat we do completely new doesn't exist right now and it's just enabling legislation and we're just chatting during their break so everything Wyoming has done we pass five bills and the legislative session earlier this year in February they're enabling bills and this would be an enabling ... prescribe exactly\nHow this is going to be is so right now I'm not sure that people have a really long well it's a bank so it's actually a bell bills are late that day that the bill that I'm a ... we talk about the five blocks bills there was actually ... that was interesting what does it Wyoming legal I talked\nAbout this on the air Wyoming had a lot of success recently that this year is there are some crypto freeing legislation octane\nEnabling bills yeah on day\nOne I think is being a little modest here she was crucial\nTo this effort and it was apparent from I'm from a lot of people keeping an eye on those but so you she was a driving force so you guys did more for crypto in Wyoming and even New Hampshire oh yeah with the deregulation that had here\nYeah yeah I think that's right I think that's right and Wyoming had great bones to build on right on it it\nIs the state that invented the limited liability company in Nineteen Seventy seven ... made reference to the privacy\nIn Wyoming allow fees that other states just don't provide so on and it you know it it it's got\nThis ... you know libertarian tenth amendment kind of um east coast where it's not afraid to take on some of the federal issues and it had one of the worst money transmit our allies Iran smack dab in to that in fact actually I was donating bitcoin when Clinton was running up last year\nUm donated to the free state project didn't allow my favorite\nLiberty oriented charities and then I tried to in Dallas scholarship at the University of Wyoming and they couldn't accept it\nBecause of Wyoming's money transmitter law so I said All right we've got to fix this and\nI figured we were just get that fixed but we ended up passing for more bells one of which um defined and open blocking token as not subject to the securities laws in Wyoming where I refer to them politically as utility tokens um as long as they don't\nHave as long as they're not marketed as an investment and then they have to meet other criteria so again it was an enabling legislation um and we exempted all crypto assets from property taxes there's already know what I hack\nAnd then there was actually a fix the bell I was just alluding to which is at Wyoming recognize gold and silver as legal tender nice while ... very cool things and uh\nSo does that mean that you can now pay a property tax yellow with gold and\nSilver well not the property taxes are paid at the county level so it's a county by county a question as to whether they want to accept gold or silver ... not a requirement it's it's a voluntary\nOkay but so that's not what a legal tender as though right legal tender is where the government forces you to accept or whatever\nOut early real tender law I Believe it or not we actually proposed to make crypto legal tender in Wyoming as well and when we looked into the legal issues we were walking straight into a constitutional problem because ... article one sec\nUnless you were walking straight into a constitutional problem because ... article one section ten of the constitution says that Congress is the only entity that can declare legal tender selected nuns under an oil because recognized in the language of the of the constitution gold and silver and\nBecause those were there the lawyers\nIn Wyoming probably I wasn't involved with that bill but probably concluded that it was possible that that could survive a constitutional challenge to pass the bill anyway I'm there I think three states Utah's Utah maybe Arizona that also recognized gold and silver brush and are already yeah\nAnd what does it mean that I mean it's sort of get my my understanding of the definition of legal tender is the federal government will force people to accept it what does it mean to be legal tender a in a state\nIt means that you can have a contract that is payable and gold or silver and not dollars you already under the banding you're an adult have done that yeah\nAnd and but when it when I when I actually reached out to somebody to look at whether we could make crypto legal tender he said you know he wasn't convinced that they um that the bill that was passed\nIn these in Wyoming and also a couple of other states that recognize gold and silver that it was meaningful for precisely they reasons or you're questioning what is it really do\nUm you know and he was almost like a proclamation more yeah\nI mean because it was actually kind of refer back to the constitution itself article one section tend to talk about money\nUm and it's already there so it's you know you're asking a good question but what does the fact that they bother to pass a bill like that again just kind of tells you something about Wyoming right now there's a lot at Wyoming a New Hampshire have in common and and how it thinks how they think about the world and\nI'd love it if New Hampshire\nDid some of the same things that Wyoming a diner sure\nYou know ... absolutely I was telling you this last night we have a state legislators here who are ... people you know yeah you have more about where the currency people than than we had in Wyoming state legislators do you have in\nWere already in the Senate and sixty in the house okay yeah I'm\nNot as big as the action of what we're trying to force right and it and one of the interesting things about New Hampshire is that\nIt is so decentralized in that regard because each representative represent about a thousand people yeah you know it will see why they only have six hundred and thirty five hundred thirty thousand people so that proportion is actually\nMy daughter has a probably a lot a lot harder and why it is it is it is yeah it is but uh you know it's a citizen legislature in contrast to New Hampshire where I Believe the what I mean it could be wrong about this\nBut I'm In in Wyoming the legislature is constitutionally limited to meet\nOnly I think it's Ninety Days during session years and thirty days during a budget session every other year they get paid almost nothing and basically the just as they are required to have real jobs were added her\nBecause her way to do not have a job [laughter] okay so you have a rather hire you already retired ... no ... well yeah that's what I mean in other words they're not paid enough most legislators it becomes their fulltime job\nRight but in these are ... citizen legislators in ... in Wyoming and and so\nYou know it does tend to me that you have you know their lawyer and Arizona's right fewer lawyers are well well the people in the legislature must be able to take a month off in the ... years and ... days off in the non budget years\nBut my point is it's not a fulltime job for anybody it there there is it ... it is constitutionally prohibited that they could meet more than a certain number of days do you want to stay on I'll tell you\nYou're cool All right we'll stick with the cables along here from Kaitlin hype and long dot com comparing notes Wyoming versus New Hampshire it's free talk live\nWe've got more coming up here from the free state block chain digital assets conference in Portsmouth New Hampshire\nI Wonder how big going on a theory him were created\n... companies and individuals make their own\nWatching solutions are

Wyoming to the courthouse where already answering that one for it\nThen also that the wall street peace because I think that really is important and I'm like Chris was saying you know a lot of people thought that I think it's great that Citigroup is coming into decline guess what it's not they're they're trying to fit a round peg into a square hole I was part of a group of five people\nWho wrote a letter to the SEC warning about the dangers and risks of trying to do that um and so basically look at it we're not going to prevent it and some of us probably would have a problem with the notion of\nRegulators preventing anything anyway but right now um we ... let's put it this way no one can say they were not warned right\nThat this is going to cause major losses for Wall Street institutions that allow rationally reserve declined to be created right on there is no lender of last resort for bitcoin and if there's a run on a bank on\nThey're going to be big losses um you know the ATF has suddenly going to have a massive divergence between the underlying spot price for example if it's an ATF if it's a clearing house that's dealing in\n... that uh and there was a hard fork in declaring ... clearinghouse can have major law says they're going to be problems with Wall Street getting involved with with as a quote unquote physical bitcoin but that just means we fall\nTo bail those out through the American taxpayer right the problem\nWasn't going to happen if you look at my Twitter account that ... that I have right now says no taxpayer backed institution should be leveraging declined to ever are great and you know I but but I I'd I'd rather just educate people and\nPut it on there for gang here and your website by the way Caitlin I Belong to Caitlyn with a C. dot com okay well thanks for coming off ... guys really great interview we were coming up here are from the free state block chain digital assets conference in Portsmouth New Hampshire this is talk last\nDoes your dog it's scratched tinker shed like crazy come to die by perhaps order and Ninety Days supply of dynamite\nEverything we tried failed except died of\nPick up two bottles of super mega fish oil get the third bottle free\nPacked with a make a three day ha and APA fatty acids\nSuper make us great for your dogs immune system healthy skin and socks shiny for dogs love it try ... by to get one free at dynamite dot com\nAnd I'll be I Can't\nArgue crypto currency advocate crypto tip is the ideal outreach tool to help new people discover crypto currency it's a principal business card size tip that you can get to service providers preferably in addition to a good cash to when the ... it'll bring up an explanation of crypto currency how to install a wallet and\nAllow them to claim the tip if they don't claim to crypto you get your tipper funded to you after a time period you specify plus what they do claim to tip you get an email alerts greatest\nMany tips as you want at crypto tipped ... that's crypto tip\nDone a word [noise]\nHello this is Dr build legally empty of neutral medical dot com announcing the brakes ...
