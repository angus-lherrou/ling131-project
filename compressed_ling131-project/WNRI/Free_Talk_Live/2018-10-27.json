shoot the fear of if I have my name on my door bell I might go to the earth is so this is actually\nA\nTown I guess removing the doorbell the names when the doorbell is I guess or the post office or something to that effect\nRemoving the names from the door does\nHey I'm ... so it looks like a ... so the GDP are is basically that's the\nGeneral levels\nDepartment of energy I Believe it's a

you\nDo you really think because I Know that you take the very broad interpretation of what this thing is because we've had this discussion previously true or do you really think that police in Europe are going to spend time investigating a farmer in Iowa\nThat may have a website that somebody is different for Germany goes to get everything\nThat I looked at ... or ... and listen to this is the

to have an ...\nYup uh and\nThey're going to enforce on somebody or try to enforce on somebody's assets are going to be used and\nYeah I mean that's just that's just how it works I I don't know um I mean there's so many other laws that he can be used to but it's just one more I Know\nWhat what's the latest and\nMore um no what what's the latest and\nI'm Still confused about why the post office would be removing names off of door bells\n... it's just what they doing OK in this city and country a ... um so I guess it's kind of comedy in Europe I think Germany is also got\nThat's coming in Germany I think and I think\nIt's like I Know that a lot of large apartment buildings yeah\nNo there's little bothers to where you know like this person than apartment three o seven or whatever but it's not the post office that puts those names there and all of us that would have the authority to remove the names are not night on Syria's why okay office in fact the doorbell\nSo you know how we have from me or I'm Sorry numbers in the United states for houses yes well I don't know how it is in ... the rest of Europe but I Know in the u._k. they have names instead of numbers in some places okay so I I Would kind of related to the\nArt so instead of saying apartment three Seventy five at West thirty seventh street in London\nThat apartment he would have a name not a number yes\nSounds weird but OK or\nMaybe the name of a a building it would be addressed to as opposed to a number\nOkay like a house member ... so they're removing the names of the buildings from the buildings\nI don't know what the story anywhere in she was the strive read I read the story last week and I I'm I'm bringing now okay for I spend a little while since I read the story it's a good story yeah let let it get down to it I don't know how to you about what we think the story but it's actually exactly\nA mommy not yet have errors and stuff and what I'm I'm relying here so finally someone's home in Vienna

dollars or about one thousand one hundred and fifty hours per ... so this this government housing\nThat's what it sounded like it I I'm not sure that that's entirely clear let me just stores selling this article so this is this is this is your guys so they do things differently in Europe and like there's a lot of socialism going on so I don't I'm not entirely sure that this is well what's the source on that story so this is from\nThe Washington Post [noise] alright dot com um and yeah\nBut let us let me see what the story and maybe we'll\nKind of explain it but I don't think it does uh they're they're acting following a complaint by single tenant\nBut no court has so far ruled on whether names on door both are indeed a violation of Europe's tough new privacy laws years housing authority did not respond to calls on friday so it sounds like maybe it is um you know some sort of but again I'm Alive I Know in the u._k. for example and a lot of these European countries\nA lot of the housing is owned by the government and so you know it's I don't know how to Vienna and so I don't know what two hundred twenty thousand that that sounds like a heck of a lot of homes and mind you

Facebook and I have shown a more serious commitment to hold to them\nTo account over privacy breaches\nThan their us counterparts yes I mean that's certainly true but the U.S is now trying to pass a

American would say bird years [laughter] I didn't even know until probably the last couple of years but it was pronounced Bruce draws the line every time I thought I was like oh Burt is All right\nYou know the thing is English has ripped off so many words from other languages over the centuries that right\nThat you'll run into those things from time to die that's why we've got the silent K and a bunch of words and the silent he age in the silent this yeah and you know all the time affiliate you pronounce it\nYeah and you know all the time affiliate you pronounce it out [laughter] that's that's very true that's very true yeah so let's get into this article from the New York times\nFrom New York Times this is the data today supposed to be published this Sunday our children are being taught to read in ways that line up with what scientists have discovered about how people actually learn\nIt's a problem has been hiding in plain sight for decades according to the national assessment of educational progress more than six intense fourth graders are proficient readers\nAnd has been this way since testing began a third of kids can't read at a basic level\nHow do we know a big part of the problem is how children are being taught because reading researchers have done studies in classrooms and clinics and they've shown over and over the virtually all kids can learn to read if they're taught with approaches that use what scientists have discovered about how the brain does the work of reading\nThe many teachers don't know the science of scientists figured out\nFirst of all why learning to talk of the natural process that occurs when children are surrounded by spoken language learning to read is not to become readers kids need to learn how the words they know how to say connect to print on the page\nThey need explicit systematic phonics instruction\nThere are hundreds of studies that backs this up but talk to teachers and many will tell you they learn something different about how children learn to read and their teacher preparation programs\nJennifer written you Carol who completed a master's degree in special education in two thousand sixteen told me she was taught the children quote read it naturally if they have access to books and cook [laughter]\nJessica rude and intervention specialists in Ohio said she learned quote you want to get children excited about what they're reading find books that they're interested in and just read read read and quote\nSo I'm guessing here that they have at least taught some of the basic it's not like you just had a two year old a buck and they're going to figure out how to read yeah I I\nI don't know any two year old so you're just hand the book and they figure out how to read on their own All right or even a five year old like unless unless they have the basics of understanding these are the letters they're not going to just figure out how to read right and\nAnd people that you know how to read they either learn to intentionally or learn to accidentally you know\nGoing on a caffeine best in elementary school principal in Pennsylvania where in the same thing quote it was just put literature in front of the kids teach the story and the children learn how to read through exposure and the quote exposure\nThat the ... did they also say that children learn math through exposure ah this this article doesn't get into that but that's that's\nA whole other topic um we can talk about that tomorrow or Monday I guess right but now like this just they'll figure it out well unless there's an underlying you know understand they had er huh yeah once you got the there are letters these are numbers this is this thing this is that they like\nYeah you give a kid a bunch of a lego blocks they'll figure out how they stick together and they'll make something\nRight but that's completely different than just like here's here's look here's a book if you if you don't know where you're at ... I mean if you know those cliffs mean how are you supposed to figure that out right hey here's a bucket might be English might be better if it might be\nWritten at a high rate gloves you'll figure it out little Timmy or maybe all eight they've talked I just can't figure it out eight to five five four or five zero three seven three three eight fifty five four fifty free oh yeah there's also the discord ... discord dot L.
