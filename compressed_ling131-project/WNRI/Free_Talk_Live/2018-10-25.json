I don't let anybody or heard of anybody getting I literally how are they talking about\nThat's a good question how often are littering tickets actually given out I mean you do see when you're you know driving around highways and the various states there's usually a threatening sign every now and that'll say like\nOne thousand dollar fine or what I Know and that's the way that they raised it to like ten thousand dollars or something insane like at\nA I think in New Hampshire it's much much much lower but are they do have these signs threatening people but yeah I Do people ever actually get a peg for littering find it in theory it could only happen if the police witness it right because\nIf the cops find a piece of litter on the ground they don't know who threw it there and they were testing we've got to find fingerprints I mean that that's circumstantial because maybe it blew out a window or right you know maybe it wasn't an intentional littering or maybe it had\nSomebody's fingerprints on it but they were the previous holder of it and the person who you know who knows how it got there unless there's actual\nEvidence like ... ... not going to spend all of the resources trying to figure trying to get fingerprints from a McDonald's cup now well\nIf it's a ten thousand dollar fine they might play money that they might but ah it would it would be interesting to see like whether you could do this area you could do like a freedom of Information Act request on the police and you could say\nHow many littering tickets had been written between the years of X and y and then you'd get a little bit more information about that\nI I I I never I never heard of anybody getting a veteran and I think oh my God I never knew anybody ever get to\nKnow what you're doing here is you're you're utilizing your own personal experience and you're judging from that and that's limited right it's essentially like a case study it may be true that these aren't done very often but you you won't really know until you actually pulled the ... but some of the it's\nThe threat of\nIs used as a deterrent\nCorrect the idea yeah but that doesn't deter littering right like there's plenty of people that litter\nI've seen it happen plenty of times where somebody's truck in a cigarette butt out their window\nI well below throat can sample only take a cigarette butts as littering well they should 'cause it's litter I Know they should I've just say I've seen people don't he'll get hit by all kinds of things in their head they justify are on the higher doing as a literary and they justify throwing an entire McDonald's cup\nFull of a fluid out the window as not littering cars I see that too\nI just saw just picked up down the road here on the street on which were you know situated are picked up a like a power a bottle\nYou know I live on a corner lot I'm picking trash out of my off and I live in a good neighborhood yep\nHere they were ... they can't be that as a habit\nThat I can about it [laughter] it's like\nOn a car that even act like they do not even in one way or like a major highway and they had it I got nine thousand dollar ... thousand dollar hiring people pick up all got\nI thought that's supposed to pay ... to do that or not pay them but just how the inmates\nDo it then when you consider all of the voluntary or organizations that go and they adopt a highway here and they're right um I mean I even you know walk up and down maple sometimes to pick trash up it's uh\nHow about the college neighborhood where it's every Thursday Friday Saturday Night these kids are

if they can afford to their guns I mean look at what's going on with the Honduras they didn't have to have a lot of money to gather into a large mass and cross the border and maybe that's what the people of Venezuela ought to consider doing as well get a large number of people and just cross\nAnd get out of there because if you just go one at a time they're gonna pick you up right they're going
