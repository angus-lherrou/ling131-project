then just send the envoys linked to the customer and then they can pay it\nSo it is possible to do other things besides real life acceptance with any pay but that was what they\nHad in mind when they were designing the system um and it works great for that to go to any paid on global and get started there you'd just great your user name and password and you get it and you put your crypto addresses that you want the crypto delivered to your ... your personal wallet addresses you put them in the set up page and then you load the app on your point of sale device that's it\nAnd we are talking about

New York you're on free talkline hello Greg\nSo I Am so uh yeah I thought I'd ask about finally do that and so this is a Republican versus Democrat thing I'm just curious the latest circus I think it's about Elizabeth Warren I'm\nA Democrat or fairly well known democratic wasn't she liked the head of the Democratic National Committee or something or is that somebody else\nI'm not sure about that issue shy last show\nOh okay ... who is a war and she's just like a state\nOr an editor Massachusetts okay\nYeah she's a Bernie Sanders is a progressive I think she's progress to 'em both people have you know dumping a fairly significant thing it's like for example of Bernie Sanders on the fed Bernie Sanders sometimes teams up with Rand Paul\n... okay I made her on hold on a minute Ron Paul himself said that Bernie Sanders put a poison pill and the I think it was a twenty twelve audit the fed bill really ah yeah yeah he said he ... or something I remember a video\nOr well I don't know about that my point is that you say mom way more going for them\nAnd simply that they claim Native American ancestry or perpetuated a story that their families said like that is so significant and yet\nThat is the only thing that both Republicans know about a it was before is that she playing something somewhere forty years ago and I think that's\nSort of this I think I've heard about this story this is the woman who is claimed to be part Native American but some kind of test showed that she was like less than a thousand\nPercent or something you hear that yeah she had a DNA test done and it showed she was less than zero point one percent and then his event or a hundredth of a hundred and some Republican or something like that and then the Cherokee Nation even come out and and issued a statement denouncing her in ... in\nThe sense of how much of a liar she is she had a cookbook that she said she got family Native American family recipe she stole it from somewhere else really she talks about how her father's parents disapproved of ah their marriage be over you know between her mother and father because a beer or racist against her mother for being Native American and it's just such lies\nNow but this is what I mean ah all that\nIt's lies\nNow but this is what I made a all that is on one way and then you take the exact same story for example Donald Trump's that\nClaim that he was a fair chance history because you know after World War two it's not popular to be a German uh renting an apartment so okay players they sort of ... and he tells a two Jews in Brooklyn and everything like that\nNow that's brought up well you know that's fine Donald Trump right that in a\nPart of the deal that he has to be this ancestry and nobody cares and he doesn't have any sweetest access tree and then ... you know the right\nThe argument that and Warren is that ... that the Trump Trump senior I think the guy or a you know Donald Trump's fathers did that to avoid I mean I'm not I'm just saying what I think it is I haven't read that did that to avoid the anti German sentiment while as before and did that to advance her career\nAnd then I went there in front of the term for it also advance this career by selling apart\nNow is this the Warren didn't she do it to pander like to you know make people feel like she was somehow part of the suppress class or she\nIs not the panic lever to advantage over here because there's so many interesting points she\nDidn't get any benefits like getting into college from that she simply from her parents were saying and it should I wasn't sure it's not supposed to start just like Donald Trump was affirming his parents were saying and that was that choice for him for a while it finally distance themselves from it\nWell I mean they're acting like Donald Trump doesn't take any heat for the things that he says I mean he's he's taking heat for all kinds of things and rightfully so so I mean if this woman again I don't know what the original statement was where she made this statement was it was it was that it all our lives dude oh it was all ... okay\nAnd she says she said it all her life because her parents used to tell her that the whole story that\nShe was wrong it turns out that there should go there can't say that\nToll free number of years eight fifty five four fifty free I understand you

think ... can you put in you know you're putting air quotes around that or do you want to tell us while you're putting your\n... or this or this is my story but I mean my wife said and I I you know I brought this up before on free talk lie by far back as last year because we've talked about if it's not legalizing it it's just giving the government of monopoly to sell it oh\nYeah yeah pretty much the only way to legally by Canada or excuse me legally by candidates in Canada is through the provincial government right and\nEach provincial government what we learned over the summer when we talked about this in more detail ah each provincial government has its own set of rules so in some of them you'll have to be Eighteen to buy the candidates and I believe one or two it's like Nineteen as far as I Know it's Nineteen\nA nationwide\nThing and came back at Eighteen I think it's for for a lot less I check it it might it might have changed it it it could be I could be wrong and I'm just thought it was in Ontario it when I ... but and maybe the maritime it's older I saw maybe Nineteen also\nWill have to pull up the list because I Know the last time I I looked at it I I Believe it actually arranged in some places even higher than Nineteen if I recall correctly I can be okay here we go\nHere we go uh in Quebec anyone Eighteen or older will be able to buy it\nThey're going to increase the minimum age to Twenty one though she's a Alberta has a gun was Eighteen but every other province has gone with Nineteen interesting oh no these are these kids under Twenty one how could they get their
