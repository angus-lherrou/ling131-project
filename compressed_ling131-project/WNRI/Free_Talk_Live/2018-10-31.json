don't care about these people they don't matter they don't matter one iota I'm ... from people for banks and special interest\nYou know it's a true statement it really is and of course they're keeping the libertarian out of any kind of a debate there actually libertarians outside right now outside of the debates going on\nA there's apparently a congressional debate happening now and then the gubernatorial debate will be on Thursday here in New Hampshire and libertarians will be protesting out in front of both of those debates because both candidates have been unfairly I kept off those ballots as is happening in states likely across the country this is the typical story when it comes to third parties whether it be the libertarians or the green for that matter\nThis is home yeah anybody who's qualified for the ballot is the third party is going to ... the system will close up\nThey will do everything they can to keep those people from actually being hurt All right so let's

we'll take your calls and dots about anything we've been\nKind of go an issue by issue and I'm going to put quotes around some of these issues are because they're just so obvious skated with this political language that is a design to make the person reading this wire think that the Democrat\nIn the race is just so much more better and compassionate then uh they're Republican is now I don't think that either of them are any good um the the libertarian in the race you're for for governor in New Hampshire is a much better choice then the other two and they didn't even include a libertarian here it's just straight up propaganda\nUm so we're going to continue with this and I'm not naming the names because it's irrelevant because these issues many of them are going to appear in other states where they put different heads in different names on the fire and they'll have the exact same issues I bet you if you hold up the issues in other states there'll be almost identical but but but you have a bio and Uri and\nWell yeah the ... and for the other candidates or any other states so we are going through kind of a checklist of here's what the Democrats thinks here's what the Republican thanks so we're not parties and it's so funny hearing you say that by the way I had a corrected Vincent on this because he's a Frenchman so like he actually thinks the words\nIs it is it pronounced that way and in France I'm not from France I Know but now he goes about four hundred years branch like you speak French from Quebec yes it\nIs it actually pronounce that way that word because it is a French word isn't it hard partisan no no I Know is it is that like I Know like I I never heard of it I've never heard had been said in Quebec\nUm you know politics or discuss differently there are actually out you know now I Want to know the etymology as\nPart of the middle French yup a middle French from upper Italian part teased again or I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right there's there's a some sort of a a a\nAccent over the the a Tuscan part to gun equivalent to part II faction or part and then eased on from Annette tested vulgar Latin uh which uh\nI yeah I don't know what that is but anyway uh yes so faction park so partisan um anyway so here we go last but certainly not least\nPartisan um anyway so here we go last but certainly not least of these people support the voting rights for all granted staters\n... an order is that supposed to me there's been a controversy in New Hampshire between the political parties are over how many hoops somebody has to jump through in order to be able to vote\nSplit into hoops to be able to jump through it's whether or not people out of state students who are going to school in in New Hampshire should be able to absolutely should know and well first off I didn't hear a libertarian you believe in voting and you want more people to vote especially people who were inclined to vote for stuff like this to vote for one hundred\nPercent sure why they weren't I thought you said you were talking to the college kids and they're going to go out and voted I say it's starting\nTo people are starting to or not even starting people just want to do it out of spice some people just want to vote against it I was by the majority of college students are still gonna vote for it or\nI'm completely against the state obviously but in the meantime between when we can convince people to get rid of the idea of the states the government from their minds\nThen in that timeframe I still think that if you're going to have a system in which the promises made that if you are taxed\nOr if you have to you know if you're being ruled by this system that you should have some kind of voice in that system than the vote is ultimately the one of the only voices you have it's one of the only way that you can register discontent or that you can register a\nFraction of yeah I bet you have a voice for our home state in Massachusetts in California and we're for law that's where they want to vote then they should vote there instead but if you are in New Hampshire and let's say you're a college student and you feel like you're being ruled by the New Hampshire government cause you are\nIt's the New Hampshire police that are going to arrest you for doing an open containers you're walking from party to party it's the New Hampshire police are who are going to arrest you if they catch you smoking marijuana cigarette\nI guess that's not a rest of the fence anymore they'll take your questions possessed you is called joined in not marijuana cigarette [noise]\nSo anyway ah what\nWas that was what will happen and so why should those people the people who are being taxed and regulated and controlled by the New Hampshire government if they feel they don't get here and they don't live here now they have to build acts\nOr whatever but you think they went from knew someone who from New Jersey dries up here but you know by oh no there's\nNo they're not leaving here I mean they're not living here the majority of their days or whatever while the students are and if you're paying sales tax and in New Hampshire there is another way to reverse the meal was literally those me there's a meals tax and remember whenever you even though there's no sales tax whenever you buy something at a local store in New Hampshire\nYour paying their property tax for them right so there is right axes that are built into the cost of the products\nThat you ... do you purchase so you don't see actually it's actually an insidious tax because the property taxes behind the scenes only the landlord actually is responsible for paying it and so the average person isn't really aware of what the tax burdens are and they are very high so why shouldn't somebody who's being regulated controlled possibly even arrested by a government\nBe able to participate in this crappy meaningless thing I mean you're ... like this is significant\nOh it was just a vote\nOr not because it because I come from a place I come from Hanover New Hampshire where it's run by the ... mafia I think it's like the blue is like deep\nBlue is Ninety percent voted for Hillary Clinton you know these people who show up students right on the people who go go go there for four years may vote you know they they're used as a mobile voting army right these people are you voting army you're losing our you know\nI mean if you want to do anything I mean there are plenty of students to students about ruining had been ruined Tanner because you have all these people right they come here but go to college and then they leave right but New Hampshire government is trying to convince people to even know it yet know what is the problem is not a problem if they begin voting because they don't have\nThey don't have a stake in the same kind of like you have to worry man so you'll love it I mean I don't want them voting I don't want any talented people for being mobilized by these Democrats by these left and the Republicans were doing it I agree with the same exact thing I get in there and visit how they got rid of all the farmers all the on kid I plan to do it to\nYou know not not that I ... I bought ... leaders are ruining the state for ruining the mountains of what happened to handle all the mountain fall down and I don't know if you don't get out of New Hampshire build a border so I

was I pulled up by pulled up a couple of stories about this it\nTurns out that uh some states and even Australia in Estonia have been experimenting with with online voting yeah the I Believe in New

really didn't think there was any point the political system\nAnd that was that was like right around the time when I moved to New Hampshire dude you're feeding into the system 'cause they say look how many people would agree with that says look how many people voted\nBut that's okay but most people don't vote and the system still continues and it continues because threats but people do our voting oh yeah there's some continues because of obedience so for instance if you look at like watches a painting in the process no longer the elections where no one for you got to raise their mental

I was we continue here gap being uh taken down by its Web host\nAnd apparently pay pal also canceling on gab and I would say this is you know very unfair how gap is being treated ultimately gab is just a platform\nAnd if they want to purport themselves as a free speech platform I don't agree that people should be punishing them for that that's what gab did they they founded another platform that ultimately did seem to attract mostly right wing or Z and so therefore it is a\nIs a sensible a shooter was apparently on the gas platform and now the entire platform has been punished for the actions of one of its users and I think that that's a unfortunate it's unnecessary\nBut it's a reality where\nPay pal is a private business is pay pal decides they want to cut off the platform well they can make that choice\nAnd similarly if uh you know the hosting provider get private business if they decide you know what yeah\nYou have a right to free speech just not on our hosting provider well they have the right to make that decision so I don't think that\nAnybody wasn't within their rights as far as what they've done here I just think it's tacky to target of an entire platform over what one person does yeah what what what the word that came to mind I Can't say on the air so can you give us the first letter\nIt said the move cat gotcha so ah the toll free number here is eight fifty five four fifty free powers vinyl posed a this is the the shooter has posted on gas before going on a killing spree apparently a that he's going in\nGab then took down his page when learning about these and then apparently also sent it to the FBI so even them being obedient to the government and you know always subpoenas yeah that didn't save them from the punishment of these other companies in the hour is falling by the way our T reporting in the hours following the shooting was hit by a wall of\nMainstream media covered with headlines in ...\nOr is following the shooting was hit by a wall of mainstream media covered with headlines invariably linking the all the sites All right leaning to the murders committed by powers supplying a cat had unable to cry or was even complicit\nWhich is completely ridiculous they're no more complicit in the crime than Facebook as well right and you know let's go back in time a little bit more what about a psychopath who sends an a sends a letter to a newspaper yeah the post office as complicit in that one what about the newspaper posting it\nMean to some extent there just reporting on somebody's opinion\nAnd somebody's opinion is controversial and a lot of cases you put that paper you know you're the news editor over in a newspaper Vincent if somebody writes a letter to the editor there is a good chance you guys are going to publish it right yeah for four and a lot of space or if it's a good one now they probably wouldn't publish something that's openly threatening\nOther people that probably wouldn't fly an old media institution but in this case all the guy said was he's going in\nRight um he didn't make it clear what he was going in to do is going in to vote\nYou know you're you you can't even have an automated system flag that you did just there's no way right so a gab does get hit by all this coverage a snowball similar condemnation came from left leaning Twitter users wasn't far behind in many cases gab was openly called a Nazi platform\nBowers also had account on Facebook and Twitter yet as our T points out those companies don't appear to be facing any backlash\nGab and its defenders of pointed out likewise the recently arrested mailed bummer says are so your book was\nAllowed to spout threats on Twitter for two years before being suspended after she was the taint\nGap has become a haven for users who have been either banned for more mainstream social media or those simply unhappy with their content control or rules\nCabs overarching message is that all speeches free speech and has to be protected under the first amendment does the site makes a point of allowing anybody to say anything in so far as possible it still has rules and they point out in their post shooting statements\nHowever it quote just a bouncing condemns all acts of terrorism and violence a cook soon after joint and stripes became the next to this about gab payment processor\nIn their letter to the besieged network it accuses gab of not doing enough to ensure its rules were being observed it disabled the social networks to counter 'til stripes own investigations issue concluded quote likely within one week unquote\nSo weird that gap has put a posted up uh they've secured some other hosting somewhere 'cause there's always somebody out there who's willing to put you up if you give them some money\nOh yeah but it's probably just a a minor hosting a cat doesn't have the the level of a ... that you would need to run a big big website there just posting a letter that you've read it here

with law enforcement blah blah blah we are going to come back bigger and better it doesn't matter what you write this is the this is a matter of free speech is is are we are going to be coming back on
