because the people made the allegations they couldn't prove really is it not matter in Seventy years and his positions on the Fourth Amendment are so confirming somebody Brian you think it can make

never changed its been adjudicated you most times\nSure you know getting into any knowledge that you have a right to travel\nI mean are they still I think the function of the of the Supreme Court basically I don't know that was originally their function or not and I don't really their hair cut to whittle away rights over time oh yeah\nI and I don't really care because I don't know how that would matter but as of now and as of the past hundred two hundred and fifty years that's their function and\nYeah well I mean but but I mean you you are you\nAh do you do and I met a checkered or I mean you're not blaming it on a woman\nThat bad that there has been this gradual a change and and I mean is it\nYou just said as it happens to bringing or just the way if she just said that the purpose of the Supreme Court was to whittle away freedom so I think she does it causes you\nShould do agree with that ... guy I oh I I I yeah Sam and well I think ultimately all over the government does the same uh you know all of the government you know our our\n... overtime that has to ...\nTo ... even more regulation and even more uh\nExpensive cost than more destruction of of liberty and all of it you know with whatever he uses the word would work best for them at the moment frequently it's you know it's for the children that's what we heard recently here in Canada for the call has played\nA but uh that's we heard recently here in Keene New Hampshire when the city council was talking about prohibiting\nAnd is moving forward with prohibiting young people from the age of Eighteen to twenty or through twenty\nOr so if you're under Twenty one you won't be able to purchase or possess nicotine related products when this ordinance goes through of course they're using the children as their excuse for this\nBut I don't want to see anyone under Twenty one being tried as an adult\nOh they're going to continue to tie yeah I Know they are they're going to try people under Eighteen and then it out too but they need to pick one I guess the point like is this person is ... ... if you're telling them what they can't can't smoke I mean at least among substances that are that are already legal\nThey're not that that's the most important right ever but\nYeah so then you're saying there John you write it ever holding his standard I mean I don't\nYeah I mean it is an important fundamental right the right to do what you want with your body and uh unfortunately only to the city councilor seem to understand or had any kind of grasp\nThis issue in the other twelve of them voted in favor of moving ahead with the ordinance so we're likely gonna see prohibition expands here in Keene New Hampshire [noise] eight fifty five four fifty free that's eight five five for five zero

and Tom what's dot com or search for Tom what show in your favorite pod catcher as we continue here and by the way I Want to apologize I did\nA make a mistake here earlier I said that I was giving you the top ten Web sites\nAnd maybe I said it was in the world it was a worldwide those were the website I gave you were just for the United states so the United states\nIn their top ten websites three adults websites however if you look at the entire world there aren't as many adult Web sites in the top ten early to\nA Google number one you to number two Facebook number three so actually you bump Facebook down on the ... the world charge because Facebook was number two in the U.S\nBy do dot com is number four now that is apparently a foreign a search engine ... and ... which was also in the top ten in the United states is number five worldwide\nOr Instagram at number six Yahoo number seven Twitter at number aids\nEx videos dot com and number nine and then ... dot com which I Believe is a Russian a social network if I recall correctly at number ... pretender so ah anyway we were talking about Netflix we can get back into that\nUh the critique from people in Hollywood about what Netflix and Amazon are doing creating entertainment and competing they don't like the competition and they're trying to claim that it's centralized but I don't know if I agree let's go to your calls and thoughts first upstairs in New Mexico Syria are on free chocolate go ahead\nAnd I you know people that are stopping the vote bought a cup\nI I'm I Wonder how are you know a part of that out that way I think their job\nThey're probably yeah there's a very good chance you've got prostitutes who are actually coming out\nTo not admit their prostitutes but quietly or or not not quite but they're you know they're not admitted it prostitutes but yet coming out and saying we want to stop the robot sex because you're referring to a story that was covered I think on Thursday or Sunday night show one of the other\nBecause I Know I wasn't on uh but I remember hearing them talk about it where they were talking about the Houston story where there was a a business that was going to be opening up in Houston to allow people to have sex with a robot doll\nAnd uh and then you know presumably a\nClean it out before the next customer comes up so to speak and uh and then\nApparently the rules now are that they're passing an ordinance to prohibit the use of the dull so they're going to allow a sex shop to sell dolls\nBut they will not allow in the shop the use of the ... so a big customer wants to buy a doll and take it home or a robot dollar whatever they are and take it home that will be legal in Houston but to actually have a trial area\nAh we're in one would take it to a room and do whatever one does to a robot sex da di ... going to be prohibited in the city of Houston\nYou compare that I make them get that yeah yeah\nYeah yeah the ... going to take over our job [laughter] you know I mean at a bottle diaper bag definitely picked up the panic but you know you know\nI don't know the details of the strike and I I didn't hear that story but if you think that your job is about the thinking of taking over refusing to continue to do it is not real\nIt was they think you know taking over refusing to continue to do it is not really that bad of a move just go find some other job to do instead and giving up is not really what we want to you know find something\nThat is productive to do if you can't have a specific job anymore that doesn't mean you can't have any job average his needs go do something else\nWill read that's the mistake that you're making here Sarah is not that you just give up and think that every single jobs going to be taken by robots\nUm that is not a future that immediately of parents I mean maybe at some point that will become a possibility where robots are so articulate and so you know good at what they do but they literally can take over every human job that seems very very unlikely what we've seen happen is when technology advances\nAnd the entire industries have been wiped out\nI mean if you look at for instance the automotive or replacing the horse drawn carriage is ... you know in the past\nThere aren't as a great of a demand for horse drawn carriage just today and so you know the the barriers to people that are that you know would put horse shoes on horses they still exist but they're nowhere near as in high demand as they used to be you know you don't see blacksmith anymore outside of a renaissance fair or for the for the most part so\nThese jobs are gone but the people who were in those rules were able to get jobs doing other things as long as you are and I know you don't understand that says you don't work and you never have apparently but uh but you know if you can learn a new skill if you're willing to learn a new skill\nThen nothing can really stop you from continuing you know in the working world so it's not not like the robot take everybody's job but she's not going to happen\nBut you know again you know what a climactic you have to I ... or a computer or they need that uh it wasn't that appeared\nSomebody's got to the machines when I don't\nKnow if that's the job that people need then that's the job that people should do you can't just decide whether there's a demand for even if the only job available is ice tea and that is not ever going to be the cases are as\nIs it reasonable for example that ... that is the market's telling you is that you should go learn ... not that you should just say well I Can't do the job I did ten years ago there for I Do nothing\nBut driver I heard they have more aid and I know that that we don't have enough funding for me to be taken care of one way or the other even if you're up there and\nMaybe a medium that other people that work in like a computer take off our we won't get I'll get a you don't know if they aren't you know make a make a garden or you know they\nReally are in our lives I Would be universal basic income and I'm not expecting you to really pick up on this but ultimately it doesn't work because you're just printing money from the thin air and so any you know\nIt's basically an illusion and the idea that you're actually getting something out of that\nWhat you're getting is you're essentially taking wealth away from other people who have earned it\nAre you so you will get if if you'd be I'd does come about you will get a check but it's going to buy less and less over time because they're centrally diluting the money supply by printing out money in order to give it to you at least that's likely the way it's going to be funded in my destination\nIs are there directly taking it from someone else either way it's not the same number\nThank you for the call tonight Sarah the toll free number of years eight fifty five four fifty free that's eight five five for five zero three seven three three and he joined
