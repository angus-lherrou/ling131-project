yeah and this one girl said after she recanted and told the truth later on she just said ah\nThat should she did it because I just don't like him I don't like to hear him talk I don't like to look at

criminal trespass and simple assault so they claimed guide\nAn assault criminal trespass and simple assault\nSo they claimed this guy um raped them\nAs sexual assault I don't know what the exact

was the radio ratings company they got gobbled up by\nThe Nielsen ratings company which was the TV ratings company so now Nielsen does both ... and a radio ratings and they have the the full market

let's go to the phones and to the bone in the news or in light of the news that Pittsburgh now the largest city number twenty seven twenty eight twenty eight by market size according to Neal than\nA that does not have a daily print newspaper the writing so to speak is on the wall here for ah the difficulties the newspapers have been having in fact a Pew Research center before I get to this caller's on this topic\nA pure research found in July that more than half of the largest newspapers in the United states have laid off employees in January of twenty Seventeen the study found that nine of the sixteen newspapers nationwide would circulation of two hundred and fifty thousand or more so the biggest papers or\nHad experienced layoffs during a sixteen month period ending in April of course as we've reported for years you're on TALK live it's just been a continual process of downsizing remember we were at breakfast this week uh Darryl and you were looking at the union leader right which is the newspaper out of a Manchester\nHere in New Hampshire is the largest paper in the state but it ain't so big physically anymore I commented on how tiny it's\nThis paper in the state but it ain't so big physically anymore I commented on how tiny it seemed a when you were looking at it and it looked like they shrunk the width of the union leader\nAh which I don't know when they did that but I Know the king sentinel which is the one in the town that we live in they did it a decade ago I'm Amazed at how small it is I I just remember where it used to live it smaller end it's dinner meaning that the pay there's not yeah yeah\nRemember where I used to live a town of a you know it's just not much bigger than keen and them in the county nonetheless was a little bit larger than instill but I'm One of the county ... county but it was it you know it was thick you like a really sick and\nI just I Can't imagine like what what does he is what are these newspapers doing or you were also basically in a suburb of New York city even though you don't like to admit that it was a suburb of new earning west New Jersey it was the ... I mean there wasn't enough trained couldn't even get into New York city without going at least the town over\nWho one whole town but I I I understand but it it's the dude let's go to the phones here ah your calls and thoughts and we've got Vernon he's in New Orleans listening on line go ahead burning\nSo I have a story about uh the opposite where one paper to the streets here in New Orleans has been publishing for over a hundred years and they decided a few years ago that they would go from seven days to three days a week and then have that on line presidents kind of thing but I remember hearing that it\nYeah the batteries use paper the advocate decided oh let's go ahead and just start doing a seven seven day a week paper in New Orleans women we were on\nThe way the advocate was once a week what were they advocate\nWas only publishing in Baton Rouge so it it it had the Baton Rouge market the times Picayune at the New Orleans market oh\nSo and it has only three days a week they advocate moved over and started publishing in both ... and ... calling the interesting and and so they and and so they started out in a small space and now that you've actually grown into a really large space and it's just more I think\nThis is the worst thing is for that used to be advertise with ties to hear that you always see the New Orleans advocate the New Orleans\nDowntown ... are they getting the same paper in Baton Rouge Ronald Blake Orleans or are there some\nContent but it's definitely different concepts because nobody in Orleans really cares about what's going on in Baton Rouge and vice versa you rightly different market even though there are about an hour an hour\nHere on the sea coast of New Hampshire there's a cluster of newspapers that dog they share the same ... coastal online\nBut there's like seven different newspapers that are tired of that cluster even do that and they largely press the same stuff so what you're saying or is it what\nVernon what you're saying is that when the the service of printing a daily paper left New Orleans another company came in to fill that service believing that there was enough business enough people that wanted to buy newspapers and you're saying it's worked out for them\nOh absolutely yes Don stretch it stretched pushed back when the ... decided to do that and\nAnd so yeah ... yeah the ... there were later shift as a Google the advocate that they advocate New Orleans you're probably these stories about it but it's just a A N and neither one of the sites or cable so there's so much competition that\nThat you could actually read the entire thing online for free but there's so many people have to rely\nOn that traditional paper that\nWe have a we have a thriving market now that the the ... paper is substantially larger way it's published like on Sunday Wednesday and effort like friday I think riding um but and there's a lot of you know a lot of stuff so it's still a surviving but it's just amazing that it's\nYou know that there's other newspapers in like twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen could just put them on it and ...\nYeah I mean that's like shocking to me are there are a bunch of old people that live in New Orleans I mean I don't understand it seems so it seems so counterintuitive no\nBecause it's a few skill it up in your costs go down a you know it may actually work yeah but you're only talking about printing costs you still have to have the costs of delivery we are but you know I mean I suspect that a lot of the content by just by what he's saying you're sharing content which today I bet you have a lot of\nContent but again a lot of it is that shared and and if you can see that you go to the adventure dot com you could be how the content is not unique content in both in New Orleans the Baton Rouge tradition and some news to make it worthwhile plowed to read so\nBurning thanks for sharing that story I really appreciate it very interesting that something like that could even happen you know this one doesn't feel doesn't mean every other business model would fail them more coming up ...\nI ... bridge repeat or I tend to repeat it has a business I Do have a business and the problem red repeat the same tier democratizing over and over you know it doesn't work over and over ... bread is about this deal does\nThis advertising budget is this new network Google smart way refrigeration potential customers would be most affordable national advertising rates period disorder to was in the news is good news network ... ... email ... don't come from\nThe United states and empire is a book they claim that the United states is the empire of\nGeorge Washington had warned us against more and more as your items base of empire shows the world\nWhereas a hearing keen this little town of twenty three thousand or city with a twenty three thousand ends up your alley [laughter] and uh they believe they're a city but uh this particular town I did an article in the city back\nIn twenty Thirteen so now five years ago actually since this article came out a titled sentinel locks down Web content as circulation sharply declines according to cause newspapers\nIn order to sell their advertising has to be able to claim a certain circulation Ray Price so they have to know at\nAt minimum how many people have the newspaper in their hands are they believe have them in their hands on a daily basis and so there are companies third party a auditors that come in to\nCreate that number for the paper because you don't just want to believe what the paper says there's actually an auditor that gets hired to come in and you know verify invalidate the the claims supposedly and in this case it's the alliance for audited media AKA the audit bureau circulation\nA which shows that the that knows paid daily average circulation numbers were seriously down in just the last five years and this was after twenty Thirteen\nSo it'd be interesting to get another update here five years later yeah I Know what they are now but in twenty Thirteen their average paid circulation was eight thousand eight hundred and Seventy four which is down more than twenty six percent from two thousand and eight when it was twelve thousand one hundred and Nineteen and\nIn Nineteen Ninety thirty two thousand three so five years prior to that it was Thirteen thousand nine hundred and Ninety eight and then ten years prior Nineteen Ninety three was Fifteen thousand seven hundred and four so their pain most households then in ... well yeah you're probably delivered a little outside of keen to but you know to that you know yes\nBut I mean that's a huge drop all talk about a forty three percent drop you don't want to hear you know what I mean he says is that the ...\nThey have um when you go to the site there they limited number of you so are you going to be maybe like five hours or less you do a private browser because you get around us right right [laughter]\nYou know what they are just that just blows my mind because the advertising if I'm not mistaken pays more than you know or what they're gonna make from revenue from from ... from I understand\nYeah it'll denial advertise more my understanding is that the case yeah um so it's kind of weird that you know an entity a newspaper would\nYou know a reduced the number of views and this has always been the argument there's always there's there has been an argument and newspapers of whether or not to let everybody access at freely because advertising pays more or to lock down the block it out right and\nYou know obviously the argument for walking it down is well you know it's it's just this mindset that\nYou know we'll get more money from the users that we have a really but they only get it for actually it's like a one hour span or something and family small obviously it can work when you don't lock it down that's what the ad\nIs right down in New Orleans your calls and thoughts are welcome maybe you have worked in
