eight five five four or five zero three seven three three we've also got our discord chats which you can join over discord dot L. R. N. dot at them and there is another chat there's the twitch chats which isn't really that it is easy\nIt's not really a place where people do much chatting but every now and then somebody will pop in there\nAnd I am in there so andme odd [noise]\nBut there's a newer chat participant there Chuck who is a he seems concern that that we're not paying enough attention to the the ...\nAnd I just wanted to kind of explain the reason why\nIt's because we're not primarily on which the show's been around since two thousand and two which was before you know video was even really ... you know the Internet ... you could get video on the Internet but it was usually really small ... you know not the best quality\nUm and now which is amazing as far as video quality is concerned and it is a great platform um but it was originally intended for games dreamers people who were streaming video games and that's probably Ninety five percent of what you're going to find if you go on twitch Dutch TV that is what you're you're likely going to see there\nAre but they did expand a couple of years ago there are categories to allow for other kinds of content\nAnd so when I was given the chance to look for new video streaming provider earlier this year I chose twitch and it's been it's been great so far uh but you know which is more of a also you know we're also on twitch right we've got a hundred and Ninety radio stations\nOr that ... am and FM across the United states at various times throughout the week with of course a live streaming audio through our website an L. R. N. dot at them and we're on satellites are free to air satellite over sub Saharan Africa and north and Central America so while I can understand where Chuck is coming from in his concern that\nYou know we need to be interacting more on the air with a twitch chat\n'cause that's what he's used to when he watches 'cause if you watch one of the video game streamers\nThey're constantly you know as long as they're not like you know in the midst of some sort of fire fight in the video game they're playing 'cause it's kinda hard to concentrate on you know shooting everything that moves and also read what's going on in your chat room at the same time\nUm as long as it's like a more down tempo game where you can easily kind of look over at the chat window it's fun to you know interact with the chat\nOn it it it adds an extra level of of interactivity in it and I agree with Chuck that it definitely is is more welcoming but we can't like\nCan you imagine how bad radio it would be if we were like every time somebody likes are stream or comes into the chat room or says something that we're like welcome to the ...\nYou know like welcome to the channel Jimmy or whatever I like that wouldn't be ... that wouldn't be a list unable radio show it's very it might be an interesting podcast up there is a very small even a pod cast because then you've got audience listening later podcast as a as a downloadable thing\nRight ... only for live interactions so I I say\nThat as somebody that listens to a pod cast that does their pod cast is the audio of their twitch stream\nAnd they read off certain chat out of the ... and then uh you know if somebody winds up buying some of their merge during the show they'll re oh this guy in this town just bought a thing from us [laughter]\nPlus I mean the twisters are really good at being I mean some of them are not so good at it but some of them are pretty good at trolling so a lower read something from it out red monkey Barrow says so what you're saying is we're not important enough for you [laughter]\nKnow what I'm saying is is that nobody is important enough for us to read off all listed shatters or whatever it is this going out every now and then\nIt's important enough for us to read off all listed shatters or whatever it is it's going out every now and then we'll reference it right like right sometimes I'll get on I'll say oh in the discord chat they're talking about filling the black you know whatever it is they're talking about I don't know what they're talking about right now I think there are making fun of Zack who's one of the uh the Tatars and they found is mug shots or something like that\nI think that went by a few minutes ago so every now and then we will highlight what is going on in these places but the most important people\nTo a talk show besides the fact that you know there are listeners out there we don't have listeners will have a show for it because nobody's listening but as far as the elements of the show are concerned it's the callers and so if you want to be\nThat important just get on the line we got open phones at eight fifty five four fifty free that's eight five five four or five zero three seven three three or and I recommend this you joined our discord server you can still chat and the twitch China that's where you prefer\nAh but you do have to join the discourse you wanna get on our discord calling line from sound like you're in the studio like\nJean the Christian an artist and that's how you guarantee to get your name on the radio as you call the show it's talk radio that's what we do gene you're on free chocolate go ahead\nJean ... are you there yeah you know he's on muted I don't know why he's not talking maybe there's some technical issue on his side normally a gene works out pretty good and you sounds great so we'll probably try to get him on here\nShortly the toll free number tonight is eight fifty five four fifty free so here's the story that I think it was Ben who called in the moments ago\nI Believe he was referring to uh from CNBC a group of nuns and other faith based investors won a shareholder vote at sturm Ruger and company\nRequiring this was earlier this year are requiring one of the nation's largest gun makers to prepare a report about the risks of its business Ruger CEO Christopher kill all a set of the company's annual meeting on Wednesday that the company will comply and prepare the report you said shareholders spoken\nBut he added the winning proposal quote cannot force us to change our business and cannot change what Ruger is about and what we stand for unquote\nSo there he is saying okay you know we'll do your report but\nWe're still gonna sell guns but I mean do you think that you're going to be able to take over a river 'cause the caller was suggesting taking over somehow the shareholders meeting we need to buy shares of McDonalds and have them stop selling big backs\nSo he said that the winning again was the first major tests this year for faith based shareholder groups which have been urging the nation's gun industry to act after recent examples of gun pilots\nThe shareholder groups have reached out to a big banks and investment firms for their support an effort that has paid off in this instance black rock of the world's largest asset manager and sturm Ruger largest shareholder because of its giant index fund business voted it's two point eight million shares in favor of the shareholder proposal a source told CNBC\nVanguard is the largest sex she'd be the second largest shareholder notes\nVote is unknown a spokesperson wasn't immediately available specifically the proposal\nBacked by Catholic health initiatives and the northwest coalition for responsible investment asks gun makers like sturm Ruger to prepare a report about the financial and reputational risk associated with their business the shareholders plan to introduce a similar proposal on the proxy of American outdoor brands another gun maker but typically holds its meetings in the fall\nTo major shareholder voting advisory firms institutional shareholders services in glass Lewis threw their support behind the proposal well sturm rigors board had advised against it\nSince February shooting at the Florida high school that left Seventeen people dead there has been a surge of activism to stop further gun violence involving a range of constituents from the high school students who survived the shooting to major banks retailers and investment firms we've heard of banks closing accounts right for instance for some of these gun manufacturers\nColleen scale in chief advocacy officer of Catholic health initiatives to his president at the meeting to introduce the proposals that quote a new momentum has emerged over these last few months it's so significant that the majority of shareholders are asking their company to consider gun safety\nBlack rock set in a no to clients in March that it would reach out to gun makers to try to get them to talk about their business and added that it could use it positioned as a major shareholder vote against directors and in favor of shareholder\nProposals slipped even if this were true you could actually have some sort of substantive change to these companies and basically just the you know the the you know it was like yeah you're not going to stop us from doing as a threat even if you could it would just mean the companies would stop going public\nRights they would just stay private and they keep their rules to themselves [noise] we're coming up here in Rome is

A. A. did it and I don't know\nWhether there was actual law but I'm sure there was some kind of a bill passed\nBut the whole idea that they they're saying is for safety air safety well it yeah it it and it could be for air safety but it isn't really required because aviation safety is already one of the highest that you can achieve I mean our air safety is very very good record so what\nDo I would imagine that commercial airlines are already on board with this ride like they want their planes are at all times and you know that way you know they get lost or\nCrawl all commercial aviation currently has on ADS be two and a good portion of private aviation has already on it\nBut the thing is what they're what we're afraid of what I'm afraid of is anytime you make a slight violation of the rules they're going to know about it and they're going to come after you and eventually I think you're going to see a lot of pilots that are going to be losing their their pilot licenses\nBecause they violated the rules too many times\nAnd it's just another way for big brother to keep an eye on yet and I'm going to tell now be unable to fire airplane around the country was a pretty a freedom\nA noted airplane is registered in another country where ATF FBI isn't required\nThat the way around if you fly in that controlled airspace you will be required to have any ideas\nThe damn dude sorry to hear about that thank you for I guess they got ya\nRight where they want to thank for the call Jean the Christian anarchist love our chatter is there and the discord Chad you can join him and others over at this court dot L.

please and we were talking about that a moment ago where\nA this is a very invasive thing now you know\nIf you're in a relationship with somebody\nTo some extent there is a value to being able to share everything with that person\nBut there's also some value to the partner respecting your privacy right so it's kind of a tough line to draw for some people and then there's also the whole thing of trust\nRight where you trust your partner um which means that you let them have their privacy but at the same time I can understand the desire for somebody to one total openness\nJust commonsense

super controlling relationships and again it's not necessarily just the woman who's going to create a list of ridiculous outrageous rules like this but in this case uh that's what has happened\nAnd to some of these rules will probably ring a bell or had been ringing bills for people who've been in relationships with very controlling insecure people who feel like they can just forced their way into a good relationship\nAnd I'm Sorry I just don't think that these rules\nAre made for a happy relationship\nAnd that this raid relationship is likely not going to get better\nUh once the rules are imposed that's just a matter of how many days will it last how many more weeks will it continue well is a roller twenty two year cat breakup with me because of all of these rules\nNow that that one's not in here but uh the final rule and by the way I Will post these on our social media so Twitter\nAnd a mastodon but not Facebook because I'm not on Facebook anymore and mark didn't want us posting

dot com so one of those three methods we'll get your show prep when we share it with you and so the final item here\nI'm On the list of rules for being in a relationship with this princess is\nYou are to never take longer than ten minutes to text me back\nThat's crazy ... and you know she's not there maybe she's on you know some work trip\nOr something like that and you've gone to bed well you better have that alarm real loud on your your notification real out on your phone so you can get back to her I don't even have notifications on my ...\nPeriod like it goes off for tornadoes and your interests here and let\nMe think having sex with somebody else if you don't ... yeah every ten minutes yeah\nOr you could be shopping get all the ... and checking out or whatever yeah\nYeah so there you go or do you want to see the full list of post them on our social media and again if you want to weigh in here maybe you can relate to this you've been in a terrible relationship like this\nUm I can relate to this I never actually had any kind of lift the rules like this even my most controlling relationship was nowhere near this bad it might have had like two or three or something like that\nOut of the the twenty two rules was the first first one that I've had and of course the the thing about relationships is you know the more you have the more you learn what you don't want right like when you get together with somebody\nAnd it doesn't work out for whatever reason well usually that's a learning experience and then you can take that what you learned about what you can handle and what you can't\nBecause ultimately everybody's crazy right like you know people say it just be crazy or whatever well let me think British or the guys are crazy too yeah I'm just uh I don't sleep with them so I don't know you know how crazy the guys are I bet if I started sleeping you've got a roommate though [laughter] that's true but I didn't sleep with them right but you witnessed how crazy they were\nNo I don't think I Would have known how half of how crazy they wear because unless you're actually in the relationship you don't really get to witness the Craig oh you do see the full crazy but you get to see part of the crazy\nYou know I didn't really know what they were doing because they're generally weren't with whoever their relationship was while they were living with me 'cause it's kind of were in their own room and like every now and then they might bring somebody in there but that was I didn't know what was going on there was none of my business\nSo um yeah you don't really get to understand a crazy relationship until you've been in one I mean you can see it from the outside it rationally if it's starting to boil over into the person's life like you know she's ... she's senior you can't hang out with your friends except for a couple of times a\nWeek maximum right or they're not allowed to hang out over at our house and get all these rules so if she all of a sudden shows up at the bar and starts you know shrieking because you're hanging out with your friends but then yeah you know this person's in a crazy relationship beyond if they're just\nBecause you're hanging out with your friends but then yeah you know this person's in a crazy relationships beyond if they're just complaining about it right but normally all you end up hearing as one side which is to say one sided complaining about the other side\nYou have to find somebody is crazy and I weigh that compatible with ...\n... yes that is the key somebody that you can love and you know appreciate their their special brand crazy at All right 'cause he does have it or you can just tolerate it right like ... but we actually had a guy in the chat room saying that he would put up with worse than this\nLike we just went through some of the most restrictive controlling rules that you could possibly imagine and there's somebody in the chat room is who basically said if I were attracted to the girl enough I put up with even more than this and it's like really\nI get to tell you exactly what to where I get to tell you exactly what I eat when to eat where to eat out to eat\nI mean some people you know as I said there's all websites dedicated that some people that's their thing like ... like you know twenty four seven total power exchange relationships\nLike wow hey what are you paying would ever let your boat you know but to me like\nNo thank you I like I'm having a relationship where you come in as equals\nAnd one person isn't trying to put a bunch of rules and controls over the other person right some sort of crazy power imbalance here because this girl's got some issues right she's got some serious in security issues now maybe some bad things have happened to her in the past may write some buddies cheated on her more than one person\nHas cheated on her in that sucks he needs therapy when I\nI I really don't yet this is just page one of the pay dock your bed ...\nAnd the rest of the pages somehow got lost okay I'm going to say it's not because what I'm looking at here on the picture of the of the document there's eight fold at the very bottom so like this takes up the whole page basically by twenty something rules at the very bottom maybe about an inch or\nMaybe an inch and a half is folded up and you can't actually see I think they did it to obscure the person's signatures cause you can see okay a little bit like a little swirl of what appears to be a signature popping out from that okay I Believe this was a one page document with a signature\nMaybe more than one signature down at a at the bottom OK from the parties involved\nSo again toll free number if you want to join us here eight fifty five four fifty free eight five five
