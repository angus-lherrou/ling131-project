talking about Facebook and they're just blatant hypocrisy of cracking down on a couple of Russian companies that were allegedly\nUsing data that they were scraping as\nIt's called which is basically another term for downloading a off of Facebook and claiming a Facebook claiming that they were somehow doing you favor by protecting you from these dastardly Russian data scrapers when of course Facebook's doing the exact same thing ... pretty much any government that would ask them\nOr to do it they've already you know through your consent and if you're a Facebook user built a data profile they've got ten years of my life or\nThat you know always going to be there and you don't control that they\nIt's maybe it's something that you can go into in you know you have the illusion of being able to delete a photograph or you have the illusion of being able to delete a\nYour update that you might have put oh whoops I messed up I didn't mean to tell you that\nUh you went and get deleted it well guess what it is still in their database it's not gone yeah they've got everything that you've ever typed into their their database and even if you deactivate your account they won't let you delete them\nAnymore right or you know even if you deactivate your account it's still in their database and even if you were to delete your account I bet you would still be okay lawyers have of course oh everything you've given them you give it to\nIncluding the consent likely as part of their terms of service to utilize those photos and those that data and not just to turn it over law enforcement but also the use them in their advertising or whatever other way they want to you know make money off of that\nSo what do you do about it well you could leave Facebook\nIf you wanted to set option uh that's that's an option I Would I Would recommend it I mean to me it's it's been a big time saver for me I spent a lot of time\nAnd you've done some of this recently yourself and I know that on Twitter you made an announcement recently saying you are no longer going to respond to the trolls basically or anybody makes it better but almost no one gets a response or if somebody really want to hear from ride lower or well it's the ones that I Will\nRespond to it sometimes if somebody is asking something related to my company ... you know another developer or something and say oh it is there a link to like you're a PI where I could and it's just\nSay oh it is there a link to like you're a PI where I could and it's just a quick for me to do that but to respond to someone who's making a criticism positive or negative\nNo more I really don't I haven't done anything on my personal Facebook posted anything for years on that but like my Facebook page also no longer responding yep I I I you know I'm not really sure about like fully deleting it but I'm just I'm not using it anymore and de activated you could say adios rated so\nThe only way they'll delay or account when you're going through the activation process there's another option to opt into deletion when you die so you have to I think you have to like identify a person from whom Facebook can then get notice of your demise

A. B. Q. in Albuquerque the I'm formerly Clear Channel now I heart media ... progressive talk station one of the few progressive talk stations remaining in the United states by the way I'm Glad you finally found us there Sara we've been on there for a couple of years now\nBut they don't fight I don't know I I don't think we can get a guy like maybe a month ago Monday to friday and Saturday not waiting

or as a city so Netflix is now the new owner of that in ... thanks Sarah for the call tonight and by the way to make the correction here it's only been a year's still feels like a couple of but uh\nCall tonight and butter or make the correction here it's only been a year still feels like a couple but\nAl ... came on with ... actually almost in in exactly a year ago it was the sixteenth October in twenty Seventeen so I'm Glad to still be on their way or the one of the only shows then by the way I don't know if you knew this but uh you know we get a hundred and Ninety radio station I didn't know that I Am and FM but we're one of the only shows probably the only\nUh issues oriented show because you know there's like doctor shows and there's you know gardening shows\nThose shows appear on both progressive and conservative shirt Asians\nBut where do you know I think we're the only issues oriented show that actually appears on both progressive and conservative talk stations across the United states we're we hold that title and there's really nobody else\nThat can do it because everybody else's so partisan a every all the other talk show hosts out there are so either in their Republican camp or in their Democrat camp\nAnd they you know that's it and get it you don't see any cross pollination between those shows but we talk loud even though there aren't many progressive talk stations left in the United states\nThere's still a handful and we're on most of them\nWell what it is is that I think most people can agree that they don't want violence placed against them where where the progressive and conservative disagree is aware they think it's appropriate to enforce the violence against others and rainy on the other hand just think ah\nNo how about we don't enforce how about we don't use violence ... violence coercion as a as a tool you had a radical I mean they'll radical so crazy don't don't hurt people and don't take their stuff I Know it's way way out there why to two year old so I said I just cried it at\nA I was recently interviewed by the border of or the executive board or not executive the editorial board at the center because I'm running for state Senate here and that's what I used to describe this was like yeah this is basically pre school level philosophy that's right\nThat's right I mean that that's what we're talking about here is\nHere we are in the year twenty Eighteen and the twenty first century and humans have still not really absorb the lessons that they were taught in preschool yes that's right like they might have absorb them while they were on the pre school playground or whatever but as soon as they grew up\nAnd became a dumb putting quotes around that and became adults well then all of a sudden the whole leave you know don't use violence against people don't aggress against others don't hit the other kid you know just 'cause you don't like the way he looks or whatever that are just went out the window if you don't just take their stuff\nThrown out yours is not yours don't you take it sharing the nice value but it has to be done voluntarily\nRight otherwise it's not a value at all it is it is amazing and so that's why it's not surprising to me that I'm a progressive station would be like oh yeah we'll play this because I agree with about\nEighty five percent of that and then a conservative station would be like we'll play this because I agree with eighty five percent of that and then yeah that's really about them\nGoing within themselves and cleaning out that Fifteen Percent of corrected\nThat's in there because that's really what it is they've got Fifteen Percent that they need to work on and being you're being very nice by saying I and I I Know that well I'm I'm going with the I I'm going with the ideal progressive or in this case or the ideal a right winger and the other case\nYeah it's probably a little more than Fifteen Percent but that's just for them to get it cleared out within their own heart\n... and that's what needs to happen I mean 'cause that's all it has to do is that people just have to change what's in their hearts they have to change their understanding of what all of this is because the government is a is really good at\nMaking you believe making people believe that it's something different than what it really that's all right but it's something more than just the most that's Harry brown put it the libertarian presidential candidate from Nineteen Ninety six and two thousand that it's something different than\nJust the most
