and then I met him are probably about seven or eight years ago he started getting involved with our organization and\nA command juggling with us or every Thursday\nHere in Austin so I mean obviously a juggling hand eye coordination you ought to be on your you know on your game takes probably a lot of practice did you start when you were a kid\nI did I taught myself to do a cascade when I was about you know like early teenager and I don't know how to type cascade is just a basic three ball um and it's the most basic the matter is like a figure eight ah that's that's the shape of the cascade pattern\nAnd are taught myself to do that and you know could do it a little bit but didn't really take it anywhere or do anything else with it other than pick it up like once or twice a year just to remind myself how to do it\nAnd then when I got to Austin in the early nineties or\nThe Texas traveling society was already going pretty strong at that point [noise]\nUh and once I started going to social meetings and a social juggling is is another dimension of it I mean what that is so it's just basically uh their clubs all over the country they get together usually once a week\nAnd just get together hang out juggle do a lot of passing social juggling is you know it does imply a certain amount of of interaction so when you see two jugglers growing like what are called out on the clubs clubs clubs balls and rooms are the primary uh\nTools or instruments juggler and then uh yeah you just to\nHang out with them learn new tricks um\nHe get various patterns going especially with multiple people and you can change things around quite a bit and there's really no end of what you can do a juggling these days and then of course some people take it to an extreme with flaming

I was planning to some of those last night\nTo watch that yeah I was planning to some of those last night and they are interesting photos ...\nYeah so a Texas juggling society are so it's been around

everyone will be as a lot of a lot of people from a novice to ass right that's right and ranging from age\nThree up to Ninety three wow yeah yeah it's a it's the full gamut and then there's also a

talking to us here in fact right now it's actually the first wallet company we've talked to so far I don't know if there's anybody else here but Daniel a rule Raj is here from\nThe malls Wallace and it's a well that is so new it's not even really available yet but uh you're excited about it a Daniel welcome to talk on the ... yeah I'm very excited about it tell me when I'm you know with all the different while it's out there there's a variety of options in the marketplace many of them have been there for years\nWhat was it that they you know inspired you guys to create another one what would you want to bring to the table this that different tell me what's exciting about\nThis yeah absolutely [noise] so we're building I've all over building a wall it that the pay pal or ... for ... for Mitt quaint [noise] so we want to make it very easy for you\nRight now we believe that a lot of them all up to a very hard to use a myself when I started you know trends acting with ... last year it was challenging it was kind of ... of a technical and we want to make it easy for everyone to that you can participate and you know center has access to your peers and your friends and also use it as a pain\nYou're showing me yesterday briefly a demo of uh what's what might be up soon and paid a release of a of a wallet and what is it that makes it easier because there was like a way to connect without actually having a scan of cue our code tell me about some of the other option\n... so we have a contact management service and what that pretty much means as you can ask someone else as a friend or a connection and once you do that\nYou can actually hair individual wallets that you create so for example if I Want him if one of hair private while I Would just another person I can add in and I'll share my uh well God created wallet and O'Hare might specific while at the end do you need me to be in front of you to do that or not at all you can be anywhere you want to be around the world\nTelling me how are you adding me 'cause normally if I'm standing somebody's wallet it's a cue our code is a long string of letters numbers is a three at email via phone number what's the message that\nSo you can log and use hearing this thing life forms that if you have an email you can simply log and using email you can log in using Facebook so I don't need to create a new log in to use won't while it is not at all okay so if you want you can create a new log in France So basically the user is in control of how they logging\nAnd we want to make it where you choose if you advocate Hubbard whatever it is you can log and using that okay and what you could create a new law again if I wanted to 'cause I don't know like I don't trust Facebook exactly that most of these are the face to face of myself [laughter] um but uh yeah some someone chooses to someone ...\nDo you fear in logging plug in and once you do um I can ... you logging okay and I'll have his act that is you know his username and once I Do that I can create a wallet and share it with them and sharing it means I only\nName and once I Do that I can create a wallet and share it with them and sharing it means I only share him with him the account address basically colic key the public or the public address um so once I share that with him he can share with me and now we're going to\nGo which he won't even while he even see or to where the person with whom you shared at will even see what the key is or is it just like oh this is Ian you ... you know money so that\nThat's not the cool part you don't have to see if you don't want to okay so if you're a technical if you're into space you want to know you really can't okay and if not you just stand at the end and her ... year it's going to go so we want to be you want to cater to the average user right and also want to cater to the technical either who's already in the ...\nI Love it I Love it I think it's really important because you know mass adoption is obviously it's still a hill that were barely climbing up you know the beginnings of fear at\nThis absolutely I think it's very early and user experiences lacking in that space it's a big problem which is you know causing people to lose their id their lose your wallet and and this is all kind of intertwined and I think either experience security is important for adoption and ... that technology and the whole\nSo okay let's uh let me give me a tough question here so Facebook somebody a mixed the mistake I'm going to call it a mistake I'm standing up on Facebook even though you're giving them their options are and then Facebook shut down their accounts and how do they get can they get back into that account on\nAlthough all it though if you if you're logging in ... um basically what happens if you own your private key on your phone friday so bought all it doesn't have ... here he needed a space but no one does there's only a method of logging and\nSo if you already backed up your private keys in your account area mnemonic we offer different methods then you're going to go okay you lose your phone a new problem\nOkay so there is a key backup so this is something we always tell people about the up and I are gene you just got your bitcoin wallet and you've been given hook up with a bunch of different crypto this uh this weekend and you did your backup right like you wrote down the username and password\nI'm with his wallet apparently you don't need the backup you just need to remember he used a name and password in because the backup a story about online here it was what ed wallet and ... but I like this idea of pay pal because I've been using pay pal for over ten years now\nIt's just incredibly easy to use and I have\nDifferent credit accounts there and I suppose you could replace those with different ... different crypto does and I just have a default one that I make my payments prominent I Want to choose a separate one it's just it's basically to click and I'm paid you know I mean we\nWant we want to make it so you're very familiar is this going to be multi crypto full well yeah that's multi crypto you know a starting with you know the coin a theory M and our working with partners who want to participate in are you [laughter] so uh this\nSounds very exciting or are you always good to hear people considering the new user people considering people who\nWe want to bring onboard we want people to be as Tamil you're with crypto currency as pay pal and Ben ... but not have to know anything about how it works I mean as exciting as we find block Shane technology the average person ... really don't need to know how crypto currency works out of that it does work\nAbsolutely not ... not the reason we started vault and want to make it very easy for the user and also participate and owning your own bank account [noise]\nAnd so yes you can\nHave the backup phrase this is so important in gene you talked about a username and password with the with the edge\nAnd that's basically your backup price you still should write those things down because in that case if you forget either one of those things you're screwed during lose your money for ever told my wife so she's always bounce that now that's important um and then you know when or what whatever the wall is yeah you always have to get that back a phrase written down\nAnd keep it in a safe place someplace preferably that's not gonna be burned by fire we talked with the the bill photo people it seems like a good solution to avoid a house fires and things like that so there are important provisions to consider if you got to keep more than ten bucks worth of a a big point in this wallet than really take a take a moment to figure out what\nHappens if my phone breaks breaks you got to think about those things because like you said you are basically your own bank account there's nobody to turn to you can't email or the folks will revolt wallet and say hey I lost my password Fred you can't do that\nYou have to pay exactly and I think in the future that's going to be even more ways um called ... then you'll start seeing that and the future to make a make it even easier for your security um so I just keep up with what the current technology that's out right now and I think you'll be good to go\nDaniel Ross thank you for coming on free talk lived the wallet dot ... fear

anonymous transactions from your mobile device in any payment that you do\nSo cool now um we talked to I mentioned briefly that there there was the rebranding it used to be in cash now their eyes and the\nClient itself crypto still called then just um but the idea was well this is a bigger vision than just a crypto currency than just a private crypto currency then you know having a bunch of nose and you know all the all the great stuff you've already talked about but there's more that you've got\nFor the future um right now there's private chat that's available with the the full mode that is um but there's also I've heard that you guys are talking about doing some kind of anonymity on the Internet\nBrowsing well there is so let me let me step through on how we're getting to that to a few of the things that we want to make sure is to address any um a past possible attack vector against the crypto currency so\nPart of that is we had to make sure that every aspect of it as decentralized and are not capable being attacked so right now for the news that we keep up and running we pay them\nThat's a centralized system we need to move that to a decentralized system operated by the notes themselves the second thing that we need to do is the actual political control of what's going to happen with horizon in the future that needs to be moved\nTo a voting system and we're using a liquid democracy model a liquid democracy is a little ... I'm not sure his ... with it you know it's I'm so there's direct democracy everybody votes representative democracy you vote for your representatives\nLiquid democracy you delegation your vote on different areas to people that are experts so I'd encourage you to look up a liquid democracy is rather new concept in the last couple of decades\nUm but at that point when we have those two major things running on our system mhm then were completely a decentralized now in order on those two things on the system we don't want to put those in the maintain because our our our block or database would get too big so we\nCreated something called site change so side chains is a a\nMore creative and faster running application environment that runs on our system and we're going to we are just release our side chains white paper last week\nAnd we're going to implement the treasury in voting on it or the secure no payments and then we're going to open up for other developers who do the types of third party systems that you want to have\nNo trust in third party on and be able to raise your knowledge groups and example of that might be someone developing a VPN system that runs on our system that again incorporates the privacy and trust us nature\nOf the crypto currency privacy platform that we are now\nIt's amazing I I Love where you guys are going with this then there's constant development and I hope that we get to continue to update our listeners on the future of what was then ... now horizon H.
