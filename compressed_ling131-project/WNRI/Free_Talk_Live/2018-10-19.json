fundraising goals set by the New York road runners but I have a personal goal of five thousand dollars and right now I think I'm about two hundred and sixty five dollars away from that so please\nEven five dollars helps run dot ... dot com nice\nSo um this article it comes to us from the national review which uh woman say will be more conservative\nA paper of than others so we've been holding from today yes definitely more conservative within reason yup I'm or vice but this is titled Mississippi shows need for transparency around civil forfeiture\nThis recent legal invention will continue to turn American principles of presumed innocent and due process on their head in the topsy turvy world of justice Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings we were told that a person should be considered guilty until proven innocent\nAnd that we must always believe accusers even when they're allegations are on verifiable remote and arise under suspicious circumstances\nFor conservatives the hearings where a reminder of why the presumption of innocence is a bedrock American principle and why the founders guaranteed the citizens\nWould not be punished unless they had been convicted of a crime under a fair and impartial process that's actually not what the founders guaranteed they guaranteed that there would not be criminal punishment there there were not be punished met through the court system\nThere we go but long after the Kavanaugh hearings had faded from the spotlight another recent legal invention known as civil asset forfeiture\nWill continue to turn American principles are presumed innocent and due process on their head unlike criminal forfeiture in which the state sees as property of someone convicted of a crime\nCivil forfeiture is based on the tortured legal fiction\nThat property can be quote guilty unquote\nOf being connected to a crime and the civil proceedings can therefore be brought against the property itself instead of its owner right and one thing and I know that the article gets into this but one thing to mention about the way the proceedings\nUh I the court cases if there ever is one\nIn these civil asset forfeiture is the case would be a United States federal government V. two hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars cash right and then someone would have to wind up saying that's my money\nAnd it's not related to drugs and then you have to prove that it's not right you have to prove the innocence\nRight so that there's not a beyond reasonable doubt where the state has to prove that it is it you have to prove to the court it's not so you have to prove a negative correct cars cash guns and even the houses are routinely saved rather than being innocent until proven guilty\nAnd even the houses are routinely sees\nRather than being innocent until proven guilty property owners often have a heavy burden to prove that their property was not connected to a criminal activity and can be punished by having the property forfeited even if they have not been charged with much less convicted of a crime\nThe proceedings usually have minimal judicial oversight and no real due process protections\nTo make matters worse law enforcement agencies get to keep the property they seize which creates a perverse incentive for agencies to abuse the process\nAnd not only that there are also a various allocation or distribution systems deaf does some states will say\nForty five percent goes to the local police department forty five percent goes to the state's general fund and then the other ... percent goes to you know something else right\nWhereas the federal level if you go through this and I forget the term that is used a ... like federal adoption or something to where the local police call up the d._a. or some other alphabet agency\nAnd say hey can you wind up adopting this\nThen the local police keep eighty percent of\nThe proceeds right and you'll often see that used by um states that have passed some law against state you know involvement in the forfeiture had right forfeiture but the feds you know have the fed still have all on the books right and you often\nIn a a lot of places you'll see a really really really nice car that has the police logo on the side and then somewhere on the back it will say this used to be a drug dealer's car now it's hours oh so Mr police officer man your\nLeg admitting to grand theft auto yeah pretty much don't know it's not grand theft auto when we do it only when you do it not surprisingly abuses that have been systemic and well documented for example the sheriff's department in just a photo county Mississippi\nAgreed to return to two thousand six Chevy Trailblazer owned by the mother of a criminal defendant\nBut only of the department was paid one thousand six hundred and fifty dollars so basically what will sell you this truck for sixteen hundred dollars\nBut it's my son's truck I Know but that's the price doesn't matter say we have possession and possession has nine ... the law and we have the key is if you want to give us the same fifty it is common for parents to have their property seized for the alleged criminal activities of their children even if the parents were completely unaware of the alleged crime\nIn many cases the parents enter into an agreement to let the agency's keep all or part of their property\nFurther complicating this pattern is the fact that often the seize property is is worth less\nThan it would cost in legal fees to contest the forfeiture all this leads critics to many forfeiture proceedings as little more than a shakedown this system also allows law enforcement agencies to fund themselves circumventing the legislative appropriations process\nAnd I've heard and no of course this is one of those things too where you'd ever really know what it would cost to take one of these things to court but I've heard that on average it's about ten thousand dollars yeah that's that's a number of that talked\nOut halo and yeah yeah\nYeah we'll we'll talk a little bit more about this and just a few minutes but it is it's disturbing especially if you're not familiar with this process [noise] this is the\nPolice can take it whether you

self interest when these agencies enforce the law civil forfeiture clearly jeopardizes that independence as well as basic American principles of fairness and justice\nOff further reform is needed forfeiture transparency is a basic minimum and should be established in every state\nYes and I ... I\nJust do away with a damn laws uh there's never\nAnd there's no there's no need for it there's no need for civil forfeiture it's it's it's a complete miscarried\nNo need for it there's no need for civil forfeit you're it's it's it's a complete\nMiscarriage of justice I mean it's it's it when I first heard of it I was reminded of the er which trials where they would title which are the suspected which up and throw it in the water and if she sank he was innocent but as she floated she was a witch right\nRight and also a talking made out of wood or he turned me into it Newt but I got better but but that's the whole thing I mean we talk about asset forfeiture and if you could argue a legal reason to do it it will because it'd be because I'm\nA let's say I'm I'm at the end I stole all sorts of stuff and I've spent that and then I bought you know guns with it and I was going to use that my next primary ended up off the criminal criminal foreclosure exactly exactly the point being is is that one can make a\nA legal claim that\nCriminal forfeiture is probably not a real violation of rights because there has been a victim you know what I mean right and and those goods can be sold to um you know ... the victim and red bell sorts of things but this idea that it just may have\nMay have been used on a crime we can't prove that it did we're not even gonna try but ... says and a lot of cases the\nCriminals forfeiture is used against people for drug offenses where there are arguably is not a victim\nI don't disagree with that Darrell at all what I Am saying is is that\nYou know through this whole convoluted mess of violating\nEverybody's rights and enriching police departments threat um it just needs to go away and there is no nobody can make a sound case in my mind\nFor civil asset forfeiture there and it doesn't exist but there was a hearing in sub committee and the New Hampshire legislature within the last couple of years to get rid of civil asset forfeiture in New Hampshire\nAnd the police department there were numerous a joke spending for all levels of police but simultaneously said we don't use this but if you pass this bill we're going\nTo lose a bunch of money and think out all the stuff that we won't be able to do to drug dealers right\nWhat's your ...
