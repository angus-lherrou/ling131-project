have to wonder if Mrs Obama is aware of took feels warnings of the consequences of being too dependent on government\nTo be sure Mrs Obama didn't say she prefers ignoring voters is however fair to observe that her husband like most politicians that nothing's who disabuse the public of the idea that government should continually expand into new areas based on the opinions of voters\nWell to be fair\nWhoever the author of this article is the Republicans do the same thing they just want to expand it in the areas that they like right oh we can't cut the military even though we wind up spending more on military then what is it the next\nEight or nine countries combined you have a we had to cut back on\nAny of these other things because reasons\nOh we can't cut farm subsidies\nWhere we can't do this we can't do that because you know we we've got to keep growing the government but I support small government bright no you don't you\nDo until it starts to affect your vote and that's that's
