university cut time of year Penn State parents entail gator Scott Olsen said that ah early Saturday morning a police officer asked the fraternity tailgating next to his group to move one space over and now it's not clear\nIf Olson was the person who called the police in\nOr what the reason was for the police initially asking for them to move us space over ... um because later in the story Olson was one of the victims of this uh situation in fact Olson said quote there was no fighting or big disruption\nNo one was doing anything crazy or outlandish we didn't have any issue with them talking about the tale gators the ones that were supposedly rowdy\nWe didn't have any issue with them all day he said he did report scratched his Mercedes Benz truck thanks to a flying tense instead of girl his tailgate was cut on the face from the breed because again loses tuning in the police bringing a helicopter after having failed to simply order the rally folks to leave the area\nOf the leaders of

point across blink canopies cetera unquote the sheer lack of concern over what the potential damage could have been as outrageous people could have been severely injured by flying tents and debris or worse\nIf the pilot would have lost control over the students the results could have been catastrophic especially considering the concentration of people on the ground it could've been pure carnage\nAnd he was flipping about um when I was watching the videos just kind of frightening\nCan you imagine if a helicopter sent to breathe that hit a horse and it got spooked and then started trampling the kids this could have been a tragedy said Olson again the man who observing all of this and there were head police horses there it's not like just you know that's where they brought in first right where the the horses\nAre quote if that helicopter at any type of accident you would have had people shredded everywhere and cars on fire it's ... it's so fortunate that there wasn't a major tragedy yesterday unquote\nNaturally and insanely enough the police are standing by their decision to endanger the lives of high level it doesn't ... few rowdy college kid that's because working for the ...\nSo it's a ... few rowdy college kid that's because working for the government means you'd never have to say you're sorry on Monday they were forced to respond to the myriad of inquiries as to why they would do such a thing here is their statements\nAnd there's another update to this story by the way but first their initial statement ... the front of the police quote we understand the concerns had been raised regarding police activity during tailgate celebration here that you've served don't like\nThe way you're being ruled\nIn one locked in advance to the Penn State versus Ohio State game on Saturday September twenty ninth university police wishes to reassure fence that officers were responding to the circumstances on the ground which involve numerous law violations\nIncluding serious threats to\nOfficer safety\nNobody else was apparently in nature it was the officers there were unsafe within a disorderly crowd they say oh unruly individual refused to disperse following verbal commands and at least one officer\nSuffered injuries\nDon't really tell you why the officers suffered injuries for all we know he got within the face with one of these tents that the uh the helicopter ended on throwing up it's rare to have got an officer with an injury so anything that everything was fine he goes on to say\nIt's rare to resort to these quotes and\nI'm having the culture extended interventions\nUnquote this is a this is under attack with a helicopter landed intervention [laughter] however\nWhen all other warnings from the mounted I've just imagining like a you know a door mounted fifty towel with nothing but rubber [noise]\nBrandon about unless it's just an intervention\nHad to intervene they wouldn't listen to our mounted police you know he goes on to say when all of their warnings from the mounted police unit officers on the ground where ignored a Pennsylvania state police helicopter so differently at Pennsylvania state\nPolice that's what it is that that makes more sense that a Pennsylvania state police will have a helicopter them state College Pennsylvania or a ... the Penn State college\nYou had better bat that they would love to have a mounted you know gun kind of candidate on there that would she rubber bullets\nIf they had it a sure way to use the Pennsylvania state police helicopter was deployed as another tool to compel the group to disperse and curb dangerous and unruly behavior following the use of the helicopter the dangerous behaviors dissipated\n[laughter] people picking through the rubble trying to deal with their wounds all drunk God what a scene\nSo it doesn't end there as I clicked on to state college dot com which is a local I think newspaper in the area to see if there was a update on this case are there is story from today\nAfter a low flying state police helicopter deployed for crowd dispersal cause disruption at tailgate outside of beaver stadium Saturday Penn State police and public safety is at least temporarily this continuing use of helicopters for crowd announcements that flaw got grounded pending a review yeah\nSo it's not a real stoppage it's just a first show stoppage okay we're serious worse there is about this or we understand you guys are concerned we're going to stop using a helicopter until we review [laughter] and then when we review it we're not that at all of this will ah will do whatever we\nWant to have fire craft or is that have fire hoses on them I mean I\nI don't give them any ideas [laughter] uh we got more coming up here and there is a little bit more about their review and what they're saying there's another statement here from Penn State police number eight fifty five four fifty free that's a thought five for five zero three seven three three it is a little confusing is that the Pennsylvania state police or is it the Penn State\nCollege police so we still have state is it every\nYou've been hearing Dr wallich talking about Ninety essential

the country to control their\nAnd doing an undercover by at a tailgate party well that is what started the all of this I understand the liquor decks aren't the state police so yes they are actually the liquor Dix are the state police so that's what they call unless Pennsylvania's different from New Hampshire their state police here\nIf it's so that they're just in the division right you know here here in New Hampshire and I presume it's this way around the around the United states is liquor decks are generally looked at as they're not really cops by cops\nWell that may be true but they still work together or on doing these enforcements and so it's very likely that the U.S Penn State police were involved and do that the liquor cops were operating undercover in that area I can tell you\nInvolved knew that the liquor cops were operating undercover in that area I can tell you I've seen him working together here in Keene they bring out a big old a\n... and they set it up they set it up recently in one of the uh there was like a church nearby college neighborhood they set up an RV and that's where they take people to when they find them under age drinking or walking around with a an open container\nThe cops just love to pick on college students college students don't know their rights they just got out of high school or an easy mark yet\nThat don't know their rights and they're when they're drunk you know there it is very easy to pick on ultimately and so it sounds to me like the cops came in\nThey started making an arrest for an undercover uh liquor by while you know\nPeople get mad when you arrest they're friends for no reason whatsoever for not actually committing an actual crime here that go on yes not bothering these kids are whatever yeah okay so this was it I don't think this was just about the cops coming in and saying we need you to move one space over 'cause that's what the original report was\nThe cops came into these tailgate is is that you need to move over to that space over there and to get her said no so did that happens first and then the cops came in with the undercover officer will never know yeah\nSo anyway completely victimless crime here leading to people being rowdy leading to the cops bringing in horse multiple like a dozen plus horse officers\nTrying to disperse the crowd for some whipping up people even more as a result of that then buzzing in with a helicopter violating if a a a airspace restrictions violating all manner\nOf you know safe helicopter ring and here we are today where you know nothing's going to happen to these officers in any kind of punishment for this um and ultimately somebody got arrested that's for sure nothing's going to happen and some people got hurt as well and people could have gotten hurt a lot worse where to go to your calls and talk to your Socrates is in New Hampshire a soccer teams are on free chocolate go ahead\nPlease have nothing better to do better in a way that they've
