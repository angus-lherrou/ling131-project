Am not by any means I'm an expert in Mexican law but I don't know I have no reason to believe one way or the other if Mexico is as forgiving and lenient about immigration laws is let's say the U.S says wait so you're not sure if they're asked for giving I have no idea but I have no reason to just assume that\nOh yeah we don't know exactly what things are like down there but I Do know some folks

the same as somebody from Mexico or someplace\nWhere it's not even from Guatemala or something right so um the the theory that they have is that if they get caught they will have to pay the fine which is you know nothing for somebody that's from the United states still racking\nYou know still making decent money uh pay the fine and they may be deported back to the United states in that case in which case if they paid the fine presumably they can come back it is the fear is the idea so it's from what they said for what they've heard it's not as bad dealing with the ...\nMicro that how

miss it Texas bitcoin conference\nDot com so we're talking about the migrants or New York times has an interesting story about how basically the Mexican government has been ignored at this point that the thousands of people who were trying to cross from Honduras\nAnd they successfully got through Guatemala and now have gotten through the uh southern Mexican border simply by non cooperation by just getting tired of waiting\nFor the Mexican government to process their applications for asylum and rather than continue to wait on a hot bridge and you know out in the middle of a wherever that is on the west south West End of a of Mexico\nAnd they just decided they're going to jump in the water and a jump in a raft and make their way to the shoreline and at that point the Mexican government decided\nWell there were just going to watch and let it happen and I think it's amazing it's a very interesting story the largest caravan\nEver according to a New York times at least maybe the largest one going through Mexico there may have been larger ones in history it's at some point but uh they're saying here this is a record caravans some have been in the numbers of hundreds of people but never thousands like this\nUh officials said that some migrants might be eligible for humanitarian visas or even safe passage permits that will allow them to travel to the northern border of Mexico and apply for protection in the United states in response to another migrant Caribbean last spring Mexican officials distributed hundreds of safe passage permits to pay to the participants\nThe revived caravan started moving on foot toward top of Chula about five AM's Sunday\nAnd the procession was orderly and peaceful some Mexican residents along the road cheer for the group or handed out bananas tortillas and water so that's a nice signed that folks that are\nGoing to be in countering them along the way are being helpful or rather than threatening towards these again peace mostly peaceful people were just trying to make a better life for themselves several hours into their journey Francisco issue about a a a top federal migration official in the state of Chiapas appeared any police pickup truck\nAnd urged the migrants to register at a shelter when the migrants demanded proof that they would not be deported if they did so Mr issue about a voter yeah offered to take several to the shelter to show them the rumors were false and to begin their asylum process is about ten of the migrants took him up on his offer and hopped into the back of a truck\nThey're cutting back that's my question and it's not clear right like they could have just been disappeared or at that moment uh but you know all they had that this was the effort right from the the Mexican Government is just send the guy in a pickup truck just say okay come with me I'll help you with the applications\nLike ten people did and then that's that's it everybody else just you know they don't trust the government I Can't blame them yeah you can't blame them at all that is one of the reasons why they're leaving Honduras among the people in the procession was Juan Carlos Garcia got to see a age sixteen from Honduras where he had been a laborer in coffee fields\nHe said as he marched north quote it's not a crime to migrate we've done nothing\nWell it it kind of is people not to miss you think about what I wrote a victim okay that's fine\nSo you're using the definition of crime as in like a government statute being violated\nThat crime doesn't mean anything in ... than there's already a word for aggression there's already aware and victimization and it's a government in terms of the term crime was created by the government doesn't mean anything else like crime doesn't mean aggression it means breaking a law okay\n[noise] uh so he said it's not a crime and I think what he means is that it's not a violent crime it's not something that actually you know harms another human being and I can understand why somebody would would I Would believe that about\nThat world that's all I I don't but yeah it's true that it's not aggression it's not that it's not a crime\nHe says we've done nothing against Mexican law he said they aren't they weren't going to allow us to pass but God has the last word so they did pass and again there now about twenty miles as of earlier today they're probably continued market marching so I don't know their exact location but last according to the New York times\nWas the city of ... about twenty miles north of see it on your doll go\nAnd that's where they spent Sunday night so likely they'd been continuing north as of today if you want to comment you went away into the discussion feel free to join us here are toll free number is eight fifty five four fifty free that's eight five five four or five zero three sets\nIs eight fifty five four fifty free that's eight five five four or five zero three seven three three now uh let's see according to an article that you shared Michael here with me the NBC News earlier this year reported on a group ... from terrorists\nWhich is basically people Without Borders is what that stands for you could say it's town Without Borders but\nEither way this has apparently one of the groups that is behind the organizing hearing and somebody had called in over the weekend\nTo to speculate and to say that there are some sort of group behind this there's ... there's funding uh that's behind us and my immediate response was well there's funding behind this as sure as hell ain't a whole lot because they don't even have water yeah they this this group does not have that much money do you look at the funding behind\nSomething doesn't mean that the people who they want to say they they're saying they want to help or in fact the people that\nThey actually want to help\nOkay so how would the funding work in this case\nWhat are you there I just want to scare the U.S about immigration I mean I thought well I'll go to a bunch of people who really need to leave and I'm like hey look I'm not gonna give you order food but here's some gasoline mhm\nThey might be desperate enough to take me up on it\nMaybe so maybe um and I said well we're going to learn a little bit more about this this group here according to NBC News uh this is again a story from earlier this year when there was a smaller group of migrants that was attempting to cross through Mexico as well\nAs he stood among the mothers children an algae Beatty used to have been walking through Mexico on their way to the U.S border Rodrigo a bay has found it hard to believe\nThat Donald Trump had deemed these people dangerous and and that's what's happening again trance are once again taking the Twitter it wouldn't surprise me if they're refreshed tweets today he's keeping people abreast of his opinions about this particular migration\nAnd trying to make it sound like they are enemies\nThat these people are invaders that they're dangerous\nWhen they probably already and [noise] probably by what measure what are you talking about ... people in general and to be dangerous no yeah no if there were dangerous people tend to tend to be dangerous people there'd be a very very violent place in the world and most people are very very well it's not\nA it's very very peaceful I've been to the suppose that murder

tell her that I hate all people equally okay so uh uh some people out there will get that but I\nI Believe that most people are good if you give them the opportunity to be a [noise] like it was the evidence\nThat's not good that's something close ties opportunistic\nMore like civilized let's let's let's put it that way but yeah I I guess I knew hate all\nPeople eat my goodness All right so you guys are more similar than you are a different a hostile ugly or by the you know I don't have hatred or for other people I mean I see other people as just\nYou know other ... other people yeah I uh\nI like people don't get me wrong I\nIn general specific people I might have a problem is but ah\nI see people as are just other versions of me that I could have ended up like any of them right whether they be the EU migrants who are trying to escape a better place I just happened to get born in a better place there are so God do I um or you know these people who have beliefs in the states\nI could have been raised in an environment that would have maybe better inculcated a belief in the state maybe if my parents had raised me differently I wouldn't be who I Am today or maybe I was naturally born anti state I don't know maybe that's\nThe thing that I I'm not seeing a whole lot of environmental difference I mean\nMy husband his father in the military and her mother was I think it's more

no he converted pretty late in life I remember as your light in Miami and he's thirty is but\nYeah I mean I don't describe myself as an anarchist I don't like the term I I don't like to define myself by what am against uh but uh uh but I Am of volunteers to believe all human interaction should be voluntary but I have been\nVery against authority over my lifetime I can remember it back to being in

so I mean there is an argument that there could be some sort of negative born in thing but then again as you pointed out people convert you were twenty seven by the time you came around\nThe world that we're\nNot going to write the anarchy I was a liver Harry ... I was ... ... years before that okay and I never really was like a big fan of the state or really any other were you\nBefore you were a small government we elect a Republican or something yeah okay where's your family Republican yeah okay I think that's true for a lot of people as they sort of\nA mixed feelings about this though like on the one hand like I absolutely do not think that I Am better than state is I think that I Am one hundred percent luckier than status mhm and that's not the same thing but I also think that it's objectively evil to the\nAlso think that it's objectively evil to some\nA huge evil aggressive entity but by some kind of ...\nDo you mean obedient we pay taxes grudgingly pay taxes or support vocally like I Love the government like\nWhat do you have thirty ... Rob does not support because if a mother I walked up and put the right on your face and it was like give me your wallet you're not supporting mugging by doing\nOkay so you would agree that most people are the people to pay taxes are not necessarily supportive of the government\nThe ... factor so yeah so there are the spectrum between somebody who\nCan be apathetic or at least some kind of a passive status if that makes any sense or you could be somebody who's like yes one hundred percent we need the state it you know it's\nIf it's the law don't break it even explicitly say like don't break laws even if there are moral laws and if you do you deserve jail like in between those two people there's a lot of different things you can be sure so if you just kind of walk around and get through life without\nActing on an opinion one way or the other and that's fine\nAnd I think that's probably what most people do anyway we got more coming up here you can share your thoughts on people or on immigration or the migrants a mass that is apparently in as many as Seventy five hundred people according to some estimates\nAre making its way north bounce through Mexico southern portion of Mexico right now are 'til the number's eight fifty five four fifty free bring up what you want as well you can also take control the airwaves here a thought five for five zero three seven three three joined us on the radio here on TALK live\nThe United states that empire is a book that claims the United states is the empire of the world\nGeorge Washington had warned us against foreign wars you're either face of empire shows the world\nWars one answer left England broker is former colonies are us head to save the umpire was there ever a vote we fight for it seems they began with\nFor United States of empire by James done\nSome bailout Amazon Books\nMostly you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S what if I told the for just fifty four Ninety five a month you could fight against heart disease naturally at heart and body extract we've been helping thousands of people get back\nTo a healthier hard don't just take my word for it check out all of the success stories at H.
