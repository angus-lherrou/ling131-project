R. and all that time you can join the conversation in our chat rooms there and there's a few of them are there are several actually and then there's the the one room that's for on air discussion amongst the listeners and then if you want to call in you joined the discord on air colon lines there's three of them right there at the top\nOf our chat room let's just hop into one of those rooms will join you and you'll get on the air and sound almost like you're in the studio with us we've been talking about often on tonight some issues regarding homelessness\nAnd we started out talking about your right to be able to feed the homeless finally being upheld somewhat by a federal appeals courts that one still kind of working its way through the court system led to a larger discussion about rights in general and now we're going to focus in on a different story\nProperty rights when it comes to helping the homeless because the feeding the homeless had been going on on public property meaning you know on a beach or a park in like Orlando sidewalks\nIn Orlando it was it a park or in uh Fort Lauderdale is it a beach maybe it's done on sidewalks around and play as well Fort\nLauderdale it was done on a sidewalk right next to the beach on what they call the boardwalk\nBut it was like what do you write a paper it was a public place dog which presumably in public you have no rights to do things correct presumably a\nAnd also on your private ... you should have rights and in fact that he'd been a greater range because you get to set the rules on your private property at least should all\nGet to say everybody that steps onto my property for supper get shot in the face no\nYou don't get to do that um you don't get to you don't get too aggressive against other people but uh on your property you get to set the rules and so if you want to allow somebody to give food to the homeless you should be able to do that I'm In this case it's not a giving food to the homeless but giving a home to the homeless\nA story from the New York times out of Ohio in the early days it said Joe Louis admits the homeless and cap meant that he allowed on his property was quote like the wild wild west\nResidents drank alcohol built campfires and argued loudly as you would expect it smelled bad neighbors complained as the months passed and the campsites grew from a few people to a few dozen Mr Lewis said conditions improved drinking was banned the residency elected their own leaders and volunteers dropped all food and clothing\nMr Lewis came to say the cap meant as a model for using private land to help the homeless\nIn city after city homeless encampments have sprung up on sidewalks and parks under bridges vexing local governments in Akron\nDon't go scrambling for quarters power fees are equipped with credit or debit card swipe birds and you are cold readers no more excuses or a dirty car stuck by executive order Washington at the intersection of privilege

five four or five zero three seven three three also the discord on air call in line rooms we got the discord color weight and we're going to get to that\nComing up here in a moment we're talking about property rights or the illusion of property rights because as long as the government is around you don't really have a right to do what you want on your property because if you have to beg for permission oh sorry you don't have a right\nUh you are in a privileged user of a thing the government controls at that point\nAnd it shouldn't be that way but that's the way it is at the moment we'd like to see that changed but unfortunately until we can get enough people to move to New Hampshire and concentrate their activism it's very unlikely that anything significant is going to change we definitely need more people to get up and make the move here are\nLike your girlfriend just did Darryl ... the newest movers year to the area I'm and she seems to be liking it up here it's cold but

I lied to to my face by a so called public service and I ... I've been fortunate enough that I haven't had that experience before the wrong but never been pulled over by that particular department right but I always heard about\nOn rare just it just makes me it just makes me I mean to my ... but it's not even it was about ... it was at\nThat look at least Fifteen miles an hour over my actual speed at the time so hold on a daily actually assure you a ticket\nAbsolutely not as as soon as she read my license about two minutes later she brings out the tells me to go to have a ... I have a witness Rockaway that's right that's right yeah\nYeah so I mean it's it's not it's not worth em searching\nYou know I'm sure she didn't you know she didn't want to expand yet to people's
