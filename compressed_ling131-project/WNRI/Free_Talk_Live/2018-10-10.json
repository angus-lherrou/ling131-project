is when we were in proving maybe I don't know [laughter]\nThat's funny I was just thinking about doing that\nUm I remember years ago when you were living out in king when\nWhenever you would like modify government property in some way I won't say which way because I don't remember but you would always say well I'm just improving it yeah I'm just a permanent describing all my ... about\nYou know I'd creativity make things better every day so uh we've been talking a lot about crypto currency and as you would expect a that's why we're out here for the ... conference but again we're hearing any pays\nHeadquarters or to kick things off\nAnd we're talking about some of the advantages of crypto currency and what things are like in places like Venezuela can I tell you about the Bristol meet up there I was only through the story thank you for reminding me of the un's yes so I Want to bring with the Laramie England yeah this this pub these guys\nUs a and they saw any pay and then they took any pay back to their home town of Bristol, England set up a pub in the same building where they work out there producing a documentary about dash\nAnd I'm no one was going to the business so ... crypto currency was hoping that this was going to inspire more businesslike what happens here in New Hampshire people flock to these uh locations oh you accept cryptic okay we're going to have made up there right so I said\nI'll make a made up like maybe there isn't one maybe no one even knows about this place\nTurns out there was already at Bristol meet up groups that had like over four hundred members and I I ... message them apparently there last meet up they made every two weeks there were only for people that had been nuts about how it goes that's about right but they weren't even aware that this this business\nAnd so that's about how it goes that's about right but they weren't even aware that this this business took bitcoin so they said okay well now will will tell people about this bad about ten people at the made up last night it connect first one was the first one first one and nobody even knew each other\nSo one guy was a launching its own icy oh he was working like in the building next door\nThese two guys are the the dash guys they were excited to use a crypto to pay for their beers and then um another group of people was was there as part of a pod cast they taught the most popular crypto pod cast in the u._k. wow\nSo they were there like their minds blown finally you know don't ever used in the ... used to and they're all excited because they do a crypto

New Hampshire doing our first day of three days of broadcasting from uh this pretty little town here in South east New Hampshire kind of the er the opposite side of the state from where we normally are in a\nAre beautiful keen and the other crypto accepting a mecca here in New Hampshire both the Portsmouth then team the number one and two respectively a top\nCrypto accepting cities in the world from what I can tell now again you know I put that out there on the radio multiple times and I've invited people\nHey if I'm wrong about this there's obviously a lot of cities in the world I don't have all day to go look around the entire planet on ... map uh but uh there's obviously a lot of cities in the world but of the major ones uh\nYou know if you look at like if you pull up a list of top ten ... went accepting cities San Francisco is usually listed at number one we easier in the dirt ah as far as crypto except a that's a joke I Lived there there's nothing there's zero add\nThere's a whoever's claiming that San Francisco has anything is wrong so all they go by all they can go by is the ... which is a it's a nice website coin yeah auto word Iraq right now I'm looking at it right now right and and so quaint map is great however\nThere is one problem and that is that\nThe items on going that gets stale yellow and ready business starts taking crypto but then stop like you talked about it every now and then it happens yeah um they're not going to remember to go to ... map\nAnd remove themselves from the map so what you end up getting is a bunch of stale locations I Will tell you I've audited when I was in Austin, Texas uh last year for the Texas bitcoin conference or no it was a different time I was an awesome but anyway it was a different crypto that happening down there\nAnd I'm like I Want to go out to eat Austin's a hip city Austin the cool you know keep Austin weird it's got to be a bitcoin you know place got I got to be and so I pulled up point map\nAnd I'm like oh look at look at all these you know potential places I can go and I start clicking around and I mean that it was zero I wasn't in ... I wasn't impressed with the total number but I'm like All right I'm going to go through these here and I'm going to I'm just 'cause I got plenty of time here I'm an audit this I'm going to see how many of these businesses are still except encrypted or actually except encrypted\nAnd just looking at the restaurants on the list it was zero wow\nUm there was one place to kind of made these waffles things but they were a manufacturer they weren't really a restaurant you couldn't go and eat there\nThey were still taking crypto but that's the only one there was a taco truck listed on there\nBut you couldn't find out what I Am um they put that in ... and according to the local according to Danny from the crypt do show they're sort of off and on whether it depends on who's running the truck as to whether or not they take crypto if you can find the truck and I tried contacting tried calling I tried emailing them like hey where are you guys set up they didn't get back to me so I couldn't\nActually proved that place existed or was still in business but here's the other thing\nSo what the majority of the entries work because there were a few of them that were something but they had you know closed their shop or whatever but there were a majority of the entries of businesses that were still open\nBut they didn't know they were on the list and what it is is this basically there's an intermediary company that will take crypto for delivery from certain\nUh like uh mostly Chinese food Orientals although I mean that's that's cool but it still to me that's not the same thing it took it to me it doesn't qualify if I Can't go in and sit down\nA restaurant or walk up to a taco truck or whatever if I Can't get the food directly from a server or if the person at the restaurant then it's not real I called these businesses to ask them yeah and I said\nOh I called the first few and I stopped calling them because it was all the same company so I said hey are you taking crypto currency like huh\n[laughter] ... ... and I figured oh yeah you know Chinese people are going to want to they're going to love crypto they can send it back to the you know their family\nAnd I figured oh yeah you know Chinese people are going to want it they're going to love crypto they can send it back to the you know their family and in China or whatever right like of course they're taking crypto now turns out they didn't know anything about it it was just this company that had set up and at the probably the manager didn't even know right like because companies just like oh well we'll take your car don't deliver you some uh\nSome food I don't bring the food delivery service yeah are you so I mean that's a cool service presuming it actually works I didn't actually try that 'cause that's not what I wanted I wanted to go and spend my cryptic restaurant Austin, Texas population eight hundred thousand in the city not a single place\nCould I go and actually spend 'cause we're so spoiled because it used to be that it was only marginal businesses that would take it quite like it was weird a Web designer like we're really desperate perk up dinner is like whatever's going to get a new role but now it's a car dealership I mean it's people who really can't turn people away will need ya\nAnd these are the types of businesses now taking bitcoin in New Hampshire and everywhere else is still like blood ... [laughter]\nSo disappointing to cause I'm like oh come on Austin nope not a single well because if you're from Austin which my partner is that you love crypto currency you're going to move to New Hampshire\nRight and you know that's one thing that's really nice about nobody did they did which is a website where people can list liberty by the things they wrecked it requires you\nAt least once a year to verify your still a business here's a chance to update your listing of shade because a lot of times people forget for data listed on ... ... yeah I Am glad you brought that up because it was what I was thinking of when I brought this up was liberty dot menu\nThat was the first time I've ever seen a website of here's a business listings site in this case of libertarian business listings site that actually requires the person who submitted the thing to follow up a year later so every year they send you an email saying hey\nWe're going to expire your business unless you can log in and verify that this is still open that's a great tool and it's just\nNo one else has done that quaint not doesn't do it um discovered ashes pretty decent because it's actually human curated so I think they're more likely to be\nAccurate I think discovered dash are more likely to find places that are actually open and knowingly accepting a crypto correct but again who's to say in a year and a half\nTwo years from now that those businesses are still going to exist well and I didn't know that liberty menu or liberty dot and then you had that feature until the year later when I finally got that right now that's how I figured it out so maybe they maybe discovered that has something like that and it's not that a year yet\nBut either way hum I Want to mention that we are talking of course from the any pay ... global headquarters here\nThat any pay you mentioned earlier accepts allows businesses to accept bitcoin dash\nBut you said those were the big ones what are the other ones that any pay is also enabling at\nThe point of sale right now then is the latest horizon horizon yeah well the the currently known as then cash yeah reading the currency is still been correct correct right they brought our platform is a rise then correct uh what else anything else\nI Know I've seen like corn but says anybody actually you know it was actually used usable or useful not really I don't know [laughter]\nSo uh yes those in school we love them here on free ... and uh in fact we're doing getaways tries then\nAnd I believe they're picking a winner tomorrow they are on one of these give away though every Wednesday okay that roughly moon is when I pick the winners\nUh jumped the gun last night and accidentally or told people about the next give away this happening or the first give away that is going to be chosen tomorrow yes uh is going to be or how much do we know a I've got it written down I Believe it or is that one and a\nA half one and a half then we'll be given away to you which right now what about sixteen Seventeen bucks or ... dollars of them yet so you get some free crypto currency freeze then\nBy emailing Daryl and here's what you have to do to enter you have to

while it set up before you email Darryl\nUh glitches in address and tell us how you listen to the show and you'll be randomly selected possibly as the winner of this then and then if you don't win this time you're still entered into future then get away correct and if you've entered a previous then give away as but have not won you can still enter and the more times you know the more contest you enter enter more than once\nWe got more coming up here are from the any pay ... global headquarters in downtown Portsmouth New Hampshire this is talk live [noise]\n\n[noise]\nWater is the most

uh\nThe person explained that\nThey just you know didn't think it was worthwhile and I said you know this is also activism when you spend crypto currency if you are an activist if you are somebody who fancy yourself a libertarian activist and your crypto currency fanatic or interested in in crypto\nThen you should spend it just because you shouldn't have to wait for an incentive program to come come along if you can afford to tip somebody somewhere\nThen you can afford to tip them encrypted if they're willing to accept Corrado if you could afford to eat out with cash and then you can afford to eat out with crypto now I can understand if somebody's super compressed as far as they can't spend any money you know they're they they don't eat out or whatever like they can't but these are the people that\nWere complaining that oh my God the rebate is only ten percent it's a waste of my time to get ten percent of the bat [laughter]\nThis is the same person who was complaining about that yeah um and it's I I just try to you know again put it in perspective to people that it's ten percent back and they were complaining they getting money back was a waste of their eyes\nRight well because you do have to acquire the crypto so there is the cost of the time of\nEither go into a crypto currency vending machine and putting money into a machine or get getting a an online account from you know some sort of a brokerage or you know exchange and that would allow you to send money is so there is some some investment of time involved there but again this is activism ... point\nAnd so if you are if you fancy yourself an activist then do what I in my opinion you should do it a good activists should do which is to say use the thing you're advocating\nRight eight year old dog food right so yeah I don't I just much more pleasant than up and then have you know that um but yeah I imagine that I ever I look at activism I mean it's necessary and we all do and everybody here at the table does it we\nLive the breeze a crypto as much as we can as much as we possibly can um but I I still recognize the were the outliers mhm you know we we may have a role in weather crypto become successful but what we really need is normal everyday people to\nTake that plunge and see the benefits I mean it's\nThere are so many different benefits when we compare to traditional money or when we compared to credit cards or God Forbid you know the the traditional banking system um it's easy for us to look at and go this is better money you can look at anybody's definition of what makes what constitutes good money\nYou know and scarcity is going to be on everybody's list and that's the one thing you will never get with the Federal Reserve now that are in your pocket because they keep

Institute for technology or you're not here for a meeting with the any pay people this is a private or you know private business basically you\nAre but they're still doing outreach which is good that's why they got that stuff on the outside of the building for folks that are just walking by they ah they see something here they want to learn more about it\nUh they uh they can't actually come in to talk because they're busy here or if they've got programming going on they've got classes are that they're doing\nThis particular location unlike the the decline shop that they used to run\nThis isn't an outreach a facility right it's a it's a different a theme basically a different concept entirely in fact\nUm because they're closing down the bitcoin shop now because it was a failure it was a tremendous success right and it was so such a burden of time they weren't able to do the things they needed to do for any pay\nAnd still run a full I mean you know it is running a shop you got you've got to be there yeah uh so the good news is it all kind of worked out or\nAt the right time they were winding down the bitcoin shop as we were getting ready to open up the doors on New Hampshire's first bitcoin embassy which is going on or at route one on local goods we remodeled the store and uh actually I think everything's better now than it's ever been\nIs looking right yeah so the we we to make room for the embassy we had to do upgrades in the store itself\nAnd all those upgrades of of definitely got a positive response from the public have out that's ... it's more spacious now even though the same amount of product is there no there's no more product into a smaller space for\n'em but because we changed some shelving it it just it works out great but what that allowed us to do was to open up a classroom space for twelve students at a time to 'em up seminars movies presentations whatever meat up uh up to twenty four twenty five people at a club\nI'm with you know projectors and and big screens and stuff like that so\nWe're really excited I was Louis was paid through or say that first dot com yeah except for the project or it could get that one though we did with the track and in fact we failed and the way ahead of us were but that's OK a way it works on those things so I didn't really want to go too far deep into what's going on with the\nClinton thing 'cause it's brand new we'll talk about it maybe later in the the next couple of days sure uh but uh it's just exciting just kind of setting the stage for where we are here so we were talking about their crypto currency alleged crypto currency from Venezuela these so called Petro where'd you now you're saying there's a news article out Darryl that says that in order to get\nA passport if you're a Venezuelan person or you have to pay with Petra yet as you do that given there are no Petro that anybody can find and there are people who have been trying very very hard to get these things\nGet that's a really good question and the articles here there's actually a pair of them from going telegraph says that apparently the Petro will officially launched in November wave now wait it was supposed to officially launched\nIn February no that was the I see oh they they had an icy oh a ... minute actually work\nAt least permanent when it comes to de centralized crypto currency is now not clear is if this is going to be a decentralized ah crypto currency because generally you don't have a registration page on any other crypto currency that I've ever seen anywhere so right I don't understand the extent to which\nAnd we're not going to really know until somebody can actually try it yeah the extent to which the restrictions governmental restrictions are going to be placed on this script\nAnd that's that's what I seem to remember something about my Darrow talking about the mining and how this is not going to be mind all over the place and the the function of mining in most crypto currency use is to secure the network\nRight to ease the pain protected from hacking protected from hacks protected from Ben taken override fifty one percent attacks all sorts of things\nUm and if that's not the case here if it's gonna be confined to you know a few authorized miners then then this is set up poor attack\nProviding anybody feels the Petro is worth attacking in the first place right and\nIf the government controls all the authorized miners correct then the whole thing is questionable from the word go well they can manipulate the entire system and you get five thousand Petro that you can have a master node they actually have astronauts on the metro system yeah they own a purpose they sort of thing okay All right\nSo we're going to keep an eye on this uh as it develops but you're saying Daryl right now the news is if you have a Petro you can buy or if you have some Petro you can buy a passport in Venezuela and there's no other way to get the passport dont pay with are the boulevard\nBased on a press conference that was given by the vice president of Venezuela on friday October fifth\nThe only way that you will be able to pay for a passport in Venezuela is with Petro and\nPart of this could be because they've lost Thirteen percent of their population over the last uh several years and the forty percent of Venezuelans say that they wish that they could ... country\nI bet the other forty percent or or the rest of the remainder wish they could leave but there you know their family is still there so there's probably reasons why they they feel like they can't ruling class will want to stay right and actually the question was do you want to immigrate right with an IV so do you want to leave forty percent what too\nBut they can't probably a higher percent that wish that they could but for various reasons some are leaving anyway so they can't legally leave right but that doesn't mean that people won't leave and in fact that brings me to my story that I've been hold onto it for a couple of days about Venezuela where\nA now apparently they're they're creating a border enforcement agency that never existed before ... and I'm sure it's just coincidental that that happened at\nThe same time that the news that Thirteen percent of their population has allowed Clinton and the number of people leaving per year between twenty Fifteen and
