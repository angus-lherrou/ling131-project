I. N. A. insulin\nAnd David you called in as a libertarian with comments about the idea of recalling political office holders there was a gentleman who called from prison earlier saying that he thought that I recall petition is a good way to go\nUh was advocating doing that now whether or not that's tied then when I was just before I think it sounds great sounds as unique kept very lazy I don't know in which are and how many states in which it's possible to do recall petition but he says he's research Michigan that you can do it there\nAre that it takes you know twenty five percent of the voting amount of people that voted in the election in which the person is being recalled from anyway your comments on that I wanted to make sure you had a chance to say what you want it\nYou know I I basically just commenting on my own personal struggle as a libertarian believing in that non aggression principle you know I have a hard time going to the polls and voting\nBecause I feel like it as as people are voting in ... and and people are voting in these these day they're both on the left and the right\nThey are in fact violate who writes of me sure because they're using the power in the force of government\nYou know took been there will ever know to meet me I have to pay more taxes more sales tax more and come back we're property tax\nAnd things like that and I think to myself gosh are we in such a position where why should we have to recall politician why are we\n... area and buddy I pack late but that's the course of human events right like why should a slave half to escape why should they go they go through the brambles will deal with the dogs have somebody with a gun chasing after the why should they well\nI'm Sorry but they did\nAnd you have one that didn't escape just waited around for somebody to free them and then finally they did but they got fried into just like all of us have a a just a lesser form of slavery the kind of ...\nRather than giving out of trouble yeah giving up a hundred percent of the fruits of your labors you're you're giving up but thirty five percent or fifty percent depending on a you know where your actual tax bracket is or ... or whatever\nSo and and that's something that internally I struggle with it because I'm like I Need to get to the polls to vote for libertarian candidate\nBecause I don't want Republicans and Democrats running my life [laughter] you know but at the same time I feel a voting you know we're voting this saying darn people in\nVision advertising on the genesis communications network Google smart wave refer to reach a potential customers would be most reportable national advertising rates period disorder today was used in the news this communications network just email ... an easier and lived on go boom\nThis is free talk live Collins all free eight fifty five four fifty free that's eight fifty five four fifty free\nThree talk lies bringing a flood you want lives Saturday edition of the program right here in Brazil for a number for you is a fifty five four fifty free that's eight five five for five zero three seven three three also we do have our discord on air call in line rooms just go to discord\nDot L. our end on it and you can get interactive there and the time on the show you need to know about the ah Tom words if you are a libertarian\nBecause he's a great author is best selling author and the New York times he's written over a dozen books including the politically incorrect guide to American history and he's been doing his own show Tom would show every single week day since September of twenty Thirteen so he's racked up over twelve hundred episodes so far\nGreat guess like Ron Paul judge Andrew ...

I Know why again and yet I don't think they need a mailing address\nYeah kind of curious I'm so some places require you to sort of register in advance\nAnd most places yeah if you're a homeless that it's got to be kind of difficult because you're not going to be necessarily where you were when you're registered\nSo it makes it difficult so I mean if it's if it's forty five days or sixty days beforehand well maybe you're moving with the uh the seasons or whatever so it seems unlikely that very many homeless people are voting\nArt but now they're about ... ... e y my cat or why not yeah riding\nOn the last thing you're concerned with is voting I guess you're right I gotta mathematically in submitted act [laughter] exactly um and you know ... I don't know what the rules are you in a ... in New Mexico where you are you're saying you have to have an address in New Hampshire all you gotta do is show them on a map where it is that your encampment is\nSo it's not quite they're gay\nOr they got married at ... no no\nNo no not a maybe maybe that's true in Albuquerque New Mexico where you're calling from probably true somewhere um but it's not true in New Hampshire are you in New Hampshire all you have to do is point on a map\nThat's all you gotta do you go in to register to vote and you say that you're homeless and then they ask you where it is you sleep at night and then you know your point to whatever Parker or wherever it is that if you know you lay at night and then they figure out what war that is in New Hampshire they they have\nWards in some towns are I think I don't know if all towns happened but king has words they figure out what area you're in and then they register you there so there is no actual address\nIn your mind that required because they they mail you out all the information I got my mailing polling location but that oh I like why they don't do that\nYeah there are things that I call is fun to compare notes\nOn how things work in different places because different states have drastically different rules in some cases in New Hampshire you can register to vote day up you can walk into first time ever into voting location as long as you know which one you're supposed to go to which you have to go and research that\nUh but then you know you show up and uh you just present whatever you need to present to get registered and they give you a ballot that's it most states you've got to do thirty days in advance or you've got to go down to uh to register to vote in some states you can register to vote\n'em you'd have individuals register people to vote so when I Lived in Florida we did a table at a a county fair once where we were trying to get people to register to vote with the Libertarian Party and we actually had voter registration forms from the secretary of state or whatever uh and we had them with us and we could just collect information and then submit them to the government and that would register people to do\nIs there any particular value and registering libertarian um I mean is it\nDoes to the libertarians there is that do anything for libertarians like what that allows us to see who's the libertarian okay or because you can get you can pull voters lists right ...\nIt's good for the Libertarian Party it may not be that great for somebody who wants to vote in a primary election\nIf you think that some primary matters like have editors a heck of a lot more than the general it doesn't matter of ... down in Florida because it's some scum bag Republican versus another comeback Republican whereas or a Democrat versus another comeback Democrat\nWhereas in New Hampshire you could argue it matters because a lot of times the Republican primary or a Democrat primary will actually have a libertarian in it it's just a libertarian will be will be running as a Democrat or Republican so you could argue I think successfully that it\nWe'll be running as a Democrat or Republican so you could argue I think successfully that it matters in New Hampshire a but if you are a libertarian and you want to be you know loyal to that particular party and then it's nice to be able to register as a libertarian\nSo the toll free number here tonight is eight fifty five four fifty free that's eight five five four or five zero three seven three three he's James Arizona James you're on TALK live within about\n...

radio news [noise]\nFollowing programs paid programming is expressed on the following program at those was hosting participants and nowhere is like those are the ownership staff or advertisers have WN are a\nGood morning this is Brendan Murray and you are listening to health and wealth radio heard every Thursday morning here on WNPR I I Am president of a company called health and wealth ink and\nWe believe we are the only company that truly brings health care and wealth care together for the consumer and you know it may sound obvious well we have things like um you know early to bed and makes man healthy wealthy unwise right I\nI remember when we started our company name we we had been in the business\nAlready for over a decade but\nWe incorporated as health and welfare officially two thousand fourteen and I remember I was telling my cousin and he said well that pretty much sums it up health and wealth has a nice ring to it doesn't it but\nThe idea of bringing together health care and wealth care in a way that makes sense for you the consumer is something that really hadn't been done yet in our industry and so we're blazing a new trail and uh it just makes good sense to us that um\nIf you're concerned about your health care that one of the things are really concerned about is your wellbeing and part of that is your financial well being so um you know anytime you make a decision to\nLower deductibles to lower co pays to minimize out of pocket expenses to a save money on prescription drugs um to cover surgeries if you go in the hospital to worry about um\nHappens if you need help\nWith a assistance with daily living activities of daily living what you're really saying is number one is I Want to be cared for well but number two who's going to pay for it that's really the question and that's a question of wealth now if you have your own money\nOr your own assets the concern is well how much of this do I have to spend out of my nest egg in order to fuel my health care\nAnd so really pretty much if you're if you're really doing a thorough job if you follow things to their\nTheir natural conclusion as soon as you start talking about health what you're really\nWhat'd you really looking at is really a a health wealth continuum we'll call it that so it's like ah\nLike I was explaining to my son he's Thirteen he's asking a lot of questions about space and time black holes you know he's really fascinated with with the ... the science of space and you know\nOne of the things I explain to them is really a I Believe it's space time I don't think it's one without the other I think it's based in time together and you know as soon as you have distance between objects there's a distance in space and in time how much time does it take for life to travel\nAnd so from one point to another so\nYou know in science we have these things continue in space time together and I believe that in our planning it's really health and wealth planning were the first to do it\nAs evidenced by our name but even more as evidenced by the vision of how we see the business so if you were\nConcerned about your health and well if you have questions about your health and well if you just want to make sure that your partner with a company that understands these things and thinks about them and this way than we would really welcome an opportunity to work with you\nKnow we're very fortunate\nTo be working with uh\nSome excellent people families throughout New England and\nNot only are in Rhode Island Massachusetts Connecticut and New Hampshire on but we have clients in Florida and we have clients in California we have clients in Illinois and Indiana and Texas and what happens is as people are spread out or\nThey have friends and family or someone sells their home and when socket and moved to Arizona um we don't just say bye nice serving you we say well we can continue to help 'em\nAnd now with technology\nYou know we are able to keep in touch with people I'm\nNot only with the telephone but even computer wise um you know you can actually do a presentation for someone on your computer and it's not quite as good as being in there you know in their home or at the kitchen table or at a desk but I'm the technology is there where we can actually um\nYou're listening to health and wealth radio I Am the host Brendan Marie I'm your host every week and some of you I Know of actually heard my voice it's when I go to a ... a someone's house for an appointment sometimes they say I've heard you on the radio I said oh good you're listening thank you um\nBut if you're listening for the first time this is a show about\nWhat we call health and wealth planning\nAnd it's really a show about you your concerns because the reason I Do the show is to help you sort through in your head if it's time for an appointment you know uh\nActually listen to four five six seven a different financial planning shows on the radio ah\nI'm from Massachusetts has some very good ones there but when I'm In town in Rhode Island I listen to some that are here I'm ... I'm kinda like whenever I hear something about the financial or the insurance industry I tune in are also estate planning attorneys you know if an attorney is going to be talking about wheels and trust\nUm irrevocably trust long term care planning tax planning I listen\nI read books about that stuff up a film I had with increasing my knowledge as often as I can uh\nBut what I what I find is that\nYou know what we're really it's not about trying to sell a product and I know there are some shows that do that you know that's just all about getting you to book an appointment so that they can sell you a specific retirement product or\nWe can do the same thing we can sell the same product that pretty much anyone else can that's\nA sewing you anything insurance or or retirement planning circles we can do that but\nWhat we really want to do is just help you come to the conclusion in your own head that maybe you want to do something because in the end it's not about selling you it's about ... a serving you\nAnd so that may sound like a different twist if you've never heard that before but that is how health in wealth works it's about serving you and serving our clients so if if if you can start to think about what's important to you and we can a\nWeek while I'm pretty confident that we can help you so we'll listen will share some ideas and then we might be able to implement a plan to gather that puts you in a better place moving forward you can reach us off the air for consultation for a conversation a\nReally the best thing is to just call\nSo that we can touch base and maybe schedule some time together a\nYou're able to you are welcome to come to our offices but ah we will come to you and first appointment is just a gathering info having a conversation gathering info and then a follow up would be here some suggestions about what a\nBased on what we talk about in the first point about what might you might want to consider about moving forward or\nA third appointment might be implementation so the second and third appointments could be implementation of one or more of the solutions we talk about and and then from there on it's an ongoing relationship then it's whenever you want to check in obviously were depending on what we do for you if we're going to be\nMeeting annually or semi annually or possibly quarterly depending on how much we're doing for you and with you\nBut if we're helping you with your health care plan\nDefinitely annually you will be we'll we'll check in or just to let you know about changes if any and sometimes people say I'm all set I'm happy with what I have anything major I Need to know about Brendan\nAnd I'll explain it I said I'm sticking with what I have great you know no problem but\nOther times it's like well my situation has changed I you know I don't like I don't like that I have to get referrals or\nYou know for my doctors do you have another plan or you know I don't really like the dental plan that I have a can we talk about that\nOr you know I'm this plan that I had worked for me for the last five years but now I'm a little more concerned about\nYou know major expenses and out of pocket expenses so can we review again the plan that I have so that I understand how it will work I have hip surgery or what have you so you can reach me if you're doing business with us great if you're not give us a call we would love to have you uh\nAs an addition to the health of wealth team it is eight eight eight four to nine\nFour seven to seven\nAnd again that's eight eight eight\nFour to nine four seven to seven you can always always find us uh\nYou know we do have a pretty good website that\nShows a lot of what we can do for people I mean if you go there you're going to see every kind of insurance that you can imagine car insurance we do it homeowner's insurance we do it liability insurance we do it I'm Brelo policies we do it\nEvery form of health insurance that you can imagine we do it long term care we do it\nRight and ... we do it retirement planning we do it so ah\nThe website is pretty comprehensive but you can also just see a little bit about who we are and you can also just email us through the website to schedule an appointment or to ask a question uh\nAnd we can follow up with you from there so we are at health wealth financial dot com that is our domain health wealth financial dot com\nAnd we are health and well think I Am Brendan Marie so today we're talking as we always do about health care and welfare or what's wealth care caring about your wealth so one of the things we do in our businesses we\nGemini who's my business partner we ... we come from a musical background so we were we played music together for years even before we got into this this business and so we're kind of lyrical and the way we think we're we we like to\nWe like to rearrange and re think you know certain things you know maybe common sayings out there the good ones don't need to be changed but\nThere's some that you know need to be rethought and because they get used or misused overused to the point where they seem to lose their their original meeting and I and I'll give you an example\nOf what I mean but one of one of the examples would be um\nYou know health care and we we came up with wealth care what his wealth carrots caring about your wealth and and it's not just health insurance it's health care so you know you could have an health insurance policy\nOr health insurance\nDoes the insurance company you have care about your health you get that feeling you get that sense and it's not just an emotional thing you can never really prove does this person or does the c._e._o. or does this company care about me but it's evidenced by the policy itself what what kind of extra um\nLevels of care do you see that are offered uniquely through that insurance plan\nIn other words you're done\nThat are offered uniquely through that insurance plan\nIn other words your doctor's your nurse practitioners\nYour pharmacist\nYour ah the person administering that flu shot\nRight they're all part of our health care experience aren't they so we love our doctors are we love our or we like our uh\nPharmacist or we don't but that that that\nAffects our day to day experience with our healthcare but it's the health insurance company that we're going through that\nReally helped provide the access for us to maybe\nBenefits or\nOr services that go above and beyond simply picking up your prescriptions at the pharmacy so things like home delivery you know some people love to go to the pharmacy every day it's a kind of a ritual it's an experience you know you get to know the person that behind the pharmacy and and there's a lot of reasons why people like that\nBut there's other people\nEither because of circumstance or desire that they cannot you know get to the pharmacy it's more of a burden than it is a um\nA pleasure so home delivery service the ability to get your prescriptions delivered to your home Ninety Days supplies and maybe even in a cost effective manner maybe in a way that you can save money by doing so as a double when the conveniences there and the cost savings as their things like\nAccess to a nurse that you can talk to twenty four hours a day that some of the planes might have\nYou know membership at the gym\nMagazine that comes a health magazine that's um you know goes out for being a member of the talks about healthy living a and and and that kinda stuff so there's lots of things that your plan may offer that go above and beyond just the fact that it's insurance\nAnd it and it's really about health care caring about you caring about your health and and that\nThat administration uh\nOf those services behind the scenes you know you're looking for companies that invest in that companies that have a vision about health care have a vision about how to serve their consumers better and I'm a wealth side it's the same thing you know I Can't tell you how many times\nThe fact is\nIt is expensive and you don't want to get overwhelmed with the expense but you also don't want to be blindsided by expense is specially if there's something you can do about it so\nWhen people get closer to retirement it becomes very important to really look at possible expenses in retirement\nBecause when you're working when you have income coming in sometimes it's a lot easier to get away with not\nYou know really having a plan because money's coming in the door and you're able to pay your bills the challenges if you do stop working all of a sudden it becomes a reality of okay where's the money going to come from so\nWhen I sit with people one of the things that we like to do\nIs talk about\nYou know do do you have a budget not so much um\nThat we lecture you on you need to have a budget but like you may have had a budget when you were first starting out or maybe you had kids maybe you um\nYou know just got a mortgage or you know maybe it just became something not on paper but just in your head you've always been good with managing and budgeting and you know how to just kind of self correct um\nYou're spending so that you stay within your means but when you retire what I mean by budget I mean let's start thinking\nSpecifically about this phase of your life what you've never had to live through before which is the the phase of where's the money going to come in I'm not working for it anymore so where does the money come from it come from a\nThat's a new phase for people when they retire for the first time they go from stop working not to stop living\nUm but from stop working so money's going to come from somewhere where's it going to come from we look at Social Security\nWe look at maximizing people's Social Security income so\nIf people are sixty two and they're trying to decide should I take Social Security early\nShould I Do lay it how long should I delay it should I wait till my full retirement age we actually have software and we're not government employees by any means of course but we do have software in our industry so anyone who works in retirement planning really should have access to Social Security planning software\nThat can run the numbers for you and so you can see it\nAre based on inflation based on a you know we don't know what the future will be but we can look to the past and and say well there there has been this inflationary um adjustments overtime cost of living adjustments so we can\nKind of break that into the presentation or the illustration so that you can see how much would Social Security cover for you and what will the shortfall be and whatever that shortfall is we need to make up that shortfall\nWhat will the shortfall be and whatever that shortfall is we need to make up that shortfall so the good news is maybe we don't have to\nMaybe like let's say you need three thousand dollars a month\nMost Social Security is paying Thirteen hundred of it maybe we don't have to come up with three thousand we just have to come up with the difference and so now maybe you have an IRA and maybe you're going to have required minimum distributions and we run that number for you and we say well\nThat's going to be five hundred a month right well so now now we've got the Social Security plus the required minimum distribution so now we only have to come up with another few hundred dollars and so we can look at that together with you in from that we can build a plan or\nWhen we look at the health care we may say well this is um\nThis is what some of the costs could be depending on what your health experience has been perhaps or no one knows what it will be in the future but we can look at history and what the last two three four five years of looked like I mean if someone's\nRegularly going to a doctor visits or or physical therapy or has knee surgery planned ... there's no sense pretending\nThat's not so right you want to factor that in so you know if we know what your expenses are or what they've been we can build that in and say well here's a plan that might work better for you and when we say better we're talking about dollars you know yes we're talking about your experience but we're also talking about money so you know\nI'll sit with someone else showing the plan and they may say I really liked this plan because it has X Y and Z you know maybe it's got a better Jim network than another plan for ... you can go to a gym for a little less money or whatever but\nYou don't buy you don't choose a health care plan as a better word than by you don't choose your health care plan simply because of who has a better Jim network right you bet you buy for the whole experience and one of those things that we're looking at is expense\nExpense we've got to look to value today you know what that's the biggest challenge is finding value you got to look for a value value means more\nFor less you know you want the best quality you can get\nFor the least amount of money nothing more frustrating than spending more money than\nYou think something is worth\nAnd not having a great experience you know I always use food in my in my in my analogies but you know went to a restaurant somewhat recently and it was more expensive say then other restaurants might be a\nNot the most expensive restaurant you could go to by any means but just we'll just say a little bit\nMore pricey than your average restaurant but the quality wasn't that great and you know when they they didn't they didn't bring out you know they didn't bring up the bread before the meal like they usually do and and when they did they didn't bring out the ... oil and and they forgot you know I'm\n... and then my wife ordered a Caesar salad with anchovies and they bought one anchovies end up salad you know ... plural isn't it ... it was one you always want to anchovies on there so you may as well if you're going to just put one inch over just don't even mention it right just as\nJust chop it up and put it on top of\nYour value is the key some there's nothing worse than paying an overpriced\nPay for and overpriced product that inferior quality well\nIn your health care and in your wealth care those are two big ones we want to get it right\nSo sometimes I'll sit with clients and they've got a financial advisor you know\nIf I'm sitting with someone [noise] sixty five Seventy years old usually they have something saved you mean like I get like I said before you may they might not have many commas and many zeros and their net worth\nBut they've got something saved and it's very common for people to have someone they've worked with over the years but very very often\nYou know they feel like well I haven't really heard from the person or you know\nWhen I call I kind of feel like I'm\nLike down in the list of important to them and that's not something that you should feel like you know again I\nPromote feeling as the main reason why you should do business with us it's not how you feel it's also how would how we deliver you know its results but you know you definitely shouldn't get the impression that\nI'm a burden to this person I'm working with if you're dealing with your investments and your healthcare you have the right\nYou have the ability never mind the right you have the ability to get great service\nYou know there are some hungry businesses out there a fear ... people hungry for your business and who deserve your business you know so we're not the only people out there that are hustling to pay attention to the customer service but we have that plus the knowledge base plus the vision of how to do it\nA plus the infrastructure and the background and experience and the people behind us backing us up\nUh so it's not just me and it's not just Jim we have Jonathan Travers our general office manager who's there when we are out on the road to call\nTo take calls to assist clients with questions and then we also have our network of accountants\nThat we can call if there's a a deep tax question right we have special uh\nExperts within different fields that can actually answer questions so if I'm sitting with someone on a long term care question I Know quite a bit about long term care insurance but I have access to also myself\nTo getting illustrations done for me that can look at various products that might work for that person in that state so it's even state specific um you know some people\nAre maybe someone has sleep apnea and for some long term care insurance companies that's a problem if they're not wearing their ... their sleep apnea mask there see pap mask they might not accept a\nWhereas another policy it might treated a little differently so um\nIt's very important to understand that it's not just\nYou know I'm not just banging the drum shooting the horn ... Blake crashing the symbol and saying can work with me health and well now we have a business that can service your needs um from now and throughout your retirement you can reach me off the air at eight eight eight four to nine four seven to seven\nYou can also reach us on the Web anytime at health wealth financial dot com and we're coming into a season the fall is a big season very big season for\nConsumers and it's a big season for health and wealth because it's a review season and you know we offer reviews year round\nBut this season in particular coming up in the fall\nIs really a great time to get together number one because there's something to talk about you know the plans have changed the plans will change now how much they change", "show_name": "Free Talk Live", "year": "2018", "city": "Woonsocket", "day": "07"}
