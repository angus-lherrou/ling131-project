Bush\n... robot I hear the nine percent under Reagan back in the Nineteen eighties I think I remember reading about Harry brown ... that the difference there was that Democrats control Congress during the first six years of George W. Bush\nRepublicans controlled all of it\nYeah I don't buy that uh I don't buy that these people actually care about smaller government I don't buy it either for a moment I didn't hear it\nHuh I don't buy that these people actually care about smaller government do I don't buy it either for a moment\nBut anyway go ahead oh yeah they certainly do that's what I'm trying to make any conservative better siding with Brett Kavanaugh\nIs actually it is actually buy their own definition of what a conservative is is not a conservative because they're in there they are in favor of big government if they like Brett Kavanaugh because Brett Kavanaugh supported all that and if they do but also a bad spot did though in his in his favor relief or a reality check this past week\nThat I'm kind of kind of does go and go to Brett Kavanaugh's favor as far as the rapes sexual assault situation\nBecause this is where he outlines believes he's a\nSupport for best yes supportive of what well well the fact that she doesn't have any credibility\nYeah exactly\nI don't know anything about this I I have not been following this uh situation at all beyond what it is that people say here on the radio so I tend to agree with penguins call earlier that this whole Kevin thing is a huge\nUh unimportant distraction nothing's ever going to come out of this nobody's going to be satisfied when all this is said and done whatever it is that ends up happening you know people are not going to be satisfied if they ah they don't if they don't approve this guy well guess what Trump's going to pick somebody else right\nSo all of this is just so\nDramatic and build on what I'm saying we're going to end your speculated that you know Congress has passed saying something that they don't want us to know about I'm looking and I'm not saying you know anything that's really been voted on recently uh about executive uh uh on\nI think this is all just you know some kind of drawn out campaigning on their behalf\nIt's just a feeding frenzy in the media that's all this is um an order to keep the Supreme Court in the has been 'til they start making decisions in what ... how how how soon as that coming God they just started the term uh they could in theory write an opinion as soon as they hear oral arguments they generally don't\nTurn focused and other comments go ahead\nWell no I mean for Brett Kavanaugh he's total show for the Republican Party in a ... any any person any any conservative that calls himself a real conservative she just this the idea that Brett Kavanaugh should be in the Supreme Court so really logically no one in the country should be supporting bracket Republicans or Democrats\nAnd and and nobody else other than that which are all the rest of the level at it'd be in the country none of these people should think that that this guy should be on the Supreme Court that's all I\nThanks for the call tonight turned focused in there on our discord on air colon lying around which you can jump into over at discord\nDot L. our end on it and you'll sounded almost like you're sitting here in the studio with us apparently this cabinet guy kept a diary of some of his alleged ... what conflicts things\nBut uh the the ... well the claim is that he had like very detailed calendars of everything he did back in Nineteen eighty two but then there were things from a couple of years ago where he had no record\nThat is very sell like there are a lot of things that just don't want to add up and and\nThen he lives about the definitions of ... like devil's triangle

okay I have I have to very detailed records on things and then and like oh five oh six just for a seat stopped existing relate to answer or something\nSo that's what I said just just before he was

or or others I think there's an interesting moral argument for pacifism\nBut all that said I just I Can't see standing by when somebody who's been savvy and hurt but there are some pacifist that\nWill go so far as to like not even swat a fly if it lands on their arm\nMosquito you know one thing I have noticed about\nPassive is is that they are aggressive in a way to pass if aggressive\nAnd oh most definitely and I actually out of out of out of this room at the three of us I Would say that you Mr Freeman are the most passive aggressive ... of us all I see you in action\nAre dealing with politicians and dealing with people who get a little little uppity an obscene you throw in a right back in their faces and I can I have to tell you\nYou know sometimes I Would rather get punched\n... than dealing with a passive aggressive person does it it that's just something it's like I Can't fight back and like it's like if you are right now I'm not touching you expect your word Smith and you're really quick on your feet I mean you really can walk circles around some of these guys just like what if you if you throw a punch I mean I can you know I can at least defend myself\nBut ah yeah it's I can see a\nI've never understood those accusations personally of me being passive aggressive because I don't feel aggression I'm not interested in aggression\nOr put on anything and it's kind of a snarky kind of\nKind of a thing it's where I don't even I don't think it's something that you realize I Believe that it is a\nUm it's just something that you've grown in evolved into a as a ... to react to that too bad behavior or to authority\nAnd it's just how is this how you handle it I don't know have you ever been in a fight a lot of physical five years ago recently\nRecently no I mean I'm not I'm not talking about I don't think I may I think overall it than I used to lead been incite fear\nWhich by the end by the way that's that's good that you brought that up too because we're we're in fights in our present day society where they actually take place a white nationalist rallies and school too big places and how often do white nationalist party a ... and you know where they

I don't think it's necessarily a happy event when somebody loses their job it's usually unexpected it's usually you know a shock to the system sometimes they're not ready for it\nBut almost every time at least I've seen this happen so many times where somebody will lose their job and it's like look this was just your next step is just\nOne door closes another door appears which you can open up and walk through you know and I I I think that ah these I think the younger generations are I don't think they have any problem with this and they're going to be much more capable of of of and bracing this move\nBecause we are one of the automation we are the ... when we are the generations the changes jobs every six months or we work\nPart time a hard time that I'm all over the um all over the spectrum are\nThey worked there they worked one job their entire lives is all they know all they love it it's like I sounds awful I can I can understand how they could see a a job being lost and having to go and find another to me it's like I'm looking forward to ... go ahead Sarah\nNow why why at a bar fiber here on the ... now and are not like you know like you know when they think they're going to be other computer related got up and doing all they have\nTo talk about the money that all of that would get a universal basic income\nOr going to split so I I agree with what you were saying about why are these bus drivers afraid of the unknown uh\nUh that's true people are not just bus drivers that people generally tend to be afraid of change change because it is it does represent an uncertainty right like when you lose your job you're not sure where things are going to go from there\nAnd if you haven't been inculcated with the idea of hey look everything's going to be okay just look for opportunities get out there put it out there that you want things to change that you want a good you know things that come about and it's gonna happen for you\nIn a in a case of these unionized bus drivers I'm sure they are paid quite wary well and to try to go out and find a real job where they are providing customers with a real\nA real product trying to trying to get paid that much I think they I think they should be worried that they actually have to go out and it lowers like the rest of us by working yeah that's part of it is that they're afraid of losing a sweetheart deal\nThat they've had for so long the same problems with the ... the government unions and the and especially the teacher it's the same problem with a lot of established\nKind of jobs and industries as well look at the taxi drivers are that are upset about super and lift bringing in New oh yeah shop petition as they are right that competition is the big one right so um so I agree with your sentiments on this uh Sarah I think that people shouldn't be afraid of\nThe uncertain future should embrace it what you're talking about ... and it's always a better mouse trap and we should be looking to to to make our lives better\nMoving up and they voted but using the government like universal basic income or universal healthcare those are terrible ideas because those are always implemented through coercion and violence and thanks for the call tonight to get more coming up here to the five four fifty free like freedom and it's uncertain we don't know what's around the corner
