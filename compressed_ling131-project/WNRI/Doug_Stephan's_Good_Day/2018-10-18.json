talking a little bit about are the things that are important when you\nDoing this sort of thing is ... so is your husband a farmer you're on your at farmers' markets I Know\nWe're talking about the west coast the east coast you're located actually where\nIn Pennsylvania where Sherman Dale\nShame Perry county we're about we're not correct or Harrisburg or harm yet\nThat's a great charm area but\nGoing to learn you learn how to do this on the west coast and I\nIt back here so tell us about your a farm and then the introduction of the bread and the other baked goods to your farm I guess I'm I'm assuming because you have a commercial kitchen on a farm that you're selling um other days you have sort of a farm store do you\nNot right now where I'm\nBut so basically yeah we um my husband and I tell you what when I met him he was working on a farm or a pastor and poultry credit together we kind of wanted to learn how to figure out how we can incorporate passions ...\nLast year I ask you a personal question because it just comes up all\nIn my circle of friends how do you meet are there\nHow do you meet people of like interest like in your ... you and your husband they're interested in the same sort of thing and then they'll say well\nAll of these dating sites that are\nHave like interests and so when I hear people tell the story like you I Wonder\nWorking together how did you how do you because this is a very specialized area so I like I Know people like this on every\nCorner well I I just say that's all pure luck [laughter] really I mean I didn't I didn't really even think that I Would ever meet my partner but he actually was working I I Am a mile down the road from me and a lot of people that work with him that the girl living with me was dating\nA guy to another guy like working on that finally got together and that's [laughter]\nThat's a sweet errands because\nWhile to get it in ... ... yeah\nI so what else is let\nOurselves to your farm the farm search whatever reasons there\nThere are several reasons I wanted to tell stories like this and the fact that younger people are getting into farming or staying in the farming when we hear the stories you may have heard me talking before you went on the air but the problem is the older farms and farmers are having a just letting their bills so it does it look attractive to a lot of younger people\nWhy did it look attractive to you it's it's refreshing it's good to\nHave you bring the new bloody and but how did you figure you could make a go of it [laughter] oh\nI think I I've always been kind of German well I was going to be hard work but you know the level and we figured out a way and it's you know what will sit and cry from\nWhere we can get really to be creative and figured out how exactly correct me except for farm and that that the\nMoon gets graduate and selling to bury after her into value added product and they're like I'm like a croaker yeah cleared out how to make it all work together\nYeah um so what else can you have on how to protect\nWhat else do you have on your farm you have forty five acres in this county in Pennsylvania what else do you have on the farm\nI have no contract that right now the meat chicken and the pastor chicken um we're laying hens for eggs\nAnd we weren't getting paid until this last year we took a break from them can be so ... hot right at me but um yeah so that they call it that we we have a chicken stir\nPastures and land you know they live is the land and then in the power plant the weight and then there are three credit kind of crap on a second but kind of taken we're we're kind of make it a whole circle\nFull circle I hold on to saying well spent more time making that sort of a shame to Amsterdam on which judge different on the American family farmer\n... ever wonder why Europeans seem to be so many languages maybe it's because they use battle\nOne selling language learning habanero battles award winning

up right away they're going to work with us on the different components there the financing and everything I needed the best way to look at it so\nUm it was it was scary but you have to be confident and you have to take a risk\nAnd so so far away so I don't do the free guy I I Am horrible\nTo gluten and it's getting worse is I get older to the point\nWhere I Can't even have a good pumpkin donut [laughter] yes I Am a good pumpkin flavor donut this time of year so what do you do\nWhen it comes to those grains or how do you make things I've never understood that the gluten free thing seems to apply\nTo lots of different stuff not just breads and pastries and things so how do you find ... free sources\nWell I don't know that's a whole different business [laughter] I mean what are our bakery and stuff but that's the real Clinton and we love our gluten and unfortunately when we have ... but I felt great for you when I write what party you know to create things because\nFlower asset

lined up than my husband and I asked well equipped and [laughter] I don't eat raw\nFortunate that if you don't have to I don't necessarily want to do I do it because I have to because I don't\nTo have the ... and things that go with it and so the others who would prefer to have a it's like non dairy ice cream there's nothing worse than non dairy ice cream [laughter] have have you\nTried have you tried bread that are um prevented or some sand melt flower anything like that because now that the process of making bread I think at least from what I Believe what it might be affecting them\nOn the left side about ... when a quick process where you are naturally from inside if you if you do it properly right\nNo I've not heard of it I don't I'm not ... you haven't heard of that\nI so I'm not one who gets into the understanding of what's on their produce side of things and I didn't I guess that's why I asked you are because uh\nIt is something that he's on my mind and then the more you talk about it it's kinda like you buy a red car and Eric all you see going out of this raises a red car so [laughter] you know\nI rooting for him an allergy and so I talk about it and then this is very

I ran into some bad weather and ah\nPeople aren't wearing life jackets and things like that well one woman who survived although nine of her family members died during the accident she is now speaking out or because this has gone into a huge lawsuit obviously we knew that would happen however the the reason that she is a upset about this lawsuit is because\nThe company that dates called Ripley Entertainment there the company that operates the brands and duck vehicles\nThey are citing and this is some clever legal tricks here they're citing law from the Eighteen fifty\nThat says that ... that the company has a very limited liability because the uh they maintain the the vehicle properly which I think you could probably argue that they didn't\nUm but they said they prepared for the voyage and after the thinking the uh the boat with a total loss and sell this law firm Eighteen fifty one limits the liability or\nFor any type of class action lawsuits or any lawsuits in general and so I did this one woman who lost most of her family she said that uh\nShe finds that this is what they did basically makes her feel like her relatives losing their lives was worthless and ... is an incredibly hurtful and incentives and ah but this is what the lawyers are moving forward with and they say that they want to individually handle 'em\nSettlements obviously they want to keep this hush hush it's possible they don't want this to go to court and so apparently citing this type of law even though it's from Eighteen fifty one I guess it allows them to have a lot of wiggle room so it's just you know I I guess it's it's a very sad\nSo what do you go there for just to be entertained news as we we have infotainment and that's where the news attainment or whatever\nPayment is what this is supposed to be I guess right conversations like this radio and television talk programs that sort of dissect what's going on some of the stories we're following maybe there is a commonality and in some of the stuff that we talk about here is stuff that you weren't here anywhere\nElse wherever you destroy themselves or our thoughts about that because we are not in the main uh that's\nOf the things that I had not demanded that the people who have been on on demand much of anything but\nI think that I look for people who have different points of view maybe stronger points of view a than those that are expressed in some of the quote unquote mainstream media are so anyway\nI'm not surprised a you forty two percent say they they were they see as many as accurate with ... has confessed pretty much what we expect is that what you expect Victoria\nLet's all opinion based though I just sort of take an opinion right by trying to\nKill one stop for flooring and competing is D.
