people have worried Victoria Kim and you're good at this stuff from Victoria Jones I'd like to have you jumping on this as well or Facebook but was it fifty million people accounts were compromised yet again a\nIs going on there and why is with\nOf these questions I Know\nNumbers have gone down on Facebook but they don't seem to be going down appreciably and one\nWhy because they seem to be very well have just gotten to shore themselves what is going on there\nWell as in terms of numbers one of the reasons why Facebook's numbers have they've definitely dropped off but in the older demographic they have not because that's for two reasons one older people don't know how to disconnect and delete an account on Facebook and that's actually I'm not making a joke that is a very real thing and the second thing is\nFor a lot of older people that is still their lifeline of communication with family across the country or around the world and so those numbers of the older generation are always going to be there on Facebook but for a lot of younger people they've just you know pulled the plug\nAnd and you just keep hearing these stories time and time again that they've been hacked and the security isn't good and you know and again going back to the older generation using Facebook they're probably still using password one so they're even more vulnerable\nAnd they don't even realize that and I don't\nThey don't change their passwords they never change it well you have to change your passwords on a regular basis but you know get my mom to try to she got even on Facebook but if she was\nTo get her to change your password you know it's all I've got this sheet we're right on my password eye on it you know it's just it's never going to happen so unfortunately there are a lot of people who are very very vulnerable to all kinds of now where\nAnd but you know all kinds of stuff is is going to be that and\nLive with forever yes and this is it's going to be something that we have to learn how to deal with the way you deal with it as you change your password and you're right you're user name or at least a couple of times a year\nYup and I also said something very creepy I'm

this is me on your phone and computer says okay you can get in so is that good or bad return it\nWell in in its good about what Facebook has done it but ah they have been altitude and court\nBattling
