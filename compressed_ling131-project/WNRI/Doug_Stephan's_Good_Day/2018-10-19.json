already\nUp I saw the as I'm In Massachusetts there's always lots of news in the papers about Harvard in what goes on at Harvard apparently there's a I'm a doctor cardiologist named Pierre oh and

talking about the results of research the data that comes from studies are using again evidence based that phrase evidence based\nBut in this circumstance how can you be sure anything and everything is on the up and up Ken well that\nIs definitely a problem and because in medicine and science you have to assume that some legitimacy and that is why what you really want to do before you jump on any

this person is conscious forever and so so far we hope this is a rare\nIs a rare thing when when before something gets published it has to be reviewed by people in a lot of it is in the eyes of the

either protected or\nWe wash them and you'll notice you know doctors now they've got the keys to the uh\nTo to a farm and they and they know how to prevent these things and that's what they're basically doing they're just keeping their hands off their face and he do that\nYou will you prevent a lot of this you know you walk into a tight subway and everybody's coughing all over you you you can't get out you're you're ... you're going to get it you know here in a very sealed up spot and everybody's got it and there and it's flying around\nAnd so it's almost hard to avoid it but in most
