this is Brendan Murray and you are listening to health and wealth radio heard every Thursday morning here on WNPR I I Am president of a company called health and wealth ink and\nWe believe we are the only company that truly brings health care and wealth care together for the consumer and you know it may sound obvious well we have things like um you know early Tibet makes man healthy wealthy and wise right I\nI remember when we started the company name we we had been in the business\nAlready for over a decade but\nWe incorporated as health and welfare officially two thousand fourteen and I remember I was telling my cousin and he said well that's pretty much sums it up health and wealth has a nice ring to it doesn't it but\nThe idea of bringing together healthcare in wealth care in a way that makes sense for you the consumer is something that really hadn't been done yet in our industry and so we're blazing new trail and uh it just makes good sense to us that um\nIf you're concerned about your health care that one of the things are really concerned about is your wellbeing and part of that is your financial well being so um\nYou know anytime you make a decision to\nLower deductibles to lower co pays to minimize out of pocket expenses\nTo a save money on prescription drugs\nUm to cover surgeries if you go in the hospital to worry about um\nWith assistance with daily living activities of daily living what you're really saying is\nNumber one is I Want to be cared for well but number two who's going to pay for it that's really the question and that's a question of wealth now if you have your own money or your own assets the concern is well how much of this do I have to spend out of my nest egg in order to fuel my health care\nAnd so really pretty much if you're if you're really doing a thorough job if you follow the\nPretty much if you're if you're really doing a thorough job if you follow things to their their natural conclusion as soon as you start talking about health\nWhat you're really what you're really looking at is really a health wealth continuum we'll call it that so\nIt's like a like I was explaining to my son he's Thirteen he's asking a lot of questions about space and time black holes you know he's really fascinated with with the the science of space and you know\nOne of the things I explain to him Israeli it I Believe it's space time I don't think it's one without the other I think it's based in time together and you know as soon as you have distance between objects there's a distance in space and in time how much\nTime does it take for light to travel and so from one point to another so\nYou know in science we have these things just continue in space time together and I believe that and I are planning it's really health and wealth planning were the first to do it\nAs evidenced by our name but even more as evidenced by the vision of how we see the business so if you were\nConcerned about your health and well if you have questions about your health and well if you just want to make sure that your partnered with a company that understands these things and thinks about them in this way then we would really welcome an opportunity to work with you\nKnow we're very fortunate\nTo be working with uh\nExcellent people families throughout New England and\nNot only are in Rhode Island Massachusetts Connecticut and New Hampshire on but we have clients in Florida and we have clients in California we have clients in Illinois and Indiana and Texas and what happens is as people are spread out or\nThey have friends and family or someone sells their home and when socket and moved to Arizona um we don't just say bye nice serving you we say well we can continue to help 'em and now with technology\nYou know we are able to keep in touch with people I'm\nNot only with the telephone but even computer wise um\nYou know you can actually do a presentation for someone on your computer and it's not quite as good as being in there you know in their home or at the kitchen table or at a desk but I'm the technology is there where we can actually um\nPicking up your prescriptions at the pharmacy so things like home delivery you know some people love to go to the pharmacy every day it's a kind of a ritual it's an experience you know you get to know the person that behind the pharmacy in it and there's a lot of reasons why people like that but there's other people\nEither because of circumstance or desire that they cannot you know get to the pharmacy it's more of a burden than it is a um\nA pleasure so home delivery service the ability to get your prescriptions delivered to your home Ninety Days supplies and maybe even in a cost effective manner maybe in a way that you can save money by doing so it's a double when the conveniences there and the cost savings as their things like\nAccess to a nurse that you can talk to twenty four hours a day that some of the plans might have you know membership at the gym I extra\nMagazine that comes a health magazine that's um\nYou know goes out for being a member of the talks about healthy living a and and and that kind of stuff so there's lots of things that your plan may offer that go above and beyond just the fact that it's insurance\nAnd and it's really about health care\nCaring about you caring about your health and and that\nAdministration uh\nOf those services behind the scenes you know you're looking for companies that invest in that companies that have a vision about health care have a vision about how to serve their consumers better and on the wealth side it's the same thing\nIt is expensive and you don't want to get overwhelmed with the expense but you also don't want to be blindsided by expense is specially if there's something you can do about it so\nWhen people get closer to retirement it becomes very important to really look at possible expenses in retirement\nBecause when you're working when you have income coming in sometimes it's a lot easier to get away with not\nReally having a plan because money is coming in the door and you're able to pay your bills the challenges if you do stop working all of a sudden it becomes a reality of okay where's the money going to come from so\nWhen I sit with people one of the things that we like to do\nIs talk about\nYou know do do you have a budget not so much um\nThat we lecture you on you need to have a budget but like you may have had a budget when you were first starting out or maybe you had kids maybe you um\nYou know just got a mortgage or you know maybe it just became something not on paper but just in your head you've always been good with managing and budgeting and you know how to\nJust kind of self correct um you're spending so that you stay within your means but when you retire what I mean by budget I mean let's start thinking\nSpecifically about this phase of your life what you've never had to live through before which is the the phase of where's the money going to come in I'm not working for it anymore so where does the money come from it come from\nA that's a new phase for people when they retire for the first time they go from stop working not to stop living um\nFrom stop working so money's going to come from somewhere where's it going to come from we look at Social Security\nWe look at maximizing people's Social Security income so\nIf people are sixty two and they're trying to decide should I take Social Security early\nShould I delay it how long should I delay it should I wait till my full retirement age we actually have software and now we're not government employees by any means of course but we do have software in our industry so anyone who works in retirement planning really should have access to Social Security planning software\nThat can run the numbers for you and so you can see it are based on inflation based on a you know we don't know what the future will be but we can look to the past and and say well there there has been this inflationary um adjustments overtime cost of living adjustments so we can\nKind of baked into the presentation or the illustration so that you can see how much would Social Security cover for you and what will the shortfall be and whatever that shortfall is we need to make up that shortfall so the good news is maybe we don't have to\nMaybe like let's say you need three thousand dollars a month\nWell Social Security is paying Thirteen hundred of it maybe we don't have to come up with three thousand we just have to come up with the difference and so now maybe you have an IRA and maybe you're going to have required minimum distributions and we run that number for you and we say well\nThat's going to be five hundred a month right well so now now we've got the Social Security plus the required minimum distribution so now we only have to come up with\nAnother few hundred dollars and so we can look at that together with you in from that we can build a plan or\nWhen we look at the health care we may say well this is um\nThis is what some of the costs could be depending on what your health experience has been perhaps\nI could be depending on what your health experience has been perhaps or no one knows what it will be in the future but we can look at history and what the last two three four five years of looked like I mean if someone's\nRegularly going to a doctor visits or or physical therapy or has knee surgery plan to there's no sense pretending\nThat's not so right you want to factor that in so you know if we know what your expenses are or what they've been we can build that in and say well here's a plan that might work better for you\nAnd when we say better we're talking about dollars you know yes we're talking about your experience but we're also talking about money so you know\nI'll sit with someone else showing the plant and they may say I really liked this plan because it has X Y and Z you know maybe it's got a better Jim network than another plan for ... you can go to a gym for a little less money or whatever but you don't\nYou don't choose a health care plan as a better word than by you know choose your health care plan simply because of who has a better Jim network right you bet you buy for the whole experience in one of those things that we're looking at is expense\nExpense we've got to look to value today you know what that's the biggest challenge is binding value you got to look for value value means more\nFor less you know you want the best quality you can get\nFor the least amount of money nothing more frustrating than spending more money than you think something is worth and not having a great experience you know\nI always use food in my in my in my analogies but you know went to a restaurant somewhat recently and it was more expensive say than other restaurants might be a\nA not the most expensive restaurant you could go to by any means but just we'll just say a little bit more pricey than your average restaurant but the quality wasn't that great and you know when they they didn't they didn't bring out\nYou know they didn't bring up the bread before the meal like they usually do and and when they did they didn't bring out the dipping oil and and they forgot\nYou know I'm\n... and then but my wife ordered a a Caesar salad with anchovies and they brought one anchovies on the salad you know an show visas plural isn't it anchovies there was one you know it was one anchovies on there so you may as well if you're going to just put one anchovies just don't even mention it right just\nJust chop it up and put it on top of\nYour value is the key some there's nothing worse than paying and overpriced\nPaid for and overpriced product that inferior quality well in your health care and in your wealth care those are two big ones we want to get it right\nSo sometimes I'll sit with clients and they've got a financial advisor you know\nIf I'm sitting was sent one sixty five Seventy years old usually they have something saved you mean like I get like I said before you may they might not have many commas and many zeros and their net worth but they've got something saved and\nIt's very common for people to have someone they've worked with over the years but very very often\nYou know they feel like well I haven't really heard from the person or you know when I call I kind of feel like I'm\nLike down on the list of important to them and that's not something that you should feel like you know again I don't promote feeling as the main reason why you should do business with us it's not how you feel it's also how would how we deliver you know its results but you know you definitely shouldn't get the impression that\nI'm a burden to this person I'm working with a ... if you're dealing with your investments in your healthcare you have the right\nYou have the ability never mind the right you have the ability to get grape service you know there are some hungry businesses out there are fewer people hungry for your business and who deserve your business you know so\nWe're not the only people out there that are hustling to pay attention to the customer service but we have that plus the knowledge base plus the vision of how to do it\nA plus the infrastructure and the background and experience and the people behind us backing us up\nUh so it's not just me and it's not just Jim we have Jonathan Travers our general office manager who's there when we are out on the road to call a to take calls to assist clients with questions and then we also have our network\nOf accountants\nThat we can call if there is a a deep tax question right we have special uh\nExperts within different fields that can actually answer questions so if I'm sitting with someone on a long term care question I Know quite a bit about long term care insurance but I have access to also myself\nTo getting illustrations done for me that can look at various products that might work for that person in that state so it's even state specific\nUm you know some people\nAre maybe someone has sleep apnea and for some long term care insurance companies that's a problem if they're not wearing their ... their sleep apnea mask there see pop mask they might not accept a\nWhereas another policy it might treated a little differently so um\nIt's very important to understand that it's not just\nYou know I'm not just banging the drum shooting the horn ... crashing the symbol and saying come work with me health and well now we have a business that can service your needs um from now and throughout your retirement you can reach me off the air at eight eight eight four to nine four seven to seven\nYou can also reach us on the Web anytime at health wealth financial dot com\nAnd we're
