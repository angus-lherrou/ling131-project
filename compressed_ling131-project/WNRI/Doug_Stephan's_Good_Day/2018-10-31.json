keep working at all studies or they do\nStudy of studies and then instead of having new information some of them are new but there's a lot of stuff based on all\nThe info it's all put together and it depends on who pays for the study yes the desired there are people who are going to studies and they're told\nOr this is what I Want\nFigure out how I can do it justified legally behind me you know some and that's why doctors and research people do I want this conclusion get me there however you can get me to get me there and what what's out\nThere some forbid knowledge some of the absolute best
