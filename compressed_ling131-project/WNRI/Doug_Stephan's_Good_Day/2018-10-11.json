up to the parliament to decide\nThose in favor of the change say civil partnerships allow people who object to the idea of marriage to have the same legal and financial protections I think that's a

case on budgets and spending money and a crazy we've gotten in spending spending spending a lot of money being spent on immigration crackdown\nBut apparently a\nAccording to some numbers that have been released this week the number\nWho are supposed to be deported like three million is what's the problem is number was about ten percent of that yet we're spending\nOf money or the budgets are as many holes in it thanks to all the efforts is it worth the effort is the question Jennifer is it worth the time and effort and money we're spending to\nOn illegal immigration or the or the people who are here to no\nWhat it costs about no matter what it costs I mean obviously you have to do\nA comparison but I live in a state where immigration is out of control and it has killed the state they said in California is the richest and the poor state all at the same time in the country and that is not only because it's not all immigration salt that's really left leaning\nProgressive if you will whatever we want to call a policy that has kind of taking the the path of socialism and has provided the end to the middle class in California or at least the the\nI guess maybe the destruction of the

just wasn't enough because the amount of people using it were\nAnd it would not being covered by the taxpayers and the state so I when you see how it has affected California education were forty seven and a nation when it comes to schools in California it's a combination of not\nHaving the resources to pay for the onslaught of people it's also that people are coming here and putting their kids in school or not learning English as their first language or sorry their second language and that puts the kids that are really\nThat it starts them at a slow pace that puts them at at a disadvantage so when you see not only the social but the economic dangers of having immigration that's out of control I see yes ultimately it is worse because the problems in California are going to seep are already
