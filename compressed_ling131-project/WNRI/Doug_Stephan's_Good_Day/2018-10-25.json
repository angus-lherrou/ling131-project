I've had\nThey were expecting to watch the screens like we did on the way out and it was just the whole plane everybody was clearly nerdy\nAnd with no food it was disgusting it was literally like if you've ever been in Europe and you have to take like a I'm a regional flight between say if you go between the Ireland in France or Ireland in England you know it's like you're on there was old Ryan air light stats that don't like it felt like we were in some crappy European\nQuick to jump you know you know more than an hour and a half in the air and it would've been OK but to go all the way across the country and this was a direct flight I I I just said I was like never again I'm not you ever choosing United\nUnited or nothing's bachelor the ... it's a way I'm going to go and\nRude offering we had you had to hunt down the flight attendant and I said can I purchase food that ... me\nThe service on these planes now and\nAnd they're entitled positions the older\nOnes usually are better although in your case you know that's the older ones they\nIns you older oh yeah it's like can you just retired already the what's the matter with well\nI mean that's the my sister's Seventy four and she still is in a active she flies eighty five dollars a month for the delta\nRight but it's like if you hate your job that much then you know to do right yeah why do you that's exactly the entitlement these people are I don't\nOnce I was doing [laughter] Hi from from New York to Los Angeles and\nHad just come in from uh some of the bait overnight and then they were doing a\nWest coast and the guy who\nWas the pressure was so\nAngry and just Henri is out so I said to him what is your problem sir we don't do their best flights this girl was like [laughter] where I asked\n... whether you're so lucky I guess your thought oh my way out we we have this this older or this older male flight attendant who just\nHe just hated everything and we were in we were in the premium economy which gives you like four inches Marta does make a difference yeah next to us was our friend\nWho was the uh fishing for my brother and sister in law's wedding he had a suit in a little like folded overseeing and so he asked he normally flies in first but he does he travels a lot for business\nBut he was sold out so he asked the flight attendant if there's room in the first class closet would you be able to hang in this up for me it's the suit for a wedding yeah you know that he asked the guy for a kidney it was such a run around and it was and then he literally he said you know it just never mind I'll just hold it on my lap\nDon't worry about me so I Know I'm here to please you it was just the worst customer service it was horrible they don't get it never again don't get it the only thing I think it was his own yard at this point that's the only thing that was missing on the flight with a dog that unfortunately died because the United was negligent\nYeah it is amazing how these in these what they've done what it is is basically give you what\nMonopolies is all about the same thing with the rise in and the same thing with him just name the industry where\nOne company keeps buying up all the competitors and they're all by themselves and they do what they want and they tell US government goes grew and that's what happens\nWell let me ask one more question then we'll get off the ran for the airlines I used to I grew up flying continental and I always loved continental I thought it was a great airline how to unite it ended up being the top dog in that merger I don't get in\nBecause kind of went bankrupt in the United bought\nThe at everything about continental that it is gone right\nOnce and then the merger mania took place and so this is only been maybe less than ten years actually I so now you but you feel better I gave you the opportunity to be a lot of people listening who have had the same experiences and so they say yeah they are yeah yeah yeah\nYou tell them yeah I Know get them and you might have even been on my flight with me\nHurt or if you had been lying was pretty good to me so there you go oh\nYeah yeah yeah yeah\nMe and Hawaiian with a
