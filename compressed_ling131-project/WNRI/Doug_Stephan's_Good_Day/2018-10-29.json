Jennifer I get started with an item return for many trending department\nAnd the question is just how divided are way yeah and of course then in the focus because at the suspicious packages that have been sent over the last several days and the hot rhetoric on both sides of the aisle in response to it there's a new survey that has been done by the Associated Press and Newark\nNewark Center for Republican bears they'd\nNewark Newark Newark is that like more work\nWork toward Newark right mark Georgia and\nUh they did to admit they did some research they did a poll and they talked about it and let it cool division and the United states than a newly released survey found that more than eight and ten Americans think the country is greatly divided about important value is just twenty percent of Americans say they think the country will become less divided over the next few years\nThirty nine percent think things will get worse and a strong majority of American Seventy seven percent said that they're just\nIt will get worse and a strong majority of Americans Seventy seven percent said that they are dissatisfied with the state of politics in the country that his poll was conducted October eleventh through fourteenth so that's before these suspicious packages and and all of the uh\nThe intensification of of even this problem so I imagine those numbers are even higher today but it's done in the final sprint towards the mid term\nElections in which President Trump has been rallying his supporters to turn out to vote in November however fifty nine percent of Americans disapprove how Trump is handling his job as president forty percent of Americans according to this poll actually approve of the president's job and I think how Americans\nThey're viewing press the button that divides itself along partisan lines according to this poll at least eighty three percent of Republicans approve of how Trump is handling his job\nNinety two percent of Democrats sixty one percent of ... of independents said that they do not approve so I think you can take a couple of lessons from this obviously we know we're divided and that's something that we need to tackle on both sides of our political aisle but you can also look to see how the president and the RMC or\nActually taking misinformation to put to work to try to turn out the president's base to keep the house and the Senate in a in a couple of weeks and we all go to vote and that is that he's going to states where Hillary Clinton didn't win he's going to states and districts to campaign for members of the house and the Senate and even governors who\nAre in states that are considered to be trumped state so his job instead of trying to convert independence or trying to convert Democrats to his way of thinking is just simply energized his own base to try to\nOf the stores in the ... the next time for me you're opening another one which gives me in a a mall\nA plaza down in ...
