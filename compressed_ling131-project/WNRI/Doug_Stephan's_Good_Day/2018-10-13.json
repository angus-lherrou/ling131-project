attract people love\nThey with the same degree of animals they dislike Hillary or at least some people do but\nA man yeah there are people who just like real but there's something about it that just very dry heat ...\nI don't know what they're it hits every level you are in\nFriends of mine ... never forget that my mom and I belong to the uh to 'em and historical preservation group and so with lots of little old ladies and on and they're very very Republican and I remember years ago when I was a kid they had met somehow they met Bill Clinton and both both these two little old ladies they said you know\nWe're you know we we didn't vote for him we never what the what when ... when we met him\nWe kind of got it like like they had like they figured out some great they said that they like really like when you meet him in person he's got this magnanimous kind of or\nHim and they said that they they definitely were swooning up a bit\nUntil you question him about the sexual assault stuff because all the cabinet all good it's well it'll be all that kind of a story this week is that they're going out on this tour and bill really should be just kind of laying\nRight now waiting for almost a blow over before he comes back out because I Know unfortunately this has been planned for a while\nRight now Hillary has to answer to her covering up for Bill and calling these women ... you're going to be sure any questions from the audience you're going to be well\nScreen yeah had do they're going to be having held have Fred back in the third\nPleased right they ...\nSome news channel the other day and he got a little testy what them\nYeah well the heat and pushed on Monica Lewinsky recently read and so I I think that's where he said look you know either ... yeah because of the movement or she is now the Monica Lewinsky has labeled herself as an activist\nI'm so she kind of been a little more visible recently but you know I look look if they're going to go out and be on tour together I don't think it would be Hillary's and though to back away from those questions maybe bill doesn't want to answer them but I think Hillary would I really do\nWell it'd be interesting what you're going to say power couple yeah what are they say\nWell well I don't know whether it's going to be all he had to go either ...\nAnd all the rest of them Jennifer Flowers ... ... ... what's your response to that ...\nQuestion then let her answer it\nI mean your husband was a serial Jeter I don't know if he was you know we don't know if he was a sexual assault or like the way that you know Brett Kavanaugh was accused of oil and and the bill Cosby type stuff I\nDon't know ... what did she marry a deadbeat has been absolutely but you know that's her choice to stick with him style a deadbeat has been in what way he's he was a serial cheater to me that he was a day that tell you it and\nThey should have you did a really for me personally I thought a deadbeat has will be so we didn't pay his alimony their luggage at your bad invented Debbie good at so trends parents it's just that I bring them to a way to\nMoney but you know what the LA any different than I did on me in

attracted to and loves having my body us as white whether it was er I don't know in my body was there for convenience and [noise] right right I mean she loves him too I don't know maybe she does\nSo

Nancy Brinker yup yeah\nOK who would be good\nWas uh um\nRicky what's the for now I Can't remember a name I saw somebody had written the somebody that we don't know they just kinda does good and then you get up there and they didn't stop all\nTheir like having another Brett Kavanaugh thing though the un investors have to be approved by the Senate\nIs that another ... Brinker has already been confirmed because she was in I'm\nIn ... or how to Hungary under George W so I think she already went through the Senate confirmation so I think that might be part of the reason a she's a woman and I think it might be part of the reason why she she would pretty much sail through a Senate confirmation\nI'm guessing that uh that she will not do the kind of work that Nikki Haley has done a good job to adapt as Hitler\nBut you know she's ever took like she said is that a tough a years but they are in the headline was all about our finances yeah so she had the same financial difficulty a lot of his ... why are we focusing on that\nScale I guess she also mentioned that tale that she wanted to get back into the private sector because of that so I I don't think it's a big story I think it's just a real legitimate reason\nHigh number four is something I have nothing to say I'm tired of the cabinet discussion aftermath is more of the same garbage anybody have anything to say\nI Will say something if you have something that is kind of you know I I got a chuckle out of it this week my new favorite website is Brett Kavanaugh dot com so yeah and it has and the role and therefore it\nIt is because now with someone bought the domain name brand of having a set of owned his own domain name was ... yeah\nAnd so the the when you go on to write the cat Brett Kavanaugh dot com it's an entire website That's devoted to raising money for victims of sexual assault so I thought that was kind of that you know you're not seeing or and they are right and\nDo my
