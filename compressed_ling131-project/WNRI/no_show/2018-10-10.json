I I don't get how did that help you in any way other than just as you said it it really seems to be nothing more\nThan playing the role of the spoiler\nYeah and and as you said he has internal also put them up near that amount than his vote total and I you know I just don't buy it he obviously was a a quantity in Rhode Island\nYeah one of their mind walk with Governor and run for lieutenant governor but finished that if he had done that and we asked them where did you come up with that number how come there's no expenditure said blight volunteers to ... their ... the the plumbing poll instant Joan he slammed the Joel plumbing polling September now suddenly\nHe's he doesn't believe polls but he believes his polls done by I it's it's just becoming less credible to me by the daycare chest and\nCertainly in and out of the adding to that and I do is this idea that they've got this Eighteen you mentioned earlier how they got a kind of luck John Robert Hi and on and violets signed up to be part of the administration and\nI've spoken with John overtime and can block and both of them\nSay absolutely yes on on that I Would participate in administration to ah and I got I got in the same central Arlene I'm disgusted with her a and actually I don't find it already reached out to kind of ... to\nBe part of that so the whole idea that there's a team that's going to come in and make up for whatever it is that Joe Joe accidents administration that two dozen you don't you don't get passed a little bit of scratching to say that that's just another talking like and you can only do that so much\nUntil until you even start to erode whatever support you already have\nA which was about ... to seven percent range\nWas and I'm a couple of the things that and we will move on to the Senate race but just sticking with that being promoted and\nWhat what I what I think a nerve that they have if anything's been I'm On earth in some way and it was Patricia more indoor credit she did it and that is some former members of the Republican Party that Iran that obviously feel under appreciated and\nIn some ways want to be part of the conversation and perhaps\nNot to the moon but to even be relevant again for instance\nThe Arlene violent writes a column for the belly breeze and as I said I worked with ... ... years I've known I saw this past summer a theater by the sea I'm obviously a friendly with her in that respect but her column in the valley breeze I mean Arlene violent\nHates President Trump voted for Hillary Clinton is in favor of sanctuary cities\nHe wrote a column in the valley breeze praising joked furloughs performance in the debate\nNow Joe cello during those to be interrupted fond six times\nHe called Alan ... a wimp prior to that he referred to farm and Raimondo with paying these\nAren't lean violent be arming the pilots and I knew never would have been on board\nViolent be arming the pilots and I knew I never would have been on board with the candidate that behaves in those ways by the way she never mentioned that in your column where she thought shrill oh stole the show with the debate\nThat he interrupted funk six times and called him a wimp at the debate it just makes me wonder if them agreeing to be part of it is more of what they have tapped into some of these form of people that are run\nFeel totally unappreciated by the party and so the at the first phone call like someone you know the day of the prime Nick off the phone rings that they're they haven't been invited there there are so desperate to be part of a conversation\nThat willing ... really willing to jump into to any situation because if you look at the way trailer was comport himself during this campaign and what his views are\nAnd where Arlene is\nNormally she never would be on board with Joe terminal but it doesn't seem to matter she's more flattered that he'd been asked her to be part of this you know thriller administrators shouldn't if the rapper is such a thing\n[noise] but I Am not knowing her I I couldn't speak to that but it does it does seem strange and she has she didn't have nice things to say about President Obama and it's just that she wouldn't be enamored of Joe true although certain really doesn't make a whole lot of sense and do\nYou mean by the way in the valley breeze I mean I don't know if you had a chance to read by ... said you know someone who's angling for a position of and and the administration be writing columns\nAlmost objectively and then never mentioning that she's supposedly part of the ... campaign if he gets elected this whole thing it'd be a team or whatever the hell they're calling it um but go ahead finish the thought on that thought\nIt was a big thing about that I mean I can understand uh she she advocated for an inspector general for a long time so she may see this as a as a good face on his or her but she may be seeing this as an opportunity to get that implemented but don't you just mentioned in a rep shipping males comment\nPoints to why that's a bad idea the inspector general especially of all the positions she's not going to be up for chief of staff\nOr something so cause the political the\nThe inspector general position should be independent so if you've got somebody coming in and going oh this guy is great I Can't wait to be a part of his administration how much can you trust that inspector general to be objective try in assessing the administration that in a in a matter of corruption and so there's a lot of just strange\nBarrett has a very Rhode Island feel all of this is a lot of her personality driven or people in relatively small groups going after each other a ... and it just it quickly get beyond rational explanation is just people fighting because they hold some kind of grudge\nThat's what it seems to be and it's funny you mentioned that again postcard afternoon it's time to be trust thing but just the cats managing our approaches they ... I've always believed in it and\nI don't remember if it was governor among do or Chris me around on the Senate but opposition should be created for the position not you know create a position for ... so this whole notion that\nYou know Patricia Morgan was putting it forward that she wants to position which someone disagrees with but then it should be Arlene violent I I think the\nMerits of the position outweigh any potential candidate that may you know fall into that because that's just not the way to design it what do you make of the fact just and now we're waiting I Believe the next debate next Monday Night the gubernatorial debate with Cranston mayor Allen fund a\nGovernor Jean Armando and the pillow and then this time though they're also going to be including the moderate party candidate I think at that ... percent is this bill go but but I I never remember the onslaught I'm God you're put on local TV the negative ads the Raimondo the bomb throwing it ... it remind\nYou about the bombing of Dresden during World War two I mean everything I can even recite\nOr the ads that they it is a non stop onslaught towards mayor ... right now to ... and he is still\nStanding right up there I I like the new funds spot that his out that talks about had small business people from the city of Cranston um through everything they're putting up with with with a month ago the ... campaign they are still holding strong\nBut\nThey're doing what but they have to do and I I think a a positive message will help to create that contrast there there is a cost to negative campaigning um and it's it's I'm actually a little surprised that remind us spending\nSo much of her or resources doing that they they must they must have looked at the favorability ratings and decided that owns favorability is really\nWhere they have to to push a and maybe they're open unless the for their candidate in that and because she has been picking up the whole thing with the police report and so on [noise] um but but it it actually I I thought they'd be concentrating much more on just the retail politics and\nAnd pay and mail ballot people to go out and get get those for um the fact that they feel like they have\nTo pump up as negative seems seems a little bit strange and probably speaks to how negative people's feelings are toward her by contrast you got clearly her campaign people are still out there pumping the national media\nLook forward to his ex CIA alright for their district and cats right here on the job that paid Tricia listen on this Tuesday\nI Want to remind you I received a nice of email\nFrom one of our listeners said Jon I Want to thank you I said thank me for what they said thank you for telling us about double double a wine bar and grill dying seventies Douglas roof\nEvidence for field authentic Italian food [noise] creative affordable dining at ... the low folks remember Monday through friday three course price lunch\nFourteen Ninety five\nTo ...\nT Ninety five three horses one time I went I started with a delicious salad [noise] then\nHad the tremendous delicious grilled swordfish ... hours of fresh pasta\nOr enjoy them fresh ... double oh\nMaybe I brought a friend and he loved their big cod at a bowl of stopping and feed them three course price fix lunch just fourteen Ninety five at\nTemple [noise] three cost price fake blood and remember trouble or whether it's chicken farm fields harm whole desserts made fresh in house you're going to lump determined to do\nFor the she lined by the mole wine bar in Tuscan brown Leonard his staff to a tremendous job nine Seventy five groups evidence for field whether lunch dinner or drinking or wild ... of wind but they have\nFailed waiting ads and also check them out on my they do a lot of takeout catering symbol on\nT.

I had a ... a a generator and I had to have it rebuilt because the additives that gas ruined all the gas gets\nAnd I went up to you know I this year's ago idea lawnmower they told me stabilize or it's not good what they do is they put Harris seen it a little bit of kerosene like announcer something you're going to leave a full but ... you're going to put less\nAnd what the army does they they do what they call the fuck it when I was there when they have kind of rate isn't all that they uh they put the train it out and they they spray it a little bit with oil\nAnd that that stops it from anything from happening now having to different remedies different opinions but that's what they didn't and I like I said they told me kerosene so stabilize or I tried that before he didn't do much good I just had to buy coverage on my arm or\n... like the carburetor if it gets white means you can use it because it'll stop but it was All right All right so I got to put that in in the spring I was going to put it out but a season's over so I wait till spring\nOkay but\nYou're probably better off to train it like it and then and when you put the kerosene all the little boy when you pull it caught so it gets a carburetor and keep staff from\nArmy so\nI guess everybody has their own opinion that's ... that's what I mean they have plenty of them so they know what they're doing I think\nYes I was what was that I said yes\nOkay now what was that shooting you said I didn't catch one it was\nIt was um it was a C ... on Monday oh\nI didn't hear about it [noise]\nLet me see it says a new face charges Monday's incident Monday and even in Sunday\nOkay and once they have something in a city I went to the breeze I went to the call I couldn't find it and I had to read the story in Boston paper had it even though they they have it here I don't know why they had it but it was suddenly I forget what it was but it was something kind of I guess\nWell written and the reason they put it in a day late in the courtroom very simple then went to the mind the papal does not crazy I mean and they lose a ... and his\nAnd readers and so they do want to do in a day or unless it's very very hot story of them would you leave on a on line to even find a paper you know that type of stuff so\nThey should do maybe like they'd go up in a in a New Hampshire as a paper up there they they give it frees published every day and they have so many ads because\nYou know it's a free paper is distributed everybody and and I think it's full of ads and it was probably ... or something like that\nBut for every year I forget what places but somewhere at Hampshire right and and worship there\nSo I mean maybe they should try that here I mean it got Seventy five that's not much and if the advertisers know everybody's got it they're going to advertise more now\nI Want to call them for their own paper\nJournal print print somewhere else right but then on a running it here\nYeah but they they have to develop print paper daily the they have to deal with a journal or I don't know if the uh the the the German prince their own people assume you're probably other things so it's it's a matter of cost and other things like that a\nPriority itself I'm near my watch that Africa was that little town is that right but he goes\nRight but I mean they couldn't give it a try an idea that too much now I mean nobody's running by now\nNow I'm Charlie hall\nI went to see him at ... high school once there was a good clean show\nCame to the stadium so I bought tickets for their bunch of people and that was just like at the bottom fest now I called him at home and I actually went down to ... falls for his performing a couple of days later I got all my money back and I told him I said they should tell you if it's going to be a show like that\nAnd after that I noticed whenever they had a show like that they put a a a mature audience only so you know\n'cause they don't want to spend your money for something that you know like so that's what they do now\nWell my question is not I don't think anybody seeking a calm Follies from family event which is what autumn festival the ball\nAround me about

the top and you're going to take out all the seats [noise] once you do that you're going to put it in a big UPN where water\nTurned it upside down and you're going to bake it for forty five minutes to an hour that's going to get it's often so you can finish baking\nWhen I met that was one of the upside down so that the whole is going to be facing is going to be in the water\nYes yes because you want that stimulus effect to go up inside inside the pumpkin you know exactly know pull my stuffing mix you can use anything you want folks but for this application I view choice\nStewed tomatoes in Hamburg white rice white rice or you can use rice pilaf whatever you want you can use ... whatever you want I Will cook that I had basically that's followed your the application that's on the box and so forth I mix at all and I cook it\nAnd then when the pumpkin comes out like turn it over\nAnd stuff it\nBut before I ... I Want to add a little cinnamon nutmeg all spices whatever you would like on the lining of the company and then you stop it then you take a cab you don't throw it out and you put it back onto the pumpkin and you put it back in the oven a three Seventy five\nAnd you got a big issue for another thirty two\nAnd the five and you got a big issue for another thirty to forty minutes\nAnd then at that point you're going to pull it out take off the cap let it cool\nOkay let it settled all those natural beautiful juices that would bubbling will settle into the product into the pumpkin into the rice or the mash whatever you want to use okay and let it cool et cetera\nAnd then you can cut it in half or cut it in a quarter depending on the size of your pocket they any actual hit the shallow the punk and to some people have but I I I Will just eat\nThe stuff in the stuffing in the pumpkin inside talk or not the outside shell but none exists off this stuff in ... alright okay yes so there you go as a rice or a a do tomatoes tomatoes that's on the line of canned yes yes but you can use\nAny tomato if you want to use a fresh tomato that's fine if you want to use hamburger and mashed potatoes that's fine you can put any stopping you want in that pumpkin anything is fine whatever you enjoy liver worst [noise] no\n[laughter]\nI'm Sorry I won't go out on ...\nSo this year a year recap of this stuff pumpkins up cause I well I think we did it a few weeks ago but you know the pumpkins of flying out of the stores right now and I'm perhaps some people were just wanted to try and they didn't jot down a few weeks ago we're going to be talking apples now his number two this is your double does\nYes it is what are we making well last week we did apple pie but I have a a another recipe for Apple Chris now with this ... this apple dessert you don't need a quest\nOkay you need your food and then the topic and basically what you're going to have is four cups of fresh fruit [noise]\nNow you can use eight people in this application I'm using apples\nYou're going to build them and call them and get four cups of fresh fruit one pound of Apple's\nJust to give you some guidance one pound of Apple's appeal to the court is eagle eagle street cops so you need four cups of this recipe so you need a bottom up on the record upon them act okay then you're going to need a quarter\nPound of all purpose flower a quarter cup of oats a\nHalf a cup of blood sugar and a quarter cup of salted butter okay\nYou're going to pre heat the oven to three hundred and Seventy dry and Seventy five degrees and you're going to get a a cut the food into one inch pieces lay them in a nine inch Greece\nBaking dish you don't want to use aluminum aluminum foil paying for that she wanted a basically a glass baking dish okay now you're going to\nBe ... with about off you're going to take all your ingredients your\nFlower you're oats your sugar\nAnd the rest of the butter and you're going to mix together until it's a crumbles okay you don't want to solid piece you want to on one side is done you're going to put\nYour foot on the bottom to crumble on top and then you go to\nBake for approximately thirty minutes Oh hi yes\nMaybe thirty five to forty depending on how much you want your apples to cook but you don't want to burden how how do we were up making three hundred and Seventy five for survival right\nAnd then that that is just the simple recipe and if you want you can always add more blown should go to the apples before you put on the to crumble\nOkay don't forget your but no ice queen [laughter]\nTo put that on when you take it ... or ... after the oven\nYes [laughter]\nThat's a lot different than the apple Chris by made once oh what did you do job all the that recipe was a take out a box removed film and microwave [laughter]\n[laughter] oh my ... got ...

the uh\nUh latest a police blotter\nAnd uh all together and they were\nAbout Nineteen arrests from October ...\nThrough today yes okay so uh that's the story they get all the details in today's one socket call\nWell getting back to a Brady Robinson who's being held at the CIA by the way and uh he'll be back in court on October the twenty third yes on another topic\nA neighbor works is in the ah the news and that's ... works of one sock it but this time they're in the news because uh they're buying the old abandoned Andrews meal on great wrote in North Smithfield the old Tupperware plant\nYes Tupperware are operated out of their spin empty for a long time I don't know how long but a ... a ... quite a long time\nAnd I'm going to be interesting to see what they do they say they're going to a ... it's a mixed use redevelopment projects and I'm\nCurious to see if naval works will offer a subsidize affordable housing\nIn this complex in North Smith feel I don't know if they allow that and not Smithfield there's not much of it is some of their way at the low end of the scale and when it comes to how much affordable a subsidized housing they have in North Smithfield cause we\nHave the price you and when socket we have more than anybody\nElse probably more than anybody else would want but that's a whole other story isn't it huh maybe you have a comment seven six six Thirteen eighty that's our number feel free to join us and again any topic at all is fine\nWith us say seven six six Thirteen eighty that's the number to call and put in your two cents okay okay\nRon sends us I'm a story about hurricane Michael er which actually is nearing category five\nAnd what was interesting too I heard a report about a half an hour or so ago usually when these storms you know go over land they tend to weekend but a hurricane Michael has held onto its strength\nThat's on the west coast of Florida\nGood afternoon Iran W in Iraq I I Am fine how about yourself and other damn how do you go what more can yeah so at least shining right yeah\nI'm here in the city on a crowded how hard it is what it is [noise] uh [noise] I wanted to just comment on on your [noise] query for a view industry drove our\nYeah what do you think he's got to do and not Smith and what is it well I think they're going to get just as they did was I remember when I did that big project on Greenville absolutely gorgeous over fifty five\nProject that at ...\nAt a waiting list to get into okay yes yes absolutely gorgeous ...\nAnd I think you're going to do the same thing the man [noise] and I don't think\nThat you have stores up there are so I don't think you're going to have you on it's I think you're going to continue to elderly I was there is going to maintain his political blocks in Providence has subsidized him these decades\nIn Providence that has subsidized him for these decades and he's going to continue to shaft those urban communities like us that are supposedly the beneficiaries of of a lot of infrastructure for water in ... ... and now it's to our detriment ...\nAnd even and even when we sought to get a kept mumbling resorted to kind of capital comprehensive plan\nYes uh it wasn't it wasn't allowed we have trouble holding it true\nWhen would submit that comprehensive plan every aspect is scrutinized by some lose a bureaucrat in Providence and I read the results when they came back and they wouldn't cap it again because of our strong infrastructure and said that we could actually go higher\n... and you remember at the time they wouldn't let us use economic economic development as the strongest caviar and our comprehensive plan to try to turn around ...\nWell I don't remember all the details but I'll take your word for it\nWhere we did you know said that that job number one and a comprehensive plan the new comprehensive plan was economic development ... to create a larger base more diverse base and and I totally true that\nGetting back to this ah project in not Smithfield or you say you think it's going to be four fifty five in over rights that that's that's what you're thinking they're going to\nDevelop in that or even older than that you know what I'm saying your house you know I wouldn't have a problem with more of that in the city or I don't know about you but uh I Would\nI Would I Would and and you know again historically speaking let's go back toward a viewer when they wanted to put another thirty or forty you're on the Senate or water viewing and they took 'em all our for chicken dinners and everything you have the problem you're having your electoral process right now\nBecause you're inundated with these individuals who pay nothing who get panda too and and and treated so extremely well band or just the right word I guess\nThat uh they vote for whoever's in office and who buys them the most peace or and\nSo we have too many senior citizens in the city already as much as we\nWe had and and you know you know a lot of people were on housing we have probably the highest percentage for for a total a population we\nProbably do have an area of Chicago and prominent yeah yeah we probably know you're doing all benefit\nAnd if and if I Want to throw this and I want to go back because the other day had no time for me but I was talking about the ... and I'm saying that with or without a expanse of water problems right now and a law on the books that that says that communities are to to have ten percent of what about housing in their community right\nWe should be filing a class action suit\nOkay with the other urban areas that are stuck with a higher percentile I like that I get dumped to raise a numbers up or to get the state if they really choose to do that to get to stay to come and take over our education department completely to take that a burden off our back\nWouldn't that be great if one of our state reps jumped the board that idea huh\nWouldn't it be great and and I was reading the wall Street Journal just last week and they they uh they did an update for the whole country you to three hundred and thirty five million people in the country how many families ... and uh the average\nFamily income for the whole country I quote in you know the southern states in the Midwest states and everything\nIs a little bit over six two on between sixty one and sixty true and now let's go back to an socket where we're between thirty four thirty section and you know I brought this up at least a hundred times the problem is the disposable income for us to support this kind of rats on you know market rents\nWithout being subsidized and dog businesses okay is not there we have to make we have to make that shift\nTo allow more people and again it's economic development more people to have a higher income and I think that higher income base in the community would raise all ships\nYeah I tend to agree with you there and you know just getting back to a how where we stand with the subsidized housing we know we have the highest concentration in the state based on our population\nYou know one thing there were many statistics in this story in the wall Street Journal today but one statistic that I did not see was the test results I I I Wonder if they've conducted I Would I Would assume they have\nThey must have a an idea of whether the testing score is a better as a result of going to a four day work week that would speak for itself right there you know if they're maintaining the scores are the scores are going up with a four day school week\nI like to look at the chest that they are in England and dumbed down at a sin and create a a chest restart chess ... based on uh the the way they want to resolve to come out\nSo you're not sold on this at all [laughter] you know if anything\nSo you're not sold on this at all [laughter]\nYou know if anything Larry we should have more school time more because we're falling further and further behind and the the only thing that keeps us the number one country in a while Larry\nIs a technological advances yes that tracked illogical edge over the rest of the world and the rest of the oil is catching up on us very rapidly especially China\nAnd India oh yeah uh uh uh catching up on us what our track um many of the computer companies now I almost exclusively in ... um because they're very well educated and they're willing to come here and watch for half an hour commute to work\nYeah they have they have the necessary skills\nYeah and and one not pushing the kids in this country to acquire the skills that they need for the future\nWhich is math and science not humanities not you know and the other thing that really are actually as all these stupid majors at college like fine arts and dance and music and you know that's wonderful button you leave out of college or the Ninety thousand dollar bill\nAnd you can't get a job with a fine arts degree ...\nYou know colleges should offer majors based on what there is a need for in in in the economy\nYou know not not lure kids into believing that they're going to get a bachelor's degree and get a really good job with a degree in psychology mhm or sociology of political science and all that there are no jobs to those sales\nWell that's a good point uh [laughter] uh yeah and it's true I I Know too many people myself or who have degrees in those areas and finding a good paying job is not all that easy\nAnd but and then we've talked about this is ... uh the skills that are ... you know the the the jobs that are out there right now so many of them you don't even need a college or a ... and what you need a special and bill that are available and some of the technical schools\nYes and that's the other thing that we're doing a terrible job in this country for years and years and years they've been brainwashing kids into believing you go to go to college if you're going to get a job you have to go to college you have to have that college degree so all these kids go to college\nAnd I'm willing to bet you if you brought in kids in a room that was seen as an ice go and say what do you want to do when you when you grow up\nThey wouldn't be able to tell you but I'm going to college here [laughter] so what do you go into college costs you don't know where you are you going to do a B mhm mhm uh you know and that's the problem in like you said Laurie we have structurally source skilled trades in this country\nThat we don't have any young America instead of going into those skilled trades\nTo a major problem major problem\nYou up and and we should be investing much more money and they're still trade a training ... ... in education it might affect the President Trump or a signed a bill a Jew or what are all in\nThat area yes he did so why are we trying to get some of that money in ...\nI'm Sorry about that why are we trying to get that money Larry to expand a technical school here one socket\nWill you know that ... that leads me to that question that somebody sent in a you know we had some discussion a few months ago about a post high school education center in the city\nOr they weren't all that many details or it was sort of vague but I've heard no more about it that's why you know this question of whether I read anything about it I have not I don't know if you have but I'm curious where we're headed yeah\nYou know and you know there's so much need for a skill carpenters electricians plumbers five senators machinist\nBut you know what so many of the young kids have been led to believe that go to college that's where you ... you know tell that the bill gates and never graduated from college yeah you're right and there's so many other rich people knew that I've never gone to college and I've made billions of dollars\nAnd that's correct and there aren't there are many there are many well let's see if anyone else agrees with what we're talking about this afternoon\nAll right Larry you have a wonderful day and let's keep working on making one socket great again\nSounds good All right but I Know you like do you like that I Love it I've heard it somewhere before but I Love it [laughter] okay Larry I'm actually I'm by no seven six\nSix Thirteen eighty that's our number seven six six Thirteen eighty as we talk with you\nOn this a Wednesday afternoon\nProvidence a business news or the latest edition talks about manufacturing\nThings that we build in Rhode Island\nAnd it was it's an interesting um edition and I was looking through there to see a if there's anything in a way of manufacturing you know of that here in the one socket area and this so uh well we didn't hit the ... that publication so I guess if I'm sure we have some\nManufacturing but it's probably on a small scale so it didn't make this list a but even the state is a whole\nBoy when you think of what we used to be you know uh as far as the state is concerned I mean this was a major manufacturing center state of Rhode Island and when socket included\nAnd now this so you know it's so limited as to what manufacturing takes place in this area you might have a comment email comes in\nAbout the post high school location this person says I think the seven hills building that is being refurbished for a school would be a perfect location for the training center and it would fit the zoning for that area\nThis person's talking about the blockbuster building there at social corner that's being torn apart to make way for a mayoral charter school that are supposedly as being a challenge in the courts as far as the ... I don't know where all that is that these days\nBut um\nI tend to agree with this email that wouldn't be a great location for a training center some thought you know skills training center type of school maybe you have a comment seven six six Thirteen eighty as we talk with you on a\nWednesday don't you be bashful we'd love to talk with you\nMove your ... currently seeking a seat on the one suck at school committee any upcoming November sixth election pleased joined Lynn her fundraising open on Thursday October eleventh\nAt the St ... his whole Ninety nine Louis street from six to nine PM homemade dynamite and meatball sandwich is will be served a cash bar will be available for beverages a donation of ten dollars per person is suggested all children's age twelve with under may eat free of charge\nMusic and games provided by DJ buddy ... us support of lens Canada see is welcomed paid for friends over ... ... ...
