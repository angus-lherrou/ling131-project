in\nPolitical race and she's Indian two questions I Want to ask and Terry's talkers\nHere on think America Elizabeth Warren releasing her DNA results and apparently she has quote Native American\nIndian from her great great great grandmother who's records show that she was white only because it was the same for choice she describes herself as a ... as white\nRather than record yourself as Native American since Indians at the time we're being attacked here's a question Jennifer you I'll start with you a Native American\nAmerican indian but the DNA was contrast it against Mexican native how does that old square I'm so confused\nThat does that square with me and I can tell you I'm more Native American that she is um my great great grandmother was a Cherokee Indian and I've got the evidence to show that are listed in the sense is but\nI think this is ridiculous I think she's trying to to prove something that may not be provable and earlier this week I understand that the Cherokee Nation\nProve something that may not be provable and earlier this week I understand that the Cherokee Nation has said\nThere's no evidence that she can't affiliate with a tribe or that she can claim that she's Native American particularly if the DNA does not show\n... which is a tribe affiliation exit and curious to see if she actually check the Native American box on any of her a\nRecord store employment to see if she got a special hair and least so Chris because that helped her be part of the diversified faculty at Harvard that's why she got into this and the first place\nYeah I I just I forgot where it matters I mean I I'm I'm more interested in what our thoughts are water policy\nUm thoughts are a conceptually where she stands on a lot of different political issues as it relates to society at large I could care less I mean if she if it makes her feel more prouder of you know to have an understanding of what our heritage and that's that's all well and good I forgot where that matter\nTo anybody other than her and her family [noise] um so I don't\nI don't get where where this was even newsworthy to be honest with you because it it has nothing to do what she going to move the needle on the boat because she has some Native American heritage last time I checked if you know if you're here you're American the American represent Americans and and go fight the good fight you know on global\nHere to your point aren't we all mud\nAbsolutely I I I could not tell you where my great great great grandmother was from because a a you know I'm I don't go to the ancestry dot coms of the world and all this kind of stuff and try to try to figure it out but be\nReally genuinely has nothing to do with me I was brought up in this country a I'm a proud American always will be in where I came from is nothing to do with my ability to be a pride full American and do what I Need to do to be a great contributing member of society\nBuddy in the world of politics Jennifer it does matter and politics and news are in bed together so she and she knows this she purposely\nPut this out there right before the midterms chances are after the midterm she will announce she thinks this is helpful it creates an attack against President Trump to pony up his million dollars because ah he challenged her to a DNA test the problem is I think it's got a boomerang on her because\nRight now there's ten generations back she's one\nOne thousand twenty four percent Native American and more to the point it's Mexican native so I don't get it\nPolitics are are ah are omnipresent in America\nAnd this age of identity politics I think it makes a difference in two ways first of all it would illustrate if she game the system in other words if she's\nBarely Native American but she checked a box for employment that tells us that she game the system\nThe other thing it tells us is that maybe she wants to become the first Native American female president of the United states I mean that's really where we're going it's all about identity politics and and her history of gaming the system did she in fact check those boxes to get employment and I would\nSuggest that she did well I think she did I I think your suggestion a will prove to be a true it it will show that she did this to a game to game the system however\nThis is sort of a badge of honor right now for her it's look at me look at me look at me I'm right I'm truthful and President Trump is not Jennifer I mean it ... the political\nOver ... that's over all of this is very strange to me\nIt is a very odd and I think it to your point she was trying to prove President Trump wrong but she hasn't really proven anything how she I mean it just shows that she has a Mexican Indian blood in her um and this is why the the Cherokee Nation earlier this week has been so vocal\nAbout it I'm finally Chris to your point you you say well it doesn't even matter in politics everything matters and certainly now before the midterms\n[noise] maybe I mean it it again I'm I'm trying to figure out which bass she's trying to rally that she doesn't already identified with on trying to figure out how this makes her\nPolitical agenda more clear or or more fruitful for her as she may fight the good fight and try to go be the first uh Jennifer that you know female ended Native American president the United states\nBut again I mean there there's a huge disconnect I think there's an artist and disconnect between who you are and what you believe 'em and I and it shouldn't have anything to do with heritage I mean again it was an American fight the good fight we're not if you're running for that office\nEyes you know and your number one priority your very first thing you should be thinking of is the fact that you're American yeah\nAnd you must be agree with Trump when he says who cares if that's all we have time for that statement straight ahead you were a Halloween costume ... am\nIn the office I'm Jerry be right back\nUm somebody ... it was clear that Michael Vick was released from prison and somebody a dress up as Michael Vick with like a a dog on a leash just like a stuffed animal dog but it was and who painted their a black\nAnd he wasn't painting of a black\nTo pretend to be a any black\nPerson and he was a black to be Michael Vick but that didn't matter you knew there was an explosion on campus there with actually even a demonstration where a large group of African American students that\nIn our largest cafeteria and painting their faces white and\nYou know there will always be people that want to\n... per protests and people who will get offended at the slightest thing and what have you but I think the the professional and responsible thing to do in this case is ask yourself like could that be offensive to somebody even though maybe I don't intend it that way and even if maybe that person is being overly sensitive\nBut well you raise a good point on that but it's hard to jumping side somebody else's had I just wonder I'm a to your point about adding a little liberty you know humor is a funny thing sometimes it works and sometimes that doesn't\nUm we're down to about two minutes Tracy so let me go in this direction and get give us your thoughts on that using the whole me too movement\nWith this girl wearing this about sexual behavior in the office has just put a couple Bosch on fun particularly Halloween fun\nWow that's a great question um\nI think it's certainly heightened awareness of people are just in a workplace in general and in professional settings what is the appropriate and rightfully so right and live good conversation to be having\nAt it important for women to be having a comment on it as well and but I I Do think you're right I think that it can get to a point where we are\nSo serious that we we forget about the levee and we forget to have fun I think the biggest concern here and that\nThen you know Halloween marks the beginning of sort of the holiday season or companies right do you have something like a\nThanksgiving party and they had a Christmas card area that New Year's party doesn't really the first opportunity to have something like that and to have that led the workplace I'm given what's going on this year I mean if you're a woman you address in something you know scantily clad\nFor Halloween it's like what are you asking for\nA while and it sounds to me like I'm going to a child is a thing to do [noise] I had a time Tracy Tam double A. M. P. I. M. M. is a business a coach and the creator of the ... degree online you can find her they're racing Tam\nDon't care who you're White House call any heating and air conditioning of any but if you want to

the cable guy offered this [noise]\n... of the American dream there's always been that the next generation would do better than the one before it education was the essential key because the ship you know when you're Jackson president or staying staying true to America's national ... my father had a six grade education I graduated from Harvard law school by\nDid drilled into me study hard and get a good education\nThe public schools are tentative working class just to Pennsylvania prepared me for college unfortunately the latter I applied to relish ripped out for many children were tend not accredited schools in dangerous neighborhoods where academic achievement is often ridiculed it's above the poor education school choice\nLiberate parents to make independent choices for their children instead of ... students hostage to failing schools introduce competition for scarce educational dollars competition and waste improves quality it's time to restore the dream of a better life for the next generation by giving parents the ability to choose quality education for their children\nAnd knows it's hard to find qualified candidates when you're hiring it's like finding a unicorn born

higher\nIndeed the world's number one job site source comp Gore told us that\nI think America and good discussion on Halloween I say go to a jar Tracy Jim interview what'd you think Jennifer I thought it was very helpful for people that work in the\nPrivate sector here at the university I we've been given given guidance that they should be very cautious maybe the students and faculty and deciding what they dress up for Halloween because of the political correctness Chris and wealth management how to use it\nJerry I Love your jokes deposed appropriateness um use or do you get out of a very nice figured woman wearing a Wonder Woman caught a costume and then you're going to have a a woman who may not be quite squeeze into that same same costume and in both cases it could be appropriate and I love that the response was use common sense\nMove on guys Americans are generally open and positive about seeking help from counselors and therapists and in fact forty two percent of adults have seen account for some time in their life\nWhile thirty six percent are in fact open to it and that by the way is born a group research uh you can look them up online barn a group research uh\nWith that Christ it's not really a stretch I think for parents to be open to taking their kids to mental health professionals if they see them struggling with certain issues\nAnd then you add to that horrific shootings in America that brought\nParents together to acknowledge the need for mental health care for young people um but with that then as come there at some schools\nThe child's mental health history becomes part of the school records I worry about this because the fact that a kid could see a therapist either outside the school setting or within the school setting now is our record that this kid has a mental health issue\nThat's problematic to me you\nIt's yeah it's a privacy issue I mean we we can't be infringing upon ...\nWell it's yeah it's a privacy issue I mean we we can't be infringing upon people's privacy rights although I Will say this\nIf we're not keeping good records of what is\nHappening with the child's behavior\nMaybe which is a result of some mental health issue if there is not good documentation with respect to the behavior we're not doing everything that we can't prevent catastrophic event from happening so while I'm not a huge fan of just having an electronic medical record system that when you blow up a client or a client record\nA child's record 'em\nTo view that child history having a fleet of it the their mental health industry I think we can hedge this a little bit if we have really good notes and really get documentation about the behavior which could open a conversation in the future and then maybe you do have to die to sell you know situation and that's all\nI also like the title psychology\nThan mental health uh Jennifer because mental health always sounds like a pejorative\nIt does and and I have a couple of concerns about this person is privacy and then what are we talking about with respect to a child let's say that we're talking about elementary or high school\nAnd the child Sikhs care for depression because their parents got a divorce or something else occurred I mean can you imagine if Brett Kavanaugh would have had mental health and his high school record\nThey would have used that against him so I think there is a privacy concerns but on the other hand as a college instructor I've seen ... individuals in my classroom that clearly have some type of\nMental health issue and that would have been helpful to know in advance of teaching a course to have a better understanding of the students and their behavior within the classroom\nSo do you think yet Jennifer do you think it's more of a positive or more of a negative if some mental health history and again I liked the psychological history I like the word cycle has it it's much more broad and and it's not my\nUnderstanding of Jerry ...\nUh the way mental health is majority are can be in today's parlance or do you think it is a help or hurt\nOr can be when you put it in the history that they have been to an outside psychologist or outside I'd try your trip as opposed to a therapist within the school confines I think\nIt's more of a negative all the way around because there are varying degrees of psychology and mental health issues so to have that in the record without any contracts or understanding just a disservice to the state uh Chris your final thought\n\nYour way Haley was Chris bar so\nThere are bipartisan calls for more

would you like to enlighten us on Mr Dave dean\nBoth as a public airing tonight the developer of the proposed hope point tower in Providence his name's Jason feign\nWill present new rendering of what would become the tallest building in Rhode Island now this has been\nQuite a hot topic in Rhode Island for several reasons number one initially he wanted to do a commercial slash residential three story tower in Providence one being the highest and then to smaller towers and initially the Providence a city cops said no way for that\nWe're not zoning that so he then drove up at six hundred foot building\nAnd that's drawn criticism from residence\nIn an op ed piece in the Providence Journal faint says the new ... will address concerns mentioned in the previous meeting I think what he's not understanding is no matter what he does this group of people as hell bent on him not building this particular tower in Providence because they don't want it and then stopping their feet right now\nIn the meantime the Senate president Dominic Ruggieri oh recognizing this as an economic development opportunity says he cannot believe that\nThe city of Providence is giving this guy such a hard time it should be noted that union construction or\nWill be hired to build these yeah buildings in Dominic Ruggieri oh his background is as a union had yeah yeah I mean there's a lot of angles to this whole Korea was as a union agent you know ...\nThat would be forty six stories high which is six hundred feet tall the city of Providence however the zoning ordinance only allowed building heights of one hundred and thirty feet in that area so he needs\nA zoning change and that means the city council would have to approve the zoning change in order for the three hundred million dollar project to proceed lotta angles to this story I think inevitably or\nThey are held by not letting it happen and I think the Senate president as hell bent on making it happen or\nWhat is it now speaking of predictions what's your prediction what this\nI think of the state is going to prevail on this uh I think the argument is gonna be the state gives Providence so much money to sustain itself that uh you ought to give us some a building\nConstruction project but it's going to help but Rhode Island get a work is on the job to help pay the bills that we pay for Providence\nYou want to hear what the objection is I mean this is one of the softest weakest objections I've ever heard for a potential forty eight million dollars a year revenue source\nOpponents of the project are expected to attend

it's not even controversial in the sense it's just like oh I don't like the view that it's going to create\nAll freaking well I mean it's I think you're right I think the state will inevitably force Providence into this but it blows my mind\nThat a handful of Providence residents can hold up a three hundred it would've been even bigger project had they let the initial rendering they'll remember

eventually communicate to us what was offered lie they chose to go with what was offered as their best choice and\nAnd deal with responding to that as we see it once we get it\nBut for the moment we know nothing about it except that\nThey've had that discussion and has to do a solar panel on all the panels are wins turbans or whatever other options are available in terms of a passive energy development program to generate savings electrical savings for the city\nSo like Mr of brie and Mr gender in I get here I'm a will question them on that because just like you said\nUm I don't know much about it you don't know much about it so lovable at the council pursue it but I think you're answering my question that um it's true when you're a councilmember you have the information that's available to you that the regular citizen\nDoesn't ... and it's a question of whether or not a council member when it's appropriate um makes every effort or even the administration makes every effort to communicate important information to the public so they're aware of what's going on\nWe have a budget that's in place um and the uh city or the city treasurer is um and I guess the tax collector and all those in the front end the finance director all those in the finance the department of\nMonitoring that budget is this budget um what we would call a sound budget and and um where did the money come\nFrom anyway [laughter] well we have no money come from I I\nMade a point early out early on after the budget was approved ends and frankly I Want to give credit for the council members who attempted to modify it by reducing spending by about seven hundred thousand dollars and\nArranging things differently than the administration did um however they lost that battle because of the the man's override and so we're left with the mayor's original budget and ah what I noted back when it was past is that it relies on free\nSignificant dollar amounts that are not going to be available to us next year and\nWhen you spend money that's all it only available to one time for operating expenses it's basically what you call a a structural deficit and that amounts to almost three million dollars that of revenue that's in this year's budget and we're not even talking about spending that we just you know if you assume we're spending on when we have to spend\nWe're not even talking about spending now which is you know if you assume we're spending ... we have to spend you need rather than to pay for it and if there's three million dollars of revenue you're not going to have next year than even if you don't spend a dime more next year\nYou either have to find three million dollars more somewhere or raised taxes by three million dollars or cut spending on things that you thought were important this year [noise]\nUh and that three million dollars is made up of free significant items one of which is the fact that prime or landmark medical center has become tax exempt and will we will not get the full tax amount of the one point six or seven million dollars but we'll be getting\nA state payment the lowest taxes and the last time that happened I think the number was somewhere in the vicinity of three hundred and some thousand dollars so you're talking about a loss of about one point three million dollars at one point four million dollars and then the\nThe firefighters had agreed and their contract to set aside some\nMoney for their retirement and health care and ended accumulated and the mayor grab that money as a revenue source which isn't going to be there again next year and so that was\nDon't know five or six hundred thousand dollars and then\nThere was a revenue item ... actual collection of revenue this year for nine utilization tax of one point two million dollars that\nShould be have been reported in the two ... fiscal year two thousand Eighteen as revenue and would have to be which goes to surplus but then they immediately spent that initiated budget\nWell that one point two million dollars isn't going to be available when you add those free things up that's three million dollar roughly three million dollars of revenue that we don't have and the two thousand twenty budget and we will need to find a way to fill that gap\nThrough a cut in spending which\nYou know if if ... and then I'll just add flavor to this put the er the harsh spice then that's going to make your mouth taste better\nOn top of that we have an on ... and in complete teacher contract negotiation\nAnd I believe the number that's been thrown around is about five hundred thousand dollars of cost for every one percent or five to six hundred thousand [noise] so I Would guess that that contract when it's all said and done will cost between after mediation\nIs going to cost between a million and a half and two million dollars more so we're now faced with probably four and a half to five million dollars of lost revenue and more expense that we're going to have to find them during the budget\nIn two thousand twenty and so to me that's what made this budget a bad budget because it utilize that one time money and made us put us in a position where next year is going to be extremely challenging\nNow I realize you here to um to promote the candidate sea of ah John John Ward\nYeah and it's like oh God but um\nAs you talk about this budget I'm saying well ah you're elected to the council but um but there's going to be a mayor\nIn place yet is either going to be the current mayor there's going to be a new mayor in ... that I'm Wondering whether in fact the whether it makes any difference who's mayor or not it's it's the council budget right it does make a difference it\nIt makes a difference because the mayor proposes a budget and the space the structure of what comes to us is based upon what the mayor sees as the priorities for each department and for capital spending and for and the estimates that come in for what the revenue is going to be [noise] um so it it\n... I Would think the difference between a a mayor ball deli hunter a mayor brand would be\nDifferent between the two they're not going to be the same perspective the outlook is on what's important is probably different but it becomes to counsel job to sort through it all and establish its own priorities and make its own proposals as to what they think is appropriate and and put it back to the mayor to either veto or not veto um\n[noise] so it's it's a it's a combination of all of that I think things most troubling to me though on top of that is this a ... state requirement in the law that has Mr ... our financial advisor that's under the state\nControl which keeps us on the state control who has the authority to reject budgets or approved budgets are you must approve of I just and so whenever we do has to pass muster with him\nAnd frankly I was extremely disappointed and expressed as much to the state officials about how weak I thought Mr Lugar's response was to what I think are\nCompletely flawed budgeting techniques which is as I pointed out it's just three million dollar one time money he of all people should know that that was irresponsible way to build a budget and he did nothing about it except allow it to happen\nAnd I don't think that was appropriate and I let state officials know what I thought about that [noise]\nUm nothing to do with our interview but he just seems to be disinterested he just seems to you don't do the job\nBut doesn't seem to be um interest I describe it as passive severe she's\nAllowing things to happen rather than trying to manage things\nIf you're just joining us John Ward is in our studio and we're going to talk to him and spend the next half hour about or his candidacy so on our list of topics to talk about a new simply list street lights fire street lights are on your mind today\nStreet lights are on on mine for a couple of reasons in two thousand thirteenth street lights were on my mind because I thought at that time and I still think today that it's if there's a lot of money to be saved for the city and um and it's not about turning off the street lights it's about replacing our current street lights with al Libi fixtures which\nWould generate probably sixty percent savings and across the street lights and\nAs some have recently pointed out in two thousand Thirteen when the streetlights was so expensive the cost\nFor the year was the budget here two thousand Thirteen was about three hundred and a little over three hundred thousand dollars in this year's budget that number is over six hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nAnd that's a fairly large increase in the cost of electricity related to street lights\nUm and it was coming back then to replace them with ladies and I happened to be in the process of the finance director of the tunnel Lincoln we are together with six other communities going to bed I'm for the replacement of street lights\nNow you have to spend money in order to do that by buying out the old national grid fixtures and buying a new fixtures\nBut it doesn't necessarily incur new debt because what you used to pay for it is your electricity savings over five or six years and then once you five or six years is up you ended up with all of the savings coming into the cities budget so\nUm I I can appreciate and I don't want to bumped into the mayor's claim of not wanting to put new debt on the ... as a burden to taxpayers but\nIf you're simply replacing spending on electricity was spending on electricity and buying new fixtures so that eventually can save sixty percent on the city's electric bill I think it's a worthwhile investment that should have been done four or five years ago so it's still on my topic\nThat they've put in place have had it I I don't know I Can't say that it had nothing to do with city administration but it's certainly something that they had on their radar for several years so\nI don't know that it's something to be bragging about other than be thankful that they chose to do it at the Wal Mart they're doing it at um yeah that that to me economic development and something that's been disturbing the last five years has been the fact that we have had retirees managing our planning department into my mind\nYou know one of the ... when you look at the city charter that is not the department of planning\nThat is the department of planning and development and go [laughter] I'm\nIn theory if we had a an experienced professional not retired and that's not to take away from Joel or are they bully\nThey knew what they were doing certainly but it it's some thing that needs a full time employee as a department director running it\nAnd the job I see that the city can best achieve economic development through is making sure our zoning isn't isn't obstructionists making sure our inspectors are obstructionist\nAnd letting a planning director do the planning with the people are looking to come into the city by streamlining the process and making it easier for them and not turn it into a PR move for a job that\nIs basically making phone calls you know people come if you have a good good operation going on we need to show it as an opportunity we need to market it but I think a fulltime planning department can do that in the fulltime planning director [noise] um and I'll give you an example of what I think and one of the problems I see in the city we just had the um [noise]\nElderly daycare center proposal that came for a lady a victory school in\nAnd it was it was in is the only thing that would have simply require to selling board to grant a variance to allow them to do it and yet in collaboration with the planning director of the acting planning director they retire planning director acting as the planning director [noise] um he penned a letter saying that this is a bad idea and it's bad for the neighborhood\nNobody in the neighborhoods said that and yet the zoning board blocked it and they're going to court now have to fight over that that is not a good planning strategy for a city that's trying to um\nMake itself known as a place that his business friendly and looking for opportunities to um to expand this business footprint in commercial and both in commercial and industrial footprint because that's the way you save homeowners taxes is by using up all the available space to\nTo achieve um tax revenues from businesses so the residents who live in their homes can pay less\nKind of close up I'm going to name a five the department's I'm a legal department in one socket government planning department was ... ... public shape deep which is police and fire public works and finance\nJohn Ward a what would you say all of a ball those departments mentioned that\nHe needs attention in the city will socket right now the law department\nIs bloated it is it is a is a place for a politically affiliated people take the job as a solicitor and make a lot of money unnecessarily and there's nothing wrong necessarily was spending a hundred and twenty thousand dollars on what the solicitor does but\nIt should be in a more accountable way by having a minimal salary for somebody who was doing the job the basic job a solicitor by attending meetings and dealing with standard day to day legal issues of for much less money and then charging us on hourly rate for those special circumstance cases\nAnd then that solicitor would then be the person to make decisions about who to hire specialty cases like utilities like tax\nTax evaluation challenges and and a liability issues which we do all the way through the trust anyway and yes that that needs to be streamlined and and and\nDown to reality not necessarily to where it was because of everything was stand

I think there's some council members that have some strong opinions about how they dealt with that issue and so it may be difficult for people who are on the board looking to get re appointed to get re appointed\nUm in terms of the CD BJ advisory board apparently the the current administration has decided that they are going to take full control over that\nManage it and leave the council out of

believe it or not they played out in two years ago but the Dodgers don't know much about Fenway Park is you can imagine mad\nAnd I think the red Sox their favor because they have the first two games at home or we do know they're starting to for the red Sox is gonna be they've announced Chris failed and he's kind of a mystery he was in the hospital briefly after game one of the American league championship series\nNo reason given Dodgers diving and now we're starting pitcher yet\nBut uh the Dodgers do have one big advantage I think a an addition to playing at home or they ... a big

familiar he's never pitched there he's expected to start um posted by ... dot com this workout he looked pretty good\nBut ah outside of ... where else do they turn to\nThe good question also shot you know his overall pitching numbers are down as far as what role after the end that great fastball over last year so he's tailing off a little bit\nI've got to be a lot of mixing and matching and then another big factor in a World Series like this is that any games three four and five at Dodger Stadium\nThe red Sox pitchers have to hit they don't like that they don't do that and the American league so that's an advantage for the ... when they get home but it's a good thing I think we're going to see a lot of this book ending where people are gonna be coming in and out and a lot of they wanna really dodge pitchers that mean to hip I Know the red Sox do\nThat we could the so early changes in the pits the rotation that get them out\nYeah ah rams are undefeated or they looked or they didn't look that great against the forty niners actually\nOr the definition of a good team that Iran there's nobody to plead that well if you look at their box scoring golf with average to TD pass two hundred yards passing girlie only six yards rushing and still they beat the forty niners thirty nine to kind of doesn't say much about the forty niners but that's how good the rams are they're just winning easy even when no one's playing that well\nYeah and that's a division game on the road their third road game a ... in a row that says a lot\nOh big time yeah and then another thing to talk about his Jacksonville Jaguars I mean ever since last year there were ten minutes away from a Super Bowls and that loss of the patriots and then they started this season three in one met with a blow out of the patriots this season\nAnd all of a sudden the wheels came off and now they've lost their last three games by a ... a combined score of Ninety to twenty eight in the first half that they're losing fifty seven to nothing in these last three losses in the first half\nAnd there's a lot of reasons why you know let her for that they're great running backs always hurt he can't play the office

only twenty two touchdown passes in his first eight NFL starts dating back to one game last year and then seven this year I'm a homes is really um you got to go to Andy Reid he's a quarterback whisper\n... quarterback it away Alex Smith went to the Redskins and now he's got to get it even better in just a second year in the NFL bedroom homes a superstar\nYeah he sure is um let's talk a well let's talk college football was before we get into the fight in the NBA guys I feel like I'm a kid again you've got Notre Dame at three LSU hats for Michigan at five I mean this feels all too familiar to me\nYeah everybody nobody wants to finish fourth a playoff to go into the play by play Alabama in the first game Alabama's a strong number one and then climbs in a number two but a lot more is going to happen is there a huge games coming up\nOne of them being on November third one Alabama plays at LSU allies you're good enough to beat anybody they've proven that\nAlabama will be favored even on the road though and then the huge game on November twenty fourth at Ohio State when Michigan goes in to try to beat the buck guys and the buckeyes who knows where they're at after getting buried on Saturday Night at Purdue\nSo yeah there's a lot of mystery is out there still yeah\nSuspensions or being handed down in the NBA the league of course looking closely at that footage of what appear to be re John Rondo spinning in the face of Chris Paul\nWhether or not that was on purpose we don't know uh but uh the the fight broke out there that I I don't know about you I I like this especially in the beginning of the season it sets a tone or not so much the spinning in the face obviously I don't condone that but I I liked it I I like the edge you know I like being testy out there especially between these two teams\nEspecially in today's NBA we're all the stores are friends with each other you don't see Larry Bird and Dr ... tried to fight and kill each other like it used to but this was the first is throwing fight in the NBA since two thousand and five when Carmelo Anthony got a Fifteen games bench and\nFor the league's been pretty clean since then so that's why this flight ... getting a lot of attention but the Lakers third year forward Brandon ... who's usually known for his mellow style of play surprised everyone was his aggressive nature last night I mean he really instigated a fight with James Harden\nBut I I I was a thing I found interesting was that LeBron James you know when he's with his new young leader team is\nHe in a chance to show them that he has their back you know maybe jumping yeah we'll run never fight ever Michael Jordan fought a wide Kareem all these guys for Larry Bird O'Brien does not do it in ... in Latin and Saturday nights fight only did was go to Chris Paul over on the side he did nothing\nSo I I think what brought you out of his team down you know and don't forget this long so that will start now for three games as Ron does out for three games with the suspension could be good for Alonzo ball\nYeah I agree there yet most of the banana vote on the floor there when that fight broke out as a ... a mellow you mentioned mellow spy a game when I was wondering why he did not get more involved but you'd uh just uh with that\nWith that memory there the memory jog a yeah yeah that's probably why he didn't get more involved in it too but yeah they were for the most part or consoling each other I guess that's okay but uh\nYou're you're right there there is a time to set a tone and then to back your team up and yeah that that didn't happen with LeBron and Ron do so I Do like Ron do though I liked I liked that nobody likes them or you need a guy like that on your team guys well how'd you get on Wednesday

made a valid score or what the Dodgers so they're very close to you know you got the Machado a president\nOver their public enemy number one here in Boston when he was with the Orioles a and and he hasn't done anything to change that\nBeing a tears of the same type of dirty plays we saw him here he he doesn't ... isn't my cup of tea yeah the basic or whatever I Love that uh uh yeah just a curse Shaw sales to the grades up is that every other ballpark except Fenway I mean you can go on and on the computer while\nIt is in um a lot of young a talent on that a Dodgers team obviously I'm that line up we saw them last year in the world series of great world series in for a minute there I thought Milwaukee was going to\nSneak in the back door and I was surprised on they were able to get it to a game seven and then you know watching that game unfolded in having your help we come up and had not been home run that kind of you know was the\nWas the final nail in the ... often but um\nYeah it's it's looking at this now you know we've had a lot of people to asking questions and I didn't think this was viable at all to even think about uh last week but you know as time has gone on and I wanted to ask you\nYou know obviously the big one of the big questions is when they do when they do go to the national league games for three four and five how does the line up look how do they get a GED Martinez in how to use the G BJ you can't take Micki out the Andrew may you know how do you what do you do in this movie back to second base thing is this at all on the\nOn on any surface the possibility do you think for our corridor to trying to say we know we had experienced there in the minor leagues [noise]\nYeah you know it's funny I was on major league baseball network or the day after the else yes that was friday and then I had just been throw it out there almost as a joke yeah and I said I Can't\nSee them doing that and exposing them injured but that we see put joy out there with him yesterday working on turning the double play down if some of that at the core it couldn't be I don't think you'll see that play three games there and I'm not even sure if you'll see him start there [noise]\nUm I think some things factor in the match ups which we don't really know yet the games reinforced starters are for the Dodgers [noise]\nUh and then I think where they are in this series you know get down to nothing going in LA you might have to make a desperation move okay and then maybe you do it or if you're up to nothing I'm not doing it you know if you're up to doubt thing [noise]\nI I think I take my chances and and you said that anyone games the Bradley one game a and maybe when you bring those guys ended the pinch hitter maybe that's what that's comes into second base gotcha okay so you've got you know you've got a\nYou've got a a Martinez let's say playing less feel okay and then you know you've got the bats in center so let's say that I'm thinking that that like let's say that get Martinez in right bill patents that are in bed and petty and left the central\nAre your kids learn second base later in the game you got a chance where they Bradley is a good match up for the cats or something you bring him in their head up a sweat she'll leave him in the outfield move back then the second base able to keep Martinez in there I think it can do that in a tie game where you don't want to pull that out of the line up\nYou know what I'm saying so I think I think the score is really good at the intricacies of the game we've seen this time and again he does a lot of little things makes will lose that seem to pay off so I this is going to be intriguing to watch how he handles all this other national it\nThat is on the caliber of any one of these starting pitchers that isn't the double digit million dollars that does this for a living with risk taking a chance eating anything questionable on their own\nAnd one of the biggest leaks in LA like I find it hard to believe that he got food poisoning but that he's the only one on the team that got a stomach virus if we've ever ... if you've ever worked\nIn an office work I mean I've worked in kitchens at the first sign of somebody getting sick you want to monitor you don't want him to get everybody else sick by being contagious and\nI had I had questions about the whole thing of tire Leah I'm wrong and this was this really is something but when asked for the first time about it with the media on Saturday he told reporters that the cause of the infection was from a belly button rang that he had\nAnd he was joking but he was saying it in front of some stone faced reporters um that that didn't know that he was joking and they they took him in a serious nobody asked him a follow up question uh\nI and and I thought I heard that this morning and I and I thought I'm going to be honest like I said I go back to it you know uh we joke about how Tom Brady doesn't eat you know sugar or white flour or or or or beef that he eats out McConnell a screaming and lagoons and and grains and and beats and all these other things\nYou know like I said there's a lot on a lot on the line these guys are paid the million is this is a huge big deal for a lot of people I just don't think he would have eaten anything that would have made him sick on his own taking a chance you know like we're going to stop any or a risky place late at night on the side of the road and eat something out of it\nStop at a uh a risky place late at night on the side of the road and eat something out of the vending machine and you know what I'm saying I think I just don't think that happened and I am telling you one person does not get a stomach virus it just doesn't work that way\nI Am not a doctor I work in a restaurant and I pretend that I'm a sports show talk on sports talk show host and I try my best to do it but you know it just I\nEvery time I've ever been around that in my life you get the heck out of dodge the first time somebody is nauseous saw some you find out somebody's sick or what ever got to get them out of here get them home we don't need everybody getting sick so the whole thing is is just kind of I don't\nAnd if you look at what time Karen just said and and I'm not putting him with what we're talking about but this is a guy that was on the number one spot to win the Cy Young he was the front runner\nHe went from ... the ads pitching three or four times the rest of the year at best and and we're getting these these elaborate a these extended stints on the DL and then he comes back and he throws to winnings and then he's out again and this is the same guy that last year John Donald brought back\nTo get that three hundred strike out this is the same guy that that Lincoln Tom Brady mentality doesn't want to miss a second\nThis is a guy that when you're watching TV with them he stay seated during a commercial break because he doesn't want to miss anything Christian Bale does not want to miss games missed I missed playoffs dots\nSo I think that's something I think they know that after the season they're going to take care of whatever they have to take care of and again this is just me speculating I have nothing to go on with this I have no sauce well I think that he's going to pitch wants and it's going to be tomorrow\nNight and whether it's to winnings for winning six innings nine innings that's it after tomorrow was shutting them down and thank you for everything you did grits get healthy get sick then we're going to hope we celebrate a World Series and we'll see if we help eat the spring training I don't think you're going to see a ... second time let's say\nAt one point she had um [noise] okay took the wrong time growing smaller slumped movie that's yeah\nI mean I ... and you know and this is why this is bizarro world Jackie Bradley junior\nJust pick up the slack and got the big ... and ...\nYou know that doesn't doesn't upstate doesn't solve everything for his ... struggles at some point during the playoff because he hasn't really done anything yet big but maybe he's saving it for the final courting grow but that's road to get camp out at second\nIf they win this whole thing that'll be one of the top highlights of the whole thing but I agree with you you know and that's what I've been saying on the show without Judy Martinez who

what kinds of things are different\nI mean you know you got to understand is um [noise] you know as far as you want to see him as you don't really\nWant to cheer for the office you want off the bat right you know was another thing to come in I was a\nShow on the horizon shown on off\nFor words at all to visit us [noise]\nWe are back here\nOn the job show radio program we thank you so much for joining us this morning on W. went awry Ninety nine nine ask them Thirteen eighty am\nWu when our eye dot com worldwide that was ... flowers I and I thought that was key even though that was from the past me talking a tray looking forward to the all sense yeah you are looking forward to the office yesterday and so as the rest of this patriot the fence\nAs Mitch Trybulski\nAh he had some uh some moves yesterday and that touchdown run of him running in wet cement and Adrian ... diving and missing him brought me back to the old video game football I used to play and wanting to throw the controller at the TV set\nLike the perfect storm ah we knew Chicago has been playing well since the addition of ... defense I'm kind of legitimize by that and an interesting Ron fence to say the least with ah with Mr ... developing young quarterback\nOr you know the jury's still probably out on whether or not he's going to be good tough when you compare to the lakes among homes in some other guys that are playing right now but Jordan Hall word and to recall when obviously are they went out and go down Robinson um they got him when he from Jacksonville last year and\nYou know some interesting players on that team of costs Trey Burton and we remember from Philadelphia or an interesting ... to go with that defense and uh\nI I think of an intelligent a new young coach\nThey are they look like they're going to be a team to be reckoned with in in some time to come in the future but I think it was important yesterday or that the patriots came out in scored right away on that Edelman play you know four minutes in and then we're able to overcome\nThe University of uh eight the formal on the kickoff coral Patterson and then the Sony Michel a turnover slash injury uh those are the kinds of things on the road that can have a domino effect and lead to a Los\nYeah no I think it was a day I think there was one Shay added that they showed all top is I mean yeah they got upset\nOr nothing but it wasn't long after that and Seventy seven asked a problem with the get mad at my dad's Seventy seven um da\n... return it got like ... as a huge like if they if you get half of its normal ... at the bears the as buying or some more confidence\nAnd it's never a bears get back up and he was always add any or ... or\n... and the second half and I want to pay that ... at ... at\nThat age and big players while because you know a cat and if you stop Tom Brady when you can you as you get these special games touchdowns if you're the bears I mean that's got to kill you and you know it's hard enough stopping Brady and then\nThe lose the game because you can't you know patriotic than splashing and ... genes that forced on asking and they got attacked an academic\nAnd still has to be disappointing if you're embarrassed by the barest editor page\nAbsolutely and you know I Know you were there to cover him all those years in March from and that\nKind of reminded me of I don't want to see an old school patriots win but\nAs you pointed out we know what number two wells\nWe know where he brings to the table on a on a game every game basis all along the way and all these successful patriots teams and all these different years you've had a you know strings of games where you've gotten\nThose types of plays not necessarily a block party for a touchdown I Know that hasn't happened in quite some time but\nYou know a key playing a game uh all the one way one thing or another yesterday it was a kickoff return or as you said and then the block point but\nThey just they you know during this this stretched during this running you know when they've been successful they seem to I don't know if you call it complimentary football but it's um ... just the ability to make things happen for us to turn all the get ...\nGet a saccharin special teams play even if it's not a maternal that just a a you know just to flip the field basically they've been able to do that\nHow much of a of the advantage do you think it gives the patriots or if corner all Pattison continues I Know he had another run after the touchdown he I think he had a pretty a pretty solid and another trick returned to I Believe the I think\nIt was enough I pointed this out I'm at home or order of about a forty Arkansas [noise] it was only the second half you've got to get into an advantage to seek to I think Paterson port\nA ... if he um you know there's\nQuestions earlier in the season or what has value was I was just hang up or ... and then in the sense that you know you can't really run the ... and she's a gadget fire as best skill as this kick returning but\nIf it can be moved back to the thirty it was hard to getting a chance to return to get a\nI think one of the advice as as as the weather gets older there'd be less back it'll get more chance to return catch so I think it could be more of it at the actual games as the season\nAh goes along yesterday was in the thirties in Chicago so I wasn't you know freezing but it was still cold and um you know you said the value on that picky bad again\nCold and um you know ... the value on that picky about it at a five and returned it Ninety five yards educating\nThem slowly and just reading and some of your ah somebody to work in great great route writing on the coverage from yesterday uh watching it but not realizing the pass gave the blow of James wait each three times a running for twenty six yards to first downs influencing the best to burn their time outs this is reading directly from your\nYour column and uh I thought the same thing yesterday it was a situation where the band's new attacks were going to run the ball and they couldn't stop it and um even without even show that was different too for the patriots I I Know in any as past I've I've always\nBeen frustrated when they're when there is a close game you know coming down the stretch and and they can't get just those ... they need to\nExtend to drive and get a new Senate downs in ... but this is a couple of games in a row now are you seeing I think it was last week against Kansas City Sony Michel had a key third down pick up late in that game and then again yesterday you mentioned James White just doing what James why does and\nYou know everybody's starting to notice how great the sky is we've known it for a long time\nYou have had a huge I mean look at its best get through that passed in ... and making thirty eight thirty one\nAnd uh you know the ACC fans makes it interesting that at the at that point I think that the bears had three ...\nAnd ... you know a stop them you know they're going to get the ball bat in to ski I think what I had enough time to get the times or back in a ... to ... going to get ... at a time of damage to add one day but a huge or the ... and um the ball late I\nMean can throw the ball wells right old game\nBut you know they given that this infants will make those interesting I think there will be situations like off yesterday where they're going to have to run out the car\nOr make a first down on the ground and they show they can do that so that's encouraging you know especially\nBecause you know in the last nine games are going to be on the whole letter games you know games where running game late will be a poor you have essentially they play at all when they play in Pittsburgh so [noise] that's all I have many warm weather I mean the games that Joanne so running the ball they\nI think will be important I think what else are showed yeah he's\nI think we can barely say one of the best past catching running backs and the league I don't think anyone that I've seen really does it much better but at the end of all he can do it if he has to do right I Know starting the show's most most\nOf the shows that if he asked to do it he's not a bad off\nTheir smoke break probably not going to do that for the navy yard touchdown but right and you know pick up to three yards and in critical situations or yards are just also think the fact that he's as a ... so he wears out the fences and you're given a go one two three four straight times I think that's also what makes it tough\nFor him slowly hearing you know rumors this morning on my way to do the show\nThat were leaking night the Michelle injury may not be as serious as originally into ... originally thought obviously no matter what there's going to be some time midst if it's not\nYou know a season ending situation I'm sure he's going to need some time and the fact that they just have Devlin and burner on the Ross do you think now they they turn to a guy like might Gillis leader familiar with the fence that I\nThink you're still bail on after the hatred for eastern what's New Orleans they released them so it's still available I mean they know him and they know and add to that gets about ... and if they need a body in their ... and\nIn on it or they might come back a little earlier but ah yeah and I think it's a possibility I Do yeah opens on the often says is something you thought\nOf but yet you also you might go up you know I don't know what else is out there but it can be tough to find a good running back on the street so goes the might be the best off you know you know barring Drake but yeah the guys that are on the side\nAbsolutely um yesterday going to the are\nGoing to that long touchdown run by Trybulski I always saying that I wanted to throw the controller at the TV I it was one\nOf those moments where you're just like you want to you want it to tackle them yourself watching it I just\nProbably I think the worst defensive player of the year and I'm not sure what broke down I Know Claiborne missed badly I Know flowers was in pursuit and it seemed like everybody left their assignment and just left that whole side of the field open but the ... the optic of him just walking into the end zone I think it was a fifty five yard run or something was just\nThat was tough and that would have been one we'd we'd be all hopping on today had they lost that game yesterday [noise]\nThere you know I mean I was out there for clay born he had his first act yesterday he's in the bay last week or so people that said I it\nDrew critical of having a lot and there there are these advances quarterback pressure stacked with sharks\nOr you know they are all football focus and and sometimes are subjected to the your quarterback runs into got by ... has been a disappointment but\nA couple of games he has been improving I mean what I think they're hoping that he can give them is a good situational third third down pass restaurants that gives you much against the Ron okay 'cause he's under size I think that\nIf he can get some pressure I don't I haven't seen the quarterback for stats obviously you have the sack I think you got a couple of other pressures um but yeah I don't know why that touchdown you're referring to me I think it was the first quarter yeah as you read about\nFootball ... Iowa I'm On it right now and I'm Talking to you my friend ... trips yeah he was reality in ... all\nOne word thought I S slashed patriots\nAnd on and tell you what you if you didn't see the game yesterday you wouldn't have had to because you can just read wills coverage like\nMy column I had to catch a flight and I I had to get it up pretty quickly after the game it's great it was that the fans to add one you know yeah I was at home as a writer you sound like you know you get any over and you go to is it this is a terrible that I just write you know you have one of those like auto body you know\nYeah obviously I'm you got the ... and you do great work here I'm just looking through it and letting everybody know that is listening or this is the place to go the football field patriots coverage again\nAnd I said before you know fans didn't feel free to send me question or they could call me on a tree it's made but I think I had\nA er about thirty five points during the game I hear I should have video before the game during the halftime and then after the game so corporate that into\nMy stories I Try to make it as a interact as possible\nUh Rob Gronkowski\nThey're saying now this morning he should not miss any more time with the schedule being what it is they've got the bill's on the road this Monday as you know and then I Believe it's back home for Green Bay and then on to Tennessee or do you think he's going to be playing and all three of these games barring any of the ... was not just\nBecause I Know a lot of people were surprised when they heard he didn't travel with the team and he was going to be missing to Chicago\nYeah I was surprised that I I thought he would play it on the much stock in the questionable and ... yeah they added back at the friday I think it was so ... you know and he's had back issues I think he's had back surgery is in his career is ... feet up so it's not a surprise it could have been on friday\nOr Thursday at practice\nIn on the ... I didn't feel good and that's why ankle and back so I think they saw by friday maybe Saturday he just wasn't feeling good or are they called him back the combination thought\nYou know maybe more than a you know they didn't you know the combination of all maybe they're not going to get that much and you know it's good to preserve him for later in the season give him a game up yeah I I Would expect in the play against ... [noise]\nI don't think anybody's going to play as crazy to think he's in his ... year now and he's only twenty nine and is he came out at twenty ... is suffering and he only played one year of college football at Arizona because I'm\nAlways on his face because his first area than a second here hurt his back he missed the whole season that's why he felt\nHarassed right at twice sell them so you know he's had he's going to play with increases beat up but that's just going to be the way it is 'cause he's taken a lot of hits ... I think the idea that ... is ever a hundred percent I'll be just as if\nThey're not as not as reasonable now so we saw what happened to them yesterday they get smoked by an Indianapolis team that's still trying to find their way I think it was like thirty seven to five was the final or something there uh what what happens with buffalo next week is their young a rookie cornerback back healthy for next week or are they going to continue to uh\nGo with what they've gone with the idea\nOf just a mess I mean I don't know any way to share that go in and they play Derek gap has said yesterday that\nStarted the game and two years he was out of football I think they signed them two weeks ago and then he was there a starter I mean you know Alan has some elbow issues I don't see how this on the computer in the game 'cause it seems like every time he's in the game yet about five interception right\nYou know they chose not to resign or above their stance they want to get in twenty million dollars would stop all he's not even playing in Cleveland power base Mayfield so\nIt's just a mess but I don't know ... on the inside and now\nI I just think about all those teams that are involved or wasn't Arabs hold on a threat I mean I'm Amazed at all has to win so yeah I Am going into Minnesota who was my Super Bowl fat guy NSA and winning might be the most baffling when and twenty five\nYears I think it is I think statistically ... it was one of the one of the big I think\nMinnesota was favored by Seventeen or quality I remember looking at that ... yeah they have the numbers wrong in Detroit him\nAnd um I don't know what happened with Minnesota Minnesota starting to look like the team that they are and I don't know if they just pop or white the whole play the game of their lives right just crazy to think and I also be Tennessee you know it's interesting\nA few weeks ago people thought Tennessee was the ... there were three and one of them lost three straight games so\nI said this last week I and I think our Twitter I think there are three really good teams are linked but land so obviously great right now the eight to ... famous shapes overlooking go that another you know they all went last Sunday night\nAnd then I think there are three really bad team the raiders partners in the bill but I think the rest of the team they're very interchangeable added mediocrity\nYes that's a good way to put in and somebody was saying this morning you know that they're doing they were really excited about the way the patriots won and they were going back and forth\nAnd I was saying you know it's the the I don't want to say the league has achieved parity but I think you put it perfectly Wilders three great teams there is a wet when he finds are eight teams there anytime he might have a lot\nOf whatever the chargers I said that a couple of people up and on and just want to see the chargers being more good genes also the way you know the chargers always seemed to fall apart yeah who\nMakes you not treat them as as a seriously as um [noise] and the other thing going against the chargers that are in the same division as the cheap so true that they can't over them to change you know maybe they can be a wild card you know I think that's very possible\nAbsolutely brothers is a good veteran that you know always ... wherever he already player he really is but they're like trying to stop Messi art every game you know\nSitting for this month or will they link trick or treat a because I mean they can they seem to play amazing sometimes against like great teams in and make it a game and sometimes can even win and then they play against the team some times that you think they should handle and the the Bailey when they get so I Know what you're saying it's tough to trust the challenges are just\nSeem to always play to the level of the ... you know absolutely that and they always get behind and\nEvery time I watch them there I'd never seen a team that's in like third or the more than they are and sometimes they pick it up they they put themselves in these really difficult situation almost like a golfer that's always getting out of the woods and the ... you know actually that's going to catch up to you [noise]\nSo we got to read to prepare for a buffalo and we'll wait and see on Sony Michel\nDemand is William ... is football made in a ... and you cannot patriots since last patriots and you'll get right on and there's just a lot of content he had to read and catch up on and you can also as we'll send you can tweet them\nUm and ask questions and he loves on the interaction and he keeps us up to date on what we need to know so we'll wait\nWait to see to find out about Sunni Michelle and wait to see if there's a roster moved to a deal is somebody I don't think they're going to stick with just James devil in a can John Boehner and James light as active running back on\nA running dad at ya I don't see them but they're also question you know division or somebody they got on the practice what they let a wall wept goal and they signed a running back kennel Barrow at a ball\nIt was a wall where all assign a running back Kevin arrow at all [noise] they have any of that as bad as we see ten minutes stretching so I don't know yeah he's been practicing but you know no it isn't that just seemed very a baby they update 'em to the last so\nIt's going to be fun to see a this off and continue to come together will and ah you know just hopefully for health wise and everything else a have a good week in Buffalo because you know everybody's looking at that showdown with Aaron Rodgers especially the way he's been able to have some uh\nUnbelievable moments are they going to go\nI think you'll see a dollar check you know every time they play the ... it makes it sound like eighty five bears but I think he's really going to talk about this week because he does not want the players know looking at today the Vegas\nAbsolutely we thank you so much for your time will and we love talking day we're listening and we'll talk to you soon and thanks for joining us from Chicago and now you'll be on the road again like Willie Nelson but this time the buffalo\nFor Joel always a pleasure thank you sort of take care bye no good morning or on the show [laughter] and\nI Can't it's tough on with these two new gas or the time my regular calls but thank you for holding were in the world series Chris sales talking about belly button rings and and nobody nobody asks them of Harlem question I don't believe he's I don't believe these six a Steven and I'm\nAmong the poetry run here on on a overlooking the ... river heroin diamond hill road but I'm off\nA limb I don't think he's sick at all I think this is gamesmanship that saying that he's got the stomach then who knows but I think he's going to come all ready to go tomorrow and that's going to be fun Dodgers Red Sox World Series patriots won by a yard Bruins\nHaven't won a game up in Canada they got on the left are coming up but they haven't done too well but I'm not even worried about I Can't even think about them right now I Can't even think about them that my brain is completely full the\nShow what a week that's unbelievable that's\nWhere were you uh where you were anxious a little bit at the last moments in Chicago game yesterday with are you kidding me I'm saying to myself that took place before that I'm saying to myself they can't even ... even reached the end zone and I'm going to get them to miss field where he can attempt to make the throat then they let them get there\nAnd I'm saying alright knock it down knock it down there's no way you're going to catch this and oh my goodness I thought\nYou want to come close unbelievable but there's a team now Chicago that probably shouldn't have eaten Green Bay and if they would have had their act together could've eaten us yesterday so they're a team or that I think they'll get better\nThank God for the

understand\nThe nature of the question I was ... um let's see\nOh maybe I word and correctly\nI mean gene has all kinds of money put into a campaign I lost he said I support fund why do I keep getting feeling wasn't prepared financially no big time Republicans have donated his campaign I don't know who that is for these big time Republicans is supposed to be donated to campaign said his chase them all to Florida\nSo I said all he does this contrast himself he every all uh ... does this contrast himself with Governor ...\n... what do you mean he has been going after every press conference he has is he's contrasting himself and bringing up the flaws of Gina Raimondo he's doing the best he can I mean gene has all kinds of money you put it in a campaign from outside Democrat supporters\nMeanwhile the Republican committee well let's talk about that I Know that did make some news but you have to understand um he is doing the best he can\nIt is not easy to jump in on a race like this it is true the Republican National committee at this moment are putting resources towards incumbent Republican governors if you're a Republican governor another state and you are having a tough race that takes precedence over a challenger\nGina Raimondo is the incumbent governor incompetent governors well but incumbent governor\nSo but I Want to be very clear you know someone else had posted a what's his name I don't know\nYou know John you misguided we need you know a planned or should get three million in here and uh he should get President Trump and here I I have not seen and I've been obviously no one has been more supportive of the ... campaign but I'm not convinced the ... campaign want the support\nOf um of a President Trump I I'm not convinced that in any way so this business that President Trump and I you know three million\nThree to five they should be three to five million coming in here why why do we make thirty to fifty million oh let's let's say we just got to throw around money let's make it eighty million to one hundred million I mean I I you know what are you talking about President Trump is helping those the won his help\nAh I've not heard of any effort\nIf anything I think there seems to be an over compensation sometimes where candidates feel they need to distance himself from the president but this situation with the Caribbean to me\nI Believe at eleven twenty two on this Monday it would help both Cranston mayor Allen falling and Bob planned to say we need to stop them folks where do you think they're coming here were sanctuary state\nAnd I believe and you tell me if I'm wrong it's seven six six Thirteen eighty illegal immigration\nIs a bipartisan nonpartisan issue what do I mean by that I Know Democrats that are against it not all\nI Know independent voters are against it there was a poll eighty five percent of independent voters are against illegal getting a driver's license if Gina Raimondo is is re elected with the help of drug solo by executive order she's going to give drivers license to illegal\nSo I Am saying right now at eleven twenty three and this one day I Would love to see\nSenate candidate Bob landers and may have fun support President Trump and stop all these illegals they're they're invading our border in coming in\nIt's in Beijing stop them this caravan pushing past we're coming to the United states carbon marching through Mexico this one woman nothing's going to stop me what you mean nothing's going to stop me how about some troops at the border\nWhere do these people think they are caravan Honduran migrants Guatemala gee I Wonder where they'd be coming\nI Wonder if they want to come up to the city that has the the mayor who's from\nGuatemala [laughter] how why is it all these Guatemalan illegals that are in Mexico and the caravan they all have an address in Providence Rhode Island ... what does that tell [laughter] crying out loud\nSafety for Didi Whitman go after the illegals All right let's go to your calls seven six six Thirteen eighty\nHer morning Europe first on the job in the future of show hello Hi John good morning how are you very well now we're on speaker

met a more ah Gish\nUnprofessional completely incompetent at first and then my life criminal when criminal\nClearly incompetent and corrupt person in my life criminal when\nFeminine absolute criminal is the epitome of a criminal and I'll tell you why John nothing gets out of committee and I think everyone in Rhode Island noses but it's always good for a refresher um when when when you have a bill that you want to get sued committee you can't get it through committee unless the leadership approves it\nSo we've had a ... one thousand four hundred and sixty percent increase in child deaths in D. C. Y. of kids and ...\nHe and I ah who enrich himself here only there to enrich himself he's spending for raising and spending four hundred thousand dollars for a job that pays twenty five thousand dollars no\nReasonable sensible logical person would make that kind of investment unless you had plans to make it up on the back end so am\nRight he is completely dropped the ball with D.C why out as a as governor among do she should be removed as speaker he is surrounded himself with goons he is only\nThere for one reason to make money and I don't mean right now I Need the pad favors so then when he comes out thinking for the call\nWaiting then comes out or when I take comes out finishes being speaker he has all these chips to collect and people will throw money back and if he throw someone you know something by the one let's just say something should costs twenty thousand and then he throws someone and let them charge one hundred thousand well you know\nThat's what the understanding that when the the favor can be returned he's going to see some percentage of that kick back not now\nFolks I don't know how to explain it he was shaking down the ... they didn't want to pay him he was insisting he wanted to be paid for the stadium he chased them to Worcester\nHe is a criminal sub\nI don't support the guy in any way he's got to be removed and his band to marry men are a bunch of criminal feeds and\nWires as well good afternoon or good morning you're next on the John ... show hello\nFor morning lists that John ... either ... had\nJohn they're finally made their way is that Mexico avid\nYes they have and they're headed towards\nThe United states for John a very good question and I know you can answer this okay there\nThere there are various rumors that there are three thousand four thousand five thousand six\nTo seven thousand now yes seven\nThousand now they're making their trek through Mexico correct\nOn on on on on that OK correct or not stopped\nAnd they're making their way towards the net effect for\nAll true who\nIs actually supporting this caravan shot\nOr the Democrats George Soros orange paying their way through Mexico Democrat ...\nI think a larger question is if you and I from Guatemala and we're part of this caravan we've all these different states but actually we don't have all these states 'cause there are some states that if we go into and we're ... we're going to be deported [noise]\nBut if we would go to look for a place in the United states to live [noise]\nAnd then we heard and maybe we even met this Guatemalan who's the mayor in the northeast who says come to my city I Will protect you I'll give you a ... D the police won't interfere\nI I think that's I you tell me I think that's where we're headed\nWell I'll tell you what I Am going to give states of sex\nAnd I just answer my question\nThough I don't\nKnow why can't you just answered my question I answer your questions I I'm Sorry go ahead I'm Sorry I don't listen to my question that's why I don't know not repeat that question I\nKnow how well through repeated you were listening to my question aren't I Will repeat the question and I think it's very simple question for you and I are in Guatemala where heart of these this caravan ... going to end to the United states and now we have to figure out which they were going to go to now there's\nSend people down and help them improve life in Guatemala El Salvador and Honduras but everyone can come and live in the United states I think they have no education\nAnd where do they want to come they want to come mayoral lords and Gina Raimondo and Sheldon Whitehouse I David Sicily any are telling them to come to Rhode Island and I am against it\nI agree I don't want to come in here we can't afford to take care of these ... I\nAgree that ... and and in other parts of the United states that I you know that and great need themselves so why we've taken care of others yes these are not doctors\nThe great need those house so why are we taking care of others\nYes these are not doctors these are not educators and outliers right they're coming you know they have no skills\n... money what why and how they they immediately need government service why should we take them on ... agree on a visit says so I I well you know no listen governor among do I know who you're planning on voting for for governor\nBut if Joe till I was trying to help Gina Raimondo get reelected if Raimondo gets elected one of the first thing she's going to do\nIf she's going to get driver's licenses to illegal aliens you I don't know if you're aware of that no I ...

the race for governor lively experiment I thought was interesting over the weekend thank God my sister down a Perry was on it because Maureen vocally who ... or whatever it is locally who is political science for your eyes she said something very interesting\nThat um that I Want to touch on but uh so far I that this caravan you know the today show's the lead story this morning\nAnd I think you know my opinion and you can obviously weigh in and first time caller so welcome at four O. one seven six six Thirteen eighty the today show led off with it it's a major story it's going to lead the news\nYou have this caravan of illegals that are marching their way towards the United states border and it's got to be a showdown because President Trump is saying I'm not going to let them in I Am not going to let them in now to me this is a gift should be a gift\nTo Cranston mayor Allen Fong Bob Flanders who's challenging Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and ... why do I think it's a gift\nIllegals assisted by residence in southern Mexico as they push towards the U.S folks these people have no business of being here is zero\nHonduras Guatemala El Salvador and President Trump is saying I'm not going to let you in and what I Love about this story\nIs it is such a clear difference\nOf where the different opposition is for instance if I were going against Senator Sheldon Whitehouse why go to the phones\nTo what a low view they have disingenuous elitist attitude they have\nHow small minded they think the Trump supporters are because number one\nProfessor Donald Trump did not leave the Republican Party joke truckload dead number one number two you miss the point behind all the bluster\nHillary Clinton was not a strong candidate they can't believe it in the world no one would have voted for Trump in their world know when they know I don't know anyone that voted for debt that see that's the bubble they live in they think well any rational person they look down on the middle of the country\nYou know they talk about the middle class but they look down on the middle class they frown on the middle class they knocked the middle class\nPresident Trump tapped into what he called the forgotten men and women of the country and that's why he won in Pennsylvania that's why he connected in Michigan he was willing to step forward and tell them like it is [noise]\nSt all they hear is the noise and they dismiss that and they feel well if someone else comes along and they make that type of noise let everyone vote for him and that is completely false\nThe Trump supporters that I Know\nAre all voting for mayor ... all of them and they'd be shocked at how is that possible he doesn't yell\nYou're missing the larger point it stands for principal the Democrat Party is the party of anarchy open borders and just giving out as many entitlements as benefits as possible growing the budget this is insanity with Rhode Island budget is\nBut their idea the only one of the ... the only reason they want all these illegals and caravan in is for their votes that's the deal they have\nThat's a deli deal that ... has that was the deal with Hillary Clinton they still can't believe ... the professor Maureen locally who was on lively experiment how insulting well the Trump voters they must like ... because he yells and Trump guilt he didn't yell\nHe would defend himself he would fight now if Joe Miller had run Republican\nAnd was carrying on the campaign if he had run in the primary and one\nThen it's a completely different story then I think people would say there's still has to be substance behind it you know they don't understand that\nThe most brilliant campaign slogan of our time\nWas very simple and Trump came up with it right after Romney lost make America great again because what do people keep saying what is happening to our country I don't recognize my neighborhood anymore\nBecause what do people keep saying what has happened to our country I don't recognize my neighborhood anymore I don't recognize Providence anymore I don't recognize protected any more I don't recognize when sock it any more people feel that way people feel what is happening to the United states\nSo Trump tapped into that he also understood he was the first candidate\nTo take on illegal immigration in a presidential campaign and look at the result the number one issue we're going to build a wall\nAnd now we're dealing with this caravan coming in the ... and the gene or among does an Sheldon Whitehouse is and they were shocked by people upset about this people don't like the fact that illegals are coming in\nAnd sending their kids to school and they don't pay taxes and taking the jobs of Americans and they show up at the hospital with no health insurance\nAnd they live Fifteen to an apartment in a ... going to be trying to find ways for them to vote the regular people are somehow offended you're damn right people are offended by that\n[noise] there's very smart to tap into the fact that people knew and explained very simple terms how we were being ripped off by other countries would trade deals and the trade deals are better and look at the economy is better\nAnd governor among do will never admit\nIf if President Obama was still in office there's no way the Rhode Island economy is what it is right now but that really struck me\nThe disconnect and she and I saw her Saturday Night I saw a Saturday Night at the debate for Flanders in I'm Sheldon Whitehouse if you want to call it or to be more like I don't know what it was um but um\nBut she teaches political science at ... at University of Rhode Island\nAnd that's how she views Trump voter so if somebody just comes along and yells while then everyone votes for them 'cause that's what Trump people like they don't get it no that's that's not it still don't get it look at his two years later they still don't get why he won and she lost\nPhil unbelievable you know when I Do believe I Do actually agree why they do grab on to that Russian whole thing of collusion and everything else is because that's the only way they can wrap their mind a way around that Hillary lost\nIs because it must have been because there's no way that someone like Trump could went on his own it must have been through some interference that's their attitude\n[noise] Laurie for Olin rights of gene or when some over the Massachusetts a lot of others [noise]\nTelling you Lisa have you read what the working uh no I Can't read that no I did not read that there's Brian is our friend wolf voting for mayor ... good well you know it's interesting I um folks I pushed my website ... dot com\nAnd I have to admit even I surprised myself with what I wrote but we'll talk about that in and I this is a tough election [noise] that\n\nThat many child the governor of Massachusetts doesn't know how to deal with Trump President Trump a it's very obvious to me that a Bob Flanders does not know how to handle the Trump situation I'm In fields they get boxed in on it\nAnd what's also noticed that mayor phone Gina Raimondo lumps may have fun with President Trump but she doesn't even mentioned the fact that joke pillow\nWas the honorary co chair of the Trump campaign so talk about that in more seven six six Thirteen eighty\nSeven six six Thirteen eighty you can email me it's John at ... dot com John ... dot

asked a mayor from pain if there was something that I could serve on\nAnd he said yeah we have an opening as an alternate under zoning board and I quickly took it and I have no regrets about that I learned a lot and I was able to uh um make a few votes to make a lot but I was always prepared I'm\nServed seven years with the Rhode Island Army National guard honorable discharge\nAnd I know last week on a certain show I was discredited I was dragged through the mud ridiculed and are accused the false charges on whatever no that's absolutely wrong folks\nA just a little story um during the

with that had a lost their lives for the country and Vietnam and or the army wouldn't take me because my blood pressure was too high\nSo I tried different ways of doing it and then finally somebody told me that the uh eleven Eighteenth engineers on cells main street one socket might have some openings well I went down and fill out the application that was a right after high school\nAnd ah it took months and months and I had to go basically have my blood pressure checked 'cause there was high\nThe single family residences we lost our homestead ladies and gentlemen out there\nFrom forty two to twenty five that's Seventeen percent and then you add in the supplemental packs at two point five million that's built into the base every year is another six percent so you'll ladies and gentlemen

would harm the taxpayers the citizens won't talk I guess what ladies and gentleman\nI met that pledge I didn't make a promise I pledged and it was a goal you set short term goals and you achieved them

you didn't want to fight no\nI'd never gave it up but I didn't have the votes and it was more important to get that thing passed without fighting okay\nAnd they didn't even put me on it they didn't want me on the committee because it wasn't popular at the beginning and they didn't want to touch it and then all of a sudden when they realized that people in the city we're going to vote for the

statistics forever that for whatever they're worth\nAnd two thousand sixteen in the presidential election that was the presidential election year do you know that only forty eight percent of college students voted I was surprised to see that statistic\nForty eight percent less than half of college students bother to vote in the last presidential election\nUh luckily those in the um people in the forty five sixty four age bracket they did better sixty seven percent\nBut you know that still means that one out of every three Americans didn't bother voting who could have voted in the presidential race in two thousand sixteen\nRather interesting I don't know what kind of voter turnout will have\nUm [noise] you know when all this\nComes to a an end two weeks from tomorrow but it'll be interesting to see what percentage of voters in one socket vote what percentage of the voters in Rhode Island bother to vote it always amazes me there are so many people who don't bother to vote\nAnd of course they spend a lot of time complaining thereafter so uh my philosophy has always been if you're not gonna bother to vote no we don't bother complaining maybe you have a\nAs far as that is concern also um if you subscribe to the Providence Journal want to see if I have that before me yeah\nBut his journal want to see if I have that before me yeah um I don't know if you happened to take a look at the legal ads in the journal today and I always find this interesting uh periodically\nThe state I guess it's the let's say who's responsible for this now I Want to make sure I Know who who vis a who's paying for this ad\nWell anyway it's it's a legal ad and it lists seizures and forfeiture is under the uniform controlled substance act\nAnd it mentions police departments in the state police and it tells you what they confiscated during various drug grades\nAnd are there are a number of them listed\nIn the amounts that they confiscated here in one socket is very interesting and they the only conclusion I have made after we're looking at this is to be honest with you um it's all over the place you know he'll streets\nNorth main street ... St Bernard in St Marie street\nMatter of fact I'm Marie street I Lived in that house when we were first married to a new one Mari street they confiscated one thousand six hundred Seventy five dollars back in July, July eleventh at an apartment on the second floor we lived on the thirty years' ago Marshall road is listed\nBeacon avenue\nProspect street Harris avenue hero avenue willow street Fifth Avenue the list goes on amazing and there's a full page of\nUm\nAddresses and the forfeiture amounts and many of them in the thousands of dollars yeah a lot of money in drugs\nA lot of money and drugs I don't know exactly what happened so that money I don't know if they give it to the police departments and then they can use it to buy equipment or whatever it is that they need to spend that um I don't know how that works good afternoon Iran WN alright\n... this year it seems to be an awful lot of ... going on and I'm calling on talk to call the ... for failure to a fact check or is that a case so don't bite the hand that feeds you [noise]\nCan you be more specific\nWell while I was so mad at work today ...\nFrom uh the mayor or a committed for the mayor claiming or a ... and this and that bankruptcies or things like a yes\nThat one of the call is going to follow up and do a a fact check on any of the stuff just take ads from both of the candidates on on both sides and they accept the money but they don't does affect ... ...\nWell you know in fan is a\nI have matter of fact I have that mailer in front of me and I ... I received it in today's mail and loaded are yeah and again I'm you know I'm looking at some of the accusations there\nI guess you could say that I shouldn't people who work here at WNPR I should be doing some research to see how accurate this information is but it's like everything else\nThe investigative teams aren't there anymore you know the cold doesn't really have an investigative team that can go out and do this research it would be extremely time consuming to try to\nAccept the money from the candidates well yeah ... or if it's true or not true\nYeah and and basically we do the same thing and you know the the uh\nPerson who's seeking public office is the one who takes the responsibility for what is being said and just like this mailer the you know the ... the people whoever the friends of Lisa ... or they need to take responsibility for what they put together and\nThere's nothing wrong with having that person and she just provide a service 'cause we watch it on local infecting other people don't have computers watch it on you know and watch 'em on via Facebook or whatever but bottom line is and I don't want to go on but the bottom line is\nThis guy is a big

uh I'm In ...\nYou you hear it every day every day somebody getting involved in an accident\nOftentimes serious accidents than they should not have been on the road and the first place how do you control something like that is it that these people just don't care well obviously it has something to do with that\n\nUh email comes in Roger sins in an email he says the mayor's mailer represents sleaze at its worst\nThat is his old pinion what else do we have yeah\nUh this person says regarding the male is I take them out of my mailbox I Walk straight to my recycling bin rip them up and put them in the trash I think they are a waste of money\nWe used to bowl deli hunch was al brands business partner for years and he helped her get elected you walk down the aisle if he was that bad why does she keep company with them\nFor all her life she herself filed bankruptcy and if you want I'll send you copies of the documents she should stop looking in should stop looking in the mirror when she\nBut it's not city hall that can do that it's the people who own the plaza if they're really interested in serious about filling the spaces up there\nThey're the ones who should be thinking outside the box what is it that will work in that space and I ... the opinion something like what you just described and there are other\nUh ideas out there as well take a look at what some other what has happened in some other communities where not the only community that has empty space in a shopping plazas I mean you drive around I don't care where you go you're going to the empty spaces\nBut it's up to the people who own the property they're the ones who have to be thinking as to how do we feel this space how do we attract a supermarket into Wal Mart he'll applies if that's the right place for one\nYou know it'd be almost worthwhile for city all to say that the owners of the plaza listen you get a supermarket and you will give it a tax break of ...\nWell something like that could come out of city hall I I don't I'm not saying it would be simple to do something like that but they're the ones who would have the power to offers some sort of a an incentive ...\n... exactly oh the carrot in\nFront of a oh yeah and again even the plows the owners could do something to they could go to somebody and say okay we want a supermarket here and we're giving you free rent for a year or something like that or for the first year or you know an incentive of that type I mean I I\nIt's easy for me to say that I don't own the ... but you know they have to I'm sure a answer\nTo the ... the people who invest in these uh you know the knees and\nReal estate the properties so uh I I don't it's not easy though it is and he's in I don't think we can really blame our elected officials what ... what I Would\nAsk our ... elected officials to do though is do everything within your power as an elected official to make it as easy as convenient as possible to open a business in the city\nBecause we need to have a supermarket now we've got enough empty spaces and different places I'm sure that would be a large enough for ...\nOh I think so ah you know I I\nI had written to the folks who own Dave's marketplace a man that's not a very big supermarket that could fit [noise] excuse me at the either at one of\n... or maybe at an end to vote when socket plaza uh there's there's ample space up there uh for ... free\nStanding Adam ... was\nIt could it could but again we can't force people to do that [laughter] you know we can we cannot force people to invest in the city I Know that's unfortunate yes it is [laughter] it is yeah\nBut you know like I said issues mhm issues have been brought up in the city and said that this guy that she\nWell I agree with you there are a lot of issues facing the city and uh I Would love everybody I Would I Would really urge\nAll the candidates and the next two weeks to stick to the issues\nKnow they try to do like Washington DC the Washington DC such a total mess right now what blame this on blamed on blamed us on oh look at this one's\nThat's right now we're blamed some blamed on blamed us on oh look at as far as pass oh look at that one's pass yeah that's why it's called the pass and you know what are you gonna do it today and tomorrow\nWell those are the questions that I Would like to see and said\nI Would love to see that answer because if we don't see that answer we're only that'd be rolling in the same\nAs before will just be so stagnant that's got to be a yeah okay so what's different today compared to two

and grow street before I before I bought this house and that's why we bought this house because we take it one sock it wasn't that bad it was nice small community that was mostly French back then\nYou know that's also because they got the garages it back you know they write I imagine a lot less back there and stuff so\nI had I heard that they removed that I I heard they sold the lift so they're probably not only garage but one way or the other I mean if they're serious about it they can find a way but it's a yeah it's\nIt's a nice garage backed ... it'll be a shame to go to waste goes all the high doors and yeah you know we're in the building set up for that well\nIt's certainly a good purpose for many many years I Know that CEOs had a lot of customers are ... who you know for people

don't think it was that the crap that he was trying to get out of there\nWell he don't definitely there's a problem um that um you know you have people hanging around\nThat school and the park behind the school after hours is clearly posted ... nobody's hosts to be in there I Believe it's eight thirty or nine o'clock in the cut off point\nBut yet the lights are on which is an attraction you know the kids see the lights on and from what I understand they have access to the park to the basketball courts and all of a all of that so\nThat creates you know that that that that that's that's not something somebody should have to put up with totally eleven eleven thirty at night in later\nBut it'll come out and I were going to grab a call ... ...\nWell what some of the characters that hang around the neighborhood he probably thought twice about going outside maybe you didn't know who you were [laughter] that could have been the reason why he didn't go out\nAt a stockbroker yeah yeah

in and you're already put some question on ... on the ground my husband was\nOkay he's got his sons advice on and then again as him on a helmet barricades and we got flying stuff over the airwaves\nBut that first one is from ... from how it's done in Cape Cod and I think you get to the incident because he's asking will you be in the conch speedway and what will you be driving for six thousand dollars to win October twenty seven\nYeah as of right now I'm not sure a scar on ago there were going to go there was a stance car to go there with a Danny ... duty to a a well a modified to our car we haven't chosen yet but it will be one of those two cars\nOkay but you will be there and nobody's guaranteed a slot in that right you have to get it through qualifying\nYeah I think there is some provisional Z like tried track winter professionals but which I Do have a win on the\nOn the series from ... asked at Waterford so I mean you don't want to have to use that but it's always nice to know that you have it there in your back pocket but\nIt's pretty much you know you've got to try to qualify for the heat's\nOkay do you have a ... to be driving with that as late model\n[noise] uh no I won't be running out of your weight loss of their by\n'cause I Know you've got plenty of experience with all the you know forty career wins Justin staffing alone and people don't realize their career you had in late models ah besides the modified and I think it was it ... one night and you get an a four cylinder amongst the many up there\nSo there isn't anything that you can drive I'd seen as many as five or six divisions up in a World Series and ... and a couple of other people\nOr you know you can drive while Mitt Kennedy to there's three that I Know that can drive any division and have a chance to win the race I've got an email here from Kenny from Portsmouth New Hampshire and he says\nHow has the a big event that uh happened up in New Hampshire are the two hundred and fifty lap must get two fifty\nHow has that changed modified racing in New England where someone like he's dialing gets his first Korea when and walks away with thirty three thousand nine hundred dollars how is that change modified racing\nWell I think it definitely changed a lot um you know for chases\nA resume or just because of the fact that I mean he's run so good throughout the whole year it seemed like you bad\nYou know pretty much set second fiddle to much Justin almost every race so you know it's nice to see him get his first one there and obviously that's probably the biggest race of the year that everybody wants to win so that um you know\nIs even looks better on his resume bought\nI I don't know how much it changed the modifies in general um\nI think it definitely for all of fans perspective was it was a lot different um hopefully it didn't confuse them with with all the stops that we're going out on her I mean\nI'm you know and then we had the uh the break their stuff so it definitely out a lot going on I Know I was not so much confused but I Know I was kind of off\nOff all of 'em and I was on ...\nOn my own there I think either two or three laps down at one point so it was tough to know who you're facing and lining up of starts but I don't know I I probably don't have the correct answer on on how much that race changed for the whole modifies I mean\nYou know with the pay out that it was and stuff I Would I have to a thought that we would have maybe a little bit better by a car called because\nYou did it when I was twenty five thousand dollars and when\nSome southern drivers did make the trip and come up for the first time and I think everybody must be looking at the two thousand Nineteen calendar wondering is something this size is gonna transpire again now also along the modified racing series I Believe that's two consecutive years that they raised up there\nBut I'm surprised that one thing on that race with a limited to a fifty lap race\nAnd he should be a hundred or a hundred and a quarter on that track\n'em for the for the\nNot track\n'em for the for the for the Emirates you're talking about the ...\nYeah I don't know I I I kinda liked the fifty I mean maybe Seventy five I don't think jak would go\nTo a hundred or a or a hundred and twenty five ... just because of the fact that series is kind of you know it's kind of they're they're trying to do that like the Affordable series not have a pet for cars and stuff and then you start getting into like the hundred lap raised and you might have to come in for tires\nI'm so maybe that's the one of the reasons why they keep it\nAnd I don't know how much that race is um you know all all of a jak 'cause I think that's more of that that short short tracks series right that that Bob ... ... ah does so I don't know maybe he likes to do we have heard that they've added to ask a modified\nUm for two thousand I've seen it up there so that'll be really cool I think I think they're running thirty or forty ...\nI think that's definitely the nicer when that's going to end up being a premium\nYeah I'd like to I Know that the ... the last ... moderate that was up there ... pretty bad yeah but uh I like to see you know those guys go back up there 'cause I was ... to do\nThen they add the king and then up through a few times in a year now now down to one race would NASCAR I again another a note here from Susan ... from what what type of Rhode Island she wants to know can we expect you to come back in the late model division Thompson next year any any car\n\nI'm I'm not sure what my plans are right now for ... for Thompson just because of the fact that I'm a we're not going to be running their withstand I think we're going to try to track Syria's next year so I haven't really talked to those guys yet I'm sure they'll probably they wanted to come back um for right now I don't have a definitely answer on what we're doing there for next year\nThey know this is a personal question for me 'cause I've done a lot of talking about Eric or over the years that's very true swim with the ... and I was very surprised\nA caffeine started this program up at a stop to raise the money for charity and stuff [noise]\nUh two years ago they had a couple of ... additives in it and then it swelled up this year to twelve female races which I Believe generated thirty six thousand dollars in Germany for twelve different charities teach girl had their own and I kept looking to see\n... Santos ... cat's name on one of those ladies cars and I thought she would jump on this on a damn\nShe definitely would have done that the only problem and a lot of people probably don't realize this but that was um you to do that you will not have a hole in a in another race car or any surgeon\nWhy did no those ladies that had all race we're supposed to not have any any on track experience at anything\nThat answers along quite actually that's why she couldn't do it yeah [laughter] okay now we know so yeah no shoot you definitely ... she would have been all of that [laughter]\nAnd I'll tell you I'm so proud of those ladies what they did of them and I think this is going to grow a chance to and it was a lot a lot yeah I'm an to really was\nA lot of people don't realize it last year and a ... cat is on a lie right now on race chatter\nOn smoking Ninety five point one and Thirteen eighty am I'm ...\nUh Amazon Echo Alexa capital radio uh fourteen different way don't touch that dial you just want to give you a few more stats on I guess\nUh what do you believe in and on his third of all time as Kay modified wins the tops and I believe you have forty right now I keep it up to about forty seven and then the all time is teddy Chris red Ninety nine\nA you're tied entered the season are tied for late model wind up it's not bad\nAnd then as we all know somebody one twelve races up there this year to take over the all time lead a wind in that decision is different and die you right now I Believe are sitting there at all times and late model wind and stop the speedway\nAnd so many positions and now to along the Turing modified racing championships the resume\nHow many more years you get less money\n[laughter] well I'll be forty in July so uh I don't know how much longer I Want to be doing it I got a little\nBoy here that's going to be to a December that all you ever says he loves race cars so between having my heritage and Eric is heritage and him I think we're going to have a problem [laughter] I'm sure he's going to want to be behind the wheel so\nDealing with a quote imagine going to happen and then have\nDefinitely probably going to have to uh you know slow down when my racing career but I'd have to think that I could y'all go at least an hour you know Fifteen Twenty years I mean teddy was fifty eight and still going strong and I know a lot of the physical condition as as he is but\nI'd like to think that I'm In pretty good condition where I could at least you know go another Fifteen Years but it\nAlso has to you know you have to have a great

Speedway was worth the price of admission I Love it isn't that you know I absolutely love it somebody to ... send an email like that\nYeah you know I've I've lost\nA multiple divisions and all of my years of racing but the only thing that\nCan be upsetting about running a sports ... there's the fact that sometimes they don't get to see some of the best racing granted a part of it but uh when I visit another racetrack um you know the the modified are generally the premier division and\nThat's what most people go to see\nA a you'll find be locked garbage was torture good sports river street

these guys that\nGrill up racing on these you know drinking age a quarter mile tracks like I did um I I really think they have an edge over the rest of the guys that are used to make these these quick abrasive moves and they really gel well into or the racing at Thompson\nBut you know you mentioned the or the Gleason brothers and and and times have changed for me now is a little bit of an older
