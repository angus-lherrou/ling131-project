right well I I don't know if this is a story I don't know if a if a journalist can be a celebrity but um I think I think to turning into celebrities legendary journalist and author\nBob Woodward now he was he's a an older\nOlder guy I mean he was around for the Watergate scandal with President Nixon he was a young reporter in those days and was one of the guys that did the research on Watergate and actually brought down the president of the usa\nAnd he was in Providence delivering a keynote speech at the Rhode Island public expenditure councils Seventy fifth annual meeting of the convention

NBC's channel can reporter about a phone call that he had with the president about a month after the book came out\nI pointed out that I talked to six people trying to interview him would would said he acknowledged kind of in one and a half cases I guess that he knew about my interviews with them he wished we'd talked ahead of time\nYou said that I'd always treated him fairly obviously since the book is out he has changed his mind\nBecause Donald Trump has called it fake news the book\nSo far is sold three quarters of a million copies\nAnd that was on the first day of the sale so it's a huge success for Bob Woodward the journalists in Providence\nLast night as my story well\nI'll tell you who's not going to read the books may [laughter] does not interest me at all you know and even if it means even if it's a hundred percent accurate and they wouldn't surprise me if it is\nI don't care [laughter] I Know I should uh-huh I Am so sick of government and politics and talking about it I Can't even stand it anymore I don't know what to do I someone said yesterday on Facebook\nWith a capital at us please stop talking about judge Kavanaugh and ... it just gets to the point I had nausea and let's see what happens and I know I'm In this business it's a pathetic thing but it's just it's so much information all the time coming from both sides of the aisle\nSo along the same lines yesterday I get to the gym and sell the first thing I Want to do is catch up on the news and I couldn't get away from that story I mean whether it was CNN or whether it was Fox News there it is someone talking there the Kavanaugh story on television\nAnd I'm and basically the FBI is conducting an investigation what does it say but they continue to cover that news story so I went to my\nTo my uh I pat and I watched another um another edition of that\nFound Amazon Prime a\nMovie that I that I watch it at the gym I watch um\nDownton Abbey at home or in the comfort of your home right this is this is that um detective a series or watching\nSomebody asked me you know the name of it the other day I forgot the name of it it's called Scott and Bailey is a is a British detective series to female detectives and for the Manchester uh England police department and so I watch that instead of the news because I just cannot take too much more\nOf a ... on the story on\nBoth ways by the way of it I think the problem is\nWhoever's talking to you already knows what they think so you're not having a conversation with someone who's just them imposing their opinion on you know because to be honest and I don't care what anybody says no matter how much you\nUsed a terminology to try to describe what you think is happening you really don't know ...\nNone of it it could be a total scam by the Democrats it may be legitimate it could be he could be the greatest guy you know if you could be the biggest combat you don't really know you're getting bits and pieces of a human life so when someone says do\nThese Democrats are all on All right that's a you think or are these combat Republicans in Trump attacked\nTrying to take down the country you already think those things so there's no conversation to be ad of maybe there's a third point of view where\nMaybe President Trump's done some bad things maybe he's done some good things it's not all bad not all good so it does gets tiresome to talk about because the person already has the opinion of formulated in their brain\nWhen we come back what's in the name what we'll find out when we join a soundbite from the ... the city council

work ahead of you\nAre but it's always my favorite time of the year here in the city um I always\nYou know every year try to enjoy some parts of the autumn fest celebration that I've never done before\nUm and you know I look forward to it every it's a good chance to catch up with people that you haven't seen in a while from the community touch base with people that you don't have a chance to relax with and the bad ten once in a while I have a beer with them and\nIt's a great community event I think it's the highlight of my year here on one side it\nWhile I'm attending autumn best be show to stop in at ... family restaurants booth now yesterday my son was in town and we went to lunch at ... family restaurant and I had a chance to chat with Judy ...\nThe owner of a misuse family restaurant and she is telling me that they have a booth set up on them fest and there'll be offering\nFish sandwich meat pie slices tomato or chicken noodle soup and grilled cheese sandwiches I did complain to Judy that uh because I have to\nWork at autumn festival number of different ways that um I was disappointed she didn't bring her baked beans and she said she'll\nBring some uh along with our anyway that restaurant located at eight on Clinton street will be open for regular hours during autumn fest bug will be closed on Columbus Day the day of the parade Judy in her family looks forward to seeing you at all the best and see you at the ... family restaurant boots\nAnd are they are setting up at all to invest this year and we hope you'll stop by and say Hi to Judy and the gang at the autumn fest two thousand and Eighteen number forty\nMay I share the telephone number with you before we get to our next topic seven six nine of six hundred\nSeven six six Thirteen eighties or something you want to talk about please feel free to talk about it with me so uh as I explained to Dave every morning I go to that coffee shop\nOn main street and a bunch of people in there\nAnd I'm One of the topics was the uh on a ventilator city council meeting last night one of the quietest council meetings that we've had a long time I did not attend that I did not listen to it I've been listening to some of the audio\nTape that we have of the meeting which has provided by a\nPoll Jacob to us and um you know there are a number of people under good and welfare but not a you know any earth shaking I'm a vent some happen at all the best in terms of legislation you know resolutions annoyed and then says and and so forth I don't know if it's because we're getting close to the election\nAnd um nobody wants to introduce anything or or comment on anything and stay safe\nI think it's twofold you and I'm not mocking this by the way I think because autumn festival coming up I don't know I think that there's something to be said where it's like to put it away until autumn festival done um\nTry to keep your differences a little bit quieter try not to have any major situation arrive right before them fest I really believe that uh it is election Neal elections right around the corner but I think it'll start in earnest\nA particularly in Providence where people are retiring at forty years old and receiving six percent coal or for the rest of their lives true which means every twelve years their pensions were doubling and costs so if you retire with a six thousand sixty thousand dollar pension or fifty thousand dollar pension\nAt forty two years old by the time he was sixty six you are making two hundred thousand dollars a year it's called the rule of Seventy two uh the rule of Seventy two is whatever percentage are making you divided in there that's how long it takes a double your pension so it's six percent every twelve years they're they're um pension was\nDouble do the gentleman who is holding on line I guess uh you know we got into an extensive bug a comment there or or explanation of well rather complicated thing the pension system yeah You're welcome to call back and we'll put your right on the air\nMy point being with that though to finish that up is why anybody would want to go to all of a system that is clearly failed it hasn't worked now whether that's because of the politicians not spending the money where they should of every single pension in this state with the exception of a handful of them\nIs in trouble the question is ah when the market falls apart again which it will because it does every now and then every ten or Fifteen Years or so what will be the result and what further problems are on the horizon for the people that are tied into those systems\nBut I got a moment from social media to work and school it's hard to know what and who you can trust these days fact is it's never been easy that's why over three hundred years ago ... and rate was astonished masons are people who speak\nPlainly act fairly and could always be trusted because that's the way they live if you'd like to discover the masons and

think the largest paper when when people make compensations with their heads whether it's at the facts the takeaway coming down to the golf ball with their late\n... because you know they can't make

has come forward to back up this woman story not one hash tag believe women\nThis Julie sweat Nick the quote flirt accuser alright it continues [noise] I\nThink for a doctor Christine Blasey Ford came forward in the Washington Post more recently and September ... I it's it's\nIt's been several weeks but I'm not somebody who follows the news and not political\nAt all [noise] Julie sweating it says she was in community college when she started attending house parties that included high schoolers\nGraduated in Nineteen eighty correct or my school's cry from Gaithersburg public high school and would have been out of high school a lot of people that I was wondering what do you do at a high school parties here or the high school\nParty parties had everybody in between about an age range is attain sixteen and twenty five maybe even more how did you meet Brett Kavanaugh and he actually made it I did actually said how I remember him as a I remember\nWe just stop the tape there from all the folks that I don't know why I was looking for this I don't know why the media's not picking this up and I want everyone to just stop for a moment ... ... what is the John ... drove show will trigger you can listen am Thirteen eighty or Ninety nine point nine of them\nShe claims that they were these ten parties ten of them in the ages went from Fifteen to twenty five even up now where's the anyone listening right now\nWhen you were in high school is there anyone that can hear my voice there was ever at a party in high school with ... individuals they're twenty five years old in older I remember when I was in college\nThe only people that would be allowed to a college party would be sometimes they'd be some high school senior girls who would go but never the boys they would kick out the boys and even then once you get out of the college parties circuit\nYou you you suddenly don't belong never mind you are certainly not at a party with her high school boys is there any person lifting any reasonable individual you're twenty five years old and you supposedly at a party\nWith Fifteen and sixteen year old and she says even up\nOr how high Thirty Years' old there were a thirty year old people\nAt a high school party with Brett Kavanaugh has friends I I don't believe her she's already lying I don't pay attention to the news listen this is really simple she doesn't even know when the doctor forward story broke this is made up\nHash tag I Believe survivors I Believe women I Want to remind people this woman swore under roe\nPenalty of perjury per that Michael ... lawyer misses the person that Senator Sheldon Whitehouse is standing by this is absolutely ludicrous\nShe's going to community college why would she be at a high school party I said that right away there's no way\nWhy would twenty five year old adults be at a party with Seventeen year old Brett Kavanaugh in his friend that that is more absolutely ... this isn't even college this is their high school students\nShe's absolutely a pathological liar and last night her former boyfriend was on ... she's a liar oh excuse me hash tag I Believe women hash tag believe oh wait a minute she's a survivor\nThat's the new term she is that there was this woman is disturbed she is making it up\nAnd this Kate Snow of NBC News that they were in Russia who ran on MSNBC who choose capital drugging women participating in gang rapes big continue the interview\nI it is so preposterous folks she's telling you throw the through she's lying can we say that is there any woman lifting that actually believes what this Julie sweating to quote the third accuser were saying\nWhat she is also doing by the way is a tremendous unbelievable disservice ... every woman who has actually been\nSuffered sexual assault or bitter victim of sexual assault or has been a rape victim or mail for that matter she don't want to complete disservice because so far nothing she has said is credible listen how it goes on as pathetic interview\nVarious and as a as a judge and I remember specifically him and his hand it you know anything about Brett Kavanaugh\nI just I I Believe he might have been wearing a a Georgetown Prep\nUniform which a lot of the boys to where at least a uniform or parts of their uniforms at the party at all times and I think are very proud and their statement to the Judiciary Committee have described it to ... and you say you saw\nCabinet under these things can you tell you what they saw him do it was very aggressive a very sloppy driving drunk [noise] ah I saw him\nGo up to a girl who\nAre on them try to get a little same hand they touching them all scientists are a lot of um [noise] try to shift clothing\nLater in the interview she went further I saw him Push Girls against walls\nAre here for tennis stumbling stumble into them and I'll come into a wall have pushed his body against their as he would grow them there are some differences between what next hiring statement last race and what she told us role in that\nStatement bracelet and then she became aware of efforts by Kavanaugh and his friend or a judge to spike punch at parties\nIn our interview she said she saw them near the punch but did not specifically either men spy kids the Brett Kavanaugh [noise]\nYou know fighting a posh rifle I saw I saw him given red solo cups to quite a few girls during that time frame and there was grand punch it those parties and\nWould not take one of those classes so\nHave to say I saw him around the punch I went to the malls or the French containers I don't know what he did but I saw him by them\nIn her declaration sweat Nick also wrote I also witnessed efforts by mark judge Brett Kavanaugh and others to cause and girls to become an ... an disoriented so they could then be gang raped by rumor ... by train as numerous boys I have a for recollection of seen boys lined up outside ruins as men\nBoy I have a recollection of team boys lined up outside ruins as many of these parties waiting for their turn with a girl inside\nThe room these boys included mark judge and Brett Kavanaugh\nWhat did she say well I tell what happening he happened to me I didn't put two and two together but I always say boy standing outside of rooms congregated together so like a gauntlet\nAnd I didn't know what was it ... I thought I Would see them laughing alive laughing I'm standing in line outside or in line that definitely huddled by door it and I didn't understand what it possibly day and and your declaration you describe\nBrett Kavanaugh and his friend mark judge standing outside seen them stand outside the door at the other boys\nGuess thing that in hindsight it takes away the law going to have [noise]\nI I it's just too coincidental she says she had no idea and I believe all knowing that they have and I was unable she her salary for the door was open\nAnd they tell me what happened [noise] comfortable telling us\nHappened to me [noise] it's probably the most\nIt's awful thing that could happen any human my body was violated [noise] my soul was broken [noise] uh I was not able to have somebody thought but I had no stop [noise]\nI I felt like somebody took me and basically saying you're worthless [noise] anywhere nothing that you are disposable I was at a party [noise] and\nI remember that I started not to feel very well and next thing I Know I was shoved into a room and I'm having my clothes\nIt's trying to defend the guy that made the accusation we'll take your calls on the ... showing aimed Thirteen eighty and Ninety nine point nine asked them a lot more head on the John to beach Rochelle WN outright when socket\n\n\nYou're waiting on the news was Chris bar and was\nAnd claiming the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his legal team tried to refute an accusation of sexual misconduct\nBefore it was made public NBC News is reporting a cabin exchanged text messages with mutual friends or isn't Deborah Ramirez Ramirez is the woman who is accused Kavanaugh other exposing himself to her during a dorm party at Yale in the Nineteen eighties\nAnd the tax cabinet are reportedly he tried to convince at least one of their mutual friends to go on the record\nAnd his defense justice the Ramirez story was to be published in the New Yorker\nMeanwhile Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell saying again today on the Senate floor that there will be a vote on Kavanaugh this week\nWell the alternative voted yes on the farm nominate\nYou're listening to USA radio news\nUnder new ownership Rick siren auto center in auto sales fourteen thirty by victory highways latest bill ... family owned and operated than we are a complete automotive service and repair center\nAt all a team of experience but can I can handle all kinds of autos service and repair work for maintenance two major auto issue and yes\nWe service important domestic causes well chat or had mechanic has Thirteen Years experience with all kinds of vehicles listen to this money saving deal during a grand opening power staring fluid flush Seventy nine Ninety five plus tax was Ninety nine Ninety five a twenty dollar saving now reopen\nPunter new on the show with a great service you always expected from this location and a new phone number please market um seven six nine eight or eight eight\nTire models that are in auto sales fourteen thirty by victory highway Slater's ...\nAcross from Kate as well\n\nAs I could trust in the White House is down according to a new Gallup survey it shows forty percent of Americans say they trust Congress the highest rating for Congress said nine years\nTrusted the White House that's down to forty two percent not much better than the all time low of forty percent seen during the Watergate scandal at a campaign style rally in Tennessee last evening President Trump says\nDemocrats are the party of crime how does\nThe president saying he's referring there to the Democrats stance on border issues he was also complaining about their response to his Supreme Court nominee\nDemocrats are willing to do anything and hurt anyone to get their way like they're doing with judge Kavanaugh\nPresident Trump today is speaking to the electrical contractors association convention in Philadelphia and tonight will speak in Mississippi and this is usa radio news with a risk [noise]\nCold and flu season is here in ocean there ... it's ready to handle all of your urgent medical needs that staff that ocean state is ready to care for you your child or an elderly relatives we're located at the bank of America building twenty five\nJohn ... hours of operation are Monday through friday ... pm and Saturdays and Sundays Ninety ... check us out at ... dot com boom\nAround us were held in Las Vegas yesterday to mark the one year anniversary since the worst mass shooting in American history when a gunman opened fire on a concert crowd from a nearby hotel window killing a fifty eight injuring hundreds more here's more from usa Radio's Tim bird\n...

and uh we can do better than ... than Sheldon Whitehouse that would be my suggestion or going to talk to the um the judge judge Flanders coming up\nAt um at twelve thirty in the meantime folk seven six six Thirteen eighty seven six six Thirteen eighty to ... what is the ... show you can email me John at the ... dot com John ... to ... uh we'll bring you the latest also Senator Whitehouse\nThis guy that made up the story about judge Kavanaugh made it up\nRecanted the story made up the judge Kavanaugh in mark judge rape some woman to Newport on a boat Nineteen by made it up\nThe FBI is our best game Sheldon Whitehouse your senator who's up for re election in November folks we have a chance to remove him he says that man is ordered apology that man is owed an apology\nMismanaged shouting fire in a crowded theater if someone's holds in a a bully bomb threat is that person and ordered apology ridiculous let's go to a fault seven six six\nThirteen eighty good afternoon Europe on the John ... drove show hello\nJohn either question and I have two comments are okay and the first thing the question is about outhouse he is saying that he won't divulge the name of the reporter and he did say what reporter the gentleman that owns the folks go to why can't the FBI us\nWould administer a test with someone who was grieving coming from a ... on my air at all no no but it just you don't get it it's not even matter\n... if you're not going to get accurate results you're trying to get accurate results right so so Rachel Mitchell said based on the testimony that Dr Ford gave her\nIf she was asked not only would she not issue a search warrant she said there was no credible evidence but she cited she is someone that deals with sex abuse victims and said\nThat they remember this while they remember next to nothing yes only that ... that bad yeah yeah\nBut she couldn't even keep street things from just a couple of weeks ago which does lead Cindy so she's re chanting and I want you to just I Want everybody right now it's twelve twenty I Wonder what you just think about this for a moment we talked with this doctor fourth but let's be honest\nShe can't remember where the party was where when the party was\nThat's a fact\nSheet she ... and and and Rachel Mitchell says at first she said it happened in the mid eighties then she said and happened in the early eighties then suddenly said it happened in the summer Nineteen eighty\nTwo changing too much why does it change like that's indeed yeah it doesn't make any sense now hold on it just\nGive me one more minute I Want to read this is exactly from the memo that I got regarding Rachel Mitchell um\nHer her account of what the party has been inconsistent\nAccording to the Washington ... ... a good portion of post account\nThere were four boys in the bedroom when she was assaulted she told the Washington Post the notes were erroneous cars or for boys at a party only two in the bedroom in her letter to Dr Feinstein she said me and for others were president the party in her testimony she said it was their self and her friend at the party\nSo she also listed this PJ as a bystander\nTo the polygraph person and she passed them when she testified think about this you know Cindy ... actually because of your phone call you just raised a very good point that I just realized\nShe passed the ... supposedly past the polygraph test when she took the polygraph test she said this boy PJ was a bystander in the bedroom when she testified she said he was at the party but not in the bedroom now\nWhy would a guy stayed behind the Potter they got what the other guys\nYeah but you're missing the point how valid could the polygraph be if she passed a polygraph by saying he was in the bedroom but then when she testified she said he was not in ...\nAnd he was in the bedroom but then when she testified she said he was not in the bedroom\nYou have to wonder any accuracy of the polygraph is one of many yeah I mean he gets through she's getting through I don't know about you now I mean I Am demanding that he got through do you agree Oh yes yes I agree um hold on one more thing doctor Portland\nCounted ledge the salt ah she named three people other than judge who attended the party\nOr she said they could they could not remember the name knowing his come forward all three eyewitnesses that Dr Ford named\nDenied any memory of the party in any way oh by the way this um that Julie sweating it one of the people I was mentioning earlier one of the people that she mentioned oh this person you call this person or the ... and she's going to testify this happened at these parties the person said I I've never even heard of Julie sweating can you imagine\nImagine if you go on for a job interview and you said I Want you to call this person they're going to give me a great recommendation and then the new employer calls the president says I I've never heard of this person Cindy I don't know what you're talking about so hold on just one more thing about Rachel that I just want to point out um\nAnd then I'll let you go and you're so a great or the bottom line\nDr Ford has not offered a consistent account of when the alleged assault happened listen to this is in the July six a message she sent to the Washington Post shoes that have happened in the mid Nineteen eighties July thirtieth letter to Feinstein she has said it happened in the early eighties\nI Know she changed her telling about the air\nAugust seventh statement polygraph she said it happened one high school summer in the early eighties but then she crossed out the word early and she never explained why September sixteenth\nWashington Post article that was the first time the Washington Post came out that she said it happened in the summer of Nineteen eighty two so\nShe say anyone at one point as well\nShe did that is exactly right but I Want to swing back to this third accused of that I was playing the son of a swipe Nick so September sixteenth is when the Washington Post published the first article sold as Kate Snow is interviewing this quote third accuser Julie sweat neck\nAs case there was interviewing her she says when did you first learn of this and hear of itchy and ... as I played ... third accused of that this Michael ... represents as I first learned a bit when Dr Ford came forward six weeks ago\nYeah and she really came forward three and came back for three weeks ago I mean none of this that and go what about what I Love it I mean Cindy I Believe all women now don't prefer last question last question do you agree to me they're doing real\nOr victims of sexual assault injustice on his whole thing yeah terrible injustice center of your a gray color call me again alright alright\nAlright thank you folks seven six six Thirteen eighty seven six six Thirteen eighty judge Flanders who's going to join me again Sheldon Whitehouse Sheldon Whitehouse I Want you to think about this just for a moment right now it's twelve twenty five\nAnd you take any way or anything away good afternoon ... show Senator Whitehouse feels that this man from ... who made up this whole account\nFabricated at a town called the FBI they judge Kavanaugh was on that boat he rape that woman in Newport blah blah blah ... the whole thing fabricated FBI investigating what is that of the White House said that guy goes that that can they do they all live in an apology\nThey owe him an apology for going after him from making up that story hopes that this is absolutely pathetic is what it is seven six six Thirteen eight and when I talked to a judge Flanders coming up Senator Sheldon Whitehouse I repeat you know channel ten reports\nThat he won't named ... who is the reporter who did Senator Whitehouse tell Senator Whitehouse Sheldon Whitehouse was orchestrating a smear campaign with a fake accuser behind the scenes that's what was going on\nAnd there's no way that he can try to get away get away from it hey I Want to remind you west fountain auto body\nCalled them today if you're ever in an accident\nCall Kenny and Patricia at West boatload of body four oh one to seven to thirty three forty four oh one to seven to thirty three forty west fountain auto body with west spoke remember they going to work for you not the insurance company\nWest outlawed her body called them today\nTo seven to thirty three forty they're going to work for you not the insurance company it's west fountain auto body for all one to seven to thirty three forty from a small dent\nTo a nearly total vehicle you can depend on west followed her body to seven to thirty three forty two seven to thirty three forty four west fountain auto body to the phones\nGood afternoon Europe on the John ... show\nHello unless the teacher either\nOne of the things that I Would like to know from judge Flint is there any there are many of us out here\nAre older techie when not on the Internet blah blah blah and we went to find your way to help him for instance I wouldn't be very happy to me is um I Would be very happy to do that\nI keep missing in my computer is not so I don't even bother going on\nOkay so maybe she could track I can address it OK we will be willing to go to his headquarters to help out okay\nHis headquarters the headquarters for judge Flanders is in Warwick Juno where the crown plaza hotel is\nIt made a real number was right off the Ninety five Ninety five five near route five yes around plaza our riots across\nThe street from there it used to be I'll go with the used to be I think it's a stop and shop now but it used to be eight packs use to be right in there to remember\nThat I guess yes I Do his own\nHis headquarters is right in the plaza it's beautiful there to stop and ... I Believe it to stop and shop is Home Depot there\nThe Flanders headquarters is right there they could use some volunteers you can get a lawn signs he we Rhode Island deserves to have judge Flanders represent us in the U.S Senate\nA and then say that this man has over an apology after making a false rape allegations it's it's beyond belief and Senator Whitehouse sent this letter\nA which is the source of all this yeah she admits that he not only did he referred to the Senate committee and the FBI but he says right in the letter that he sent to I'm a Senator Grassley into Senator Feinstein or that he had also referred him to a reporter\nUh and so the question arises who is this reporter\nYes or and or you know what was the purpose of referring him to a reporter other than the obvious one of trying to get this out to the media sooner rather than later\nAh before it can be vetted and investigated or along the proper channels\nSo it's a completely inappropriate a thing for him to do in the first place but then on top of it to add insult to injury to the intelligence of all of us to say that now this man is older an apology this false accused of rape\nOr as old an apology because uh it got out there to the public\nThat he had made these allegations were what did Senator Whitehouse think was going to happen that's right when he sent them to this investigative reporter\nAnd not only that he's not a quote this is Senator Whitehouse now ... trying to throw this quote regular guy demand folks that made the false accusation and recanted they try to throw them under the bus I think is a demonstration other people come forward will be treated very roughly will judge lenders there is a penalty\nThat if you call a a screen fire in a crowded theater there is a penalty if you call in a false bomb threat that sucked in to prevent or the people for information from coming forward the\nFact the FBI is investigating this man is they have any consequences if you've flown in bony accusations any information on with someone of a high profile need to like this and it's not throwing someone onto the bus you you can't if someone pulls up fire alarm and there's no fire\nTo have to be consequences for that that's what that's thrown them under the bus ... behaving in that matter\nAll that and that's why a Senator Grassley has referred this individual to the ... ah for a possible prosecution\nFor what he did yeah but but the really thing is that this guy if he's or an apology by anybody is by senator why that that's right because he this lead this fellow yes and the the notion which is unbelievable to me that he would\nHave requested Senator Whitehouse to send them\nTo a reporter about this whole who goes to your senator uh and says you know I've I've I've got information about a crime and the senators as well I'll I'll send it along to the investigative authorities are and then a Senator Whitehouse wants us to believe that this man that's at all but but\nIn addition to that please send me a tour of Porter's quarter fresh\nHis own way and I've heard that added that man is contradicting that saying that he did not ask for that is some White House that offered that some of my answer budgets lenders and folks again good afternoon it's John ... was speaking with judge Bob landers he is the person that you can vote for\nInstead of Senator Sheldon Whitehouse in the senatorial election\nJudge plan to be on top of that\nWhat is a solo alarming about this is as we both know central White House is not just any senator he sits on the Judiciary Committee he was going to be ... or questioning which he did Brett Kavanaugh you ended up questioning him about ... and ... and all this other your book type nonsense but\nThis is not just any senator in if he has some pre arrangement with the reporter such as listen if I come across someone an accuser I'm going to feed it to you and then we're gonna flame up\nThat is basically I mean we don't know this but that is orchestrating a smear campaign against judge Kavanaugh on allegations that he does not know to be true in any way and they should be\nAbsolutely a shame and Grassley should investigate this in two seconds\nAnd I hope the media the media that are truly investigative reporters will jump on this and start asking a Senator Whitehouse these questions because there are all sorts of unanswered questions that need to be asked of him as to why he did this uh what was his thinking\nOr did this man really request that Senator Whitehouse send them to a reporter for some unexplained reason\nAnd let's let's find out what this guy has to say well that's right this this Rhode Island are supposedly who [noise] who came to him and then a recanted or\nA with a day or two of the whole situation and so you know before anybody starts showing any apologies we need some answers to some hard questions that Senator Whitehouse needs to answer\nTo judge Flint is I Know you have a some debates coming up with Senator Whitehouse and again I I'm going to repeat the question\nWho is the reporter that Senator Whitehouse referred this man too and why won't he revealed who the reporter is if this was all on the up and up why won't he reveal who that reporter is why is he hiding the name of this oppose it investigative reporter we have a right to know that\nAnd I don't understand why he won't reveal who it was\nI mean I think I think we can infer why because ah we're going to find out things that are not going to be helpful to us\nWe can infer why because ah we're going to find out things that are not going to be helpful for Senator Whitehouse and ah\nYou know even if it were true which is hard to believe that this uh Rhode Island are etc White House to refer him to some reporter so that the report to do an investigation in addition to or low of the FBI and the Senate\nCommittee why wouldn't Senator Whitehouse do everything in his power to dissuade them from doing that until his allegations can be properly investigated and vetted\nA because otherwise he had was at risk of having his name out there uh and and being embarrassed if it turned out that this was not\nAs a indeed turned out to be not a truthful assertion\nSo even if if what Senator Whitehouse says is so that this man actually asked them to refer to report which which I very much doubt I doubt that uh I think that uh he was at fault for for for not only not sweating actually giving him the name of some\nPresently nameless reporter uh that we need to ask a lot of questions about us to water ranger and so you had was Senator Whitehouse for this type of stuff\nA judge planets as you know Senator Whitehouse he was the Rhode Island us attorney during the nineties or the U.S attorney works with the FBI do we know during that time if anyone alerted him to any crime did he instruct\nThat individual wherever it may be of the crime\nDoesn't matter what it was guns drugs corruption anyway did he instructed individual that he would work with in his office to gather information did he instructed individual that he would use the resources that he has the U.S during the the FBI or would he work for that person to an investigative reporter in the media\nAgain that would be in comprehensible the thing that he would in for any complaining of the sword to the media either in conjunction with or low of working with the proper law enforcement authorities so as I say it's just\nA it's not like he didn't know what to do the obviously didn't send this along to the FBI and to the Senate committee but the business of bringing in a real poor or to do this in my mind could have only one logical purpose and that is to\nAh get get this allegation out there into the media feeding frenzy\nThat's right that was going on to further tarnish a this judge's reputation before the hearings could even begin\nTo it and it did I mean it did reach out into the bit accuser comes forward and then even judge Kavanaugh had to say\nWhen he was very emotional and you know now the me up on boats or an island and the judge Flanders and again folks that ... judgment is I'm not trying to put you on the spot here but for four years Senator Sheldon Whitehouse was the attorney general uh Rhode Island from Nineteen Ninety nine\nTwo uh two thousand two he was elected in the full November of Nineteen Ninety eight\nAs attorney general liberty island is Senator Whitehouse was that some kind of an event or someone contacted him is attorney general and said I have specific information about a crime\nNow as the attorney general of Rhode Island chief law enforcement officer he has the resources of his office he has the resources of the sea police\nAt that time do we know did Sheldon Whitehouse saying I Want you to contact the investigative reporters Eddie the channel ten twelve or the Providence Journal\nWell obviously we don't know that but those those are good questions to ask him because\nWe have every bullied reason to believe is that maybe he has been operating this way all along he needs to a den of pi the reporter in as you said he needs to identify what we see look at why would he do that and even a stepfather judge Flanders even if the man said\nBy the way you have the number of her reporter or the Washington Post the New York times or the New Yorker or whoever it may be\nAs a sitting senator\nOn the Judiciary Committee I Would think that part of behavior and they just supposed to be here to would be that's not the type of information that I'm going to give out I I don't care if the guy said you know can you put me in touch with Lester Holt or you know whoever the hell you want to mention in the news\nWe'll have mayor ... studio also

[laughter]\nIf if you're if you're looking at it appear of people who are qualified she's number one\nOh yes that is that that we're both\nTravesty if if you didn't get the support of of of the city or in\nOur fingers services back let's understand something okay that part of the group that are coming on you got you're putting on some schools remember the some of these people were serving were school teachers\nAnd then you have a seven and served in public service all my life and the military okay if this was years ago tell me last time a school teacher was elected to the school committee can you tell me one time we went bust them sue ...\nSaid forty something that is\nWhy not big why because they ... they got their union people that okay ... with an appointed school committee you could do that and and and and then have to run because the mayor has control and that's changing back to an elected\n\nOkay so so they better be very careful in the ass as to what exactly is going on in this in his whole political race and the situation I maybe there are people I'm supporting that I've only met two times\nHi how are you finding in any people see the good Pearson or I I never followed the school committee meetings I don't know what their conversations I I don't know what the ideology is\n... of of um of that the ... the um\nThe fact of the matter is is that those are the facts are and and I don't understand they they should be round in Iran Ellie just for experience\nYes yes\nIn fact one of them to go jade is if I remember correctly when she was on the school committee and she holds all prisoners she she she worked for the people\nOh definitely like it is yet live oh anyway\nYou know my vote so she's got two votes and heard that three votes we've already and assert lens going to vote for that for in a dream is five and my my family's six seven when she got at least ten votes\nOut at all oh gosh um\nOh I Know we don't count so people can learn a little more 'cause they don't eat in our house ill at the one to one name\nNo you did basically you don't you can bullet you you you can just said you can just over two three one I mean are there are bought\nAn old ... oh my God I Believe many times over the years that show that that's giving somebody to votes okay but\nThe fact of the matter is and that's the problem with some teams because it would become the teams they they run as a team but then they all they don't they go bullet vote [laughter] and then you look at the white guys what happened well why do we know that people come in [laughter]\n[laughter] oh my [laughter] about that I mean let's say ...\nAd out but the but there are some there are some people there's a kid named uh Tom chiefs are that's been very very\nQuiet but I understand he's very qualified and he's dignified and he's got integrity and that's what I understand and of course you could Roger Gillette neither John Ward\nYes he is the\nWhether it gets close up I'll be talking about the people that are about of integrity the from what I Am looking into the people and I'm\nI'm the I'm and I will give I Will give my opinion on on the candidates that that that's all I can do I mean you can vote for anybody you want and I have no problem with that why would I have a problem because I don't want you to tell me how to vote\nBut I'm going to just tell you my experience and and what I've been able to to learn about people and some people that I had the highest some respect\nI've been able to learn about people and some people that I had to hire some respect me for my no respect at all no none\nI mean I have a scary\nIsn't it yes it is scary I mean when you're dealing with phone these you know a ... that's that's life that his life\nI don't know if you can answer this question never mind going wrong ... campaign yep how many you know seeing the phone with me Mavis grants [noise]\nOoh boy he's pretty he's been there a couple of ... a couple of terms I mean in the wrong name I I Would say it's got to be three or four terms I don't know\nSo he could have been in a good nine yes\nWell he's ... he's the city when you're talking about the things that he's says that he's done for Princeton are\nThose things that take place in five minutes um and I but I've never really looked at a flyer on his there'll be honest with you on that he's not they they don't come up in Northern Ireland and the the Republicans um because they it's like talking to the wall you know a\nWeek I asked that and then I'll hang up but that said he he lay tax nine times out of all I don't think that the mayor of aid that tax\nI think they put in that budget that's up to whatever I guess they have a powerful too\nSo I don't think he could have done that and it's all and I was curious if he was the F by nine years to begin with\nOr if that wasn't the case for me to be running ads everywhere so suddenly though it's gotten me time to time nine years I have to be on and on and the time that he's been there if if the if the governor is saying that a few though I mean talk about the kennel calling the kettle black\nWe're up to what what what is the ... what does the budget out what eleven twelve billion or something like that\nAnd look at it a lot of money that's coming in this last federal not something that was a buck and a\nAnd a ... federal aid for the roads and all this money coming in I I really wish that just shows Marco that hung in their funds\nOr pick up on ... jets and I think he did where they're going to go a high as some\nI guess accountants and look at the ... about that because we have twice as many state employees at New Hampshire if I go by and there's no need for that\nNo need for that that's right ah you know that way they can cut the budget somewhat and eventually\nYou know you know it's interesting you would you say ... ... as you I don't know if you're old enough to remember this but at one time Nashua New Hampshire here was the like the sister city of wouldn't soccer\nThey want the same size predominantly French French Canadian ... that type of situation\nAnd I used to go there all the time that's my grandparents were\nAnd I've seen that that plays developed over the time when when all of the type that came to the middle of Massachusetts they would work and mass and go to Nashville okay was tax free\nBut Rhode Island is the same equal different this way okay when socket and they're going they're growing in doing great numbers were going down the tubes\nThe game because they know planning oh heck no vision no ... ... you and you listen\nYou're going to a guy like apple ... coverage the soldiers coverage ... that we have an opportunity to make when socket Rhode Island one of the most focal point of all of New England\nOkay chats shots\nAt it and it's a it's really incredible the city on earth a pipe dream okay well that's an hunted that I'm Sorry okay he's only the mans husband that's a pipe dream that's going nowhere I mean this is crazy\nIt's kind of course have taxpayers and if they want to put their money in there that [laughter] and it's going to impose some buildings at least in downtown a socket I mean why don't you want to go for it\nBecause we live in a bubble up here that's the problem you have a bubble\nI find that a believed that you know it no shots at the taxpayer money if they all down it ... you know of course that's that could be ... there can be up to the city\nThat could be self sufficient sufficient new income coming into the city in tax dollars that the city one sided considering suitably shut down\nA stupid waiting for the plant and pipe it down to strip down the river like they were looking at the connected tobacco blocks on valley in a state would go away for the city and we wouldn't have to worry about being the craft capitals New England\nAnd then I got an email about that about the bench fragments bench about his sister Margaret and it says I thought that when you're a city council president should do things to make the city better it's not a position for self promotion he's doing this for himself not the city I think it's a joke at some Ron\nWell run your your let me say this and I put it on Facebook and I'll say it\nUm last August when he lost his sister and the compensation he told me about it because I lost my sister\nAnd I I said I didn't even know you had a sister and well I won't say that but the uh I don't know how close they were but he didn't indicate backwards and that's that's relevant anyway [noise] um but the um I said well I'll play in our father for is a no no there's no there's not going to be an obit don't play anything\nAnd that was strange\nThat was strange uh the uh because I I could have just said it first name\nAnd and ah but I gave him my sympathies and uh uh sorry about that and that's the end of it the bench the globe boxing is ah as far as the rumor on the street from the very beginning was um\nThe flip the that's how they got to go with the with the budget vetoes okay and and I guess if you really care about your sister and you want to do that may be at the time to flip\nOkay that's a decision that he had to make if in fact that is true okay um\nAnd I don't believe that what the W O and was doing the broadcasting they're airing them I don't believe there's probably anyone at the board because Dave lives upstairs and if there's a problem with the transmission he just runs on stairs and works on at the very talented engineer okay\nUm I happen to listen to the radio or because I Am able to listen to the radio and watch Fox News at the same time with the uh the words on us you know one of the silent so I can read them\nAnd um so so I'm going to miss that so I'm doing it because I'm not happy [laughter] okay [laughter] uh\nAnd is the decision to eliminate many seniors who don't ask computers even cell phones and now have been totally shut out and even people who have\nTelevisions and you watch channel Seventeen I on Cox if you only have one television and you and your husband wants all you want to uh watch jeopardy and yet you know your wife wants to watch uh the council meeting all of\nThat's going to be an interesting conversation [laughter] the wherever ... the way it's going to win whatever\nOkay um let me see [noise] uh\nAnd I talked about our show evidence of a couple of\nItems like that and then I said name one station one station that was signed fifty thousand dollars for using that word all over the airwaves especially a thousand watch station name one just one okay and they feel that the name one\nI may have a right to the FCC to get that answer okay and uh basically\nI told him I said um take the high road the one who has been given these consider airing it'd be so people could listen okay I said I Know it won't happen but once you get into the battle which includes being a hero in sometimes yes a coward that's a decision you make\nOkay is this is what are you this is what he wrote back thanks to the reading John I've always considered you a remarkable person but we disagree days\n[laughter] okay [laughter]\nAnd out of the data the other side of the ... but even with that\n... even with that uh that uh I Would if the city if they have to pay somebody to monitor the boards then I think the city council should consider that a and it would not be a lot of money\nOkay ah because all the person is always sitting there\nAnd I'm able to puts the minimum wage\nA lot of kids would do that\nBut it's good but it it\nIt's a ... and the only time you have to be concern is when there's no you're not you're not going to be concerned with Jan gender and talking Chris do are talking about John a decent home talking done\nWell a mayor leaving them there talking to you and she said a buffoon uh that's about the worst thing she's done and and uh\nI I Can't think of another council person and and by the way I like politifact and in that I think that was a he is he's he's lost it or they'll be honest with you or that the way he's been talking and uh it really really incredible uh\n... and then he was talking about the um on the show last week when he was on and I I never got to read this and I'm about the fiscal Nineteen dodge it in such a hero was saving the taxpayers money [noise] uh but the the email I got\nSaid he shouldn't listen to the people talking about next year deficit of three million\nOkay he does not address that\nWhat are you going what are you going to do with them three million dollar deficit that this budget is created\nAnd then you put two and seven or Ninety thousand dollars back on the budget Richard you don't know what the hell you're doing\nYou're totally lost concept of why you ran\nAnd then you want to know why people are upset and I don't understand how your your lawyer followers who followed you are based on your mandate and you just flip the hundred hundred degrees I mean ... this is ridiculous uh but they have a right to be a the ... the the\n... poll items lifted up keep the free point two billion dollars and we get three hundred thousand dollars pilots from the states for a non profit hospital then that last is two point nine million mystified meant but he doesn't want to deal with that problem oh so just let him off the hook\nDon't reelect him to the council\nAgreement that emailer get after when you're on the air\nI Would take the three million dollars to fill that none of us saw Platt but not in the valley appointed someplace\nTry how you doing yeah ... you're going to put up all the way up the hill\nJohn reason I'm calling is original name of the wastewater plant was filters feels\nWay back when it was what it was named filters feels filters field yes okay\nMy focus to you can look that up anyway that was the name of the sewer plant joke back in the early seventies by what socket\nHe has Blackstone Bellingham in North Smithfield that's a problem there but the biggest problem is is a ... they like I said they used to have to take care of blacks old boss Mitt feel and Boeing half what they\nDo they go out of the city hall this stuff back in from other places you know what I mean that's a problem that it's not it's not only take it like a those taking care of those three towns but the hall from out of town all shoulder\nComing from the Cape overnight and was coming up\nThat's a problem and I guess nobody ever stop them you know but anyway ...\nBy them doing that ... they're they're they're paying extra money to the city ...\nYes but what are they doing to the city they're bringing that stench at all so\nOnce I got to do it you're the one thing to do with that money has money in this city ...\n... what twenty dollar bill [laughter]\nBut anyways you know the name of the place was called filters feels way back to my side for the city\nBack in his sixties that's what it was Phil just feels yes you know the the wick is over there were able to they used to have a God's over their job is a plant tomatoes and all that there are still they built a secondary wastewater plant\nYou know when they were for was ... was forced to do that by the federal government the waste water with a\nTape I Know I was on the council okay or had a horse in with that thing I\nThat that whole situation there and a\nOf the book they gave us was eight eight inches by a high I think we want to by bus or they took us in a way that um it was when we were part of the uh after ... after the decision not during the decision and um but the um\nIt it the problem with that and if you covered the tanks would have been ... you know it'd be even worse and then once you're covered them you have to have some planning to ... to take care of the uh the the weather it's called methane or something so that if I\nMet methane which is which is a a a poisonous gas while we\nYou know there was something something that would be building up I guess I didn't want to\nExactly because he is a go back in the sixties or early fifties there was a building that did explode over there a brick building that explains why I think we've talked to work has got killed\nIn when soccer yeah yeah that's way back to the methane gas build up in a brick building and exploded killing to work is\nThis is the past seven to zero and vote once but twice okay this is my legislation [laughter] and then and then the other one he said last night about this attorney thing he said\nWe hired this this uh the Jerry oh because it's a school of poverty that high it I'm not the city\nOkay and\nDo some all told me that any why he's not going to lie to me well let me ask you something where'd you appointment letter\nMissed a fragment or from the from the school committee hiring like can you can you can you send me a copy of that\nOkay\nThat person was hired by these Simone\nHe's nothing to do with the school committee\n[laughter] [laughter]\nThe Skokie but he had a lawyer [noise] but it was on that lawyer why couldn't she represent the school committee\n\nIt you know what sometimes it's really incredible um I'll say this\nThe old school too many the old city council you used to be very boring they used to last a while I was\nBorn on me two hours budget time we'd go big time 'cause we used to go page by page so people listening to understand and back and forth and be confident would would have a say in whatever they want to amend and it it take a while okay that have midnight we probably would go to\nA hundred leaders brought in our dogs and coffee and and just do that now we have to live with a clock right afterwards\nI'm tired I gotta go\n[laughter] well I don't get on the council just stay home okay that's ridiculous that's so funny it is it is funny okay [laughter] we can will judge to another night [laughter] okay [laughter] it's incredible it really is incredible\nIf they if the does it end by the way anyone that goes back many years ago\nOn previous city councils and on and legislation seven ... never taught in on on why they're voting this and a couple of ... talk\nAnd and on and why they're voting this and a couple of would talk and then he would vote yes so now when you vote yes isn't that tell me you supported it\nI don't have to listen to you for five minutes after a while you're doing it\nI mean it's it's on the beat the basic premise of what you're voting on\nOkay I'm voting to put a stop sign and such and such a street or you have to explain to me Fifteen minutes why you know when you put your eye assume it's pretty good reason to do it you got an OK from the uh an an opinion from the traffic division [laughter]\nThat's incredible\nThose meetings that should be cutting the half\nAt the at the least by the way a but with the at the table we have now it's it's [laughter] it's a credible not not you know you have faggot that'd be meeting with what he wrote to read some letter last night\nSome some lady about uh about a Jim ...\nAnd I'm I'm not supplied ... was was not there because I Know why or\nWhy would possibly could not be there and um and set a table

about that\nBut I Know alley work with special needs kids that go talk I Know that she worked one on one of which is an extremely difficult and very um\nDifficult job for anybody on a daily basis or if you're talking about when she was on the school committee\nOr\nI don't know why you'd be battling with a a school committee person because they have nothing to do with it\nOr they are they're professionals within the school system that deal with that if a special needs kids\nNecessary services uh because I'm ... Becker my granddaughter gets some services from the when soccer the dictation department or from the city and and um but my daughter Liz a dummy which go for many people\n\nSo uh I'm Sorry you feel that way about Eli but I'm sure that you she's a there are people are going to vote for for many reasons Arab people gonna vote for her because they think she'll be good for the city\nOkay that's what it comes down to and doing a job in protecting the tax payers that's when it comes down to a\nWar on a council meeting\nI agree to say she paid a radio station if they need that broadcasted also should they have Jacob video streaming online\nI I don't know if if he I don't know if a\n\nIf Jacob video countrymen on line\nTo be honest with you but\nUh but to me I Believe that are based on my discussions with people that there are a lot of people that listen to radio\nUh and um\nThey may have only one tells you you're going to home and someone else is watching something else or does it doesn't care about it um\nI like to put it on caption and watch watch uh normally Fox News needless to say that touch with the cabinet thing and um\nAnd I I listen to radio costs when when uh when Debbie one her I was on how you saw on the W. gone awry and um and then when I decided not to broadcast I went to oh when\nUh\nI don't know how many other people do that but I Know I Do and ah so ah ... last night um I had to switch roads that my wife [laughter]\nOr that that makes absolutely no sense to me that that that that is that is vulgar you can't get any more vulgar than I think that\nThe you know people got a line and I\nYou you can get mad about using the word family but you know where they are\nRight you know what'd you say privately that somebody is one thing when you put it out with thousands of people are being shared and reading this in in every other word is this word that word I mean you you can be tough on them and blast them without using swear words as far as I'm concerned\nAh most of the house and it's All right [laughter]\n[laughter] anyway\nIt it seems like it um the feed is doing good um that I that I as I watch it when I get home I'm Elle as some people say well the lion that some people don't realize that when I use my own\nA tablet and I do that I put my body and all the way so if you are on your phone or I can feel that you have to regulate that out of the volume\nSo you know that people have got to be alive but I Know what the one that was great was when problems today what had to go away\nAny that I left the top of that that I thought of all that stuff thrown out of line I don't I like the south probably sat in his hotel well any ... that it was great\nSo you know let Phil and Phil's laugh at it you know I'm Still working at it so I I Love to hear other people's input that I Would love it if they said it I asked our lab as I\nAs somebody out there fear of using the feed last night sent me an email playing thank you\nThat that thank you very much take care of bubble girl already but I could buy\nA email last night I was confused or Richard\nFeynman talked about a Pandora's box in his legislation Benny question real estate transactions by the same person\nYou know what point was was about the real estate transactions it sounded like he didn't understand themselves and it was during the dirty work I presume for the fourth floor [noise]\nI didn't know we mentioned the name\nOf a person are you telling me that all these properties was owned by one person\nIn somebody was the dilemma legislation I'm In the ... the from the fourth floor is is that why they said that starting from scratch\nInteresting\nSo sometimes you know sometimes the the messages right before his eyes and he doesn't see it\nAnd um but I ... I'm Sorry I heard them talking about who he read this ah talking about it but I really wasn't really paying attention to him and said the honest with you\nBecause I'm most of the time he's posturing political or for votes and not for government\nA button that question I'm Sorry this is somebody out there a who was that one person they don't all these these properties that it's all gonna use that term mean one person ... as\nA\n\nKid I Know when you mentioned one that that somebody so for so many hundreds of thousands of dollars but it was only worth half of that well let me tell you something most people go to the bank can borrow the days are going to able to buy something somebody doing appraisal on that\nOn a\nSewing he did have you made sense of humor that makes sense to me and maybe a new glare find somebody can clarify it did he mentioned a developer they don't all those room announces that he said that they were trying to delay it\nA with a new legislation why would somebody do not want to or\nAny anybody that's by the way any personal buying into real estate agent it certainly would know that legislation is being discussed regarding ruin else's\nUm and it was for the safety end of it\n[noise] [laughter]\nWhy was that the why or why he objected to that that workshop the the only reason that that had been delayed months and months was because of him he could have brought it up anytime he wanted the delay was all the time is a prominent those writing it for him\nSee that's the problem when you when you're you're has something to do something and you're not running it yourself then you're at the mercy of that that department okay and and I I I'm not certainly questioning his motive on a on the legislation\nI'm not certainly questioning his motives on a on the legislation\nBut the position they took was unbelievable my opinion anyway and maybe you have good email today coming in um [noise]\nThat anybody last night lights that is what he said besides than the mayor wasn't there again she's not stupid okay and she didn't even have ... you know there\nAre [noise] I saw a trolley was there and are asking question um\nI don't understand even I didn't even understand child he because he said\nThat the whole building wasn't handicap accessible I I don't you telling me that if I'm going to broadcast booth or Fifteen feet off the up to the second floor that after ...\n... if I've got a um I'm selling 'em a storage or I don't know what's in that building or or if it's if it's a place that they sell a ice cream and stuff I've never really looked at it to be honest with you that doesn't have to be handicap accessible does it\nA next time I see jolly whether that'd be just morning I'm\nBut I'm going to find out I'm Charlie if he's listening maybe you can call 'em on that when he was referring to the bathroom as we know based on ... I got this one um\n... maybe ... the state that has you know is that they were making the the one that one bathroom and I guess they weren't happy with that uh but they they probably could not make it handicapper says a little too\nUm\nThat's the way I understood it and I think all he was doing going to the pot was trying to determine if in fact that it had been done\nOkay or is this still if they're not using her while it should've been done because with on a ... coming that could be a bathroom that could be a festival the people in addition to the other bathrooms\nOr email a Johnny did

different if we didn't have the space near the high school but we've got this gigantic pocket and all is vacant land or why not utilize it and I still I I I Would still hope the city would actively seek some professional advice from somebody outside the community\nProfessional advice from somebody outside the community or who isn't prejudice down this particular case and find out if in fact we we could sell Barry field I mean I\nI to me we need to look into that that huge empty possible sitting there on the edge of the city a very valuable piece of real estate if and I'm saying if maybe

some nice new listings that I Want to share with you folks and uh we talk about things that are going on in the economy and the housing industry\nAnd are just some observations that may be timely um they might find interesting little bit about me I'm here every week I work at ... preferred in North Providence or somebody you can see behind may have the ... balloon if you're watching on Facebook Live because of course you can hear the show on\nWWE and our I Ninety five point one or Ninety nine point nine FM Thirteen eighty I Am and you can watch me on Facebook Live just friend me on Facebook at the job Luca\nAnd then we'll be able to watch me and to see what I look like every week\nSo we have a lot of things that we talk about um most of my business is in northern Rhode Island in southern Massachusetts and I represent buyers and sellers\nAnd despite what you may have heard in the media and the business channels recently we still need more sellers okay we've had a little bit more inventory come on the market so there's been a little bit of a a pull back on the pressure pushing prices higher\nWhich is not a bad thing it is still a seller's market we do not watch prices being pushed high out of the reach of too many buyers because what you want to have is a little bit of a balancing act so that you can see\nSo the buyers can find houses and their within their price range okay\nIf they get pushed up too high higher than incomes are increasing buyers and not going to be able to buy these homes All right\nI Want to say hello to a friend a couple of friends of mine that are watching on Facebook Live my clients ought to step in Stephanie Rice and her husband works for one of our sponsors green home solutions my friend Carmella is watching hello as well as merely Herrera hello to all of my friends on Facebook\nUm if you have any questions and you are watching on Facebook you can certainly\nSending a message and I'll answer it live on the air\nSo we getting back to my point prices are going up they're not getting pushed too high a right as you know the men if you'd probably do know the fed raise interest rates last friday so we're a little bit higher than we've been\nHowever those we listen to the show no that we are well below the historic average for thirty year fixed rate mortgage that rate is eight percent right now we are still in the for as

watching us on Facebook Live so we're talking about what's going on in the market we've had a little bit more inventory command rates have gone up a little bit\nThese are not a bad thing because\nCome on rates have gone up a little bit these are not a bad thing because one thing that rainy remains consistent is demand wise demand consistent because we have this ... this millennial generation\nThe largest generation out there that has lots of buyers who are buying homes and despite\nMy term that a lot of the millennials get from some folks these millennials are actually physically savvy and and as evidence to support that state and millennials actually had been putting off their home purchases by as much as seven years\nIt's impossible for an average person to know as much as a realtor because that's all we do we work with virus so if I was looking for so we can tell a seller this is what you need to do to your home to prepare for sale so that the buyers who are looking will like your house\nHopefully pay top dollar for the exact cheaper to fix it then instead of when a nearby or comes in and ask for repairs right right\nExactly you know some of the time but I Try to do actually is get my clients to have a um a pre listing home inspection\nThat way they know okay this is what the home inspector is going to find they can take care of those and then when you have a buyer come in death actually selling points they have the here we already have a home inspection it was just completed and here are the receipts to repair everything that the home inspector said needed attention\nAll right um you know one thing I Want to point out to again since we're talking about real terrorists in and getting advice from you know if you're looking for advice on\nIt's impossible\nTo really learn everything that you need to learn\nA national website even when they're given your values again it's only a it's an estimation\nOkay and and you know there's a website national website that begins with Z and the the way they calculate price estimate is almost in their name so or in the tournament they use that marketing term so you get those numbers those values are good for you know\nKind of cocktail hour talk wages to cocktail party talk with you know chewing the fad say oh my house came in value to this or that but if you really need to know him you know what your home is worth\nYou need to talk to a local experience realtor because again those Web sites and not going to know that oh yeah there's a new development going down the road is going to pull the value of my house up by five or ten percent if you're talking to three hundred thousand dollar house that could be Fifteen or thirty thousand dollars so these are real dollars that we're talking about here\nYou know or if they're going to be putting a new round about and that's going to adversely affect my property values because my house to house sit here and uh but the back yard but that round\nYou know um these are the things that the national website are not going to be able to qualify nor quantify\nFor you but a local realtor will and they will also be able to point out that you know what that\nTo bite my actual roundabout may actually enhance the value of your house because now it's not going to be a lot of traffic backed up near your home\nI was gonna ask what do you think the value of the roundabouts a couple of minutes\nOf it for those of you that that are not aware of where and become really where John and I lived there is um they're going to be putting roundabouts in off of a route to Ninety five which is an interstate highway\nIsland and um you know the way it is right now we do not have a roundabout and when you're getting off the highway on the exit ramp on friday night ... backed up onto the travel lane of the highway\nRight um so if the it it's somewhat of a hazard okay when the cars backed up that far and takes a long time to get off the highway so if you're trying to get someplace quickly it kind of a pain\nIn the ... about his minerals bringing up it's going to\nGet that that is true exactly that it it is because now of course getting off the highway is bad and then the actual you know the conduit to hide the rover one fourteen that's all backed up in both directions so it's very frustrating to the ideas are going to put these roundabouts in which I personally believe is a good idea is going to facilitate and ease the backup\nAnd also around about actually reduced if you look at the statistics roundabouts reduce the number of traffic fatalities people getting hit by cars and that we had a number of accidents so round about what's nice is they slow the traffic down\nBut they don't stop it okay so it can continually move\nOkay so I think it's going to be a good thing and and the big picture view from ten thousand feet it's going to be good I don't know if they're going to be properties that you know it's actually a but\nWhere the roundabouts are and it's going to determine be determined by how everything is landscapes and I haven't seen that\nPortion of the Sunni throwing lands\nBut I think for the town of crumbling as a whole I think the roundabout you going to be a good thing ... is always a good thing you have less ... less ... less accidents because of course the more accidents there are if you live in town now everybody's insurance goes up because there are more accidents so you know it just it it's good all around to um\nI think to have a the roundabouts there and it will of course if the traffic flows better it's better for the businesses like my friend Sean Hogan who's business for Israel\nIt's better it's better for the businesses\nLike my friend Sean Hogan who's business is right there in the middle of things his office you know if he if he's trying to get out of his officers someone's trying to go in and they can't get in because of all the traffic that could be detrimental to your success as a business owner\nYou know at least is yoga studio there there's a hair salon or a nail salon to do is J's deli yeah these are all businesses that could be adversely impacted by having traffic backed up in front of their business and people can't get in get out of your parking lot with relative ease\nYou know and they're literally been scientific studies done showing how long people will tolerate waiting in order to get into a parking lot so that those ... issues are\nSignificant okay um and if he you know you're renting space for your business your overhead stays the same whether you have cars coming in nice and easy to go to your business by your sandwiches or not or or they don't they just continue to go a little bit further down the road\nOr avoid the area altogether around about that is something again that could positively or negatively impact\nA community and home values and if you're working with a Web site\nYou're not going to find out about that because if you see something on a national website and then you go to the house and you're talking to the owner who's selling the home him or herself they're certainly not going to a point that out to you because they're looking out for their own best interest and us a buyer would have no one's looking out for your best interest in the largest financial transaction of your life\nSo these are the things again why it's important to work with a full time experienced realtor\nBecause we have the experience we had a code of ethics that we have to apply with a comply with and um give you a good surface that's you know I tell my client I work for you it's not about me it's about you Mr Mrs by Mr Mrs seller\nIt's all about you and then what you want me to do with what else to\nFolks are listening to the joker real estate show\nWe're here every Tuesday evening on W. N. R. I. Ninety five point one or Ninety nine point nine FM and Thirteen eight and ...\nYou can also find me on Facebook Live friendly and faced with that you can watch my show there we're here with our sponsor and special guests and trying to capitalize on right now John do better on first home mortgage giant has been a sponsor of the show from the get go\nVery fortunate to have John as a sponsor we're fortunate to have a job as a defender that I can work with and refer clients too and he takes good care of them was and he was also good about John is he is asked\nAn ethical so he likes if there's someone who needs to have some work done on their credit report it before they can comply with a mortgage he'll tell them that and he'll help them\nAlong the way to prepare themselves to uh\nBe ready for mortgage or get a mortgage out a better rate right John\nSay that's a great feeling to have one um somebody does need a lot of work a lot of times people aren't taught credit I'm going through school\nSo when they come to me I mentioned that they they really wish that did happen and so uh you know sometimes it's just a couple of quick things sometimes it takes as well as long as a year or so when they come back to the next year and they're ready to go\nAnd then there a couple of months later the getting the kids that that's such a a great feeling to have when you're helping out a client that never knew any better right and they're getting their keys and buying a house and still continuing to work on building a financial\nUm portfolio of real estate and other things\nYeah and and now I Want to say hello to my friend Justin Conrad is another loan officer who gave judges will be gave Johnson props a thing you know a great at custom tailoring loans to clients needs of their ... and ... and that's what it's all about because\nWe need to I Taylor my services to my buyers to my sellers if I had a buyer who if it's a young couple looking to buy their first home maybe a two or three bedroom house and the\nTwo hundred and fifty thousand dollar price range they're going to have different needs\nThan let's say a fifty five plus\nSeller or by our market both you know they want to sell a bigger house and they want to buy another house it's going to they'll be able to age in place in that new Thomas file\nThis is going to be impacted as to whether they have any any uh chronic diseases progressive diseases just you know or just aging in a helpful matter\nThose customers are going to have very different needs\nAll right I Want to say hello to my friend ... he's watching us on Facebook Live I've met is actually he was first a a more first he is a business guy to might have commercial real estate client and he is a great entrepreneur not a Native American and he just owns businesses and takes care of his clients and that's a\nGreat car washes got a great pizza and sandwich place in Providence on mystery ...\nShould check it out and my friend Rick but she could just checked into on Facebook Live below Rick [noise]\nAh so folks if you are thinking about buying a home\nWant to give a reel to reel to recall I of course you can give me a call at four O. one five eight zero nine seven nine seven that is my cell phone you can also text me if that number that are quicker response via text [noise] um\nAfter we meet\nI Will refer you to whoever it is if you're a buyer over for you to John Doe back to get three approved for mortgage because that's the first thing you need to do it's so competitive today you need to put your best foot forward when you have\nA buyer as a seller okay\nThat I'm thinking over hurdles so that's that's how I Do with it yeah yeah exactly it and they were always always obstacles in it's just it's almost like when you have I Want to see what my friend Courtney\n... king she just tuned in on Facebook Live or she is a colleague of John's but um there there are always things that come along and sometimes you get a transaction and it seems like it's easy easy things are just smooth sailing\nAnd then something comes up and then also because everybody thought it was going to be smooth sailing now the client the buyer and seller they start to get really nervous\nBecause they didn't think they're going to have any bumps in the road\nWhereas if you have a fulltime experience realtor like myself where a lot of my colleagues like my friend ... like a you know my friend key to all these other relatives who tune in Jason Joe few so who watch the job that the real estate show every week um we know how to\nNavigate those choppy waters we know how to sail over the choppy seas of\nHome transactions of buying and selling homes\nAll right and I'm sure John what's\nIt what if some of the crazy situation that you've encountered from outer limits relations\nYeah so um let's see\nRight now I have a house trying to go up against um it's a U.S steel roll development on on great products for those that can use it\nUm the well that was built in Nineteen hundred while is only three feet away from the road oh my God and so therefore typical middle hug standards said that the well has to be always ten feet away from the road right so I'm right now we're just waiting for the appraisal to come in for us when we go to a heads up that this might be an issue on them\nAnd so we're actually going to be preparing the report in my senior underwriting management team is going to be going directly to USDA\nTo try to get an exception on us and if not that is once again where you gonna have hurdles but then you have to look at the other options there what's the next best way to help that person get over that hurdle whenever I sit down with a client of the um the ... we went to different loan options of that time as well or if something happens with this as the government backed loan\nWhat's the next backs option right and so you know fortunately we know that this homebuyer can go with a three percent down conventional through home possible there's a couple different ways to um strategize with the mortgage insurance or fortunately Rhode Island housing does a conventional loan\nThrough um that does one hundred percent financing as well and so therefore we have a couple of different hurdles a couple different options to jump over that hurdle and gets that closing table so um that the number one step is to try to jump over that hurdle without point out one of those extra tools but we know that it's they're necessary\nRight and that's it I Want to point out that why working with someone like John or some of the other lenders who watch the show every week on Facebook want to see a lot of my cousin John who just tuned in and my and I read about core buffalo Rita I'm is that when you you know if you just go into\nA big bank okay one of these national banks and they're only going to offer you the mortgage programs that they have it's like if you go into a a Chevy dealer and you want to buy a model if they don't have they're going to tell you they don't have a car for you\nAnd they're gonna try and sell you something else that you don't want or are you going to go home without a car\nBut if you go into a deal or they can sell you any car\nYou know foreign import I mean a foreign or domestic car truck sports car whatever you're going to have a better chance of going home with the car same thing when you're shopping for a mortgage John is aware of a lot of different programs\nThat a conventional bank is not going to have\nThey're not going to have that type of a variety and mortgage products you know a lot of folks especially a lot of ... millennials want to say hello to Christine ... a really good realtor from home smart and my buddy routes Bello from ... in my home office um\nHello guys are on Facebook Live checking us out or so you know it's important that you find the best mortgage product for you\nYou know John mentioned USDA USDA VA essay chase Freddie Mac I mean the officers conventional and then there are all different variations hybrids mortgages jumble more they were all kinds of mortgages and one size that does not fit all but if you go to one to him or a lender\nAnd all they sell is one kind of a mortgage\nIf they can't get it if you don't conform to what they're offering they're going to say you don't qualify for mortgage they're not going to say oh we don't have a mortgage for you go go see John I go see this when I go see that one\nThey want to sell you what they have an otherwise that's tough luck\nThat's a great point a lot of times when I Am the lender that's getting a second opinion because a lot of times people will go they hear all the stuff from the online banks and everything they come to me with just they read your F ha alone pre approval of ha alone is nice it's three and a half percent down they'll go down to a five eighty credit scores sometimes even lower\nThey'll help people get approved for more money but at the same time too that's not always the best on products for somebody\nWith F. ha ones are typically putting 'em they're paying private mortgage insurance for the way for the whole Thirty years if you're not putting up ... percent down\nSo a lotta times I'll look at that with the client and we'll look at the different options was going with a conventional war where they put down three percent and sometimes even have she promoted insurance depending on their credit score\nAnd then on top of that that they're more districts will eventually go away\nRight so that's always a better product but sometimes that's a tighter threshold to put somebody into\nTo where it maybe it's just easier to close the one with the regular ... mothers online monitors and big banks if the woman doesn't work like I said that well situation that's popping up a lot of times they won't Rother says it and try to figure out another way to get around it they'll just say sorry we can help you go to the issue of denial based on the program\nAnd they'll just move on so that that's a big thing that I see happens that's why a lot of whistling agents won't typically except in a pre Peru water from an online lender\nYeah and you know that's I think you mentioned something with those you know national companies and they make it very easy\nTo apply for a mortgage and they have you know there's one mortgage company they have an app and their name sounds like a space in a spaceship type of thing um and that's a great way to really you in to get you to\nGo for that mortgage but you need to have like an eight hundred credit score with no debt and you need to make like two hundred fifty thousand bucks a year they don't tell you that on a commercial everybody apply any real humid and they tell you oh because now they have your information\nThey have your either your contact information the whole purpose of that commercials just to get you to call or email them or text them and the thing is a lotta times to service if they're talking about what we do this and that and that\nAll of the lenders do that there are a lot of programs debates trumpet and these national advertising campaigns that any local lender around here any mortgage person around here\nDoes every day of the week and they've been doing it for years\nYou know those national companies that have their own apps you know to get you to apply for mortgage that advertised on the football\nIt's that have their own apps you know to get you to apply for a mortgage that advertise on the football during football games um they make it sound like they're the only only wants to do that okay they're not a lot of people do that [noise] um so you want you want to work with someone local because again they're going to know what is the best loan for you\nYou know just like the real terrorists going to ask lots of questions I asked my buyers ship Cartier\nA low um I asked my buyers if it's if someone who is looking to buy a home I ask a lot of questions to find out exactly what they're looking for and then I go out and I represent them represent their best interest when talking to the seller where the sellers agent so it makes a lot of sense\nTo work with a local realtor to work with a local lender\nYou know to work with a reputable professional ensured a\nMoving company a good closing eternity\nYou know as a realtor I'm kind of like the hub of the wheel and then I have the spokes to go out to all these vendors who are good in that attack could because they are they're friends of mine that I liked him which that's part of it but they're good because they take care of my clients and it's all about my clients if you're selling a home buying a home\nDoing both I take care of you I go to battle and fight for you to get the best deal\nFor you I take care of you\nRight and that's why you should do that if you're selling a home it makes a lot of sense to work with a real to because I've got all the forms that are going to save you aggravation I Know all the things you need to work look out for so you don't get exposed to unnecessary liability\nAll right and we're actually coming up it's almost ten of the hour there a couple of other things I Want to talk about\nSome of the shift gears quickly Okay John and I've been talking about the interest rates and what's going on in the market you know we recently had some a tragedy happened here and one socket where there was a home there was a murder suicide and that's very tragic and unfortunate and\nWe were talking well how does that potentially\nImpact the value of the home okay so if if I if I have all this thing out of home where there was a murder suicide how do I talk about that what do I do as the lifting agent do I disclosed that do I not disclose it well\nI talk with whoever it is that is the seller okay if it's an individual or a family or\nThey are my client and I have to do what they wish though if they say Joe don't tell anyone that there was a murder suicide in this house", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Woonsocket", "day": "02"}
