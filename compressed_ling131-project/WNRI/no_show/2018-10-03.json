very very well don't settle\n\nOn that and\nWhile I say that it's a very scary time for young men in America when you hear me I don't think that you may not be guilty are\nVery very very difficult time\nWhat's happening here has much more to do that even the appointment of a Supreme Court judge\nYou're going to be somebody that was her entire life had somebody here you don't say\nThat there are

K. R. I. [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nWell said John good morning to um to our listeners hear high\nHigh high I I have to say I was sharing a McCain state or federal out Trump's family um I Am a tax\nLaw okay\nNo though as I understand the wording though they were using loopholes as opposed to\nYou know okay I was a partner in a partnership and I was a partner for the purposes of taxes and I decided to actually do the taxes by itself okay so I tend to taxes myself and then it was some section where I got a way\nA way to be\nIn no matter what truck torturing the cable you know when you know which way to do it that way\nI get a letter from what kind of find you were going to do this job sometime in jail but you could just tell me so I get maybe next year I did it again nothing to do the same way hey next year pay their job to do it they\nGet way in the first time next year\nThey did it waking him up here I think our complaint saying they're supposed to do it the other way I read some of the section and the fact that she'll lay eggs well ship yo yo well hey\nYou know I mean you know well hey you well bio attack so how did you did I get every funny because it's below it affects you contradict each other you can't do taxes when\nI actually saw so many companies oh\nOK relax the second is that we can get our audience involved in understanding the discussion that is why you and why John and Roger and Donald Trump and Donald Trump's on that's why we hire\nCPAs and we want to see in the tax code if in fact uh there's something in there that um may be advantageous to us but to make this this argument even easier to understand that's why we hire lawyers\nWhen we go to court because we're looking for an attorney that may be able to uh say get us I'm not the the uh maybe first of all ... get us not convicted but if we get convicted of something maybe not as strong a penalty so that's why we hire professionals to do things\nAnd so that's why the CNN News story which went on for forty five minutes last night was a immaterial in irrelevant\nTo me and most of the American people and\nYour mind oh come on let's let let me comment on that if I may are you there\nI certainly am listening to you know\nWhat you can in everything in it and your wife protests why it one way where you could have done the other way but the bottom line is going to go to ... to ... to each other and I\nBut I Can't read the statute that's why I hire a professional to do it I don't understand them\nJoin you can clearly see girls when I when each other that's why we're taxed temples cash and some of that what's gotten rid of a section where you can read what legal expert to read where one thinks it still asking him\nAnd if you do this on one side you're what section so why don't you make why you went back on the bottom line is we have to come up\nAnd it set up to January in a way one of the biggest problem we had in this country at a lot of people do it a lot of people are sick and tired of it at the tri state filings well of course that was set up that way she I think it's\nWrong it's like like there's\nOnly a court fight for the for this it's a tight almost double jeopardy it didn't work for what you have if you if you will you automatically by white parents don't want to which way you turn your broke\nAnd that shouldn't happen when you have a war damage\nThank you for your call oh by All right he's all worked up I'm Brian us close to remind listeners and we did at the\nTop of on newscast today that if you're a cell phone starts going crazy or yeah your device so that is a attest to the emergency I guess you'd call it wireless system so that'll happen around between two and three this afternoon on the phone near you are you ready for that phone to go ringing John\nWhatever it is and you know rattling his papers around that he brings to the meetings I Want it ... I don't want it ... maybe clarifying listen closely to what people say that\nThat's what that's like that's why they always say that uh there's a reason we have to weigh as one mouth right\nThere ... paper is not said thank you very much have a great Dane and great ah Saddam best we can do by by by and\n... what is your remark\nOr on the front program here on WWE and I'll ride those guy in the studio here with me\nIs Mr John Gregory CEO Northern Ireland chamber of commerce I'm Roger ... we're talking about some of the issues of the day topic number two for a Roger this is a chamber of commerce topic in my opinion\nUh and it has to do with a piece of legislation that the Senate president a dominant ... wants to introduce\nAnd it has to do with a maybe a piece of state legislation overriding local control in this has to do with the\nProposal for downtown office buildings skyscraper development for Providence and of course there's been a lot of local internal Providence politics that is kind of delayed a this construction\nAnd then there's the dominant grudge aerial represents the trade industries in his uh showy private life and this is a big\nBoy he did he's out it doesn't anymore\nUh-huh he doesn't ... these retired okay I didn't know that like you are and I'll Try to remember that new so anyway he certainly has a\nShall we say a friendly feeling toward the construction industry which would benefit greatly from a big building project like this so I think I'm the kind of setting the the the tone here\nAbout the whole concept of whether I'm a municipal a municipality should be over written by the state for the good of the state because from Rogers point of view of big multi story office building in downtown Providence is good for everybody including the membership of the Northern Ireland chamber of commerce you Ron okay\nWell actually it's not downtown Providence and that's where it gets a little bit more complex it's the one Ninety four I live\nI still find that Robin in Rhode Island it's gonna be ... ...\nYeah except the state owns the when this is not city own land or whatever but it would have stayed on land and it does get a little complex I think again that uh\nUh and and the put it in context if I'm not mistaken when he made those comments Monday Night it's what Island Public expenditure councils dinner or he also used in in reference to uh what happened to talk and in the last of the ... and a\nAnd didn't want to see that continue to happen and he bought the perhaps of prominence a and I think I'm I'm right I'm speaking from memory now and we both know what happens we get older with with memory but by then but in essence a this is this the proposed famed our I guess mhm\nAnd um I don't know it it it is it is interesting because 'cause right eye ... eye or asking the locals to\nAh to give up control even though it stayed on land\nI'm On a I'm not sure I I Know there is a there certainly is an affinity from him because of his previous occupation ah towards helping those and construction uh we'd like to see more construction or let's say you know like say a lot more cranes in in in the sky in every city in ... in the state of Rhode Island\nWho saw our construction industry has has been hit a tremendously\nAh we're seeing a lot of insight to come back a little bit but the bigger issue again is is how much control should the state have a little local issues and that that is of interest 'em too often I haven't\nHad a chance to talk to any state senators or to a or to a down it was just going to be Senate president the jury I Will will will will give him his his his type one I've known I've known him for a long long time but um so it it it's interesting\nWell as a chamber of member two times over yeah different ways [noise]\nUm I think it was a chamber issue what is I think it's a state issue of what happens in Providence whether you think is similar to me when somebody is driving a Ninety five they are going to see that if that building is up there they're going to see that as part of the Providence Rhode Island skyline\nRight yeah and and and so it's a matter of whether first of all they do that except just because of guidelines that are in place already as far as the height of from what I understand and I guess the uh the um design is somewhat controversial um and so they're going to be people\nUh you know I mean for example there are some people who say\nWe should never knock down the apex building ... it's such a unique piece of architecture\nWhy don't we do something else with it I don't know what you would want to do with it but um but I get the bigger issue we haven't talked about because of this just happened to this at the bottom level and stuff we heard from anybody until just now twice over member a you know about potential concerns\nWell I think it's it's just good tax revenue for the city of Providence ah um for the economy of Rhode Island I I just but maybe that's why I ask you about it now goes um\nYou you could see in highly framed the question that I was misinformed on a whole bunch of stuff so therefore I I\nHolly framed the question that I was misinformed on a whole bunch of stuff so therefore I I kind of turn to you for\nFor it you know kind of information that helped put it into perspective and I'm trying to get my arms around why local Providence officials would\nWould object to something that has truly a bigger benefit then maybe some of their concerns about how the skyline with look politics [laughter] that's what I thought it was right there on the upfront program I just wanted to so so\nDominant rich aerial there will be sponsoring legislation some kind of legislation that involves this subject in the next session and I guess I'm you'll be watching it absolutely All right we're going to move to another topic here\nAnd I'm not sure which one I I Want to choose um is it only any topic you want to bring up as a listener you'll welcome to um to do that I guess I'm I'm going to bring up the paw socks situation\nOr because I saw um and I looked at I was in in West or actually it was in the Oxford which is just a little bit west of washed up on a Sunday and I'm Talking to a ... oriented people and\nThey're all excited about um about bringing the puck it red socks to western Massachusetts\nAnd then along refer to them is that right I ... I Hope they're up there they call them the AAA affiliate of the ... yeah well um yeah I was so far as I Do more to read and write\nTwo more years two more years of broadcasting their games here and then we're gonna continue broadcasting them out of ... when they get up there but uh the uh\nThey didn't seem to have a problem with um with a hundred million dollars being spent in in West or as a matter of fact as I pointed out to them it's not your money because neither one of the gentleman I was talking to\nLive as it was right yeah so it's easy for them to be excited about it [noise] um so um but here in Rhode Island I've and looking at Nicholas ... yellows campaign literature and um he's done us a favor\nOr by uh getting the plus socks out of Rhode Island because he saved Rhode Island is millions and millions of dollars by a\nBy shifting a the plus socks to the city of Worcester, Massachusetts\nSo my question to you Mr Gregory is\nUm outside of meetings so what have you heard from from people on this is if somebody to blame in Rhode Island or are we lucky in the end\nWell I I I don't I don't think we're lucky in the end I I I think the uh uh the process was a long and drawn out um you know for example with the Senate\nThe uh there were more hearings held on the ...\nThen there was on pension before and if you want to talk something or the that's costing the state a lot of money or was costing the state a lot of them and it continues its pension reform um there were certain constituencies who apparently I'm\nConvinced the speaker that this perhaps was not of the best deal I I think it was so complex Roger for example when we talked about this before is that there has never been a deal as lucrative for ... minutes ... state\nThan the deal at the post socks propose no stadium has been built with this much private investment money putting it into a new ad\nComparing it to our parents out the triple a pox okay for that have been built in the latter I think it was Fifteen or Twenty years is is is what they were comparing it to 'em if they become very very political or you know we have certain naysayers in the states\nWho are entitled to their opinion but they kept throwing the fire bomber thirty eight studios into this and the deals with so entirely different that\nIt didn't make sense a fact after thirty eight studios the general assembly passed legislation to make sure that we wouldn't have another thirty eight studios a\nAnd that kind of got lost in in ... in the shuffle\nI I think that the uh is that the speaker was listening to uh to some financial consultants who said that the burden would be too much for the state uh there were others who are including the chamber of who didn't agree that we thought it was a fair deal and deal that both state um could handle and\nWe'll see you on Monday I'm On your unimpressed parade unless you tell me what time and it'll be on er Cox cable oh that's right right yeah and yeah and the radio on WN alright yeah everybody\nTake this has been WN our eyes up front presented weekday mornings at eight am front is a regular public affairs presentation of news talk Thirteen eighty WN our\nWon't socket [noise]\nRadio news was Chris farms\nDays ago the president called the first woman doing accuses Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct credible last night at a rally in Mississippi he changes his tone what\nWhat is it and I don't know I don't know but that's the only thing\nThe president referring to what Christine Blasey Ford says she can't remember about the incident she alleges happens Thirty years ago when she\nOr just says she can't remember about the incident she alleges happens Thirty years ago when she claims cabinet or tried to assault or at a high school party her lawyers as Trump's words were a vicious bio and solace attack\nThe government's jobs report for September not do well Joe Friday but an eighty ... jobs report says the economy added two hundred and thirty thousand private payroll jobs last bombs\nThe most in seven months according to that survey and this is usa radio news [noise]\n\nWhen you want an action hero to go to marvel comics when you eat protection from a downpour put on a wrinkle\nWhen you want to see someone who'd all morning\nThe ballpark when you have been injured in need of a trial lawyer there's only one lawyer needs to go to his Marshfield Smith mark has been appearing in state and federal courts representing individuals\nWho have been injured he also has been settling cases for clients and all the traditions and mediation is when you are in need of a trial lawyer as opposed to an action hero they have a dash or a professional athlete than there is one celestial attorney mark hills Smith has water\nIn Smithfield call for on some six nine forty one twenty or in Providence on ... street goal for a one to seven to forty thirty to visit his website\nFulltime lawyer dot com or email market L.

I just wanted to clarify that\nI Do that because there's this third one that she had an ex she's she I mean\nJust to see it it's funny because when I was in the service if you said if you said there's somebody by looking at good looking broad that was a compliment\nYeah that's right and what isn't it it's not it's an insult that you have I mean anybody who is the the uh I don't know where maybe maybe with was navy talk on military dog\nNot you saw it in the movies John it was a compliment and the movies\nOh thank you I thought I was going nuts\nFor ... years didn't know what the heck was that movie oh so I'm a gun um\nI Can't think of having them off the bus I he's used as a couple of times they are deemed light and used it in a couple of months and in those days in the forties and fifties was that\nIt has been turned around now to come in and it's all but I just wanted to explain that 'cause that lady was very concerned about my using that word but that's what I was just a novel\nYeah well I'm Glad we clarify that up to\nWell it's because at that the person that shutting it ...\nOh my goodness I won't even get any more about it because it's horrible it's that kind of a person to come out and try to do is just trying to do to look good honest man it just it takes and it totally you know what's happening John the Democrats\nBy what they've done with these three women bringing to the forefront as they have have totally destroyed the ...\nThe woman that these women have tried to put together to get rid of all of these ... men out there in society now who's going to believe a woman and when she comes forward\nWell because you can't what they've done is they're they're uh they're destroying the mail and gender it's it's not you know what I'm saying you can have on a thousand men in one person it doesn't mean all men do that\nAnd plus that was our believes women after all of this now that you're seeing all of this why isn't nonsense from these women who's going to know people are going to say oh my gosh she's another shutdown\nWhy should we believe are you know what I mean that ... the Democrat Party is destroying the ... that these these women have tried to put together as a\nDarn shame your fault [noise] uh jeeze I blame for that to like this added to the list\n[laughter] sure [laughter] no wonder you invited my wife the house\nShe said she was given to give me a call when you're not around [laughter] I mean outside you\nKnow she's she's doing the ... you know I come into my house yeah I Know she says she's going to give me a call okay okay so you know [noise]\nOkay so you know not just make sure Gales okay I don't know no we set it up on days when deals level oh oh okay well at least see though let me make some money somehow\nBut it won't let me do that [laughter]\nBut it works good it was straight Mr President if you are listening I'm I'm with John too bad you weren't on there for this test is\nHuge [laughter] would have been great yes\nBut anyway works fine and and now senator outhouse shell the outhouse what an embarrassment this guy is to the state really he goes in there he starts talking about frat parties and drinking and flatulence I mean what what is this guy trying to prove\nI mean did you there was that none of that guy that he uh there was a guy that recently claimed that he saw tavern on a softening somebody on a boat in Newport then we can't to this story\n\nSay that again I'll say that again they there was a guy that made an accusation\nAgainst Kavanaugh I wasn't too long ago he claims that there was a that he was there when Kavanaugh assaulted a guy on a yacht\nOh and I got the White House reported that yes\nYeah yeah he told he White House toll that guy to go to the report is with it\nEven without even finding out if it's true or not he wanted to put that other slandering there as quickly as ... as he possibly could that guy out house he is such a scum bags really why do how do we vote these people at ... ... what is wrong with this state\nHe should embarrass me John\nHello I'm listening okay no oh no I just had he's an embarrassment of I mean do you agree with that or\nYes oh yes I\nI Would never vote for him or when\nOh my goodness gracious I mean this is a ... show or they're going to be voting tomorrow I'm On the ... are they going to be doing voter Thursday tomorrow\nOr if if if they did school closure or something in the mountains of today the meeting with the Saturday by by applying the law by the rules and and um and then I guess\nThe final vote would probably be Sunday I don't know a boat but um we were waiting for the FBI report is that in\nIt and I don't know yet well I I've been keeping an eye on it but then the FBI that's going to find anything I mean how many of investigations inventing the FBI do tavern on in the years prior then I got to find as much now they did then\nThe ... in this case is very simple they took the testimony of both Ford and capital they then they interviewed the witnesses from the testimony\nAnd that's it that's it\nNow that you know they're in a witnesses they gave a something else came up that could be contributory they would've been a talk to that person but they don't go back to past Eighteen years old they never done that in any any one\nYeah yeah there's this one another which I'm you know it's not Kavanaugh they hate problems they have suffered a think Trump does that go to obstruct and obstruct instructive struck when you're not going to get anywhere in this country if the Democrats keep doing this stuff\nThe the other thing they do is um when they're doing a background six times when when they do it ... when the first time they do a thorough one from the second time they go from the they they did the end of the first one\nTo where what you're being appointed to the the third one of the fourth one the fifth or sixth one because what they're really looking for is that if you drink\n... or you pick your nose what they're looking for is you could you be getting a federal job or that you could be blackmailed follow what I'm saying\nYeah I I yeah south okay how about you don't want it rather than come out you know you're going to do somebody's some favors for somebody that's basically the question I have Jim it just ban has been as one of the top judges for twelve years where the hell with these people then\nYou you you you know you hear the Democrats saying he doesn't have the temperament well he's got how many three under decisions in my own lauded by the ... even ... unbelievable that the whole course\nOf course I mean do you don't think that Kavanaugh has been judged for that long and not have had a background check I mean they they they go over here with a fine tooth comb John you know in in situations like that because you're going to be a judge you you're going to you know if you're in a courtroom and you have to a judge let's say a death penalty case okay\nThat a judge is the judge I mean outside of God and Jesus Christ the judge on a courtroom is the third one is the third most important person you know what I'm saying you know I mean is it is is his ... his ruling is what goes and you just can't have any one up their\nCabin or I think if he's going to make a great a Supreme Court judge\nI mean I think you're going to be a great during the month you're going to be fair uh for for everybody and that's all I can expect from him a is\nExactly and he and he's been tough to it he really has\nMe I mean keep on every day it's like you and they will probably crumbled after all those false accusations but he stood his\nGround and he's strong and he's going to make it I think he's going to make it a lot of these Democrats adored is nothing but stalling until November that just stalling stalling stalling started coming up with all these and you're right John where were these are ... years ago and what Mr Nobody I think it was Mr Nobody mentioned about the uh me too movement and how it's destroying that moving it is\nBecause we do have women out there that have been victimized by that I mean look what happened with Bill Cosby okay let me that he's in prison now\nI mean and these were true accusations and if the Democrats gonna use is a political tool to get their means it's going to destroy what these women who have been victims of sexual harassment and assault a over these decades it's going to destroy their credibility it's going to totally destroy it\nUnderstand something when somebody says somebody is credible on the stand has nothing to do with their presentation\nIt's it's on the ... the the it's the evidence\nThe proven that took place in in in the in the credibility is there is not because you're good looking bad looking well oh Paul Shawn or whatever what play soft alone it's based on the evidence you're giving this coming across credible\nOr the other crap is crap that's what it is\nYeah I mean you know you know she up there to start or not and I ...\nI Believe or she's credible bleed rid of the weapons and that's a person had a\nLot of women as well women they're signing for capital she didn't do it then there are women they're choosing him of doing that stuff that you can tell you something new I ... you know do I believe that women for capital absolutely and also that he felt more people on his side\nSwimming for capital absolutely and also that he felt more people on his side John ... stuff never happened than than what the Democrats come out saying that did apps\nSounds like you're going to that's like you're going to the police the problems like John Dionne country in the face this morning I Want to file a complaint yeah okay where did it happen I don't know you don't know what time

pumpkin pie way over three hundred and fifty pounds how many pounds of cook pumpkin was was there in that resume [laughter] that's a tough one\nIf that is true um I you know I Can't help but notice that I don't care where I go with street I travel and I traveled different streets as they cross the ... of the city trying to avoid traffic\nI see the mayor's signs everywhere at least ... deli hunt for mayor and ah if all those people are voting for her she must have a lot of votes because I don't think al ... invested in science I have not seen one ... then again maybe I missed it\nBut um he's there certainly are an awful lot of ... signs around town\nI if I were gonna tell our brand is something that would be good as some signs up you're going to have something that shows that people are supporting you and watch it and when\nThat's an interesting comment you make a you know that is the fact that um if you see a sign on somebody's lawn and most likely indicates that they're supporting that ... that the candidate I mean I cannot if you're not supporting someone I don't think you're going to give anybody the okay to put that sign on your lawn so\nAnd I guess you can pretty much conclude that\nThe wherever you see the signs they support those particular ... ah candidates\nYeah I Would certainly think that would be a conclusion that most people would agree with the rain we're not going to put a sign that\nYou don't want exactly exactly exactly alright outline whether or\nNot you need whether or not it signed that can be seen from a plane flying overhead right I don't know that probably is a little bit too much I don't think you need to have that\nRight I don't think really I mean there were big signs when a whole team of people is running together I suppose that was different when you wouldn't see you wouldn't see those signs all over right ... an editor on house right right\nOr like when mail like though around when I ran with with my like though there were there were some some strategically located very large science\nYeah yes lifting all candidates on the more you're everywhere yeah but um I wasn't why I call\nI didn't think it was that [laughter] so yeah you are a lot of that you were talking about something else thanks a lot um\n... chronic absenteeism in our schools by any chance\nNo but that's certainly a problem yeah ... that's that's pretty disgusting numbers to have that ... higher Saturday missing was Eighteen days\nYou're Eighteen or more days yeah\nYeah and apparently it's schools not very important\nYou know well obviously it isn't a most are two very him why won't say most but to an awful lot of students in one socket it certainly is not important to go to school\nTell me something else you with all kinds of um let's see we talked about um a Christmas shopping distracted drivers Melville a auctioning off some vacant lots [laughter]\nNo but that's interesting um that's really sad that that town is so little money uh well I have to have so little money that that's a place where the uh the people get to say the we don't want to spend the money we have true\nBy having a town meeting that's kind of an interesting way of you know if you want a democracy you going\nTo that is true democracy yes most of the people\nSaid we don't want to spend money no they got to shut everything off you talk about turning the lights off I mean it was but it ended up closing the library or something I Do\nAll sorts of things uh I I Know that as far as the streetlights they shut off even more than we did a few years ago percentage wise I must be pretty docket build build these days\n[laughter] oh I I you know I guess my vision is getting worse\nAt sixty two um at night or as many people do but I'll tell you when I was driving a couple of nights ago where it was raining mhm in the rain on my windshield besides being dark and not well let\nThat can be really as it is driving the true and I didn't want to play driving through these winding roads and Melville with no lights Neal raining out\nHere I don't know I can well imagine and I don't think they ever had as many a street lights out a ... as we do here in the city of course you know they're in town so they don't need as many but the fact that they shut off so many it must make things pretty difficult in the evening\nYou know you you say they don't need his money
