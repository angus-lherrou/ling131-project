moaning Jeff how are you today\nI Am doing well so how are you\nThank you very much for taking the time you can only do it before trapping season right\nAbsolutely it gets a little tight after November\nHey you know there's one thing I didn't see it on the abstract are you allowed to do any trapping on Sundays\nAbsolutely yes and it goes it goes by months rather than than separate days so basically the season is wide open as long as I'm a light bulb that season as open so if any day but it's a matter of number of months or weeks that it's so\nOkay and on the phone right now we're on the outdoor scene in W. when I write Jeff trainer for new a New Hampshire and he works basically around the Hillsborough County area he's one of the uh many direct is up to New Hampshire trapping association\nHe's got a fantastic website ... Facebook page and he attends all the hearings\nA couple of years ago he was very instrumental on all the hearings on the bobcat trapping season a it was past they were going to have their first in a long long time allowing fifty bobcat the entire state of New Hampshire and then it the last minute the politicians pulled the rug out of it\nAnd I haven't seen it resurfaced this year where do we stand with that\nUm it it will certainly be brought up again it's a matter of when I'm at it and you get very political um and it's unfortunate that I mean I think it\nIn an email here from Pete from home which Massachusetts down on Cape Cod and he wants to know I'm your trapping season he sees in on the I'm Pam strikes and run a computer they hand you trap as reported by April thirtieth\nNow with the wrapping are like oh there are different species big game a lot of times they ask you for an insight as a to Z or to bring him to check stations so they are a state employees and stuff like that can check the caucuses and stuff is that part of the trapping program in New Hampshire\nSimilar yeah so as far as bringing to check stations we have two species um auto and Fisher but both meets what's called seals and they call them seals because back in the old days used to take a stamp and your stamp us feel right on to help\nNow with attack that goes through the whole of the ... I mean that's basically so that the you know our state agencies as well as federal agencies to track you know how many of those animals are being trapped so you're not going to be able to sell or tan or use an author or a Fisher call to New Hampshire without having an attack on it nobody will take it\nUm so that's one way of tracking of reporting um as far as the travel records go and this is again a stress of how trapping in the modern world is heavily regulated um and it's beneficial but conservation is that we have to fill out will require to fill out a trap or report every year\nSo everything that we catch we have to record the town in the area the number of species how many traps we had our per night I'm In with all that information biologist can make all these different formulas work this this uh this map\nAnd figure out exactly what the population density is versus how many travelers are on the landscape and that's basically helps them track populations and ensure that evidence healthy as we continue traffic\nSo the most important thing is to keep the trapping program going throughout the northeast because you're working hand in hand with all the agencies unsettling Korea limits on seasons in what's going on with a particular species especially if one\nStarts overbearing or an invasive species comes into the area I've been\nCalling them here from a talent\nAnd it's from Woodstock, Connecticut and it's a fantastic question that I hadn't even thought about he says when he says you talk a lot about the problem and sleep problem with the most and other game throughout New England\nIs is a problem with the trappings species always would kicks well fleas how do you work on that would have ...\n[laughter] and this is actually a subject that has come up recently across the country is um\nPeople are concerned with trapping species like coyote and Fox um because\nYou know they are they do tend to prey on mice which do you know carry a tick borne issues like lime disease and carry the ... and things like that but a lot of things that people don't realize when they say we need to stop trafficking hunting creditors so they can control nice to control Texan Lyme disease is but\nThey're ... as well and they're also carry ticks a you know throughout throughout their uh their range um and I can tell you that ... especially I had a mink last February was the dead of winter and they had Eighteen and gorge text just on the back of his head\nWhile he got to figure a link is a pretty small credit you're talking a foot foot and a half long a lot of Tex men beating on a feeding feeding blood on a critter that's out there trying to survive in the dead of winter um so yeah we're texture definite\nThat's out there trying to survive and the dead of winter um so yeah we're techs are definitely a problem with are bearing species um you gotta keep your facilities where you're handling these animals are clean and\nAnd be able to observe that stuff's please I don't tend to really have much of an issue with fleas I tend to find them more on either coyotes which are common to have them or or a possum are very very common especially when I remove a possums from homes because as you know I also do nuisance\nWildlife control removal as well in the offseason when when ... and I'm Still trapping for route you know traffic and relocation or or what have you whatever the case may be a and police are very ... possibly get a plea infestation in your home if you remove\nThe possum as a source and the fleas that or they have nothing left to feed on so yeah you definitely gotta gotta keep your wits about you when you're handling these these creatures 'em and keep an eye on your facilities to make sure that that's not being a brought into the home otherwise you're going to be spending some time sleeping on the couch [laughter]\nI got an email from Matthew remained Kim says you coming in loud and clear she says fantastic subject matter and uh she wants to know\nOn the off season when you're working with domestic people civilians and stuff that have problems with the animals raccoons Fox under the porch and stuff like that\nIs that a separate license that you have to get a New Hampshire\nYes yes it's it's called a nuisance wildlife control operators permit\nUm or W CEO as were called in New Hampshire wildlife patrol operators\nAre basically it is a separate license that allows you to trap outside the season for nuisance animal and then there's also a WTO level to license\nWhich is basically a license for the commercial or use of wildlife control so basically after removing bats from a house or a few removing pigeons from a store or something like that you have that ... CEO to license\nI'm I'm also an instructor for a thought I should say I help out with the lights the level to um\nCourse here in New Hampshire and uh yeah it's it's an interesting duality 'cause a lot of people here me you know what I refer to myself as a trap or they think bumps on kind of blood thirsty guy but uh it's ironic that in the off season I actually do more to save wildlife by educating people on\nHow you can co exist or not kill wildlife perhaps frivolously I'm In the off season so it was kind of a duality there that a lot of people don't realize\nEmail from Taylor from uh saint John's Murray Vermont coming in on tune in radio and the question is is an interesting one on that road kill\nToo can then be turned into a recyclable help on roadkill or does that make some kind of Higgs I'm an time something comes down to the muscles and stuff that would ruin a pow\nMm it depends on how recently was killed um\nUsually I can tell I Do collect road kill 'em if it's in good shape obviously something that is without getting too graphic something that is I'm obviously not usable you can tell 'em but I Do try to collect roadkill when I can I'm In and utilize that resource I Do\nIt's one of those things especially as a trap or you know you sit there and you you try not to wage um and of course being on our highways not roadways wildlife is wasted at a just an insane a level\nUm but yes basically if you can if you can get to the animals soon enough I'm from one that's been from what it's been a killed 'em you can certainly the process that call to utilize it up here in New Hampshire you just have to call your conservation officer say hey\nPick it up I picked up the road kill animal here or there are and let them know because technically it's one of one of the animal get hit by a car at least up here in New Hampshire it's technically property of the state\nSo we have to make sure that we let them know that we're taking that stuff um\nYou'll find out quickly if the animal is in good shape or not because typically we get what's called slippage so if those enzymes that that your your caller was referring to um do actually get into the Haydn and start causing the the hair to fall out basically put bacteria\nStarts eating away and you'll start to see the hair falling out all falls out then you can tell us it's up no here's\nAnother email here from uh Freddy from Reno Maine he's listening right now and tune in radio also he says great show wings we really tune you when we have a campfire and he says we really enjoy it he wants to make a comment on the lack\nOf love them ability um trapper education classes especially in the rural areas of Maine\nAnd they ... regional director this week in the back Maine and no response receive\nAlso has an ad a dent into it he says that turkey population is absolutely exploding here in Maine and now competing with the white pill for the mess you agree on that\nTurkey's are definitely through the roof here in New Hampshire and luckily as you know we're lucky enough to have people like Carter he is on the threat bird from the turkey federation kind of doing their thing and getting\nGetting newcomers out there to kind of a U.S is with with controlling that population gr regulated hunting um yeah there's plenty of predators out there but\nTurkey's are one of those species as we develop um our our rural areas\nThese predators coyotes and bobcats and things why try to chase after a turkey when you can go for a house pet or a trash can for half the work um so yeah we're seeing definitely turkey populations are very high here I'm referring to his trapper education comment\nI can tell you here in New Hampshire we had the same situation it's just it's all volunteers you have a a a fish and game department that has has a strict budget and in in my opinion is a little bit over tasked with other things non related to wildlife\nUm so it's very difficult when you're dealing with all volunteers to try and get\nA motivation out there to get a ... educated the wants to be educated or has the interest in that um so we're working on that was certified several new instructors here in New Hampshire this year I Would hope that main is doing the same because uh those proper education courses are the future\nYes I Would say uh WWW dot for bearer conservation dot com my website ... formerly known as
