interesting of a world we live in right now um if we go back to your youth\nAnd you sit there and you say what a changing world not just politically but just like from a\n[noise] what's the word of mouth from what the\nTechnology standpoint you know I can address that in the second item you'd done how even from my you know you gotta understand when I graduated from Bellingham high school and the bottom twenty five percent of the class of Ninety Ninety four\nUm there was no Internet\nI go to college for a you know Internet\nI think about Ninety six Nineteen Ninety six I'm guessing I it was somewhere in that vicinity Ninety seven\nAOL comes out and is like those messenger like you could like message people and then you know the technology really picked up you could send a picture\nSo let's say Nineteen Ninety eight was like the heyday of that when I first came to WNYCNI we had dial up Internet mhm fast forward in all of a sudden we're two thousand and Eighteen\nAnd we're here in Rhode Island so intimate Twenty years the entire way we communicate get information or the speed or they're now into five gee networks so Fifteen Years ago here a W ... and maybe even less than that dialogue\nInternet service where now talking about five ... which is ten thousand times I think\nFaster than ... which is what the typical phone use is right now so you start thinking about that and the reason why they need that\nIs so that the communication between certain devices like if they want to do wireless cars I mean driverless cars to have to have information coming in at a rapid speed

influence independence so I think that's what it is these things kind of just do their own thing you know like they go around the state and the guard this area looks like it needs and public transportation picks you up there mhm transit access taking a different route\nNot autonomous buses in shuttle Stanley an MIT graduate has designed a system of quote pods that glide along the track well suspended fourteen feet above the ground the system is solar powered in Stanley says it's also eco friendly\nThe lightweight pods made out of carbon fibre are whisked along at forty five miles an

to the DOT transit as could be the solution of congestion and missions in crashes that the state didn't know it was looking for plus with a private investment from covering the estimated four hundred million price tag of his proposed Rhode Island project he said it wouldn't cost the state a dime\nTo think about it wants it set up\nRight it's solar powered so besides them occasional repairs possibly this thing will be just zipping around the state of Rhode Island [noise] um it could be the wave of the future\nWell how long and it sounds to me it sounds like a a whole generations away I

they should have just said\nA please handle carefully this as a mom call the FBI and give give yourself attention so I mean you're you know and I don't mean to me so cynical but Joyce ... won a ... why why announce it's a private citizen obviously you know the ... the former secretary of state the former junior senator from New York the former president faces newsworthy\nKind of you listening to the speeches made by the New York mayor and the New York governor sounded like they had speeches on um on blaming Donald Trump written ahead of time when they were un held holding a news conference yesterday uh I I uh found it awkwardly interesting\nOr that they were responding this way instead of talking about public safety they were making political statements are in the midst of a quote unquote a crisis\nYeah ... they're not going to pass that up even some of the um fringe Democrats waiting for a judge Kavanaugh was his name was released as a nominee for ... um Supreme Court they put out press releases\nAnd some of the press releases actually had a blank names in them so they said\nSuch and such a person will be a terrible chief justice\nOr I was actually a social justice and United States Supreme Court because of this this and this and they were in such a hurry to put out the press release that they actually forgot to put it in his name and then the second paragraph they misspelled his name so they saw this as an opportunity to criticize the president\n... it's out of hand you know you and they have some great\nConversations that morning talking about how things are changing and\nHow but I think people are getting smarter about the news and that's why they respect those gases less I was thinking about you know you have a little bit more years of wisdom than I Do in the Nineteen sixties\nThat we have this big discussion about the Supreme Court nomination and go this that and have you know obviously you have ... coverage but those things were not dividing the country the\nOnly time that I'm politics was discussed outside of facts of news cast was on Sunday Morning and there were um three programs one was on NBC still on called meet the press and they would talk about some of these issues and detail\nOr CBS that face the nation mhm and ABC had issues than answers and so those were the three Sunday Morning programs there were a half hour and this with the discussion took place\nFree Sunday Morning programs there were a half hour and this with the discussion to replace meantime back at the six thirty news on NBC and CBS shut hughley or [noise] or Rob Warren um oh the Cronkite Walter Cronkite or or um uh the fluids and with\nThe guy's name was Smith on the ABC Howard K Smith Howard K Smith you got it I mean any myself just as great [noise]\nAll those guys if you watch those newscast I remember a it was so sad them you know\nOn on a given night I can remember being in my house and they were giving the statistics on how many American Soldiers were killed in Vietnam that week and sometimes there was a hundred and twelve or a hundred and sixty two\nUp but there was no commentary a there was no uh uh condemning Lyndon Baines Johnson the president of there was a it was just here are the statistics from the Pentagon and the news was covered as news and you had to draw your own inferences\nAs to what you you want it to interpret in it so to answer your question his lungs answer that news has changed dramatically\nUm when I watch the weather is Fox or CNN or icy news and commentary enters into sprinkled [laughter] into sprinkled rather 'em in the in the same sentence and um that's what has happened to news so it's hard for a viewer\nTo um you know make the distinction because they're being they're being given um propaganda by both networks and all the others are somewhere in between\nUh I I agree and going back to the point that ah the Kavanaugh hearings just when I received any coverage is just not going to be it's gonna be outta sight outta mind for the average American and as it goes forward\nNow is going to continue um skipping around to the ... the some statewide nose\nTo my least favorite politicians in this order was with Warren who I have no use for governor Gina Raimondo I can find many good things to say about her a I don't want to see her a governor again but I I think there's a lot of things I can say about her and this was in\n... this morning and they found it interesting 'cause my knee jerk reaction is anything Elizabeth Warren says it's us back\nAnd this one I'm kind of filtering through\nAnd maybe we can get an audience participation here but Senator Warren is calling for an investigation into McKinsey and company which is\nWhich happens to be in this is where I go local privatize it in happens to be um fear among those husband works there\nSo Jane are among those husband has a job and he works for what kind of a for him is is a look\nMackenzie is a and I I think when you think of McKenzie the first word that comes to my mind as prestigious it's a consulting firm so if you have a a large business and you can afford them and you're having troubles your bringing McKinsey company\nAnd they will do an analysis of what's wrong with your business there can without the consultants and at the highest levels of of uh of intellect and I'm\nCapabilities in my personal opinion in\nBusiness yeah okay so you hire them and it's like hiring the best law for him in the country\nI yeah I I think that's a good analogy okay and so what they did was among other\nUm clients that they have is Saudi Arabia so into a thousand Fifteen Saudi Arabia wanted a perspective of how their economic policies are being perceived in a internally in worldwide so it happens McKinsey and company\nSo the report identifies three people who\nUm were very critical of Saudi Arabia and what happens one ended up being jailed and to the families of their families were arrested\nCoincidence or not probably not but that's what happened so Elizabeth Warren is doing is going I I'm\nAn attack on McKenzie and saying you know why you providing that kind of information the McKenzie out to Saudi Arabia and we think it's wrong and from the first aid jerk reaction is I have to take a look and look at everything with a joined us by that Elizabeth Warren says but I'm kind of trying to keep this\nOn an even keel and analyze it so where it comes in local local frog they take a job at and this is a secondary issue they take a jab\nJane are saying that the McKinsey and company folks have given her fifty nine thousand dollars to her campaign she raises a lot of money I don't see the issue with those individuals supporting her at fifty nine thousand dollars a day to support her reelection that\nNo would do Elizabeth Warren goes deep enough to even know\nThat a neighboring state Democrats like Gina Raimondo 's husband works for for um that has been a consultant to Saudi Arabia I mean it seems like a a going like playing a game of checkers and going over for a [laughter]\nA blink\nLinked linked linked linked linked linked up and there I Am and you lose three of your check is but ah that seems like a stretch um I'm not quite sure Elizabeth uh I I think go I think a local problem is is guilty of maybe a over a over connecting the dots\nOh I absolutely there there's no way in heck that a Democrat a senator from Massachusetts went out of her way to try to stick it so they're sitting democratic governor I was up for re election this is where it's obvious I mean we had um the first gentleman at\nRotary you know he he's a he's very open about what he worked at hobbit works that hobby works from McKenzie so this is a connection that go local frog is to try to discredit the governor\nGuy and there's another example of you're teaching a journalism class on this and this particular case of local news manipulation um there are news agencies in Rhode Island that I'm manipulate or the news\nA and a goal local problem does it end incidentally so does the Providence Journal uh because uh they certainly have their favorites too and they certainly are reflect to those favorites are in their editorial page where they should\nAnd it also spills overturned the news pages where it shouldn't\nI don't didn't catch all of this morning um but I don't know if you commented that ah this morning there pro Joe or endorsed laws uh who wants to be mayor again\nYes or no he did not comment on that at all and um again that's a puzzle to me but again I don't know who the people are on the editorial board that\nMake these decisions I'm sure most of them living Barrington or he's granted joy uh Narragansett or [laughter] I don't have to deal with the issues of the city of Providence\nAnd let me give you a last but not least post honey bunches of votes that Syria to boxes four dollars [laughter]\nI don't think I've ever tried that Syria to for four dollars that

twenty ninth Donald Burke member of a\nA former member of the school committee wants to get back on the school committee his term expired and uh he now is running for office something you didn't

seven six six Thirteen eighty would love to hear from you on any topic whatsoever showed up that will comment on the news of the day if you permit us\nSo you must be ah looking for a light at the end of the tunnel our first week of November when this is Don\n... yeah ... it keeps the radio station busy\nAnd I'm In there as a a difference between what political candidates and what I Would call retail uh businesses so they both by radio time but I'm political candidates are are much more\nLabor intensive from our end point of view because there are a well I can think of one particular candidate that Jeff is working with them I won't mention his name because I mean the guy is just thorough\nSo he has revised his ad you know like a dozen times because one word is doesn't sound right to uh to him and so forth\nAnd so um it takes a lot of work to um to you know generate a hundred and fifty dollars for two hundred dollars and in business as composed do uh selling us an ad to prepping lumber where they say in thirty seconds so you know having a sale and this is what we'd like to and and that's it\nSo uh it's much easier to deal with a a retail clients than it is a political clients so that's what makes it so busy around here where we like we liked the businesses that are like I I don't want to say anything against bringing in dollars to the station go ahead\nWell I can put a positive spin on anything hopefully if we have the right political wind up after\nNovember you'll have more opportunities to get more people are tapping lumber because we'll have a better economy because what we'll do the right things like make sure that commercial rates not too high and\nMake sure that we deal with all these issues like landmark and the one time finding a of the opaque for the fire department all those things that go down to ... and hopefully they'll things to be taking care of hopefully\nThey will be you know if you want to comment on anything you know the number to call and if you just want to listen to us a spiel on well a thank you for a job at least listening to the program\nWe we alluded to this earlier Ali side did I'm On I don't feel real special because it says the bull a family or current resident where I live but ... says this is from friends of Lisa ...\nOur brain is a bad apple the this election day don't let him spoiling socket this was kind of\nDifferent tone than the mayor had last night which was more about her record and things that she wants to do and has done this was more kind of a hit piece I thought for mine I miss it ran and um I was I was disappointed\nMhm so this I'm kind of literature that was mailed out was or as you may recall targeted toward Mr Bree in in the last election and help get him defeated remember a it was a very anti ... one of the unions\nUnions right and um and so al is used to having hum are having some um shall we say mortar fire son his way to uh try to um shall we say we can his position\nSo a ... I got that piece at at my house and now nobody can really measure\nUm whether it resonates positive or negative with people\nOf but I don't know if I tell you the story but I I did tell it to ah to somebody last night as a matter of fact I met the person last like funny way to make a long story short I got a phone call the day that piece was mailed out from um somebody in my neighborhood somebody I I Know a little bit and uh Saddam\nI Am so disgusted with that piece I Want to make a contribution to al ... and they asked me for al ... telephone number and and I gave it to them and when I saw them last night at the event I asked them if they followed through on their contribution to al they did um and they think before giving them his telephone number\nAnd I have you know if they would ask me for the mayor's number I had her number two so I always try to accommodate people [laughter] I thought them to make a long story short I I Do believe that that piece when it entered the house of of of the people that called me for albertson's number\n... we'll see how good of a of a negotiated Trump is to get this thing behind his ... and get\nThe world economy moving again thanks

I couldn't believe this don't you love the statistics that they come from\nThe amount of carbon dioxide of that we're putting into our atmosphere every day is equal to four hundred thousand atomic bombs oh my goodness\nOn and what does that do for us you can see\nThat or you can actually we can actually feel that let's just look at summer this shift in summer temperatures\nFrom the Nineteen fifties to this decade here is really amazing\nWe have gone from early eighties or so on an average day to as you know we have had very hot humid temperatures bordering on total extreme heat temperatures that\nAre really too much for a lot of people to be able to withstand especially older people\nFor instance in them\nIn a around her abs temperatures there about a year ago reached way over a hundred twenty of Pakistan also temperatures was so warm uh older people were actually passing out from the extreme heat\nAnd even I Try to understand how this could be\nUm I walked into an air conditioned building recently and just kind of sat there during one of a very hot days and within a very very fast time about a half an hour I could feel my skin ... very very warm\nAnd I figure how much longer can I stay here\nWith this temper with this temperature this extreme temperatures disturbing my skin was doing to my the inside of my body which\nIs one of the main reasons you know well that's a state during extreme temperatures ... days such as we have this summer had to open up a lot of cooling centers to allow people with no way to cool their homes or apartments\nTo actually be able to survive the ... the temperatures that have reached countries around the world [noise]\nReally staggering in the in the high hundreds twenties now\nAlso as the the heat tests the temperature increases our oceans evaporate more moisture into the sky some for every approximate degree or two degrees\nOf temperature Fahrenheit at the atmospheres ability to hold water vapor increases by seven percent what does that mean and we've seen that this summer\n... hurricanes hurricanes typhoons psych loans\nWe know that we've had an extreme amount of them this year also the rains it's had many many more really drastic rainstorms we can see that happening in many many places especially here\nIt more or less in the west and southwest regions more rains and they've ever been able to consider has happened in some places we've had water extending over\nUm I Believe it was in um [noise] down in Colorado one day they had more and I'm Sorry Texas they had more rain in one day that would equal if you will is Niagara Falls had fallen down on a specific city in three and a half days\nIn twenty sixteen the amount of rain\nCity in three and a half days in twenty sixteen the amount of rain\nThat happens in the entire state of Texas\nIf you could have accumulated it would've actually cause to the state to be under eight inches of water continuous it's the amount of water the amount of rain that occur is is really really drastic\nBut now in addition to causing incredible flood events and I found this totally amazing the same heat that same extra heat that that is now within our atmosphere that evaporates more water from the ocean\nCausing these big downpours and extreme floods also pulls moisture even more quickly from the soil causing longer and deeper droughts and\nThere are many many examples a reservoir in Brazil became totally dry\nI'm In the meantime delta\nIn twenty sixteen under when the worst drought that it had in close to a century [noise]\nI'm In Africa many wells became virtually dry in fact in Africa so many countries and provinces became affected by drought that they actually declared disaster areas that\nYou know you may be thinking all this is like [noise]\nYou know kind of a fairy tale or um something that can't be true and again as I mentioned before I was a skeptic for the longest time but about a year and a half\nAgo I was one of three people ... people in my profession invited to a climate reality summit\nAnd hearing firsthand accounts of people undergoing some of the ... the direct effects of this was kind of amazing just totally surprised me and virtually opens up a lot of our eyes I'll tell you\nOr even even believe it or not lakes needed and Powell\nNow like meat of course is the the one that was created by the Hoover Dam that has undergone one of its driest times in centuries Lake Powell in fact also which is the result of another damn in a slightly different region um\nThat also became almost dry within just a couple of years you can see the difference in it from one time to another from just one year to say last year the amount of water in it was absolutely amazing\nAnd now of course if we have a lot of drought if the weather ... becomes this dry what's another consequences\nIs forest fires\nThe dry the temperature the dry as a land the heart of the temperature the proportionate amount of forest fires actually increases\nAnd we we've seen this happen especially over in the west and southwest I Know several years ago in the beginning of this decade there was a fire\nWill want to thank you for listening to me today this has been Francine Jackson\nGoing basically around the globe to get today thank you so much for having listened and hopefully I'll be with you again very soon I Know

wonderfully busy time of year but it's such an important time of year or so for anyone who is listening who is a repeat listener\nAnyone who is an existing clients of health and wealth ink which is my company ah and I am the president of health and well think anyone who is maybe listening for the first time or\nThis is an opportunity to schedule an appointment to review your health care to review your health planning for two thousand Nineteen now of course we can\nI help people with the remaining months of two thousand Eighteen as well so\nThere's a little bit of time before we switch over to the new year but then we're what we're doing now is we're looking at reviewing plans that are available for the upcoming year so we always work on cycles and our business and uh the cycles\nKind of work like this uh throughout throughout the year people are are retiring you know aging into Medicare I'm switching jobs moving into the state for the first time from another state or moving out of state and so health care planning\nSomething that really happens year round people lose their job believe their job lose their work benefits um\nAll kinds of triggers that can require a need to review so we're doing health care planning all year long\nBut what happens is uh you know around round summertime early summer we start to\nGet prepared for the fall because the fall is a big renewal time\nWhere especially for clients but not only but especially for those clients who are are on Medicare because in ... and many of the clients we work with are on Medicare original Medicare a and B or getting on Medicare for the first time and so we are a company that can help educate them about\nThe age the bees the seat seize end the use of Medicare and then help them with individual insurance plan choices that may be available to them in their area\nSurround summertime we start to\nGet certified and a plan for the upcoming season will get notices from a certain companies that may be putting broods into Wal Marts or other retail locations around the country do we want to\nYou know where do we want to operate out as we want to work in retail or do we want to just um\nYou know served existing clients how do we want to get new clients so so new agents that sometimes we'll start with maybe a retail booth that's how I started or not in this business but in\nThe insurance side I started nine years ago working in a booth in a Walmart on diamond deal road and you know people would come up to that booth and\nAnd learn about basically what plans were available and at that time it was one insurance carrier that I was representing\nUs for that particular population for people who are on Medicare and you know some of those clients is still on that same plan and it's been working while all the way through but over time we were able to add other plans other insurance companies so that now\nIf you're listening if you're in one socket or Blackstone Valley or or even if you're a anywhere in Rhode Island war you know if you're over the border of Massachusetts\nOr indeed you can be listening perhaps anywhere on line um but certainly locally\nThroughout New England and specifically in Rhode Island where can we have access to all of the insurance carriers um that you're\nBut I ... we have access to all of the insurance carriers um that you're hearing about on TV that you're\nGetting letters in the mail maybe you're\nYou're being their advertising to come to a sales event of this insurance company to learn about their plans we are knowledgeable about those plans but we're also knowledgeable about the competitors plans so when you talk to health and well when you call me\nWhat happens is you're getting access to a broad landscape of what's available so you don't have to worry about well he's only here to tell me about one thing or sell me one thing\nNo I'm when I'm there to do is educate you to help you come to the best decision for yourself and will help you do that there's no cost without there never has been ah we do get paid but we get paid by the insurance companies we represent there's no markup meaning you don't pay more to have\nOver a dozen agents in Rhode Island that contract through us and that I wrote helping families themselves so some of them have five hundred clients are more themselves so there were helping a lot of people up but the best thing is to have a go to to have someone and if you\nHaven't worked with us but you have a question about your plan or a statement a\nAnd maybe it's not healthcare related or maybe it's not\nA directly related to your health plan maybe you maybe you're concerned about long term care or maybe you're worried about hospital co pays maybe you're worried about what if what if I have to do chemotherapy um you may have concerns that go above and beyond\nWhat Medicare cover you might not know about skilled nursing what are the limitations where does Medicare picked up and where does it leave off when does the coverage stop and\nThese are very common concerns and important things to address the best way to address it is to pick up the phone to give us a call and the schedule time will come sit with you at your kitchen table or your place of preference and we'll have a conversation about what's important to you that\nIsn't going to be everything done in one day you know what we'll do is we'll tackle um one thing at a time most likely\nIf it's a health care review we're just going to stick to healthcare but if you call and you say gee I'm retiring and I have four one K. I have for freebies I Need to know I'm turning Seventy and a half when do I need to start taking required minimum distributions from IRAs\nAh my life insurance is blowing up on me I'm getting statements in the mail saying send in a check or it's going to lapse\nThere's questions in crisis is like that all throughout the year\nYou know I have to have a root canal is there any dental plan that can help\nAll of these questions I'm going to Europe is my insurance plan cover me while I'm there a\n... year round stuff and we can help you any day of the year with that\nBut what we tried to do is if it's Medicare specific\nThan we keep it specifically to Medicare insurance because of regulation for one thing you know when a person an agent should not be educating or teaching you are selling you any other product other than that health insurance plan while there with you um\nBut people have other concerns another question so we can always schedule will follow up time to talk about everything else so we keep\nThe insurance review health insurance specific to that and by the way ... it's not only that it's regulated and there's rules it's also that it's a lot to cover so you know for you to have a good honest review of a formula\nRace for the prescription drugs tears to duck the bulls if there are any a hospital co pays out patient procedures to fully go through summary of benefits of a plan that you may be choosing that is that is a task that's probably going to take close to an hour some in some cases\nWill have appointments that go one to two hours or even I have agents will spend three hours with their clients we don't have a we don't have a a stop watch you know this is not like the er\nHe used to take a cab ride and you know you get in the cabin that the stock the clock even before you went in you write them to the dollars will be on the clock you haven't even gone anywhere you say wow I mean we haven't even Germany wherein I already old money it's not like that you know when we sit down\nYou know put away your worries put away your concerns I mean don't put away your concerns 'cause\nYou'd ask questions but you don't worry about that you put

the carriers for reasons so that we can actually enroll you and a plan so you call me I'd come sit down we talk about your needs we talk about the landscape\nYou ask questions I I I help you think

back to promptly\nWithin a business day and we'll take care of whatever it is a that we can and if it's something we have to point you in a different direction because\nYou know maybe we can't get an answer for you because of privacy laws because of HIPAA laws you know I Can't just call up the health insurance company on your behalf and get private information about you you know you have to be on the phone and give me access on the phone to ask a question for you\nBut we'll do that too so sometimes we'll sit with a client will call an insurance company together and they'll get permission to uh from you with me right there on speaker phone that I can ask the right questions um\nTo get the answers that we're looking for\nThey could be that you have an old insurance policy and you don't know where it is maybe you have a life insurance policy or you thought you had one you don't even know where it is\nSo we need to call the insurance company we need to ask them to look up the policy maybe you have a policy and you don't know how it works you don't know what the cash value is inside the policy you don't know um\nYou don't know basically what's going on within the policy so we can call and get those answers are\nAnd will help you do that so uh but it may be that you know there's some things we can't help with we need to send you their yourself so maybe you you know what you need is legal work maybe you need to do a trust or you need to review some legal work for power of attorney\nAnd we can just tell you a recommendation and maybe someone we know who does that work an attorney who does that work and but then it's on you you're going to have to contact that person you're going to have to sit with them so there are things that we don't do you know we don't practice law\nAddress the client and if you are in the client there's room for us to help you with more things because what's better\nTo work with someone you already know liking trust if they if you know like

liability insurance health insurance\nLife insurance all of them and not only are we license and all of them but we are knowledgeable about multiple choice as within that within those vertical

and casualties side because that's a very local thing and it's a very very specific industry I'm at a knowledge ah\nThere's a knowledge bank that's required really it's not about just\nYou know answering an ad on TV for the cheapest car insurance I mean you see these ridiculous ads like twenty dollars and you can drive your car twenty dollars for what you know how long can you drive your car and twenty dollars you can't even fill up your tank of gas on twenty dollars so I wouldn't count on any kind of insurance policy that costs twenty bucks a month\nRight so you need good advice you need what good is any coverage if it doesn't cover you know why would you want to spend\nEven fourteen dollars a month it's cheap yeah but what's it going to give you\nSo you need to\nDo you need to really really make sure you have the right coverage as well as price now what's very interesting in\nThe population that a ... big population that we serve or those who are retirees are retiring people or people who are on Medicare um there are products that are low premium so you say what slow well\nYou know we've got every ranger price product out there so it's not always thousands of dollars are hundreds of dollars to ensure yourself but you need to understand the value behind the plan that you have where the dollars coming from who's really paying for it\nAnd why you know why is why is that the cost so\nThat's some of the background that you get when you work with us we'll explain what you have to understand it better\nAnd if there's any alternatives out there and you want to know about that as well we can explain that to eight eight eight four to nine four seven to seven that's our number eight eight eight four to nine four seven to seven or give us a\nA call it our office at seven

B. C. d.s of Medicare a little better please give me a call and we can arrange time to me for no cost personal consultation\nI come to you you can reach me at eight eight eight four to nine four seven to seven again that's eight eight eight four to nine four seven to seven\nDoes your health insurance plan have co pays if so who pays you if you go into the hospital Hi this is Brandon Murray with health and wealth radio we have plans that can provide cash benefits to help cover expenses associated with daily hospital confinement\nAmbulance trips outpatient surgery and more\nWorried about critical illness we have plans for that as well call me today at one eight eight eight four to nine four seven to seven that's one eight eight eight four to nine four seven to seven get coverage today\nAnd welcome back you're listening to health and wealth radio heard every Thursday morning W went awry I'm your host Brendan Murray president of health and well thank you so you know this you go to the pharmacy you're standing in line waiting for your prescriptions and person before you get up\nIn front of you they they get their prescriptions and you're not supposed to over here but you can't help over here that they're they get the same prescription you get and\nThe pharmacist says okay and that that'll be and they put they name a price person puts in their card pays or takes out their cash pays moves on next person moves up\nPicks up their prescriptions same prescriptions as the guy or gal in front of them\nBut the co pays different because they have a different insurance card man off they go they make their payment you step up there you get your prescriptions\nYou pull out your insurance card and now you're get charged a different price for the prescription you said how can that be three of us and we all three of the same prescription all three of us are paying a different price that's because you all had different insurance plans and the importance of making sure that your insurance plan works the way you\nThink it will and the way you needed to is very critical so it's not like one size fits all you can't just say give me what he give me what she has you know it's not like going to a restaurant where our\nI'm going to try to fish you're going to try to fish which both have the fish you know this is a health care and it's very possible to be sitting at a kitchen table where you have a spouse that has a different health care situation um a family member was a different\nMedical history a different prescription list different doctors sometimes people use the same doctor sometimes they don't\n[noise] so if your friends are saying I get this plan you should go to this plan you know I I'm paying this amount and why don't why you do by paying all that money I I get this plan\nIt's worth picking up the phone and calling me for sure so if you're having breakfast and someone saying I got this plan and it gives me this this this this and this absolutely call me you know you might be overpaying maybe you have a group plan from your your work\nAnd you've been on it since you're retired as a group retiree plan and maybe you're paying a lot of money for it and maybe we can actually just save your money and give me a very similar coverage but it could also be um things that you don't know about that person might be on a\nState assistance as well they might have Medicaid and Medicare and so when you have Medicaid and Medicare\nOh they might have Medicaid and Medicare and so when you have Medicaid and Medicare that can be a dual status dual too and there are plans designed specifically for that population that may offer different co pays different benefit different um\nDifferent network different choices are then the plan you may be and\nIt could be that the person is a retired teacher or a government employee and maybe they have a union plan or plan that's paid for by their uh\nBy their company and so this I don't pay anything and I want I had open heart surgery I didn't get a bill you know maybe they're saying things like that and you're saying how can that be you know I I just went for a checkup and I got a co pay you know I just have blood work I got to go back well\nPeople are on different situations people have different situations different plans different backgrounds different uh funding all of that so\nWhat you have to be confident in his though if you call if you scheduled time we will absolutely show you what plans are available to you and from that we can together make an intelligent decision so it's not uncommon it's not unheard of for me to do a meeting with two three four people at the same time\nAnd they get different plans so\nYou could ask for different people on four different plans and they could all be correct\nMe so how can that be you know so people sometimes say to me Brandon if if if I were you what would you do or what what would you do for your mom while everyone's different you know so that's a tough question because of the reason that everyone's different\nUm again how are you different different because you're on different prescriptions you see different providers some people listening they\nThey're very they're likely to receive health care from doctors within a five mile radius maybe you grow up and win socket your whole life and maybe you see your care in when socket\nMaybe a neighboring town and that's it you wouldn't even dream about going across the border or go to Boston or anywhere else to seek your healthcare other people\nYou know they may actually have doctors in Boston they may have specialists they may need that freedom of network choice maybe they travel you know to Florida to Arizona\nWherever or maybe they go for just to visit grandkids or maybe they actually have a house there and they they go three months six months out of state you know I have I have one client who spends half the year in Europe\nYour intention was to leave that

details are still underway so they would like to try to get away from not having to pay or one quick question whether she will stay with NBC News news and some of the role I don't think so\nShe's scheduled to participate in the networks mid term election coverage in two weeks that will be changed she is gone she has hated\nShe never should have been there Kelly is parted ways with her talent agency ca according to sources and she is harder to an attorney\nSo she doesn't have a talent agency anymore but she's hired an attorney so uh so that just means now she's just going to try to get as much money as possible for the decision to retain or a lawyer may signal limping battle over a contract\nValued twenty three million a year\nShe's in the middle of the second year of a three year contract\nThe talks about dropping her show predated this lake latest controversy with the offense or offensive comments blackface\nNBC News staffers were calling your show a disaster before the latest controversy and Kelly's been openly challenging the news divisions management\nFor months so this started also by the way where she immediately started kicking Matt Lauer when he ran into some problems and you know what's interesting is our broker\nWas tight with Lauer and a lot of people feel\nThat Lauer was kind of given the short end of the stick at NBC and an eight is a ... no one was condoning his behavior but basically\nUm yes she's gone she won't be on she's she's not coming back how about the fact the fact\nThat she she's no longer at the ALPA which is her agent that that says a lot\nSo I'm definitely a something very very strong this so she's not going to be hosting let me also just get the latest on this that's big that is big ah the Megan Kelly arid NBC maybe over\nShe tried to defend the black face and then she's not on the air today so that's that's going to be just about it\nUm but and then they were slamming hurt a town hall meeting that they had at a at NBC but folks more and more you watch I I don't you know when you think of the panic yesterday and they were attacking President Trump last night\n[noise]\nMigrant caravan what happens if it reaches the U.S

wants to welcome him here\nUh Sheldon Whitehouse wants to welcome them here by the way you should also question other members of the media right like the ... radio station of ... boy call them up and said do you support\nThe or having the caravan come into the United states and let them try to answer that CBS News ex FBI profile says there's an arrogance to the coordinated string of packages that or could offer clues behind them they they definitely is they will find who this is and\nYou watch this is not some Trump supporter the way that a congressman ... trying to portray this as well I don't know if you've heard his statement congressman ... has been bashing this whole thing\nThis is congressman David says selenium I Want to express my gratitude to the men and women the law enforcement board responded to these terrifying acts working out or done it by the perpetrator or perpetrators\nThis is congressman David Sicily now the president has spent years stoking the flames of political violence he's encouraged police brutality\nRefuse to condemn the violence actions of Nazis that's wrong that's ally and offered to pay legal fees for any supporters was salted a protester he was kidding\nJust days ago we upload Republican congressman from physically attacking reporter was doing his job that's a lot of NATO ally Sicily and he goes on to say political violence has no place in the United states of America\nThe president should be doing everything he can to discourage violence and encourage respect instability in a beautiful country what congressman David Sicily need does not say folks if he is part\nOf trying to bring in\nIllegals without question which adds to it and and not only that yeah no way she is a Megan Kelly coming back not only that\nBut the attitude of people like congressman leaning is if you disagree with them you're a rotten person you can't disagree with Sicily any Raimondo a ... you can't disagree with them if you disagree with them that they're the the better person they have the high ground may have the moral high ground\nSeven six six Thirteen Amy let's go to the phones their morning you're up on the John ... hello\nJohn how are you very well guarded ...\nAnd the John ... show hello hello John how are you very well guarded ...\nOh I just uh I find it funny and ironic how a ... as Senator Jack Reed uh have the nerve the Gault say the president needs to tone down the rhetoric\nWhen in fact you have ah people on the left like a Mad Max Maxine Waters telling her constituents rash people to them that they're not welcome\nWon that that's forcing people to want to get in jail or to to get beat up because people are not going to take this\nUm they have been on the side of violence for so long yeah\nAnd especially when you have\nA Hillary Clinton also stating that are all talk about peace and and and uh a civil mess when we win the primary Adolf Hitler said that he said well talk about peace while we win the war [noise]\nThese people are absolutely lost her mind I just would like to know if Senator Jack Reed gave his own party that same advice to say hey place vaccine stopped that someone's going to get hurt that's going to be your fault\nYou know that is a very very good point in ... no point do they ever tell their side the tone down the rhetoric you exactly the same thing you know it was a Bernie Sanders supporter\nThen went to that Washington DC baseball field in shock the Republican congressman drew that there were practicing for the game Congressman Steve ... went missing and at no point do you ever hear ... White House right none of them ever condemn that\nKind of actions and not only that last march march of twenty Seventeen we had the march for Trump in March afterward island the house and the whole rally\nAnd we were trying to have peacefully was drowned out by people are yelling obscenity by playing music so you couldn't hear us I mean they lead the way as far as being disruptive and be disrespectful and hateful rhetoric and yet the you're exactly right there never cold out on our they\nKnow ... and it's getting to the point where um you know my son goes to school and\nIt says well you got to be careful what you say there because people get called racist for not even being racist or they get called a sexist for [noise] for saying that something is unfair for men um the way that the media is portraying\nThe president is one hundred percent right when he says and and this is not towards your job because I Believe you you're the one of the only ones who gives the the true thing a regardless of party or a a or left or right but the president is right when\nHe says that the media is the enemy of the people but it's not a new thing is with that has been for a long time way before he ever threw his hat and to run as press you know they only give one side\nThey really do I mean it's so and so it's so biased and you know you even see it I've never seen it is bleeding as it is in these even in just a local elections with the way that\nAnd they do it in two different ways number one the way the little radio station who's working true was is admitted he's working with Gina Raimondo the way they've been bashing Republican ... Alan ... and also the same way\nThat the media continues to ignore all the negative press local media now all the negative press about Senator Sheldon Whitehouse Senator Sheldon Whitehouse is being investigated by the FBI for leaking information in trying to take that not\nThat had the big story about cabinet and send you to reporter none of the local media would cover that in any way White House put out that\nLying on the line commercial he is a group of elderly and said send me to Washington to know the Trump people are going to take away your Social Security and Medicaid and no one\nNo one calls them out on it it is a complete lie the Washington Post gave him the highest reading for lying fools commercial and yet you still see all the local media continue to run that none of them call them out on it and you have a great candidate in Bob lenders and\nThey jump through hoops trying to get attention\nAnd the other problem with with\nThe road island voters is the fact that a lot of people are so content to just believe whatever the ... the Democratic party you're right and and even you know I've talked to a lot of people who are Democrats and they sit there and\nKen ... heads the president and that's all okay no matter what\nThey feel they can get away with all of it and you have Senator Sheldon Whitehouse going to a senior center\n... the sitting senator blatantly lying about how about this morning and the Providence Journal there's a profile on him and with his White House the reporter says that wouldn't be what has to do with whether they go a tea house how do we end up with a a a senator that that that's his idea of a good time and going and sipping tea\nA a a senator that that that's his idea of a good time and going and sipping tea for crying out loud\nOf course Sheldon was sipping tea where else would he be alright folks seven six six Thirteen eighty seven six six Thirteen eight and you can email me John ... dot com John out to be drawn dot com no attention all patriots fans coming up\nPatriots jets taking the road it's Thanksgiving weekend November twenty fourth the twenty fifth ah patriots against the jets are the triple leaves how would you like to see the New England patriots Tom Brady ...

we'll be able to\nYou know do what it wants to do because it's going to have you know the right kind of people on it but you take the six people that I'm running with I mean you've got a lawyer to financial experts it got a council president that are essentially runs the place for the elderly on roads avenue\nAnd ah he's been a council president for a while and and uh then you've got a ... you

the seventh when I think\nNow is that there are a lot of other good people that are running unfortunately they don't have the name recognition they also don't have any experience\nAnd a chief seems to be you know the the youngest one was some sort of an idea of what's going on and well David so see you know is a vending business for a long long time and hopefully you know he'll be able to

Saturday and it will be a wet\nSaturday or sure forty eight degrees the high Fifteen twenty mile an hour winds and rain to go with that isn't that a pleasant day respecting at least around an inch and a half arrange route Saturday a so I'll say a typically we go come in a little bit over when we have these major systems come into the area\nThe estimation are going to be a little conservative\nSo I'm gonna save ... inch and a half to two inches of rain throughout Saturday and Sunday evening forty five overnight into Sunday the rain will taper down by early Sunday Morning they'll still be a cloudy damp day on Sunday a little warmer into the mid fifties around fifty four degrees\nAnd some are shower activity making our way on Monday a little peek down in the valley for the kiddies it does look it will be a decent Halloween trick or treat night for the kids so there's something to look forward to mid fifties as the high but it looks like it'll be a rain free on Halloween but keep an eye

Sarah\nActor Jeff it's nice to be here it's nice that you keep a radio station open and in this day and age I get very much um\nRunning an independent candidate for district twenty four that's when the socket no Smithfield I'm not taking any pac money from any political or people or organizations cause I I Want to run\nIn my own money so I Do not feel obligated to anybody and some of the issues that I'm concerned about our some of the issues I'm concerned about is the is our taxes insurance go up every year\nUm you need a car or truck to get to work to run a business\nBut luxury rich luxury boats in Rhode Island they pay no sales tax or any property taxes while you're struggling to pay your taxes as one of the issues I'm ... I'm concerned about I've worked in private sector I worked in public sector I owned a small business um I've also worked in opening the a\nTo Veterans Memorial museum heroin socket Amazon it's a nonprofit organization I've had a lifetime representing and protecting workers' families I've been a I've got an endorsement now from the AFL CIO\nFrom the council Ninety four asked me state in in ... workers union and also from the NEA teachers' union I've accepted in the dos meant and I'm proud to have\nI'm not accepting any funding or any political money from those organizations I Want to make sure that I'm only representing the people in my district that's all I really could be concerned about some of the issues um I I\nIs that our current control the state has been under Democrat leadership for for decades it's been decades now and are there are a lot of good folks that are good folks are Democrats say they try hard working families but the situation as it is\nBut folks are Democrats say they try hard working families but the situation as it is now in in Rhode Island the working family we'll get ten dollars and fifty cents for minimum wage in January Massachusetts will be twelve dollars an hour\nI mean we're we're we're behind here for our own working people and that money gets spent in the communities that goes right back into the community and and I think we need to really take a look into into a rate raising the minimum wage much quicker um\nAnd and a senior citizens when uh when my dad passed away my my mom's sold the house and on gas goes frequent sock and she moved to condos and Blackstone\nWhen she moved there anything that wasn't covered by her a and B Medicare plan was covered by the state of Massachusetts and that was put in under on the Republican governor I just don't see why we can't have that for us senior citizens here in in our in our state\nAnd another thing you get down to uh I I heard the arguments about teachers getting pay raises\nUntil you put the shoes on of those teachers and worked in a classroom the way it is today it's not like it was when we were kids if you when you were a kid in school if you got in trouble you went home their data mom took area you got it it's not happening now so he's teachers are are in conflict in\nA base and and and it's just uh they they need us support a public schools need us support our teachers in one socket just took a very low paid compared to a lot of other communities throughout the state we really need to to take a look at that\nAnd not not criticized teachers on you know till you put the you know it's like a some people look at it as being a free day care center and they blame the teachers when the kids are not\nAre not performing right in the school of the kids are acting up in school have kids who act really bad school for a book in a classroom and it disrupts the kids were there to learn and yet there's very limited uh uh issues that Doug ... problems and now teaches need need to be they have college debt\nThey need to pay their bills and and they're working hard to educate children under a very tough situations right now and again if if you want to sit there and say they shouldn't get pay raises put the shoes on please and go and go sit there for a week and see what it feels like\nI had a small business when I went to work for the state of Rhode Island as a as a the ah the chief electoral investigative around department of labor or we were not allowed to run for political office or because we're called classified employees\nBottom line gets down to this you know if you are fed up with politics and the state\nAnd you want to see some change I'm only one person but it takes one person to stop it takes one person to step forward and and argue the points I don't need the money to be a senator I don't need the health insurance to be a senator I don't need any of those things I Want to represent up paypal\nTo two of our children moved to Connecticut 'cause uh the taxes the less the ... the houses costs less there's ... there's just you know things need to change in the state and the fact that you can have a a million dollar yacht sitting in Newport and you had to Connecticut plates on your car and you're paying no sales tax or no property tax on that boat\nAnd yet you're taxing my car I bought it I had to pay seven percent a person I bought it from page seven percent\nAnd an extra if I was assault someone else they pay seven percent all on the same car\nAnd I and I just say it might cause it to a two thousand or five dodge\nVan and I just got a fifty dollar fifty three dollar tax bill on my my vehicle [noise] so I mean ... took me to be able to buy a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand or five million dollar yacht and pocket in the harbor in one of the ... in Rhode Island and pay nothing\nThat that's not right now that that money is they should be getting taxing and they should be reducing the taxes on cars and trucks that you need to go to work in and they need to run a business with that's where\nWe need to focus on taking care of those people and not the rich people or the corporations that own always yachts and and go down there to take a ride down some day take a look at the plates in the ... a lot of the New York Connecticut New Jersey Massachusetts I got to be you know as all people from out of state\nUsing our tax free boat system here and they're going to say well if we tax suppose it's going to hurt the boating industry those yachts and not made in Rhode Island they made in Argentina that ship up here for sale\nAnd if you go over to a fellow told me about the ... vote sales and I was one of what that subtle about they take boats from Massachusetts they go over the ... border into Rhode Island and that's where they do the transaction to sell the boat so there's no sales tax on it\nI went up there and look at and there was three boats on trailers in the parking lot in Rhode Island and that's what they're doing so they don't have to pay taxes\nAnd this isn't right for us you know we all pay taxes we pay taxes on our homes our cars you know I mean you do by material for your business you're paying seven percent you know ... it's time to change these things and and and I and I can't you know I ... the Democratic party has control the state for decades now\nAnd there's some great guys in there you know we have we have a we have we have a a representative Casey in more and we have people that that blue collar guys the worst is firefighters these are guys that know how families struggle they see it themselves so and we have a Brian Mubarak is a family man or a\nA Smithfield he's a Republican he's a family man he cares about families who cares about people\nAnd then in in a Smithfield he's a Republican he's a family man he cares about families who cares about people these are the people we need more of\nIn our in our state we need people that represent working families not not special interest in businesses that that make money from there from political stuff we really need to take care of our own and I\nSome some people don't like my ideas some people think it's a little to one guy said oh you're oh you're a little too uh or two left wing I'm not left wing I I've been ... we should get something far tax money that we all pay and we've been paying them forever and it just keeps going up our insurance has gone up a need to get something back\nAnd it goes should go back to the working families and a senior citizen and for God's sake of veterans need to be rich treated with respect\nThese guys came back from Korea Vietnam and the current guys now there's no tickertape parades is nothing you know ... and you know now people are going to Vietnam ... thank you for your service that you said they weren't treated like that when they came home\nThey weren't treated like that and they came home and we need to show that respect for these gentlemen we need to do whatever we can do to honor them on them and I don't care how we do it we can have praised we can do whatever but we need to take better care of our veterans but we rarely do and some of these guys they went they went through hell\nAnd high water and came and came back here and and and struggled to to get back into society\n... let's let let's do more for them as well and uh that's kind of what I I Am here about that's why I'm running and if you know if you don't want if you like things the way they are and you want to just keep the machine run in the way the machines run and\nGo right ahead I'm not using any any money from anybody my own and I'm competing against an opponent who's taking the pac money from\nFrom people who want the power plant and and other issues I I I don't want to take any money like that I just want to represent the people\nThis is going to do some blonde he is running for Senate district twenty four on the November sixth ballot is an independent candidate\nA ties to Baltimore the socket in North Smithfield laying out his platform here we have just about five minutes left um and it will be with one thing you want to do is just cover a little bit at the top or as folks do tune in throughout the program I Want to point out that he is a hat does have some endorsements\nYet not accepting physical contributions from those endorsements I\nI'm I'm probably get the endorsements of the NEA I ride a teachers\nAnd he asked me a a council Ninety four that state municipal workers union and also the AFL CIO and itself these organizations that are working families and and and taking care of working families and\nAnd helping them to get better wages and better and make better communities for all of us I'm I'm proud to be endorsed by them\nAs means a lot to me um again I I've been offered pac money from them and I am from the organizations and I and I won't be taking it\nI Will be using only my own money and I am running against a a machine that's paying money into my opponents or account and I understand that and she\nNeeds to take the money to to to to pay for the food for the veterans at the at the pay for the food for the seniors at the high rises and stuff [noise] sorry folks I Love your seniors but uh I Can't afford to buy dinners for everybody I'm very tight dime [laughter] but uh\nYou will have my support I Will I'll never vote for anything that will hurt taxpayers working families seniors veterans are our children our grandchildren I Will never vote for anything that hurts any of those people\nWhen you've said that with some of your points are such as uh taking a look at those pensions making sure we're not getting taxed in those pensions that will help the senior than Medicare backup I mean is there anything more important for that generation making sure that whatever isn't covered this taken care of without coming out of pocket\nAnd that he's outlined a few ways of taking a look at that with uh some of the luxury taxes for uh the the higher end as society if you will the redundant management redundant management and uh it is getting bloated at the top and now at the bottom\nRight now right now the administration building is a hundred and twenty three people making over a hundred thousand dollars their salary and medical coverage is twenty eight million dollars for a hundred and twenty three people that's just over a hundred thousand dollars each that's not the ones Ninety nine thousand down\nAnd you can look it up at San payroll our riots it's very ah it shows you all the pages and\nAnd the names and the people making the money and some of them I'm sure I really needed but my department I saw nothing but redundant management and they came in and one one director after another brought in friends in pals and they never left the direct the left with the people they brought with a metal went anywhere\nAnd they're still on the payrolls and one of the people who was a direct to years ago still shows up on the payroll of the apartment of labor has it been there for at least ten years\nNo kid has sauna payroll [laughter]\nThat's all the details of cynical here as it is like anyone who's worked his state services knows exactly what I'm Talking about the redundancy and management they all know it\nThey've all seen it they all have to work with it you had low paid people doing two and three jobs and and trying to to try to help and do things for people in there and they're getting you know all of a burden with with the workload so when you don't have someone to answer the phone\nDon't blame the people that work there or if you go to the DMV and there's a long line don't blame that poor person at the ... blamed the people in the back\nWas sitting there reading a newspaper behind a closed door that's the ones who should be ... you should be pissed off at not the person at a DMV Kona who has to take a break just to go to the bathroom especially the stuff that you need to really take a look at folks and\nAnd I like to see change I Wanna I Wanna see I Want\nI like to see more more working people at low wages going through into states service I like to see the redundancy the management people they don't need leave and anyone you talk to anyone in state services I tell you the same story and I can't support a a you know\nI could not run to the Democratic party ... Rao runs the state voted for the pension bills to cut the pensions they voted Victor river cola for for the lowest paid people except for the judges those same people are running a state\nSo when you have a local union that this endorsing a candidate who was endorsed by that potty you're endorsing another person for next pension bill that comes through so when it gets caught again don't be surprised because you need people to stand up and fight for the people paying into that pension system\nYou need someone on the Senate level fighting for for the people pay the bills that people paid in eight and three quarter percent of their salary went into the pension for their whole life there were employed and all of a sudden where you're not getting this anymore you're not getting any more and that same\nLeadership voted to get rid of longevity but state workers why I don't know nobody even understand why they did that because after someone did ten years they get a little bonus for being there for ten years they got rid of\nThat why I don't know you wanted to get rid of it you should river with management always make all the money not the people working hard and then you know every day doing all the work and that's what happened and and this is the same leadership is running now the same leadership that some dos Melissa\nCut down they tend to be displaced they find themselves a new place to hang out maybe you have a comment\nSeven six six Thirteen ... is our number as we talk with you um some incredible photos both in the call in the valley breeze showing the

James ... John Brennan John what Rajan Gillette and putting us to sue than that though I I don't know him um and I never really had\nThe opportunity but he spoke very well expressed himself with good ideas and I I generally feel that all of those people will have a good relationship and they have\nGreat experience that they can bring the the city to move ahead in a positive way\n... I I thought it was interesting listening to the entire you know almost two hour presentation there were a number of real good ideas of points that the surface during that forum last night you put it all together you know you go see a lot of candidates that to coming from different directions and\nUm you know you put it altogether there it leads me to believe that there's much that we can do this you know we shouldn't give up on our city there's all this week and you know\nAnd that's why in the ... that leads me into I really pray that this debris and gets in as mayor because I Know he would be able to work collaboratively with this group that I mentioned\nAnd there's no need for a on the job training as I had mentioned these people all have been in positions that they've either serve before or these people are in even\nTheir own careers have made major decisions where if you listen to some of their commentary on who they are and where they came from they've had experience and connections\nMany areas so that they can bring that to the table at the council meetings and really move us ahead it's not all going to be talk it's going to be action because they don't have to learn how to um participate in our in our city government so real\nIf we can just get a people devote a whole new election day that's a whole other issue of course getting people get motivated to get out there and vote and uh I'm always it's disheartening when you when you really look at the numbers as to those who don't even bother you know\nAnd I know and you know ... and that's what I was thinking as I was waiting to get on people always want something for free well hello everybody\n[laughter] very be your urine and then when you think of what you're getting a I mean there are people all around this world who would give their lives are for the opportunity to to be able to vote\nIt's free yeah take it and let somebody else take it and you know we have people that are invading America that want to vote and you know do anything to to get a card in order to do so\nAnd we have people who haven't grown up in our citizens you know for generations and they don't even bother that that's unbelievable\nIt's disheartening\n[noise] yeah I heard Mr ... speak um with Jeff and I graduated he graduated with me I'm In Nineteen Seventy one from ... high school and it was very interesting I I liked hearing what he was saying\nAnd I just want to mention something 'cause I I heard a guy named Mr um guarantee speak the other day and I know he reached out he mentioned uh the people who voted for me to vote for him and I know he said\nHe's not speaking for me but I just want to clarify that I never\nUh you know a gave him my blessing at\nThe end ah to do that and I kind of said that I did not feel comfortable with that\nBecause the people who generously voted for me did so you know because they liked what I had to say or they believed they would have been a great candidate\nAnd so I release them from that they need to vote for who they want to go far you know I'm I just didn't want anyone to think that I was a directing the vote in any\nWay they clarification has been made\nYes because you know no no you know negative comments towards Mr gunny but uh you know I didn't want anyone to think that because to me\nIt was a blessing that so many people thought well with me that um I don't want them to vote as they see fit which I think they already well good that's\nAll right well we thank you for the call was on\nThank you so very much listening All right but I get by\nOh as always thank you very much for joining alright I care by now open line conversation continues\nWhether you grew up in Rhode Island came here and we can all agree that there are some things we hope never and like do boys and clams and the tower arrogance to town being racist rubs off email being on the\nOr other things in Rhode Island that had to change and they are\nFour years ago we had the highest unemployment rate in the nation our\nRoads and schools were in disrepair\nBut over the last four years under governor a Mondo we've invested in our school taking strong steps to reduce gun violence turned our state into a powerhouse renewable energy and we've seen a surge new jobs ... to manufacturing to small business and Rhode Island is ranked learn best children's\nHealth care Gina Raimondo is bringing the change we need\nIn a room I Do for governor ... our children to grow up to enjoy the things that we hope will never\nAnd paid for by frantic Gina remind them\nAll has Roger ... got the job done over the years in the Senate\nRoger knows who to talk to when he has a piece of legislation for one of his constituents he's learned how to build relationships with other senators and representatives to earn the trust and he listens to his constituents sort of carry their agenda till the general assembly for consideration as a lifelong resident\nRoger result they're attending functions and meeting people person and then\nWell I ... and you know I I I Love to travel through towns and there are many communities that do have vibrant main streets ... ... it can be done and we've got ... out here in Rhode Island you don't have to go too far when there was some beauties out in neighboring Connecticut as well in Massachusetts I mean I was in Milford a couple of weeks ago\nAnd there is a downtown area that is a vibrant I mean they're All right they have a couple of an empty storefronts but the vast majority of the storefront off field you know ... it's a it's a certainly presentable or so it it can be done it can be done I just hope I live long enough to see it [laughter]\nWell hopefully like I said I mean there are several scare that enough for them to get elected ... I mean I Would definitely pushed I mean I'm not a that's a socket but I just figured out that you know what I saw that Saddam is it's a beautiful and that's what we spend most of outside so I just\nCouldn't get to see every single day is that what it was around so but I mean some of this as something for people to think of\nAll right well we thank you for sharing that with us Robert ory you to take care bye now\nAlright seven six six Thirteen eighty I had mentioned um last the last couple of weeks ago we had gone up to New Hampshire and a couple of communities look Coney of being one\nAnd a conquered being another\nUh and uh I think there's another little community I mean I Know these are towards some of these like Meredith the New Hampshire had a nice little area some of these a tourist attractions but um you know they take they take advantage and they they show off their history and\nThat's what you want and we're lucky we still have\nSome beautiful buildings in our downtown area maybe you have a comment seven six six Thirteen eighty\n[noise] he uh he stood on and say you can tell you I'm Seventy five Quaker highway in Oxford specializes in traditional unconventional area Italian cuisine [noise]\nBut I Am enjoying dinner and there are a rustic atmosphere as on the line with a cocktail from their full bar and check out they're mostly drink specials as exciting new wind was serving system brunch every Saturday and Sunday Morning beginning with seven AM\nShe is also has a primary function room available for all your function the [noise] you know he stood on and so you tell young [noise] seven eighty five Quaker highway conveniently located off as just one\nOne forty six I'm a mass Rhode Island line in ... Massachusetts ... call five zero eight two seven eight seven five zero zero menu on line at the at least ... ... ...\nFacts matter Mr brand in two thousand and six team of voters one socket rejected al brand as consummate and now he wants to be your mayor\nWho is he kidding just look at his record member of the city council that almost drove our city into bankruptcy Kim into the city investment board that lost millions of dollars in the pension fund opposed full day kindergarten oppose new investment opportunities that would lower your taxes\nPersonally involved in more than twenty law suits oh\nAnd let's not forget he opposed the revitalization of World War two Veterans Memorial park facts matter and it's clear el brie and does not fit to be mayor\nPaid for our friends at least about how do we continue to talk with you\nBe mayor paid for a friend who weighs about deli hard we continue to talk with you until six o'clock feel free to join us good afternoon Iran W when I ride\nHome is the ... are you doing today I Am doing All right how about yourself well\nI was doing pretty good up until a few minutes ago I was just getting ready to to eat my dinner and then I heard something on your radio station that completely made me lose my appetite\nAnd what does that may I ask\nBut that was at Gina Raimondo commercial [laughter] made me sick to my stomach girl dreaming huh yes do I I figured I had to call up now you know no no it at the Republican primary I was a big supporter of Patricia Morgan you know I even\nBought advertisement for on a radio station you know but that's all done now right\nShe's she I don't know what's up with her she's turned our back on on her team and uh she's jumped ship over to Joe ...\nAnd that is a bad move for her in a bad move for the people of Rhode Island so I think that I I Hope brownies listen and you're listening Loni okay everybody has to go and vote Falun Gong\nAlright because Gina Raimondo is going to be the worst thing that ever happened to us if she gets four more years okay now she don't even want to do the four years\nBecause she wanted her her guy I'm Aaron rug and burg\nTo take over the lieutenant governor seat\nSo that when she bailed out two years in because she has higher political aspirations she wants to move to the national stage Rhode Island's not good enough for her\nSo she wanted her her her left wing progressive guy to be there to fill the void when she left but fortunately for us that didn't happen but unfortunately she may end up sticking it out the four years now you know because she doesn't have or a boy in the background the fill the void she'll have to wait for ... ... it'll come on board\nTo to fill that position but anyways I just encourage everybody out there to go and vote for Allan Fung because general one does agenda coming up is\nHorrible terrible terrible for everybody would be a Democrat or Republican well\nIt certainly has been a nasty a campaign on the governor's front that's for sure I matter of fact when I checked the mail today I expected to see another anti phone a flyer in the mail you know from the governor's office and uh it's been one after another the money they\nHave been attacking\nA mayor Fung is just incredible I mean you know it's been one bombardment after another of whether it be a TV and radio ads and these mailers are then we haven't been filling our mailboxes or the past few weeks\nAn awful lot of money is is being spent to see that she is reelected let me tell you\nAnd all that negativity not withstanding her record alone is enough to not vote or back in K tolls on the roads okay\nIt was just a a news report today or yesterday\nAnother child dies in D. C. Y. F. custody\nSets twenty kids now that have died what she's governor in while in D. C. Y. F. care okay she goes out there it runs her mouth is spelled stuff at the mouth about gun control that she needs to protect the children and make everything safe she can't even protect the children that are under her care as it is now\nSo she is so disingenuous with that and that's another part of her agenda she's already announcing now that she is intentions on making Rhode Island the first gun free state\nNot just a ban on her so called scary weapons but now she wants to go as far as have a complete ban on fire I'm On a ship in Rhode Island so that she can use that as a springboard to her campaign for president or whatever higher office she wishes to move on to where she was all done using us\nWhen you know how could she ... she can legally do that ban all weapons in the\nOh yeah she's already she already said she'd do it through executive order now executive order has no legal effect on the public at large okay but nonetheless\nShe and her cohorts in the general assembly that subscribe to this left wing progressive agenda they've been trying to do this for years and fortunately there's enough moderate Democrats left okay I think we're going to be losing a moderate Democrat that represents when socket and the Senate ah\nUnfortunately we lost a moderate and I'm afraid that a liberal left wing progressive Democrat is going to fill that seat but uh we don't need more of these people to side with the governor on this issue you know she's already said that she wants to give it a legal driver's licenses\nThat ... she supports this whole invasion that's coming across the board attempting to come across the border of Mexico she'd be happy to let them come in and giving drivers' licenses and voter ID cards\nThat's the that's the agenda that this woman subscribes to so I might come off a little car so that might not deliver the message as as palatable as some people may but nonetheless everybody needs to go vote for Alan fun because we cannot afford to have Gina Raimondo here for another four years\nNow we hear that loud and clear nor\nAlright thank you thank you buy into governor's race any comments as far as that is concerned feel free to join us we'd love to hear your thoughts on any topic whatsoever with you until six right now it's twenty nine minutes after five\nBrand new ... is your independent candidate for Senate district twenty four one socket

I [laughter] I could I mean can you imagine something of this magnitude\nA ... and again you know I I think when it comes to the beauty of a building it's a it's in the eyes of the beholder or you know our architecture is like that but a big big controversy in a lot of people are not happy with this proposal in downtown Providence you might have\nA comment on another topic um\nI don't know if anybody's going to the movies lately I I'm not a movie person but I guess the number one movie right now is Halloween that's quite a while and makes sense it's it's the right time of the year\nAnd

work for my family Jodie is family y'all better get your crap together because you might not be here tomorrow\nThat message is the one particular I'd say son but that would give it away hoops [laughter] or in any event um\nBut the thing that it says is you know such and such a construction company and they they have everybody to avoid you know the extreme cost of roofing now has all these fancy ways uh names to call themselves\nYou know happy construction or do your roof yeah okay and and I remember one other area where I saw this ah ah\nWas on Facebook you know and uh and somebody said recommend a roofer and so I was thankful when people say John the roof or and I really appreciate that and I see other names and I wish I the speeds come and go and try to remember whether LA we're how to get back to him\nBut uh\nYou know there was one there that they wanted to you know you know a painting company to uh to promote a ... as a roofer oh he can do all roofing oh well\nI suppose if you read the package and it gives you the directions anybody can do a roof to that degree I read the instructions well how do you do start blushing well I don't know that wasn't on the package\nOr you get my point you know uh people can run right where you know well he did a roof for somebody okay I've gone over this stuff to\nIt that one rope ought to roast and they are they're my friends are open I Want to their neighbors but that may have been the only to roast the guy ever did and you're willing to throw eight ten twelve thousand dollars at\nA guy that has done a couple of Roche I could say there's a lot more mean but I just say wake up it's not gonna happen anymore than\nOr were you even be able to look at let me ... you\nKnow uh you know the record China's coming in here a little while he's a lawyer but you're listening to him talk of all the different people that advertise on his shows the lawyers\nYou say\nMy God there's a there's a category for every type of law but all of a sudden a lucky is going to be a roofer and that to Mars gonna paint and next week he's gonna installer a cabinet the week after that it's going to fix your dishwasher I\nListen\nTo the notion so what if you see these post on Facebook that say you know happy ... painting will do your roof because he can\nI used to tell my guys all the time the flashing is where I Need you to use your head for more than a hat rack and rank a tank and put on roofing shingles but there's things that that roof is learning there's ways to do things that roof is Len over a period of time\nAnd these guys that you know when somebody says oh you know so and so did my row I cringe because they think oh Jesus that's not good enough reason to hire a guy is again should properly as you've got to have a basis in the business\nYou know how ... well All right let me go at this for a second\nThere is a Joe Brown out there and then they Gloucester Rhode Island area\nThat is actually now I wouldn't do this if you're shot me I told you in the past I've at employees I've had subcontractors if I'm In a position where I Need to hire a friend of mine has been doing route from for Twenty years to bail me out on a couple of rose rather than lose their job I'm using them\nI'm Still going to guarantee the work you're going to be able to call me if there's an issue but there's a rolling out there that's telling people now he's still running ads he's still putting job shines out but\nHis response is I Can't do your roof till next year I you listen if you call out your brown and he says you can't do it please call me cause I can do to anymore roast before the season it and I'm sure some of the people that I might not petition the hearing me saying there so yeah he's right call me\nCause damage I'd never heard anything so stupid\nThe things that I continue to here in this business are why I'm sitting behind this microphone and people need to have a little bit of a play a little bit of logic to what they think is the reason because logic without without the reason without logic is that what's that saying\nA life a\nLife without a handle is a is like a blade without the handle is like a a brain without logic where you're going to grab the knife right come on people\nA brain without logic where you're going to grab the knife right come up people so I just be careful out there and that was something that I kinda got my gander up about and I didn't really want to but is it your brown running ads taken away from his come competition\nOr at least muddying up toward it because they may be trying to sell jobs for next year hey you dirty rat shut your phone or\nPull your science or pull your adds up this guy that real roof is real Rufus I said people that are in the business every day that can do twenty or thirty more roast before the end of the year the audacity of some people now that guy calls himself a roofer I\nHaven't been seeing the science for that long but people tell me oh he's been around\nOkay but you know what as a roofer bona theater no way because he would be able to take more work so\nI see so many examples of of the nonsense of the business I I I it scares me\nSo when are you know when you think about you know happy that can\nPaint or you just kind of plastic ceiling and and all of a sudden he's going to have the equipment the staging the nailing guns to go up at three decker sidewalk to climb onto a roof and and bring you know shake shake guys are them bona fide guys Rufus every day\n... hours every day and you're gonna get fooled by into hiring some knuckleheads that\nThinks she can you don't want that\nGuy please people in the ocean and that that that that a a a foot doctor is going to operate on your brain\nIs is I kinda like a ... example of you know a guy that paints is going to all of a sudden put together a bona fide crew to go to the roof or by your right listen I'm All right with this stuff\nBut please don't don't make me mad don't be stupid like that or you're snowed here the the most money is another thing\nThe multiple estimate world where the hell that data come from where this salesmanship fall off the you know the out of the equation\nYou know used to be your trust that a guy who's been in business for almost seven years hand to hand touch on the roof okay and some of these new bills you know two three five years hanging a shingle\nI don't know how long they're going to be all I Know is that what is taking a chance for and you can call a company that has been around or or just under seven decades\nAnd where the heck that the idea of estimates come from how many of you and I've said this before I have to bid for your work every week you work for a I\nChef yellow to business name I CBS for CBS and on Monday morning you got a a thousand people sitting in the parking lot and they're all on their iPhones and they're all saying\nI'll I'll do the job I did a you know\nA thousand bucks this week and then somebody else says oh come on I Need to work I'll do it for nine fifty and so on and so forth and editor at the end that are in our maybe you've got to meet their at seven o'clock CBS says\nWhoever just said they were for seven fifty today come on in the rest of your go home\nI\nThis is what is happening in the in the world of estimating ... is listen how many people call three guys to fix their refrigerator when when the food is melting in the freezer\nCome on now committed truth how many people call you know when you're fused panel starts to ... you get a shot you don't have lights you can't turn on a light in the bathroom sink and read while you're while you're on the throne\nHow many people are calling three or four three estimates against the electrical problem fixed how many people call three doctors and say I need this down some people say I get a second opinion\nBut West salesmanship going where's that where's your ability to tell some Phyllis I've been doing this for forty six years\nI've been self employed for forty years you really think you need I'm not going to cheat you because we've been doing this stuff for the day\nThey go to a lawyer they say I don't know I I get two hundred bucks an hour I got to leave because you can get somebody to do it for a buck Seventy five a buck fifty pool where do you draw the line where what what is the is the criteria for choosing\nLet me tell you the criteria for choosing should the experience lengths of time in business you know reliability\nBut I'm getting a lot of ... I got a guy I I\nDon't want to say this because they might be listening but I just had to deal with it trying to do something for a friend giving them the rock bottom price that I could\nAnd you know they have a reason for that what that decision was and I respect that and that my friends so don't take exception to this if you are listening but I'm giving you an example I was trying to help them when something uh gave him my rock bottom number but they've found somebody for a hundred and five dollars shape\nAnd I said okay you got my blessing share later because they are our friends but judge just illustrates that\nMy next endeavors going to be the start of a school where I can train these youngsters ... make them understand that why you think you can work for a thousand bucks now you better charge Fifteen hundred and take that five hundred dollar bill and put it away and none of us in the business to the ... a good enough job you know is saving money\nI Know because I'm Talking to you and I'm telling ya I did\nBut you know you're forced to to to to bed that's like your papers CBS tomorrow morning you're bitten next week for your work is not a job for you there there's a hope for a job I Lived there has been the story of my life for forty years\nI Hope that I got a job on Monday I Hope that I can grab a couple of sales tomorrow I Hope that my company has done enough they put me over the edge what or\nWhoever's coming behind me I don't want to disparage anybody but for crying out loud I'm not here to join ... I I mean the Christian myself right now I'm here to sell I'm here to teach you to help you make a good decision\nSo for goodness sakes I hear the nurses are on strike I hear the teachers are on strike everybody wants\nMore and more and more but uh well only hold so much water so it has more more more come from\nAnd you know we name on us as we need more this when they bought at teachers need more money I don't know but coming from a grassroots industry like I did where you know your your your dog eat dog world if I see somebody making fifty sixty grand a year knowing\nWhat I had to do to get here understanding order wages I'd be saying stop your crying\nEverybody wants more I get it but to ... taxes go down sometimes like that and the and the big country of ours taxes go down sometimes like they have been a to a degree in one socket where's the idea of mom or more\nI I I can talk all day I can talk to you about the two people that just around the building right now I Wonder how did you get a raise talked to many guys yelling out I don't hear nothing crickets ... so\nThe reality is is that there's not a lot of education goes on in the lower ranks in this business\nBut you're fighting against a lot of the youngsters just survive you see a lotta people coming along all of a sudden I think we need a recession because everybody and their brothers a roofer all of a sudden\nA guy who I Would have hired in a heartbeat I recently heard I should say today\nThat this fellow left the company you work for as a a as a as a rep for a a a a shingle manufacturing company\nThat guy had a quite a job at one point we had a discussion and he told me what he was running and I said no tries I Can't pay that go out as a commission salesman you can make it if you can sell that much God Bless ya\nBut I'm not going to guarantee you that my crystal ball might be just said all the time my crystal ball is broken I'm Sorry I don't know what to tell you so here's a guy that I Would have hired and the next thing you know\nHe started a blanket roofing company\nThis guy said I had a good month month I've been doing this stuff for forty years this guy comes out of the black ... does a little home show somewhere so it was a few deals and I feel ... for me a bone of the other guy body is\nEspecially the older than I see some jump around and say you know giant construction why is it called construction here in Austin that people\nBecause he doesn't want to tell anybody refer cause he doesn't want to pay the roofing insurance but when he's up on your roof and he has the last ... if he's not um should probably you're going to take it\nSo there's so many reasons and I can broadly does and I get fresh then I said that your your Jeff Jeff I Want to do to Facebook thing in here I got to try to maybe take a call helped me carry the weight of week after week trying to be\nInventive and and shit here and and talk about things but I think I could\nDo redundant ... well on the show because\nI got some reports last week when I wasn't here and they replayed the show with me and Dennis hey pause a great show I heard it\nOn good I'm Glad we played it again because you know we did that to go at three weeks ago uh you know you never know who's listening and\nIt's just a little bit frustrating so pardon me for my frustration but now we look into the magazine here and ah there's a couple of things that I wanted to discuss in this magazine\nAh [noise] and I just took my shirt or something my glasses or in the pocket\nOr talking about metal roofing and I think some of the dreams that I see when people write these magazines I should have been a writer maybe so I could be grand and allusions area and uh I Believe is most clients a roofing contractors\nStarted seriously considering the lifestyle\nCost of the systems are not lifestyle life cycle cause\nOf systems they specify the rapid growth way obscene and metal roofing would explode\nThis won't happen until taking the long view becomes part of the popular culture in the EU and the United states it may not\nHappen in my lifetime but considering what we've already we've seen already including the green movement on the move toward more sustainable construction the tipping point may not be terribly far in the future what this guy's doing his aide promoting metal roofing and he's saying well not in my lifetime well until I die I Want to eat\nAnd I don't see the value of metal roofing All right I don't see the guy said it two weeks ago look at you know the the roof on tapping lumber not picking on you guys are up and you know I went to school at your kids and I I Love your\nBut the ... and I don't know how long has been there but I'm going to say it's got to be at least twenty five years well guess what the paint warranty on metal roofing is here so I don't know if it's a good deal or you know I'll say why\nThe shingle manufactures guarantee shingles for Thirty years but the reality is that is a pro rated guarantee but\nIn the thirtieth year that Warren ... but\nIt costs about one third what metal roofing does so justify for me now is I'm trying to get the best bang for my customer what\nIs the better deal I'm cell asphalt shingles till I die I can tell you that and when people ask for metal I'll say okay I get your price if they want to buy metal okay that's fine I'm not guaranteeing that finish\nSo I'm guaranteeing the installation okay thank you very much\nAnother thing I see in the magazine concrete roof tiles you know what concrete roof tiles were in the old days they had like a one one hundredth one one tenth of one percent of as best the Senate\nAs best as as a cement tile the asbestos was a binding age and I think we've talked about this and the last couple of weeks so now here they come with another concrete roof trial I don't know\nSo now here they come with another concrete roof trial I don't know but I'd have to look into it it's not something I'm going to win devil to look into it at this stage of the game I ah [noise]\nAnother article another thing they talk about it in a magazine this uh this month a volume of profits don't always go hand in hand so the reason why when when missed a pet is passed away and I took over the company and I got rid of a bunch of people is because you know how many et cetera and can you take\nYou got a bunch of people you've got a bunch of headaches you keep unreal you run to grows you do a little root for low side and you know we hang up your windows every now and then and you don't have to have an accent or a bottle of your truck\nAnd then proper don't always go on to hand in hand with more value so the guy said to me that I I Want to do a million dollars I said well if you could do six hundred and keep a third\nWouldn't you be happy with Chicago or you are\nWell what do you think that extra for hunters going to do and yet the uh the bottom line you think you're going to see another thirty thirty percent\nYou're not going to be maybe a steep ten or Fifteen but the headaches you get with the increased of everything a cost health insurance whatever four O. one K. whatever\nIt's going to be so much show that the profits are going to get eaten up and all I got a you know I did a to roost instead of Seventy\nIt's not going to be with us okay perjury allowed there I'm ... I'm at trapping educate those kids that are just coming in the business or what I tell you guys a few weeks ago four hundred bucks a square on average you love me for saying that number\nBut realistically Diablo money in the bank at the end of the week to have the proper insurance to have a decent truck that's the number I'm not alone when anybody I'm Talking to myself oh wait you're listening\nI Hope so here's another one for profanity in a workplace ... I've been about how many weeks not I haven't really dropped a bomb I better proud of myself I read something recently that they say you want to hang around with a person is was alive because they're generally very intelligent I agree F them open\nA profanity in the workplace boy that's a slippery slope we honored on the job site I tell the guys you know watch your language\nWe had a guy with Tourette's wants a if any of my old friends are listening they'll remember gene God rest his soul Vietnam vet a little bit a clock that free came back from Vietnam or he was the one with the very Tourette's syndrome and his favorite word was asked and he'd walk around the job at", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Woonsocket", "day": "25"}
