I got off of him I Want to start off and we're going to dump tail into this whole business with regard to her but I Want to start off with the fact that ... the mayor of Providence has come right out and said that I Know he's running for reelection but that he wants to abolish ice [laughter]\nNow that certainly caught a lot of people off guard known in the U.S delegation Washington delegation knowing they were saying that but there's been this had a mayor wants to abolish ice disappears floors I had any power to potentially abolish ice in the city of prominence\nHe's pandering surfaces electro base I mean that's just a silly statement as um I I was listening to your\nShow in the last hour and you're correct that the um decision to have our for instance presented our thirties I'm pleased by corporate with ISIS something but um [noise] governor shaky start\nAt a at a fake until you by governor ... Mondo it wouldn't be fair executive decision ... or so um [noise] it's tender and and I know we're going to get to guard or but I think the feral or so has those types of art\nBecause the double standard at the park or see of course you say the one hand versus what he's saying of any other uh we'll get to it but it's it's hard to bring it up and pointed out she has no authority to do or\nIt's it's hard to bring it up and pointed out a he has no authority to do what you're suggesting\nWell and I want to touch on I'm Glad you said that Monday Night I was at the gubernatorial debate it you are right and governor ... brought it up there was this dangerous person who's in the country [noise] convenience Ramon deal Santos he was held at the CIA\nKey with let out he then went on to continue to run a drug operation\nCalifornia Florida somewhere where then you're not known because he he is why he did not have to register as he did not have to register as a sex offender so we could just an end up going living somewhere else\nAnd that he does have we have to really okay no no no no he has to register with the police ... okay and the fact before Megan law right to register with the police for the police would say okay thanks for the phone today the police would have to\nDisseminate information to the community the police are not obligated to disseminate information Russia and the community but I think it gets out there it's we're back channels\nBooks were speaking with our legal experts ... Tim Elizabeth Warren had one of the worst weeks or you could have and the candidate Iceland and all and\nStill trying to do spin control damage she thought she was doing this big video of her announcement that she had had DNA ten didn't you know it does show that she is in fact part of our heritage is a Native American instead\nOf the Boston Globe and was trying to do the story with or did the math\nRon ... corrections outdated that she's one one thousand I'm a I'm a I'm a Native American and actually it's not even Native American they took the ... you have the uh the the Native Americans are upset about it because it's all clean about heritage and why this is important in my question is\nWithout question harbor put her up is a woman of color she ... University of Penn\nOr to send in the eighties you start to as they call check the box where she was clean and she was a Native American industry it seems that the average\nAmerican person actually has more Native American blood than she does is something that she we know she's actually arrived color any way of thinking of fraud or Indian and so forth or Native American but it's just a minute ad in the workplace is someone winning in\nIt you know Joe Smith tomorrow went into a company and kept on that they were on a certain\nUm minority status and then they found out the company found out that they were not because many times that the people like it or not there are\nCertain guidelines and and they have to hire and certain people get hired you know certain a risk you know I'm a level that they have to attendance so with the but she actually I mean not than harm it's going to be could be charged with fraud active trying to pass or on this way\n[noise] well I I Would presume that when she filed her applications for jobs on the other um positions when she checked a box as Native American unless she's doing it under the pains of penalties or perjury\nUm she kinda\nDodgers that bullet and she would always maintained that she had a good faith belief that she had Native American blood based upon what her mother and her paw paw all these other people allegedly told her\nAbout her heritage so she went to say I had a good faith belief um\nThat I had this I'm sure that a lineage\nAnd I think when she was applying for these positions or we didn't have\nAncestry dot com and twenty three at me and all these other companies that clip sort of do genetic testing based upon a saliva sample so how would she approved\nOr disapproved that fact when she was applying for these positions with these tests are available\nUm ditch shame knowingly fraud um University of Pennsylvania did she knowingly defraud Harvard does she know ugly obtained money and positions based upon ally\nI'm sure she did well she ever admit it and could you prevent it would be very difficult to do so um\nYou know she was basically showing that she has one one thousand Peruvian um\nIt's it's it's an embarrassment\nTo the whole system that someone like her credit so flagrantly take advantage of heights and benefits should cruelly being there for legitimate date of Americans who have many times got the short of a stick in this country\nAnd she just saw an opportunity of Iran with it and she took every advantage she could without any justification that it's despicable\nAbout the uh and it was I'll give them credit highly card discovered that he had done this how cooked a cookbook with different recipes and in Cherokee and so forth\nHow cooked a cookbook with different recipes in Turkey and so forth and she says oh this was the old Indian recipe or near family path down and then if you Google it\nInto a an old French right to be regarded regarding on within and crap now I I don't know if you get sued for that but that certainly would seem to be a form of plagiarism [noise]\nWell [noise] my ... my understanding is that she plagiarized a recipe by the personal chef further to conduct yourself when was\nThe word which was published in the New York times of Nineteen Seventy nine so I'm not sure if that's still a statute of limitations on plagiarism plagiarism of that particular recipe but you know she I guess she'll have to consult with Joe Biden as to the\nBest defense for for um [noise] ... shows with expert at it but that aside it's certainly an embarrassment and I know highly cars been talking about it and certain media outlets aren't talking about\n... and did a big segment on as well\nThere's been a deafening silence at other segments of it is yeah why not to be serious bias on missions\nNow that would be that normally what they would do is circled delivers all shut let let's jump to um the Providence Journal it a big story with the war firefighters to this is something that can block on his own with this um this community activists Rob Cody they started to\nGo through in Port through some of the records um the war fire department and as it stands now the current mayor\nMayor Solomon who was taken over because may I have a decent\nUm he stepped down to then take a job with ripped up the firefighters that I Believe we're trying to say oh no no this is the ideal we had with me or have a niece and that's why it doesn't appear on the contract Tom and won't comment but it it certainly gets off the me or I believed him that there there could be some uh\nYou know it's being investigated and that could certainly people being charged in this um [noise] I don't know what the color scheme or just the way that they would determine hours worked in overtime pay back in India it's obviously it's so foreign to anything that would go on and the private sector [noise]\nWell and typically all Israel is a pilot\nHe does have a hard fought negotiated contracts betraying the governmental authority city or the town and the union ... you know teachers are cops or firemen so to say that as a side deal with the um [noise] ...\nI think mayor Solomon is well within his rights to say we're not doing this anymore if it's not a contract right up the contract\nUm is there an ability now for the city of war to go back and what we would call claw back money from the recipients of this money who received it I'm outside of the purview of the contract\nAnd what Solomon administration have\nAn appetite to go after these union members to try to get money back\nFrom them I'm just so clearly wind up in court um it might be Arbor trouble under the union contract\nBut if it's not in a contract I'm not sure any um arbitration provisions would find it but clearly this will be litigated and it sounds like Joe Solomon has called I'm a fire department\nAnd its union for an improper practice I think he's right on\nAnd if I'm understanding this correctly but I'm reading right on him and so there was just telling the monthly credit that was established by the time but it is the monthly credit with outside the terms of the contact in Warwick firefighters took typing credits while receiving payments on you take time\nI I mean unless I'm reading this incredibly it almost sounds like they were collecting collecting twice\nTo have a double dip like exactly yeah\nAnd I had this whole business was a separate deal outside of the contract we have a mayor I but he said I had to take the thing that could could that could hold up in court\nYes what do they hold up to cite agreements forcible gals\nNow so I Would not be an force or most of these contracts for cops and farm et cetera have provisions that if you retire there's ways for you to collect unused vacation time and the ... time but this is a clear double dip yeah there's no other way to look at it\nAnd finally the um the mayor of Fall River Tim I'm you know we've seen at one point as a rising star this petition calling 'em for him to step down\nHe's a young guy I Believe he attended prominence college certainly has been in the news quite a bit very theory a investigation

these days so when I hear that a fellow resented just destroy somebody somebody down and watch it for him that's\nRight when you were just sat and that's why you're just you're just said you know I didn't quite hear everything in a matter of ... and you know what you're going to get out of that are watching it for him and I thought you know like I Can't just let that go without saying I'm

on a remote enough so\nWell what do you take that money into jak let's just say I'm going to take your theory All right I'm going to take your theory I I ... and we're going to play it out I I don't believe\nThat there was ever a meeting between governor ... the I Know I'm not saying that they couldn't have been some coordination\nBut the two of them are too smart ... ever for two of them ever personally meets now that doesn't rule out that there could be a go between person but if you want to tell me that the two of them actually\nSat in a room and came to a deal I don't believe that I Believe they hold on I but I Do the governor Mondo\nWould see something like this as mere politics as horse trading and therefore making some promise of a deal with someone\nIn exchange for them doing it I think she would see that no differently a justified this away or many times when they try to get boats\nYou have to make concessions I I also think that the person to focus on is her chief of staff brat spread smiley I could see him be authorized\nTo make a promise to a a go between right someone that's a third party that would in order to coordinate the deal but here's where people need to know and I do know I Know both of them there is no legitimate reason\nFor Joe ... to hate Allan Fung none of this and I said this to him\nNone of his campaign makes sense at all if he felt this strongly and he felt he's got resources\nAnd I'm going to put in the time and everything else than he had every possibility to defeat him in a Republican primary how can you say I Can't beat the guy in a primary but I'm going to beat him and the general election you it makes no sense at all and Allen wrong on Alan\nBond his not I know the two of them all back human Tony fourteen\nAnd twenty

that that to me was a game changer because that is not someone that is running to win you know when I interview these people and I've interviewed Joe we talk on the path to victory Wright Patt victory if his path to victory\nHis idea of victory is two percent to get you there is no way to interpret that he's working to get Gina Raimondo reelected because if you say all I Want to do is prevent Allen bond from becoming governor in essence then you're helping Raimondo become the governor rise\nAnd he made a job I may be very clear Joe drill oh he is Seventy five years old he is a means\nHe is he

protesting outside his house which I Love or they're banging things it's just annoying him to no end I don't care if this may never sleeps another wink the rest of his life for what he's done to these

should not be on the street what I think will probably happen is I have to imagine\nThe Providence police are watching this man like hawks and hoping he does one thing wrong one slip up he'll be back in jail\nSo I think that's probably the best hope I mean if you Jay walks they'll pick them up so\nAh they put the ... when he's released into the public they put the police are under tremendous

correct All right so um so he she will not be there but\nMaybe we can have um somebody read a statement and your name or something like that are so at least to be represented that evening\nI'm sure I'll be very well represented\n... of your good let's begin Ira interview by getting a little bit of a biographical a sketch or a historical a sketch of a Lynn Taylor who is she and um and then we'll Oscar about running for office Lynn Taylor a little bit of background\nSigned born and raised here and once I get I'm I'm a third generation business owner here as well um\nYou know I had a great experience coming living and once I get into you know I went off to college and moved out to New York and then I came back and I noticed a\nDifference in climate here so you know I Want it and just make a difference and the only way to make a difference as to step up and do something rather than get complain about it I'm I'm here trying to do something for you\nSo you started thinking about running for office um was it two years ago a year ago or six months ago or\nSeven years ago about a year after I came back when I realized I was going to um I ... and I was going to say here I make a life here\nOn the same time I decided I was going down there and I I I thought about it till around the same time but now I felt that there is that now I'm taking the next half like as funny profits\nAnd uh I noticed that uh you'd take quite a quite a bit of interest in or is that NOAA is now the no ... of the ... this is your boy right\nAt my sunshine uh-huh [laughter] and\nSpend a lot of time with them\nYes ... that's my that's my first job by as being a mom\nHas mostly from now who are parents that you know that will always come first and you know at that being said\nThat's my that's my reasons for wanting to rhyme mostly because I Want to make sure and ensure that you know he has a nice community grow up in the same way that same kind of community that I grew up here\nAre you ever concerned or I was looking at um I guess a couple of months ago a crime statistics came out and and I'm where I'm up there with the tuck it in Providence I'm On crime now for me for Roger I don't I don't see much crime or you know nobody's uh [noise]\nFor me for Roger I don't I don't see much crime a you know nobody's a\nYou know Rob my car on my house or a sheltered me or anything but those are those that bother you or at all or having when sock it the way up there on the crime statistics I guess the crime perpetrated against other people have you had any crime perpetrated against you\nI really don't see as much crime as they say that there isn't one side and I don't know um what the statistics are exactly on that but you know we always want to keep crime and you know neighborhood watches and things like that and people involved in that community um you know at the forefront of thanks so\nI mean yeah of course I mean we want our children grow up in a in a safe environment so no matter what you know it could be the safest it could be the safest city on the planet and you would still want to make sure that your child is as more than anything\nYou know I kind of agree with you that one of those statistics are came out no I don't have them in front of me either so I Can't the right or give it throw any numbers or your way of no just generally speaking a I said well uh I guess the figures are there but it's not like I'm afraid to walk down main street or or\nOr do anything in city walk in the city park I feel comfortable\nYeah I I certainly feel comfortable for the most part being here um I I always get that warm feeling from all the ones that get residents I think we take care of our own here which is something that's very special and it's very um endearing as an endearing quality to on TALK at\nThose pockets city council is what ... is trying to get a seat or other than their\nTheir um in looking at the city council meetings whether you\nSee them on cable TV or attend in person or whether you listen on the radio there there's a lot of bickering going on there a lot of a lot of fighting sewing Lynn pale and just to the city council um of how how are you going to approach it comes to make it a\nShall we say more civil atmosphere there than what is now\nWell let me start by saying it's very unfortunate that you know rather than try to\nCreate a community environment we'd rather attack each other and carry each other down\nUm so you know like I said social innovation it's a bullet point on my pop farm it's on campus and also means you know manners\nThat stress manners being well managed to each other you don't have to like somebody to sit in the same room with them and listened to what they have to say actually if you listen they might be right you know I I Would suggest that\nWe look at the facts instead of where it's\n... ... we look at the facts rather than who is dating back um and I think we might be able to get to the bullet points a little faster that way\nFor civility I'm being civil and nice to each other a I think is something that no matter who is elected to the one socket city council and the ... election cycle I think we probably would like to see a little more of that going on\nCorrect I mean for instance this morning it was the very last minute thing that I have to make a business trip next week um\nIt shows good ... and Julie as the half of my house that we were able to to switch without any any problems I mean simple things like that saying you know what no problem I can do that favor for you that that is what creates unity it creates community\nAnd you know it creates a better confident about our console creates you know better ideas and everything going forward for the city\nIf they're just dialing in Lynn Taylor is with us running for city council one of the things that\nAh I've observed about the city council is I'm a lack of youth meaning that if you look at the\nIndividual council members up they're sitting there\nYou can see that I'm In no disrespect to any of them you can see there are a little bit on the older side than on the younger side I'm sitting in the studio here with ... Baylor and\nYou're a little bit on the younger side than the old aside and so is that something that um that I think is a needed a new ... maybe I'm\nAn approach from a a younger demographic\nI Believe so I think getting\nUm my generation involved and community is really really important and\nI mean we're so much so on social media and interactive and technology rather than being interactive in real life so having somebody to represent their stomach this generation is very important and saying hey you know what and set up sitting behind the computer writing about it get up and go\nAnd be part of that and be at the forefront of things\n... as you look at your social media or a phone in and check things out\nOther a lot of the younger people registered to vote I mean it's one thing to be on Facebook and uh and exchange views but I'm the only thing that's going to get you liked it is for somebody to go to one of the polling places they're in and vote for Olympic ...\nCorrect um we're hoping that you know myself you know people like Julie Brown the younger candidates you know have enough people in our circle to\nGo and register and go to those calls and you know I personally know several people that had no idea how voting work then they went and they write a start and you know there'll be voting not just for myself but for for other candidates as well\nAll right so uh it's important to get that demographic uh sure right the register\nAnd I think for everybody you know that's not just for myself it's not just further them you know the younger can and that's I think it's important for everybody or across the board to have people registering as as younger voters\nNoah in euro little um I guess you would say uh this is your hand out a ... a\nA handout or you're talking about being a a business owner and um and cultivating a business and uh I'd like to maybe evaluate the business climate here in in one socket from looking at all on a hill plaza to um\nThe shopping center beyond that um to downtown to ah you know I'm you know what do you think of a of the business climate and and what can we do to improve\nWell let's face facts I mean we can look at me and certainly can see that it's a little stagnant correct but I think that you know the tax rates care a lot of people away but you know like I was telling everybody when I came back here it's really cheap to open a business here\nYou know the overhead is really inexpensive so even if the taxes are a little bit higher it really balances out in your favor to open a business here so\nYou know to be able to encourage 'em a small business and environment would be great for for when socket and also to encourage corporate ... to ... and you know hopefully\nWhat you make a pot roast they\nMay be sound you get on my right we'll take that they have [laughter] we'll take that go ahead breaded chicken\nBuy one get one free this is from Purdue is the frozen version buy one get one free KM skinny these hot dogs for Ninety nine a package apples mackintosh Cortland three pound bag to for five dollars progress so vegetables classic so since that time of year ten for ten dollars\nAnd prego pasta sauce to for three dollars two jobs three dollars I'll give you the last two last but not least All right that doesn't really make sense but I'm going to do it anyway truck feeling crazy to crystal guys had a spring water twenty four pack two Ninety nine and hold on to your seats ladies and gentlemen\nArizona Ice T O O\nA gallon two gallons four dollars from talking shops have bought\nAnd now the UN ... leave the studio to go get it done yet you got to stay here you cannot leave and get that ice tea by value I'll call it in all the time I ...

o'clock and time for a focus on law\nA weekly radio feature here on W. on our ... our offices of\nMock Smith joining us as usual from the lower office is lawyer Lynne ... she's in Studio right now and good morning to you that morning so a little bit about the law offices of mark Smith and the services that are offered there surely\nBoth the lore officers of mark Smith and services that are offered there\nSurely the offices of mark Smith is located primarily\nAt one seven six said he darling highway\nAnd our Smithfield sweet one oh one not the first full of all that's important for my elderly clients in particular the phone number there is seven six nine four one to zero mark also maintains a satellite office in Providence who might find that location for those who might find that location more convenient it's on ... street near the district\nCourt on the phone number there is to seven to fourteen thirty to explain every week or a general practice law firm but Mike Smith and I each focus our practice in different areas of law as many attorneys do these days [noise]\nMy focus is his practice on areas involving litigation both civil and criminal civil litigation is just about any ... you can imagine being resolved by a judge or a jury in a courtroom [noise] um the lion's share of civil actions involves um\nThings like contract now excuse me contract cases are one of the types of civil lawsuits ah disputes over real estate dispute between businesses but the lion's share of those are personal injury cases where you suffer damages or injurious results of the negligence and another in a duty that old to you [noise]\nUm that can be in terms of malpractice by a doctor or the professional it can be in terms of maintaining a defective condition on your property that causes injury to another are introducing a defective product into the market that injures other people\nLanguage that's adverse to their interests shall we say if you have a an executor who's a child that maybe isn't me sitting under the will anything other little because mom or dad said it gives you an apple you were alive so I'm not giving you anymore and they're not happy\nAbout that they might want to try to hide the existence of that will\nSo that they would be able to take their share as a child under the entire state statute so that's why the statutes in place that if you know that there's a will the executor is charged with to bring it into the probate court in just filing it sits on file at the pro the court today as a matter of\nMost probate courts do not like that and they do not want to accept your wealth because they take up precious space in the city's votes um but the statute isn't there it is in place and it is an obligation that you will have to comply with if somebody calls you want it\nAll right and no back to a a question that I could just a\nLike a just copy and paste as soon as this one here because um [noise] that keeps coming at us going to come to us more she you're going to hear it again I should recall you\nAnd see what's your answer is auto and socket is there any record so I can take for someone posting false negative information about my business on line ... whole question of online and since the last time we've talked I don't think there's been any new laws that have been passed that uh\nThat uh our containing this issue so uh we'll just let Lehman go to\n... unfortunately um\nAll of that would be covered all that's left all of that would be covered by federal law I'm\nA general rule social media and wire communications which is what social media is are covered by federal statute\nAnd if you're taking a look at the Congress and the Senate is not a tremendous amount of those people that are particularly well versed in social media and trying to be kind and gentle by what I say some of them use it shouldn't um some of them don't use it at all and are probably holy entirely unfamiliar with it so has it been addressed\nNow is it being addressed adequately probably not can we anticipate it will be addressed adequately within the next year\nI doubt it so here's what we're left with the whole state of the law as it is now if somebody is making negative statements about you that are on true if they are written it is liable as they are verbal is slander\nLiable or slander are actionable you can sue them in the event you suffer some real damage to your business\nIn other words because they're posting nice things about us suffered a downturn in your business something you have to demonstrate to evidence censor the testimony of an accountant or or um [noise] an auditor or whatever person might be able to explain why you made a hundred thousand dollars last year in this\nCity you're only making sixty since this person posted the negative comments about you that's what we're left with if we're talking about postings on social media that is not planner because there's not verbal so it would be considered liable that would be where it's actionable\nAnd it's going to be up to you to sue them you're going to be paying some lawyer up front for expenses and there are probably a binder to to carry them over a some sort of initial fee that they will bill against in order to get the ball rolling with no guarantee of recovery because as I've said many times here before\nGet the ball rolling with no guarantee of recovery because as I've said many times here before a judgment is just a piece of paper that says you're entitled to something but you can't get blood from stone so if you're seeing somebody who has nothing\nYou're not going to be able to recover any damages from them and again a lovely judgment you can hang on your wall and also when the correct another misconception does the court help you chase them to collect damages no\nThat's on you and I just want to make sure that you're aware of that before you go into any sort of sued\nFor libel and slander\nSo as a practical matter what can you do I wouldn't claim to be well versed in social media but I Do have a teenage son and a Twenty one year old daughter so I have a million already with social media all forms they're all of them have reporting requirements where you can\nReport of a statement that you believe to be improper or incorrect or an outright bulls they fly to them and ask that it'd be removed some of them are going to have the ability of you to go in and remove a comment if there's somebody that is a friend on Facebook\nYou can block them for example using Facebook for an example almost all social media has that capacity where you can block someone\nIf we're talking about other review sites like Yelp and such like that it's not a whole lot you can do other than to report back to them that you would like to report\nYou would like to make a response and a lot of those to provide for you as a business to have the ability to respond by saying things like I'm Sorry your experience was so negative could you please contact me I'd like to discuss it doesn't remove the comment\nNo but it doesn't make you look like you're just ignoring it it makes you look like you're trying to be proactive and try to resolve it even if you're already spoken to this person it's worth putting that posting there that it looks like you've at least try to do something kind of soften the blow that's the practical in life that give you the rest of it\nUnfortunately Congress has not yet up to speed with the rest of the population\nMotor come we hope I hope when socket\nIs it legal to make you come into work early willow pay even if you're not technically working there are just preparing I Want to avoid the stigma being about up all I've seen employees be Harris for this complaining for not being paid\nFrom the minute they walk in\nSo that's always an interesting thing I mean I don't know how you work in your office but you must have generally what we call the work\nDay and if you get in Fifteen minutes earlier should you be paid for it\nI can tell you in our office we have set office hours you're expected to be\nIn your location your office your desk\nBy a particular time of year expected to remain there until closing time when when you're relieved of duty is um and you're paid for that time um you also get a lunch hour and and everyone knows mark is a pretty liberal boss has said that many times before he was very understanding [noise] um so it's not as difficult\nWhere I work at now but as I've said before\nMany times I worked at social department store\nMany moons ago and social department store was open from nine in the morning until nine at night when when you open the doors at nine o'clock in the morning the employees and not walking in with the customers the employees have to be there and be at their registers in advance where the employees paid from the time they got there\nWhile they were setting up their registers counting back the money in the drawer cleaning things up making sure the trash browser empty did they get paid for that\nNo we never got paid for that if we couldn't get\nCustomers out of the store by nine o'clock which believe me happened a lot and we were there 'til nine thirty or quarter to ten trying to close that story did we get paid\nNo and that is not uncommon in business you do not get paid from the moment you walk in the door till the moment you leave even if you're performing work related duties\nAnd I'll do respect Illinois a million years ago so little about today\nSix hours or that long ago the horse in eighty six my apologies and then my daughter would say yeah you know eight years before I was born\nTen years before I was born but whatever [noise] um\nNowadays is it different not\nReally if you're performing work related duties and they're telling you you have to be your desk by eight Fifteen in order to deal with people are coming to the door at eight thirty then they should be paying you from eight Fifteen if they're telling you you have to be there however if you choose to come in early to set up\nAnd you won't be fired by for simply strolling on the door at eight thirty with the rest of the customers they can only pay you ... they only have to pay you from eight thirty\nOn if you have a question about that\nYou can call the department of labor and training you can look at their website is informational they do have a lot of information on there as to overtime and sorts of things like that\nThat might be what this falls into but take a look at that\nI always like to tell you I'm not well versed in labor law it's not my area of practice\nBut as a general rule you get ... hours you come in early ... you don't get paid extra unless your employer tells you you're going to get overtime is you're still here working Fifteen minutes half an hour after your work time if the employer is not letting you leave\nThat to different you're entitled to overtime but if you choose to stay in business shop so it's not waiting for you the next morning you're not necessarily entitled to overtime for that\nIf I Need a lawyer we're going to do\nI Hope you think gives all officers of mark Smith a call again our primary offices in North Smithfield than other there is seven six nine four one to zero and we also have a satellite office in Providence they're the number is to seven to fourteen thirty two\nJoining us today thank you and we'll see you next time or it I'll be here\nI'm a little later with WNPR our weekends we do watch the valley [noise] this weekend don't schedule of happening later it was shocking\nWe know Jackie can do we've seen it how many times it never mind that he turned into a Reggie Jackson in the ... in the post season this year but we're just as far as that goes defensively Jackie bribing Jillian set and now you're going to ... that's how foolish of it was that guy\nA camp to try to take second base the other night\nDown three runs after he line shot down the right field line of Kimberly he's got a single the start the ending he turns the corner and tries to test ... are you serious so he was ... he was out and I mean it was just something to see every play they needed to make they made and it's like if\nIt's like it's like you want to pinch yourself it's like we've turned into the twilight zone we got jak out right you can't get Jackie Bradley junior rowdy is heading monster home runs\nYou got these ... these cast off Steven PS who the heck we knew anything about Steven pass you might've heard of him playing for the blues yes but you didn't scare anybody\nAnd then David Price comes out nails on short rest for the first time in ten years I never want to postseason game he goes six drawn nine strike outs know walks are you kidding me this is ridiculous the only\nThe only thing I can say about this as these guys ... years old and itchy and they also feed off one another\nThey do and you can see it it's you know you want to know you're saying it and people are listening and if\nThey if they watch it they know what you're talking about but if people\nAren't as familiar with the team maybe or a casual fan maybe you listen to the broadcasts on the radio but the visual the optic of this team when you're watching these guys believe in each other and pick each other up um the other night when death is made the miss Q A\nAnd then they come right back and hit the home run and and you forget I mean even in the few moments where they they had\nMoments where you started to go oh no problem or a mistake or an arrow are just\nNot a good moment they bounced right back and just the ... the togetherness and his team\nAnd you said it a few minutes ago in this call it starts with Alex Cora it has to what else minus JD Martinez this is basically the same team as a couple of couple of additives obviously Steven passes huge of all the but I mean the core of this team is the same\nAnd it's like night and day it's like night and day from this year the last year\nOne observation I made in the dugout Joe ... when the guys are late and they like to go up to ... yeah they always stand beside Alan ... and they have like a little drop back and forth yeah we'll talk back and forth that is that sort of\nLoose and they will do see that you know and and they asked um I forget who they were talking to last night they asked one of them about it and I might have been Jackie and because they were interviewing J. B. J. was the American league or else yes MVP\nAnd ah he said out scorer in the clubhouse will kind of hang out with us he said he'll come sit down with us now you know Bradley in ... and ... and and and bats and they'll say you know what's going on\nGuys and he's he's so in touch with each individual player and not not as not what we obviously know about what they can do on the field but personally you know I remember the national I'm not going to mention names I don't want to get in trouble but I remember there's\nThere's there's national national this radio show in Boston that these guys come on and they just absolutely ripped out core of talking about\nJackie Bradley and and come into work and smiling and he's kept a smile and you want to talk about a story of a guy that you know people want it to get treated off they wanted to send this guy away for a bag of Doritos\nAnd the ... we kept them our car stuck with them all year and here we go and eight hundred O P s in the second half and he ends up becoming a playoff icon now it'll live on forever what he did no matter what and you look at it and it's just out Cora knew\nHe knew the defense and he knew if he stayed with this guy that this guy was hitting the ball hard it was just he was hitting it right out people and he needed to uh to find the holes and and he has and we all know what can happen with Jackie when he gets hot\nWe know about the hitting streak he went on a few years ago and ah he's lock them right now and you know they got time the rest bats\nJ. D. game plan I don't know who we are going to play I'm I'm going to assume Los Angeles wraps up tonight but either way it's going to be a it's going to be a fun series\nJoe I finish up it's a young team and it's just beginning it's just the beginning of the ...\nOf it I I sat in light lounge chair and watch this season I've I've had I've had this much joy me the and launching a chain or in my life\nYeah first ours babble joy as far as baseball goes you're watching the greatest Red Sox team ever I mean the statistics Hi back it up and it's and it's and it's more than the when it's more than the wins it the way they make it all the way they make us feel and it sounds like what do you mean that we make us feel the way they can just rise to the occasion\nSomebody different every night contribution from\nFrom everybody from from that ... to ... to Bogart says\nJoe ... off the bench and getting all\nYou know what that is though and I'll let you go on this because I got some a couple of people waiting you know what that is that the mark of a champion when it's somebody that I drink and somebody can step up like that that's a championship team thank you for your call and we'll talk to you from going to take care of my front\nIs Joe ... good morning you were on the joke show that Morning Joe how are we are excited this morning I woke up and immediately the smile\nWith from air to air because I'll tell you what I cannot believe\nI you know and I said it yesterday I said it would be just like David Price to come out tonight and throw the game of his wife and I ... I mean watching the replay the highlights last night he was dominant striking every ... ... uh and then just everything else that happened in this series\nJacki turning into Reggie Jackson or whoever you want to put in David Ortiz I mean the playoff magic has been ah passed down to him and I'm\nJust really excited about a team that that they would everybody said they couldn't do everybody said when they had all the winds this year I Believe it when I see let's see what they do when they play the Yankees and the Astros well guess what we stopped them both on the home turf and onto the next one\nI wasn't going to tell us about it but I Can't think of something or you can ...\nI wasn't going to talk about it but I just made me think of something\nOr you can ... certainly turned to whatever you like\nTo think of something that bug me all year long about some fans he still could comment on the side of them as well they what can they do against good came they only bad thing\nYes and on your on thinking wait a minute you know now they're five hundred against the good teams are good for the five hundred again\nHave it's kind of a simple math in Atlanta and yeah I'm here today obvious is right\nYeah um but anyway you know a meal I 'cause I didn't follow his really all that much howling like of all their [laughter]\nThey are and there's there's so much meat on that Houston bone that we can get to we we can get into and I it's I'm not going to make it a whole thing like the ... like a whole show about it but we could about this guy that I'm sure you heard about taking pictures in the clubhouse\nThe scandal that came out that the red Sox reported off the game on of Houston I'm\nHaving a guy that I'll get into all the details after but there's that there's the fact that they put the Instagram video up by Alex brag amended of Nathan evolve e before his start 'cause Houston hit three home runs in a row of him back to back to back\nAnd then there's just that I mean they won the world series they they were able to draft a very good draft picks because there were a lousy team for so many years and they got the number one picks a and they I remember reading in Sports Illustrated a few years ago how they were going to be a great team and and you know albeit they are\nBut um they got a little ... they got a little too good to fast I guess I I don't know what it is but I I Know what you're saying and I don't know what about it\n... it bothers you allow you feel they're on likeable but you know they won ONE Championship and and they did it in a year that they overcame I'm a great uh you know disaster with the hurricane and it was a great story last year\nOr that they were able to do that everybody was kind of pulling for them and they got Verlee under and he was able to claim that mountain and he's a hall of fame pitcher and just the whole story last year was great for Houston\nAnd then you come back this year and just I don't\nI don't know if they were as arrogant as they came off to me maybe I was reading\nOn line I while I agree with you and\nThe thing that you just hit on mostly why I'd a like a Red Sox turned it around as an organization to add a couple of California's but from all fought you know yeah it's ... will say that I see\nA dad that historical come back in the well I mean how can you like to go out all day all my God I thought what it's all got to get on his acting like they've done it\nI ... and that's you know I think that helped us\nWe kinda came into this whole thing as in how do you come in as the best team in baseball with a hundred and eight wins and you're the under dog kind of mentally to the I mean we ... it and we and they were if you think about it I especially when a when our and judge walk by playing New York New York on his iPhone and now we've got this clown and he's not a clown\nOn the field by the way brag money's an unbelievable play Oh absolutely you know to put a video up who you Alex pregnant you just came into the limelight this year\nTom Karen told me a ... a month ago you know this pregnant guy he might be one of the best and he is he's one of the best way as I've seen on a long time but what are you doing taking the time instead of wondering about worrying about finding videos on the on the Internet\nTo to make fun of Nathan involved the giving of home runs maybe spend a little more time not swinging at the first pitch in and lining up to ... to end the game I mean you you look at the arrogance on of hands who I think is classy in that regard the way they handled that after the game maybe it's because it's protege out score a beat 'em but\nWhat a valuable commodity that that's been in this postseason to have a guy a cast off from the angels that went to Japan to pitch last year I started the urine Puckett I got to see 'em pitch a bunch of times down there he ends up being the main guy and and again\nYou know Don Brodsky we all criticized him or he didn't have didn't do anything that the deadline but he knew he had Ryan brings ya\nAnd he went out and got Steve pass made of all the every single guy that he's gotten has made a big ... a big step in this thing and uh what can you say\nThat's why they don't that's why they do what they do that very good at their job and we doubt um and you know you can't always predict what's gonna happen but when they get it right man they look good and right now a ... he's looking good\nAnd then you've got a got better than the plant let you better slash Edelman what that what that Edelman as\nI was a that was that was\nThat was I tell you what do these guys are buyer and I'd also as you know what I mean we don't know that will keep going up against the walls\nYou know what I mean you've got better currently out there you go to Jackie Bradley you know ill and grand slams in a JD Martinez I'm surprised that shot last like that for the oil and that side\nWas um now that was as good as it gets absolutely as good as it gets and um you know we we have more in store I'm sure I'm being joined by Brendan McGill a online to see this if I don't know if you're able to call back but we only got a few minutes for Brendan and we want to definitely get his take this\nSo if I don't know if you're able to call back but we only got a few minutes from Brendon and we want to definitely get his take this morning as he calls us always attend but I'd love to hear back from you in the show if you have time a little later\nJoe I'm all set that that that tell you what I have a great show my friend\nWe love you and we're going to be talking a lot more about it hopefully you can tune in and uh we'll get we'll get back\nIn ... thoughts on Monday you gotta thank you my friend but then we can [noise] good morning you're on the joke show on Joe how are you ... you ah\nAh again I I thought of a bunch of people last night and you will definitely one of them we uh it was a great night for all the fans of the team and the people that coverage the team itself I mean so many roads to go down and and storylines I was just speaking of a few of them when probably right as you are calling in\nThe rye and breezes story obviously David Price and what he did last night to beat them against all odds on short rest nobody thought that could be possible maybe\nAnd then Jackie Brown v junior I mean my goodness what he what he did turning into Reggie Jackson side and so this Halloween season or Mr October himself a\nDon't know where to begin I Can't believe but I guess I should believe because we've been watching this thing since it started in a in in what much so uh I'll let you take the flu and my friend\nAlright I'll just go to his policies are right now and look at all the things that maybe how ... have worked at gas or Red Sox and you think they were around them\nChris Sale as a short circuit the parents as as mysterious illness outlets adding Craig Campbell as sudden loss to commit ... the ... the front runner I Believe the twenty eighth ... not really a heading finding his dry here and these playoffs\nAs that or no because other people have stepped up we can talk about prop ... cycle you know what you're talking about ... of all the Jackie proudly junior Mr Big hit ... it's it's amazing how ill divers yeah\nWent from being like almost I wouldn't say it I thought ... we think we wanted to get more defensive with our water viewed as a third baseman look at the big hit hit last night I guess just the heartland huge\nEverybody has been stepping up to maybe thinking okay if the red Sox for a joy this October the stars the big names that were going to have to carry the load ... it has it been the case it's\nBeen absolutely lake ... it's like you flip the switch from bizarro land Brendan I mean ... like you said\nYou know Chris Sale basically are not very effective I Know what he did in the Yankee series that that like they can't don't we won't talk about that but ... going you know most presently which has happened my most recent past and I should say uh\nYou you had them all and you had the mall and injury uh which cause the past to play and again you know like I said earlier in the show we all knew CPS ones but that wasn't a guy that you know you you you soon as you found out the red Sox declined Steve pass you grow up every one of your friends\nHe was so excited to make sure they knew a CPS was a nice piece but it wasn't anybody that you know to show the world the shock the world that they got him he ends up being a major thing and you mentioned you know the diversity finding out what ... hours before the start\nOf the post season that they weren't going to have Steven Wright a guy that we all thought maybe the answer to uh uh the bullpen puzzle that we've all been trying to figure out how name Don ... company you're going to solve all year\nAnd then ... and then ... employees the strategy of bringing starters in starting with reports hello and then obviously we know accrue sale did against the Yankees and again we saw that in this series last night with the ball the house sitting was it for ... for Mr Instagram Alex Brennan to see a hundred and two mile an hour fastball go by him\nOh it was poetic justice said uh you know they can say\nOh it was like our judges have fought all the all getting the uh the tunnels at Fenway Park after the game but I mean if you want to poke the bear the call Chuck Edwards you know that's just what happens you know you ... you got to live with the consequences and uh you know just like a judge had to wear ... federal where now Joe\nAbsolutely and you know you look at them again just you know we can we talk about a playoff review ... um and I I Know you've probably heard when I heard this morning I heard an interview with um ... this morning\nTalking about tipping pitches and they they they thought this off in the last couple of appearances and I don't know if you heard that if they've got that figure it out I wondered if it was a health thing\nAnd then obviously he's still throwing gas I mean the velocities there so that would lead you to believe and maybe it's not a health thing because if it was would he be throwing you know his fastball like that so\nI don't know if you know anything about that but general being what he's been and like you said no sale or J. D. with the big home run\nLast night offering land up but he's been consistent but not you know earth shattering it's been like you said ... Christian Vasquez hit the big homerun\nDenver as a ... with the catch the other night you basically have you have something you could say about each player on this team and and and that's usually what you know championship teams are made of\nAbs oh it is and you know if you look at the collective payroll of the guys we just mentioned it's almost like chump change Joe is probably not even an equal to what they were price makes any here that's what if anything else people will say\nOK the red Sox have the highest payroll and they should be hair and yes I Do believe they should be here given a you know all the auto body that John Henry and Tom water days on browse ski have signed off on this team I mean you almost felt\nThat they are under dog story all votes because you know maybe going back to New York one of the service was tied at one one\nThat you know it could be a long shot for them to come back here send it hurts your games you know all I was thinking oh there are fortunate the call waiting for the split what are they gonna come back to Fenway Park for a game six because you are so tough and all that and all that crowd has got to be kept up with everything ...\nYou know the resiliency that team actually acquaint resiliency with a hundred and eight what changed your stage based come naturally things come easy but as you look at everything\nBeyond the surface you see that yes I have to overcome some things and most notably a David Price you know was a you know maybe his off ... and the Yankees Chris Sale is help correct kept all his such mass issues there's been a lot of things at the same as are forced to overcome it\nThey're emotionally champs a house and he told us ...\nAbsolutely uh looking at this now if you are Alex score or you know and people were debating this this morning I think it's I don't know if it's been officially announce for formally been announced that sale is going to go Tuesday but\nDo you do you keep things going the same way or do you all through your your thinking at all with with knowing that there is something the ... the interview I heard this morning was the looting to this is going to be one of those situations win or lose that Chris saying was going to go out and give you everything he has a in his start\nBut then no matter what ends up happening in this next series after the end of that series we're going to find out something quite different than what we've been hearing to this point and it's going to be probably something far worse obviously the hell out of a little off season to get whatever it is corrected but\nUm if there is a belief out there I don't know if it's constituted in truth that there is something you know not severely wrong with him but he is going to\nHe does have something ailing him beyond the stomach illness and and I don't know if that would lead you to hold him back to get them more rest or if you at all\nThat would lead you to hold him back to get more rest or if you would offer that at all with the way of all the has pitched in even more so for that matter not a shop on the last time open overall he's been great\nI think clenching gay five last Thursday night with the world series caught my eye on Tuesday is going to benefit the red Sox tremendously you get to heal up this all had\nYou know we all talk about sale at a bit but just fall bars and chemical [noise] how much those two guys attached yeah dairy this three answer here saying I don't think there was nothing really left it might it either one of those guys last night no you saw\nA barge get off the home front there is that two of them are a good solid and to the other Crawford Boxes as they like to say that yeah yeah\nWe really look forward we're going to have a lot to talk about next time we talk as

joining us this morning on WN our ally the station with personality we are broadcasting and Ninety nine nine on your FM dial Ninety five one FM Thirteen eighty on the AM side of things\nAnd we a gallon streaming worldwide at WNPR I dot com my name is Joey going this is the Joe Show us bought show talking sports with you the red hot Red Sox are run to the world series all they face Milwaukee\nOr the LA Dodgers\nDoes it matter to you I don't know I think it's going to be great away let's get back to the phone lines and see what else is going on\nGood morning you're on the Joe Joe Joe is Henry\nHenry I know you're excited about this Red Sox came a\nLittle surprised that it's it's going like this so far or does it for you expected\nI didn't expect this yeah this is remarkable\nOkay I I'm with you\n... ... cells was on the show yeah\nWe're going to the show and I don't think Houston or New York knows what happened yet it's kind of who was like a wave of momentum\nThat really surprised me and I didn't get into it on the phone with Brendan but I Know you're a baseball guy like me and just watching the chess match between the manages I really felt and I'm just a fan\nAnd a guy that likes to talk about sports more than anything on the radio I thought to me just critical mistakes and I'm not just you know armchair quarterback hindsight's twenty twenty but\nAh took for the world series manager they just it's such a great job last year which I saw a couple of things that I question that came back to bite him same thing with\nAaron Boone I don't know if if our score is just that much better than these guys are it's just pressing the right button at the right time\nI think that the word I been searching for is trust this man a stresses players and then it came to light a broad and can roll last night yeah trust\nThey did that amaze you were you surprised like I had to have you on the couch and he said you're not going to see kimbrell tonight he picks me pitch to winning last night there's no way you're going to use chemical tonight and they ... up on what is going on\nUp slowly I mean I couldn't believe it and then the guy just can't throw like gangbusters at the\nCars are pressing buttons stretches pressing buttons as knowing us personnel and their personalities are showing us telling an amazing series and amazing yeah for the red Sox\nIt's been ... and you know the thing with general I don't know if you had us on earlier I alluded to it on the phone with\nCallers but I heard an interview with ... this morning who is a very knowledgeable baseball guys will be works for ... a blogger he's been all over\nHe goes to tons of games he knows price you know he said um you know and I guess it's no secret\nThat the and I just mentioned it to Brandon or there was a possibility that chemical was tipping is pitches because people are wondering watching this as we're all having a collective hot attacked for two hours the other night watching them pitch what is going on with this guy because the velocity seem to be there he's tapping out\nAt Ninety nine Ninety eight miles an hour so that would lead you to believe that there isn't an elbow thing or a shoulder problem and you've got that Seventy eight eighty mile an hour and ... curb that he's insisting on throwing to me way too much I like to ask well\nI mean most of that on this\nAnd you were talking about it when I saw you and I say he's got to throw the fastball but he's not hurt\nThen why are they lining up this fast ball and I think he was doing something Henry where he was or there was some kind of thing maybe it was the guy taking pictures in the clubhouse for Houston that they caught somehow some way those guys were guessing a\nThat was going to be in and getting starting that's when a little bit early if they knew what was going to be a fastball but it was like they knew what was coming maybe that's what it is because I don't think there's anything physically wrong with them on the other side of the claim\nListening to a reports about Chris Sale this morning thank goodness we did win that game last night because I don't know what we would have gotten out of Christ sale on Saturday like Brendan was saying and if you could only have gone if he could only have gone three or four innings where do you turn\nOff from there in a must win game you know to cover that much round that many innings who you're going to go to who to trust especially with general we just mentioned being the way he's been thank goodness that they did get the win and now they get the rest and we'll find out\nI'm sure regardless of who they play in the world series and whether or not they when we'll find out at the end of the season kind of wake up ...\nWe're going to find out that something was really wrong with Chris Sale I think I really believe that uh unless he was going to come out in and Tuesday and and and be Chris Sale of ah of April I don't know what we can expect and you know what Henry I don't I'm never going to say I don't think that we need them\nBut we just beat Houston three games in her own okra sale I mean it's it's ... you look at this team now they can stop them the way they're stepping up I don't know\nThat makes you more remarkable but a lot of affect the chemical you know a slight the announces on TBS yeah but they made a comment late in the game above ... ...\nAnd his lead by as mechanics okay at all and\nI was watching them when they push blast sending it\nHit was pitching perfectly in that fire was not leading the wrong\nWhat you do is you take the last row out like the the real nose bleeds like the furthest roll up\nYour you take those people those people are gonna come anyway they're not going to be season ticket holders and the last row out in center field what you do is you just back everything up on and you install that shelf you don't give\nI don't want to call anybody in name because it's you know we're on the radio or trying to be good you don't give a quote unquote people that aren't sinking straight an opportunity to not only affects the outcome of the game to affect the outcome of a post season game to affect the momentum\nTo affect the overall polls ... of an American league championship series that entire series could have turned around\n... home run had that counted and Houston goes on to win that game and I decided deciding fashion\nThat entire series is different\nEntire series is different and I'm not saying it would've been but it could have been and will never know and we'll never know if we'll keep order caught that ball if they did in fact into the air and pushes glove close lake it appeared on the video\nWe know on the at the game before that they were the benefit of a good call and I was arguing about this to the other night if you watch the replay\nOn the Kemp catching center field\nIt's so quick it happened so fast that the ball\nHits the wall and goes into his glove because his glove is so close to where the ball hits and the ball goes straight down into his glove the the ball in his glove would not have made the sound that it made if you were watching the game you know it sounded like you had a a a racket ball off a garage door\nI mean off a metal garage it was loud the crank that doesn't happen with your leather glove it would've been a a thought they wouldn't have been a quake that ball hit the wall and they got the benefit of that call\nYou know so replay is there for a reason and cowboy Joe asked who everybody is critical of who had a great a series overall got the call right\nIn a in right field the other night those fans didn't reach over to try to make a play and they did interfere and people in Houston I going to argue just like people in Jacksonville wanna keep signs up that mild jak was not down and that's fine you can make all the things up you want\nIt to that is what it is as the man says with ... sweatshirt\nUm but in this case\nYou know I'd be very angry if I was the Houston Astros fan how many times does it have to happen if that ever happened at Fenway Park they would need a helicopter to fly that person like like they have life late they would need that kind of a helicopter to fly that person out and fly 'em to uh\nI don't know where the Galapagos Islands so they can go test the uh ... the theory of a survival of the fittest Charles Darwin out if something over there because you wouldn't be ... you wouldn't be surviving too much in Boston if somebody had the lack of a mental a framework to think\nThat you can interfere with the home run in a playoff game\nI mean ... had every right to be angry but not at ... and not as Joel West at the fair and that wasn't thinking and should we allow these people the opportunity\nYou have any faith in society I Know when I get behind the wheel and I drive sometimes I'm very pleasantly surprised at the courtesy and the nature of the kindness that I experience on the roadways and that's about three percent of the time\nThe other Ninety seven percent of the time I'm Amazed at just how people act and what they're willing to do to just to be to exist\nAnd those same people are sitting in the first row closest to the field of the outfield and they're waiting to ruin your team's chances at a pennant and an AOL cs game because they want to catch a home run ball\nThey would rather catch a home run ball then have you or maybe\nTake the take the momentum from the red Sox and come back and when the series and go back and when the second World Series in franchise history back to back World Series\nThat opportunity blown and maybe because of that reason I could not imagine having to talk about that this morning had that happened in Boston and had the roads men reverse than Houston moving on 'cause somebody was trying to catch a foul ball and right field and the other people like I said they would have to move that person\nOut of town because people would be ah not happy to say the least\nAbsolutely a controversial moment in that game just watching it live bang bang play Joe West I give him a ton of credit for getting that right had he said homerun\nHad he said a home run we don't even know if that it would have been overturned it was inconclusive because of that security guy getting in the way of every single camera angle in fact it was funny there's an Internet meaning of that guy being at every major historical event\nLike at the signing of the declaration of independence\nAt the landing on the moon I'm you know pretty much everything important that's ever happened or that there's there's a historical picture of people have been photo shopping that security guard in the way of the shot because that's what happened in this case which led the job to the inclusive nature of it and they got to go with the call on the field\nThe call on the field has to stand in the car on the field with Santa ferrets and Jose out to Vegas out and I know I just spent a lot of time on that but that was the series that was a huge play huge huge play\nOr in that series and then the absolute life out of the uh out of the Houston Astros sucked out\nBy Jackie Bradley junior on consecutive nights the last guy on earth that you would expect to do damage like the shirts said was Jackie Bradley junior a black hole and you'll line up an automatic out I've heard every name in the book called for this guy not an everyday player\nAnybody with Jackie Bradley and you know who you are Boston sports talk show hosts you know who you are\nAnd you know what stations Iran and I've been listening to you and I've been on this station defending Jackie Bradley from day one and I don't know if he plays here

I mean there is this caravan thousands there'll be illegals marching new way up through Mexico trying to now approach to the American board of the southern border and try to get in here\nI don't know what that at that sound as and President Trump David ... is saying that he is going to ... that he is in fact going to stop them and he won't let them in so I agree with them Steve thank you for the call I'm also a the Drudge Report has great coverage on this how about this I'm also seeing one last time\nSomeone close to Hillary Clinton that's right folks she may run one last time the rematch hot

invaders from coming in I agree with all of it folks you can't allow it\nThere's no reason to bring them in their net let alone they would make their way\nFor sanctuary state I also getting the feeling\nThat mayor Fung his momentum is building\nThere's two huge weeks to go to huge weeks ago actually I think it is it's Eighteen days until the election\nAnd I think Gina Raimondo peak too early and I think for low now is being seen for exactly what it is is he's just running to try to defeat mayor Fung ... sad but if you check the Facebook page I mean Patricia Morgan and Joe ...\nBasically have been\nWell they've been found out they had been running\nFor no other reason but to help governor Gina Raimondo defeat Allan Fung intro out of his own words said I don't care if I get\nTwo percent of the vote as long as I prevent funk now I've even heard a rumor and I want to save money everybody on Facebook Live station says send the national guard to the southern border that's exactly right this morning Richard Fortier there's my friend Richard how are you Richard\nHow's retirement treating Richard\nShut the border down Richard was a was just tremendous when I dealt with them and pull Massey Richard so good to see your face I Hope you're well I'm ... I'm surprised that are run Al Gore they appeal to the low information voted this Karen a Lanny socialism it is an Jeanette\nBut folks what we're finding a this morning Stephen ... ah the Oreo um there was a rumor right now I mean they imagined this is how the governor's race is turning out I heard from a very good source how about this\nThat or the ... people and you can uh you know this ... this is a room with a chilling out there again I Want to be very clear I'm not saying it's a fact\nAnd there are a lot of different political rumors but I Am hearing are you ready for this that on a lecture at night\nThe Raimondo people may invite Patricia Morgan and Joe ... to ... headquarters for what they feel will be the victory party now I Want you to think about that just for a moment do we have a long way to go to the election is November sex\nA real above board campaign in and I I just think it is absolutely this is one of the most rotten things I've ever seen done in politics really is because in all come out and say and I'll tell you I I I've known trailer with Morgan ... over\nTwelve years maybe even longer than that I think the two of them I really do I itching for what they're doing it his rotten it is selfish gene pool\nI Do look up to it at ... Morgan ... for her to do that yeah and then even Arlene violent who I knew to then say alarming doors you Joe drunk yeah I mean I don't know why\nAnd who I knew then say alarming ... yeah I mean I don't know why all day you know what it is just a lot much you don't want to be on a please to their jealousy\nThey're jealous of anyone succeeding who now Republican other than that and that's the only thing you can put your finger to\nCause harm is a is a nice guy listen there's no perfect candidate\nThere is there is no one I mean no matter who it is there's always ups and downs his own up to some of the problems he's changed him and his police department he is a solid campaign I think it is so under he entered in rotten at Raimondo basically recruited truckload of run against fun to throw off this election\nSo we've got to get from oh there we ...\nWe have to and you know I I was speaking with someone this morning and I feel bad this is someone who was with troll ... and can you believe this I'll I'll tell you this and then to let you go but Patricia Morgan with telling these people\nThis is even embarrassing to say but she was actually telling people that President Trump was coming in to to have a rally for Joe trailer when they get a chance to meet a President Trump's so they were putting true little signs out working on the campaign I mean they flat out lie to these people that was never happening\nSo that's another ... caught in in ... I'm just so\nI I I I'm just so disappointed at I mean I Know from Russian but yeah this is another level of under handedness and it I I as much as we know that there's corruption Rhode Island I I really didn't think it would come from these two\nNo really doesn't I mean I Would say that that that would have probably voted for her and yet I go why other side of her yeah\nAnd and Joe ... if anything I mean\nA couple of years ago he ... back in ah twenty fourteen I think or even\nTwenty fourteen of twenty ten he's flirted with the idea of running for governor then he didn't I think now he probably regrets it 'cause he realizes that he's very good at getting media attention and you know we as a way and just kind of goes under the thing but\nWhat turned it for me was last friday when Joe trailer did an interview with the Providence Journal and said 'cause the journal said well after this whole thing of him beating up the twelve year old kid when he was a thirty four year old man are you going to get out of the race and ... said\nI don't care if I get to ... percent as long as Raimondo wins and falling loses\nThat that just turned it for me that turned it for me\nTo me it's going to be a very very close right it is going to be a ... to ... percent off her\nAnd you imagine that would happen that absolutely could happen but I I'm just\nI'm very disappointed in the two of them I didn't see it coming and there's there's I also want you to know there is no reason for this ban them\nThat ... has towards Allan Fung none it's not even real there's no reason or is no he didn't do anything and I I've heard of the members of me do my math unless the ... he didn't do anything like I said I mean if you're walking down the street and\nSomeone jumps show on the back and such Cliburn you you know ... ... how would you feel if someone said oh well she must have done something to the brain that attacked or it it's not like that I mean mayor Fong won the primary he came up short four years ago\nPatricia Morgan ran against them in the primary and lost and what did she say oh I didn't know the primary the primary was not raped\nThe primaries on break teams just a better candidate and if ... wanted to run the shooter run against mayor Fong in that Republican primary light up he should've and it would have a four way race and you know what I don't know he may have won he may have one will never get to know\nBut I I just think this is cruel and unfair at the two of the ... what they have done a long time Republicans\nYep bailing out in all they're doing is helping Gina Raimondo yeah that is just absolutely terrible talk about knives in the back and I know that people say politics is dirty but\nThis is like another level I guess this is really it has a real stench to it it does I was speaking to a media reporter out of town and he was calling me I won't go the Washington Post was I Know someone was there and trying to get him on the governor's race and\nI said a lot of times I find it somewhat amusing and and it can but I said this this just stinks to high heaven this is really cruel because the people of Rhode Island do not want Gina Raimondo for four more years I don't know\nNo shape you know she knew she could not be mayor Fong in a one on one race and I just think the actions\nWell again I don't want to be a broken record here but girl that allowed to say I'll be happy if I get to ... percent as long as Gina wins a phone loses I I don't know what that's that seems very selfish to me\nYeah yeah that is not it it's not right\nAnd I want you to know word is see everything is peaking in momentum\nThere is a feeling ... continues to gain strength he's going up\nRomano's actually coming down you notice she you never see her she's in hiding wherever and hiding right now you she doesn't do press conferences she is lying low you wouldn't even know you never see her on the news anything like that she's trying to stay out of sight because she has the Hillary effect when people see her they get very very upset and they don't like her\nBut um there is still time now 'cause family needs a couple of points to come right up\nAnd that overtake her and then he does have a big final debate with her so I Am very hopeful and that is not a wasted vote a boat for mayor phone is about to turn the state around\n... I'm Sorry to say with a vote for Joe ... is really about for Gina Raimondo\nOh it definitely it definitely yeah I mean there's no doubt about that yeah it's too bad I'm surprised at him too because I remember him fighting at the state house yes for different yes you know and I attended ...\nI've spoken to rally them yeah so you go out and\nYes it is around la de you say that is there anyone better work in a crowded up in a frenzy that may not one I just I I'm actually this this whole election in ... it's I Can't it's so disappointing to me because it's\nI I I feel like they're traders that whatever deal I I I don't know how you escape from that whatever range when they don't like the word deal what whatever them I'll put it this way and I'm going to be kind whatever their motivations are\nI I just we are all going to have to suffer the consequences of general under for four more years and by the way\nPeople if people had any idea what she plans to do the next four years you will not recognize Rhode Island by the year twenty twenty two you're not going to recognize rile what she wants to do she her goal is to make this the most liberal progressive state in the entire country\nThe first thing that's happening is illegals they're getting driver's license and she has all these progressive ideals\nThat have money they make sure\nDoesn't care it's all going to be about a presidential run and listen if I'm Joe troll oh do I really\nOur presidential run and listen if I'm Joe ... do I really care you know gee then leaves after the election he goes down to Florida for the winter comes back in the summertime as good as two million dollar yacht\nSail around areas to sail around orange tree sale around block island Seventy six years old what does he care whether one stuck having to live here\nHe's got to worry about his stepdaughter that while the whole again I\nI don't know what to make the reason why throw in the shallow nod nod out now why can't he does not need a job I can tell you that he doesn't need a job and he doesn't need money no nope not at all that somebody else does\nWell we I don't know I I you raised very good points call me again you're very very good color I I really enjoyed our conversation I Do want to get a get fun\nOut here in part of the state you're right All right maybe I'll Try to rally within my place All right here we are going to do that I Am a person to do\nThat or I Will do that we will take it for the call will do that with mayor ...

All right let's let's let's take a reasonable read one sided learns about it I had a conversation where Frank and then he talked to his family about it\nBut we're talking about something that happened that Rhode Island college I've been a leader on ethics reform ... the general assembly subject to the ethics commission voted this is a lot of this which is on line a lobbying reform campaign finance reform I've been cold the most\nActive much the reform or a speaker in Iran in recent history well local ... by the ... journal her on that so it might administrations about why would I like college has the answer for their own policy and you get credit for all that before me just rattled off all\nBasically first of all in regards to this commission reform\nHe was dead set against given a journal simply oversight that was high ethics commission oversight over the journals simply yeah it was dead on arrival and then what occurred is that there was a possibility I could run against him was when he started thinking maybe we should do something here and then re Galston his appointee as finance chairman got busted\nRated I found I reside so now the general companies and panic when we got to do something to look like we're ethical so now we've had a little legislative Ryan to west had that I can tell from the cows we all know Ryan I had a for that at this commission yeah and secondly we all know re Galveston\nCame first then the legislation introduced on the other aspects look he can fight this and you can cite that he can quote people close to ... professor ... college who is talking about his little pool numbers in this state\nAnd he said that he wrote speaker patio represents the old Rhode Island of corruption and insider deals he can talk reform where's the line item veto none where's the inspector general who may offering Martha narrows abusive dry erase term limits\nWe don't see any of them were legislated brand changes in\nJail they could find a word and that's all I can address that led to the inspector journalists a political tool we have the order to general we have the office of liar management and budget we have to either you know he's lying is someone that I don't I just look at it from\nFrom a cost perspective but I was ... taken fry\nA reasonable operation channel ... the speaker's office today it's been reform oriented any third party available data will tell you that I they have set it they've said very publicly all so we've been reform oriented and we've been working on moving our economy for what\nDo I have tremendous results to show All right let's move on Tunisia dominated ... with us socks\nI'm surprised they'll start with you on that you were ... opponent attacked air support for a new ... New Hampshire manual on that issue any I Know Mr Matty Alou to build that with Indian impact that the team found leaving for once during his decisions me around taxpayers won't be on the hook for a new ballpark now so I don't need their credit from you know\nThey're probably somebody who tripped over themselves a\nAnd fell on a bed of roses and it was by intent OK I mean that's what\nHappened here was he was the exact around politically so let's start out with this quickly the twenty Fifteen he supported a new poll I saw a stadium in ... there was a hundred twenty million dollars with tax people who opposed it yeah any almost got defeated in twenty sixteen\nI started talking about the politics issue and so then you start saying I'm going to listen to the people but then his caucus starts had given him problems and twenty Eighteen about it\nAnd the Senate is given in Greece so he starts trying to figure out some plan\nCome out of here so that he can figure out a way to pacify the public and pass by the political people so he comes up to ... jump on plant\nAnd I don't know what his exact around was intended but what I Know is that the reason we don't have the taxpayer funded stadium is not because he was standing up for the taxpayers and he was going around and we lucked out\nAlright manual your response to that version of that all that and it's an interesting cells\n\nCharacterization um [noise] I did like the Providence stadium but I always said in a way back then was subject to vote or prove one hundred yesterday and what the voters said about the what I said very early on the ... proposal\nWas that we would see what the will of the people was we work real hard at whirling at figuring out whether that was I came to the Cincinnati yellow Brian ... are you saying why hacking of the stadium why are we came to the conclusion and I listen to a lot of my colleagues also when they were all learning the same thing doesn't listen to anybody we responded to that and we came\nIt also when they were all learning the same thing doesn't listen to anybody we responded to that and we came to the conclusion they don't already know that proposal would not move forward\nLying in the process someone brought to me the proposal of a special revenue bonding in that case you simply commit a revenue stream side of the junk bond is take the commitment of a revenue stream and what we committed\nWas exactly the amount of money we would lose if the pause socks left their sales of eyes revenue and their income tax revenue\nNo backing the investor would take all the risk it would not cost the taxpayers one dollar more than that no taxpayer backing and no Pataki it back and has been a surprise that clearly just doesn't understand the plant\nSpecial revenue bonds around a little below the only thing back again\nYou know unfortunately was came came up with a one hundred million dollar plus deal it was too rich Rhode Island would never do that and should not news to shake down the tax payers were wise\nAnd that's why we respond as well as a taxpayer you know I'm not sure how anybody could object to that but I'm just afraid of seems to find a way some people at the state has for less frustrated by your opposition to the building that way in the\nProcess unfold you killed the cat on a rival waited monster release their own bill and then there wasn't a vote of the night before a tournament why didn't you allow a vote on the original ... even if you weren't going to it as a representative of the\nLeaves were hearing the same thing I did my colleague standing wanted I we don't put bills on the floor just to\nVote them down I think that was good for the paw socks off for the process so we kept collaborating and and I thought that it probably was not going to go and uh the\nReason the process of courage and is I thought we weren't going to wait and then I learned of the special revenue bond option and I started\nLooking into that pursuing not out on you know at that point you have to talk to attack here you have to talk to the park socks and those conversations were going on at staff level\nUh so it took us to the end of the process but it was at the end for a chance only because we learned of that option within the last line to press final ... yellow or red\nLake I he's talked about he was supportive of Providence stadium plan but he won a vote approval that falls in January twenty teens there was an article in the province show which indicated they can't have over ... for this also grants to Pataki Tucker's redevelopment age they would have been on the hook for this thing\nAnd if the country developing into went down you know the city of the type that would have been affected then then the state would have to come bail land so India and the taxpayers are paying money and if things went wrong we're going to have to pay for it and it was junk on because it's high interest rate and that's why this deal fell apart is that the owners taxpayers we're gonna have to pay more money than under the original ... that\nCan I have to say that that's just not true that we had already backing a guaranteed a heavy ... with the truth and the facts no guarantee and I never said I I just say voter pool that we\nAssessed the will of the people are going to move on to a rapid fire section right now you are both familiar with this and she's been here before we don't want to believe are these issues were looking for one or two word answer on me so we can boosted them quickly Mr Matty yellow\nYou support

because they can't honor the ... gift cards they go out of business because of a major other items that's on the list and of course\nThe the the the problem yeah there is that they should have a

you can't include gift cards that are not your money that you gave nothing for those of cards 'cause I'm like you is on like you had money in the bank and saved ... but he gave me a\nYou sound like

have to work in a minute you can do a council president then genuine you see him at the council meetings or running\nRunning the uh the the the meetings are very well I'm certainly it must be an interesting a transition for you um of course we know the council president she is still one vote however are running or the meetings is a tasking itself and you seemed to be here is listening to that job very well\nThank you thank you and the uh the funny thing about it Jeff is that um somebody had told me this too but when you're running the meeting your your sometimes so\nInvolved in the ... the the the details of running the meeting and keeping the procedures and the policies and everything in place that you don't get to be as active as I used to be\nWith you know the individual um discussions that take place you know I spend more time monitoring and then by the time it gets to me because it costs the president's speech class um by the time it gets to me all the comments have been made so it's just a matter of okay move the question and and move on\nYeah yeah a lot of the the comments may be a common thoughts but I've already been appointed out ... ah in of course are you moving along and move it to a vote and make sure everybody's voice gets hurt make sure\nAre you moving along and move it to a vote and make sure everybody's voice gets hurt and make sure anybody who wants to speak on an issue gets to speak the issues are vetted before you moved to vote moving to vote question motion in second in your mending yeah I mean it could get quite a\n... in luckily you you seem to work very well um with the\nWith the Christine throughout humming or the right next oh she's ...\nShe's the uh city clerk is a is top notch you know she and and quite honestly truth be told she makes me look better than I Am because she uh she has everything ready for me you know the it's it's it's in order and she's always there to assist if I have a question and says she's great\nOne of the challenges are a variety of running this meeting is keeping it going keeping it on point keeping it on the issue of is a is one of the chatter things you know Larry has his ah this ... year\nA is a and you hear the term all the time the bickering that goes on um I don't know how you see it or or what you experience as a a council president when it comes to the car when it comes to bickering when it comes to keeping the meeting on point or it's been one of the challenges you've been dealing\nWith it is in it it's in in two different instances and and what I mean by that is there's there's you know I've tried as a as a former person trying to get a word and I've tried to give as much latitude to the counsellors as possible and allow everyone to to say what they want to say but\nAs you've heard and and just the recent past\nSometimes it gets taken too far and and I feel like sometimes my my good nature of letting people\nSay what they want to say is sometimes abuse and I've had to shut things down more recently because it's just it's gotten um it's gotten abusive and people\nAre saying more than than should be said so I Am that pot it's it's been interesting it is the best way I can put it the other thing and I I I was saying this to a reporter just the other day one of the things that really concerns me is they\nThere's a lot of chatter about the the the problems between the administration and the council and I I just if I can take care of her a minute and I wonder if he's alive bell thank you yeah but I Want to set something straight the obvious thing is that first of all the city council\nAre about the budget process meaning or that there's a proposed budget led to the council\nCouncil just like the general assembly goes through that budget makes their proposals I'm a little bit of history if you will are on these past and just the past two years two years ago a new leadership is council president\nA budget was uh was amended saving a big savings to taxpayer yes\nAnd then this year's budget spend a few minutes on that before we talk about what's coming\nSo as you said we um\nWe had two years ago we we work through a budget we presented um some significant suggestions and amendments to the budget um things that save the taxpayers\nQuite a bit of money and we brought forth a very responsible um budget jacket down around the mill we did we did and at that point the administration was criticizing the council saying we're going to have a loss in services we're going to\nHave a you know a hardship of revenue and lo and behold we made it through the ended with a surplus and provided all unnecessary services that people needed\nWhile still bringing forth a very responsible and and tax payer friendly budget fast forward to last the last budget that we just went through we attempt at the same process\nBrought forward you know a seven hundred and fifty thousand or so dollars in recommended savings made some adjustments I'm left the firefighters\nOPEC payments in place\nAnd if you don't know what ... does not everybody knows the acronyms\nOther host employment benefits and so um that was money that the firefighters paid out of their paycheck their own money paid into a fund and it was roughly Ninety thousand a year they were putting in and had accumulated about a half million dollars um we didn't think it was prudent and responsible to\nTake that all in one lump sum but that's what happened or we ... we worked a budget that would have kept that in place we um we were still making additional cuts in spending and we were bringing forth and even more responsible\nTaxpayer friendly budget unfortunately the mayor vetoed it we um we did not like the previous year we had five counsellors the previous year to override the mayor's budget a veto\nThis year um we did not have the five we lost one of the counselors and he did not vote for the override so the mayor's budget stayed the five hundred thousand dollars and ... came over\nTo the budget um and there was just some ... excessive spending in our opinion that you know it's costing the taxpayers' money and just to be clear\nThis fallacy that every\nThere's money and just to be clear there's this fallacy that\nEveryone says the the rate the tax rate went down and especially they say that about the businesses the tax rate went down in ... in the business tax rate went down but unfortunately this is in a re valuation year most businesses assessments went up the tax rate went down a little bit\nMost businesses\nSaw a tax increase this year and we we say you know we one of the things one of the ironic thing is in the budget\nThe mayor put in for an economic development director and we're raising the tax pay I mean the commercial tax payment to businesses so it's it's hard to say you need an ... an economic development director while you're raising the businesses taxes\nThe concept of the if I may ask a layman question if you will that the the firefighter pension money retirement benefit money that is here for us to pay their benefits when they retire yes\nAnd moving out into the general budget yes that means down the road we still got to pay is that essentially a self adjusted loan\nYes had actually you're you know ... that's a great point it's we actually borrowed um money in theory from a future payment\nAnd isn't that what alone is it's it's taking a future revenue\nAnd using it today and that's really what happened it was accumulated but it's not going to be there when we have to pay those firefighters OPEC payments and and it's um ... let me just stressed is the firefighters are going to get their old have\nIt's this is not putting that in jeopardy I don't want to make people worry but it's just that now the firefighters did the prudent thing they were funding it\nWith their own money now that was used to fill a hole in the budget so in the future\nNow the tax payer will pay what the firefighters were attempting to pay on their own and that that's unfortunate because they were doing the responsible thing if we were just if if the administration did the responsible thing that money would still be there\nThe upcoming book by upcoming among the next budget that you'll be addressing should you be reelected and then of course if you're just joining us comes president engendered a is probably going to be a difficult one um\nTo him I mean they're all I'm I'm assuming a budget for the city is not something that I I Want to ... go through because I can imagine it it it's got to be a challenge but I'm the upcoming budget seems like it's going to be an extra challenge\nIt will be for things like that let's let's just say everything stays the same we've got the um if if the spending stays exactly the same as it is we have the five hundred thousand dollars from the old to have that we use this year that's not their next year\nSo we have to make up that hole that five hundred thousand dollar hole and then we you know as everyone has heard landmark um was just awarded a very lucrative decision on their lawsuit\nThey don't have to pay us the taxes anymore and it's unfortunate but you know the administration took a hard line to say it's all or nothing with landmark I met with the executives of landmark\nAnd they were willing to do something they wanted to negotiate they wanted to compromise they want it to reach a number but they said that they weren't able to get that kind of a dialogue going with the administration which is most unfortunate so now we end up in a position where\nWhere were down one point six million dollars every year going forward and that's one point six million that we had this year that we're not going to have next year so just those two items is a to point one million dollar shortfall that\nIf the spending stays the same\nAnd we know it doesn't we have to find that shortfall and make that up next year it's going to be it's going to be a very difficult budget and that's why I Believe you're going to need experience\nYou're going to need financial knowledge of the city and financial knowledge of just budgeting and in general and that's why you know there's\nThere's some people on the council now myself I Hope you know I'm I'm advocating for myself today but there are going to be some very valuable people that we need back to make sure that this budget can be worked through and sustain\nSome live ability for the taxpayer and not crush them with an unnecessary tax burden\nYour factoring in as you said the landmark money the pad money or not the unknown question mark due to the mediation going on\nTeachers the teachers contract you know they they're going to be awarded something they they're deserving of some race or whatever that number is but that's got to be funded as well you're right\nThat counts for president in general has been the guests are we going to ask you to give ... you have another final two miniature in a moment\nA running for re election on November ... we've talked about a lot of topics a lot of economics on these uh back Fifteen but it's such a a it's probably one of the the most crucial elements for any citizen any taxpayer any government leader to deal with so a lot of times it should be spent on dollars and cents\nBut the ... the last two minutes as I say or was yours or anything you would like to address the public on\nThank you Jeff I I Do I Would like I first of all I Want to let everyone know I've it's been an honor because I Do realize that I Am serving\nAs a city council but um it it has been an honor to do this I truly enjoy the job um it's\nIt's something that um it's become a consuming part of my life in a good way\nAnd I do balance my life properly you know what it is a part time job with a full time responsibility and it's something that I Hope to continue in the future and I'm asking for people support because I Do believe that this is gonna be\nA crucial year it's you know we we're gonna see the exit of all of the requirements of the budget commission we're going to see\nThat where we're going to start standing on our own more and more but we're also going to see the difficulties of this future budget that we were just talking about Jeff and I think you really need the experience and the knowledge and the um the history\nThat somebody like myself brings to be able to get us through this and\nI understand that there are many um qualifications that people have but I'm a realist I take this\nResponsibility I'm with a lot of seriousness and I don't I don't want to spin\nFrivolous things I'm here to tell you I can handle the big things um I I have enjoyed being council president I've enjoyed being a consummate but I'm capable of handling the big projects and\nAnd um there'll be picked up on the day of your trash pickup\nStories in the news about repairs that continue on to route Ninety nine bridges that's the connector highway it's a one point six seven million dollar project and um as expensive as this project is is cheaper than replacing the bridges it's good to see us taking care of\nBridges before they fall down that's usually not the way we do things in Rhode Island but maybe we're learning I don't know but I guess one point one point sixty seven million a lot of money can you imagine what it would cost to replace those bridges\nHave you bought your Powerball tickets I understand it's almost what is it a billion dollars\nTonight I Know my wife bought one so I'll let you know if we win or not somebody has got to win that's the way I look at it I mean you know the chances of winning I'm sure a miniscule and then some but somebody has to win can't win if you don't buy a ticket so uh\nI guess there's still time on another\nTopic or did you read Pat Buchanan column and the call this morning I enjoy reading his ... column and he talks about the migrant caravan\nI'm putting Trump's legacy on the line this is a a very interesting situation there are thousands of migrants that I'm moving towards the United states their goal is to enter the United states illegally\nAnd are they coming in from\nEl Salvador Guatemala um Honduras last I heard there was a over four thousand\nMaking their way and I'm President Trump has told the Mexican officials that uh uh it's their job just stop them from entering the United states so I don't know where this is going to go but it does go to show you that we do have a major problem major problem\nPeople think nothing of making their way to America and again um they don't believe they have to enter the country illegally and it's a major issue major major issue some people\nSay it's our responsibility our obligation to open our doors to these migrants\nWell\nI say we need to really do some we we need to do something with our policies we have to have policies that work and we have to follow through on our policies but that's not something we've been doing\nIn ... and many many years to be honest with you\nAlso end the call today I saw her legal ad that caught my attention the city of one socket as advertising for proposals for engineering landscape an architectural services for the wall rural street\nMonument square area it's a road reconstruction project city will be using CD Bee Gees funds for this project\nAll I can say

else does um if you look at it and they've torn out the entire um I think first and second floor\nAnd maybe beyond that and the other question that comes up all the time is raise the money coming from

know it uh election day will be upon us it is not far away not far away at all maybe you have a comment as far as that is concerned us\nI'm going to be totally honest with you Ciro okay which which you know this was gonna say well what's the guy cry and if I didn't do anything about the reason I haven't gone to the authorities because\nI Can't see it on the air it'd be like there was something into the win because the Sony and he already knows defective she knows how we saw this this is only to me because I Know them all they're not going to come in there is a ticket to begin with he says and if they do I'll just pay the fine but I'm Still not going to register my vehicle\nWould you know what I I I Would recommend that you do report these individuals to the authorities called city hall let them know and then if nothing happens I think you have even more of a case the more reason to complain\nAh because I I Do know that there are a lot of vehicles in our city uh that I read just sit out of state and I I don't know if they'll ever nailed the mall or whether they'll even discover all of the ...\nState and I I don't know if they'll ever nailed the mall or\nWhether they'll even discover all of them because they're scattered all over the city now could be that then the authorities have just never made it to your street and checked out these vehicles\nOh no no because somebody else it was a reason why I didn't go because another neighbor of mine said that they actually did go ahead and report them and like I said and not have things happened which then again\nJust rent rams at home to me that the person the actual person said I'm not worried at least because I Know after police force\nThat what he's saying is actually because the other neighbor who's fed up with it because it's like why are we paying and then pay and the guy supposed to be like I said hello the community they've already it's my other neighbors said look I talk to them\nAnd they said oh yeah we're going to look into it except for except for except for and then here we are today in our things happens well see that situation yeah\nI I I Would here's what I Would do if I was you if everything is telling us is accurate um I mean right now\nWe have seven people on the city council and\nYou know at one of them live right on my screen okay but if they thought that ...\nThey were aware of it ends up they tell me what I Know well it's I mean it's it's laughable if it was so sad and I know it's kind of insurance purposes only has one person's told me that it's not even about the register\nOr no and if you lower the insurance because the insurance generally is less much less expensive\nI'm right over the border I I actually I Know someone who did that for years registered his vehicle in Massachusetts lived in with socket registered as vehicle in Massachusetts in order to save hundreds of dollars on insurance\nCorrect you know I have family in Georgia and laugh I tell you that they paid twenty five dollars a year tax on their vehicle equivalent of like excise tax that we pay and all the hundred oh yeah and if you're in and talking about that if I may\nYou know the excise tax when you get your bill as a little section and our says roads schools and ... and then you look around the state roads you look at our school system that scratch your head and say there's a lot of money just going to general fund and then it's up there and you know\nNo I Know exactly what you're saying oh yeah no no question about of course\nIt's ludicrous on so many levels by ... I just want to get your viewpoint on that because like I said here we are second go around and\nI'm sure the city has got a lot of scarf was that aren't doing it but these individuals just which will pass the graveyard and not a thing so it wouldn't even bother you 'cause it's like okay they're getting away with it\nAnd I'm not too bad when you were a kid all while they got away with it I I caught it kills me is that wouldn't bother me so much\nExcept for the fact they're actually\nBusiness owners in the city you would think that someone who owns and runs a business where have you know all the head of the higher\nThey would think so and and and it's going to be pretty aggravating if they go around bragging about the fact that they are breaking the law and they feel they can get away with it so\nWell and they are yeah I guess based on what you're saying they certainly are well let's see if anyone else has any idea as to how we can nail these culprits okay [laughter]\nOkay Larry thanks very if anything political by no\nFrustrated he is maybe you have a comment or a ... a comet or suggestion of some thought this is a city councilman John brand I Hope you consider what I've worked on the past two years were the viewer continued support on November sects I supported impasse responsible budget for the residential\nAnd commercial taxpayers held our elected leaders accountable and sought open honest and transparent government wrote the legislation to return the school committee to an elected body currently I'm working to re millions of dollars in revenue from renewable energy projects and\nI Will continue to fight the owners and seek improvements from Senate grow and the waste water treatment plant as I Believe this is an important quality of life issue on November sex I Will be honored and humbled by your continued support paid for friends of John Brennan there's a new\nFeature at valley breeze dot com that will make it easier to find the business or deal you're looking for as long as they share their ads with family and friends to valley for you dot com has a right to find this week says Lincoln and you'll see all the men\nThat were in the breezes five newspapers maybe you finished with your paper or a recalling an ad you noticed a few days ago just use the search function and the ad is right there ready to be printed our shared ... share your ads on social media valley breeze our mission is your success [noise] All right thanks so let's go to the phones\nGood afternoon Iran WN All right\nGood afternoon Larry yes how are you today but I just\nGet so upset to think that a parent would sue or I heard you know and ...

has failed simply because she cannot work well with others she does not understand that politics is the art of compromise\nShe does not know how to collaborate and build consensus she merely wants to fight with every on the council the school committee the autumn festering committee the stadium the aid of senior services\nYou name it she creates drama and controversy with everything she touches\nSpending money is easy but leading and working productively and constructively with others requires a willingness and ability to compromise and get along that simply is not\nSo there was an obvious\nRidiculous\nAaron made and of course\nWe filled out the paperwork and hopefully some day it'll be rectified but it still has not as of yet we've heard from nobody as of yet to straighten this out but that's a mistake it's very ... it's a very foolish and I'm sure it's just the type of graphical arrow some point trance forbidden\nAnd I'm sure it's just the type of graphical era of some point trance forbid the transferring the information but nobody ever came to the property before after\nA sense and even after being contacted and we received no mailings now I'm retired I Am always home she works out of the home we're always fair the very few exceptions and no one has made any attempt to contact us at all even without ethics to contact\nThem so Mr Beauchamp by saying oh yeah everybody been contacted and\nIf they didn't get into your house they sent you to lettuce\nIs baloney\nIt's fall short completely and thank God you are willing to go to the council\nAnd address this because otherwise we'll be hearing crickets and it's just another case of accountability we expect more respect counted ... restricted as we pay our vendors that the work is done to the standards can you expect she not going to get this ball deli administration [noise] I agree with that\nBecause she doesn't follow the rules to good [noise] and we know that there's a lot of intimidation and things like that [noise] and\nI don't know why people can't hear you because that's our tax dollars at work and that's how it's being protected is falling short\nOf it I I Want to switch to subject just for a little bit here because after with law called the ... of the mayoral forum back at chance\nWhere it was All right until the ending and then kind of fell apart and the mayor and has been\nLifted people see the real sides of them at the end when when it's turned ... and it's it's a trend intimidating and it and pretty much damage fools of themselves at the end of that\nAnd they got very quiet since then and you and I have spoken this for a while we know she's got way too much money to be quiet and this campaign\nI'm sure the primary scared the bejesus out of her and she did a real fight on their hands she wants to say is mayor and uh\nI think a lot of people have caught on a lot of people know that she's been dictator and as for way or the highway and she doesn't like following the rules that you can't work with a city council\nAnd she can miss the city to things that she has no right to do\nSo really knocks us up and she has no vision for the future for short term middle term long term so there's a lot of needs to be addressed but we knew she come back eventually she she'd have to get into campaigning and the only way that she knows how and that is with negative ads and without the fat now you\nAnd I said on the pulse before\nThat we're going to run on her records and we kept it that that's what we talk about do we talk about the shortcomings we talk about the different jury ministry is gonna be it's going to be open and transparent and you're going to work well with\nWhatever the next city councils consisted of and you have the vision or al ... has jumped on\nTo your campaign the field marshal feel much yes\nWho has an incredible once in a lifetime shot in the um that if we can pull it off in this city which will take a mayor behind him and the city council behind them and the people of when socket behind him but if we can believe in that vision that can be a game changer you add the railroad to this\nThe railroad as a stand okay\nIt's a wonderful thing but if it was like it's going to be a destination city they're not coming here to see just sprinkle box they're not coming here to see cast\nTop and and seeing sports seals down there they need something to come to win soccer for otherwise you're only putting the trains here to leave one socket okay so if you want to be a destination place you have to go with al ... vision and which is Albert breeds vision to\nBecause I've slowly absolutely it's going to work well listen I'll bet as been up friend\nSince\nThe Nineteen eighties I Love album I Know album\nHe he\nLook when he tells you just want to do something and not only does it does at well so listen she can have someone like al ... and\nTo work with she can't because he takes too much attention away from her\nWith her\nIt's I I I mean me me my my my that's all she understands if the focus is not on her\nFeel it's not going to happen by going to happen\nAnd you know I gotta I gotta go off on a tangent on this one because I was listening on Monday Night at the meeting um uh as as I I mean I I was at that meeting I was sitting there I was listening and I\nHeard councilman fragment talk about the Broadway junk yeah\nPhil ...\nThe mayor was elected in two thousand and Thirteen and two thousand and fourteen she held a press conference\nIn Paris all complete with the the the lights the balloons stuff the fanfare ... and and to to to\nTo identify all the accomplishments that she had generated and so short a period of time more gas why\nThe Broadway junk yard was one of her accomplishments so call back in two thousand and fourteen she had she announced that they had a ...\nVictory what I'd like you to do\nIs go to the Broadway jumps out\nAnd knock on the door of one Lorraine Motel clerk and ask what rang how much the mayor had achieved at that point in time with respect to that problem and where do you think she's going to tell you feel\nWhat do you think you know\nWhy are we why are they still why is councilman fags that still talking about a solution won the mayor announced that they had achieved victory finally\nFour years ago\nI mean who's wrong here is that the mayor where she premature in making that announcement all ... counts them in fact than it is it the wrong junkie I\nReally both of us to think so do you think so yeah\nIt's it's just one councilman who's gifted one wrong thinking coming to the wrong conclusions and being a wild about it this demand of the people ... oh yeah when did you write [noise] that that's uh\nSince ... oh yeah when is he right [noise] that that's a it's you know [noise] but anyway\nGetting back to it let's let's go back we knew that she'd come out with ads [noise]\nAnd we knew to fight the only way she knows how to fight and acts as dirty as it can get nothing based on facts nothing based on the truth [noise] she has\nTo reached the uninformed vote this because I think you inform people will follow the\nCouncil meetings who live in the city I Love the city and had such high expectations five years ago for this mayor [noise] and have been let down [noise] and and see a whole different side to the [noise] have you seen other than what they expected out of this administration has failings [noise]\nUh the only thing she can do is is as she did in his first ad that began playing Wednesday morning here on the up front show I heard it for the first time\nMyself and I knew it was going to come and I'm sure it's just a first of many and as we get closer to the election as she gets more desperate to probably get worse but\nAll day will you know and it's as Joel name and upset and Nineteen sixty seven I guarantee it yeah I guarantee it\nAnd we knew it would come and we said we take it on when it came on that was all about it but at the people just have to pay attention look at the difference between\nThe two campaigns okay we've been here every Friday right along talking about the issues talking about the making calls taking calls answering questions but\nExplaining difference between\nHer administration and what\nEl brings administrations gonna bring so you are for transparency you offer a ministry is going to work very well with the city council and with the school committee and it's going to be a front people are going to be welcome to participate in a government they're going to have\nAnd what was the budget commissions\nAnswer to all these problems what did the budget commission do there was any different than anybody could have done\nNothing they raised taxes yeah other than other than raising taxes what did they do is nothing okay now there were two people that voted against\nThe budget commission coming in yes one of them was me so if we had\nNot call them the budget commission\nBut simply gotten a waiver\nTo increase taxes not to the degree that they did because now it's obvious that they went overboard and doing that because we I we've had too much money accumulate that's why I said till\nI understand the budgetary process than I Am telling you that\nMy agenda our agenda\nIs very very simple\nOpen honest transparent and\n... and\nThey're the remainder of the agenda is a lot tax\nRelief tax relief tax relief in more tax really ... and that's what we're looking to so please you know this\nThis man man this this this fancy discussion about it's all nonsense nonsense take your fifty thousand by ads\nHurled them at us and will tear them apart one by one and we'll answer them we're not going away won't answer every single one and if you want to come into the studio and joined us or if you want to call us do that\nWill be happy to take your call\nWill be here next friday again as always we will be taking phone calls and [noise]\nBut ... [noise] uh believe it or not and you know what type of person I Am I still have that meeting when when the council took the salt to allow the budget commission and okay and\nI Am very well aware of the great presentation that you made of why not do and why we still have should've seize the opportunity\nTo allow the mayor and the city council find solutions which was raising taxes to a certain point [noise] but you pleaded for the chance to do so\nAnd you are one or two people who voted against it and because of that we went to a bunch of condition was to this day I I still feel is a mistake\nAs always in government and the republic in a democracy or who has the votes in the direction you have to go [noise] and that's how we got\nUh who has the votes in the direction you have to go [noise] and that's how we got here we are but my point is when when Lisa ... as a state rep\nVoted because cities and towns it's only because she had no idea what goes on in the city when socket because she never attended meetings she never knew what was going on in the city when she voted to do that she didn't realize probably what she did damage why says the city when socket and\nShame on us she should have\nAt the time fought kick this crash Sunday half of the city to find another alternative to cut us as much as they did but no she didn't she voted to make the cuts through the gas at the match at the gas can and ignited this this thing sent us this city on a path\nThen it could not recover from [noise] and that's why we we got the\nBudget commission you're exactly right and you know as USA Today she can say how far she brought to the city we can't know place we've been living on the amount of money that the budget commission has taken out of your pockets my pocket than all property owners\nAnd businesses in the city of one socket\nI became part of the base that is it became part of the base so every year that the tax bills go out take two and a half\nMillion dollars that two and a half million dollars was not their prior to the supplemental acts and that's a supplemental tax\nThat is compounded annually it's but you know what all of this\nImprovement\nHad nothing to do with that according to Lisa ball deli on\nAll of those improvements I because of the magnificent magnificent performance of her administrations me me me I I I my my my it's all about me all about me\nAnd her world it is but it's it's not about the citizens of outside\nOh listen if if she's not elected a\nDistrict she's gonna credit ... he's going to try to convince you that the street like the ... going off streets will no longer be pay we didn't pay roads in this city\nUntil Lisa ball deli on became the mayor prior to that we had cobblestone streets and we put the cobblestones in one at a time I mean it's so stupid I mean it boggles the mind\nAnd and you know it's it's but it's all spin and ... were ready for it was it was\nSpin and\nYou hear things that are just such nonsense\nWill give us more give us more you'll only gave us the first one to\nClose the other one ties into it as soon as she can just look at his record member of the city council almost drove a city into bankruptcy discovered that the city council says you're almost drive\nI was a member of the city council that drove the city into bankruptcy yeah really wow you might want to explain that a little bit more ... ball belly on\nThe talking about fiction you know which is covered it with a foot through the spot families are votes [noise] she didn't seem to know friends of the city of when soccer when she took that vote okay next one is chairman of the city investment board that lost millions of dollars in the pension fund\nReally yeah I did yeah just you know the city has no\nMy recollection is that the city\nPaid in investment advisor big big money to do their investment analysis now but it's all me it's all yeah I I uh [noise] and Richard lumping her\nFormer campaign chair person was also the chairman of that board so is he equally responsible oh we're not mentioned anybody else just me just me\nAnd and what's not mentioned [noise]\nWhose idea this was at the time to take a bond out for a pension and how it got through and who was the [noise]\nWell ... ... what's to say\nAgainst any all these things out with oh any background any facts find anything to substantiate anything of why is that important no 'cause we we were trying to hit the people don't know what's going on and don't pay attention now especially you oppose full day kindergarten\nReally yeah yeah Phil when he proposed all day K\nThey mechanism for the funding\nWas insane it just didn't make sense and\nI are polls the methodology I didn't uh polls all day K Austin who can uphold solved ha I'm\nBut I did oppose the methodology of the funding it wasn't until Carolyn Diaz who was a member of the budget commission\nAnd who worked at Roger Williams university\nAnd who had close ties with the department of education\nCame up with a solution as to how we were going to pay for it which was announced by the way at a budget mission meeting held at the department of revenue okay they announced that then that\nThe mechanism for the funding was going to be entirely the state of Rhode Island and at that point in time my\nI mean any for any reasonable person or my opposition if there was opposition to all day K disappeared and I embraced it because the state was going to pay for it had nothing to do what Lisa", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Woonsocket",
