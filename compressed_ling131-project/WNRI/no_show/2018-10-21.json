fifth day and by the ... hour the fifth day according to the protocols they had to tell us that the war was over and I have spent the last six months in a camp up on the Chinese border which you know was ultimately even a\nViewed as a a bad boy can for a place to\nHide some Americans so far in Vietnam that nobody could ever find them I don't know what the real rationale was for sending a hundred or so it was up there [noise] but um they brought us down from that camping in the middle of January obviously the peace talks are going in a definitive\nResolution I guess was struck on the twenty second of January if you ever take a day or two and a Tamara collection by the twenty seventh of January of Nineteen Seventy three of the Vietnamese had to explain to us what the protocols were ending the war and for our repatriation\nAnd it was set on the fourth day the eleventh hour a Vietnamese got us all the courtyard and this is the first time they ever allowed us to stand in the military formation\nWas a whole group from different rooms they always even in the good times or whenever you know fifty or sixty or a hundred guys outside at one time in a in a common area\nAnd uh they read the protocols\nAddressing the end of the war and the repatriation of the POWs centrally was going to be in for groups coincide with uh with with all of the last four quarters of the total number of American troops in South Vietnam and uh when it was all done we just all very quietly walked back into our room\nAnd I think the Vietnamese are and all of the people who were standing around with the cameras and the international control commission who was there at the time we're expecting a bunch of hoping hollering and jumping up and\nDown and pass laughing at a rest at\nTo wasn't a peep and it wasn't anything that was a said to us by the senior ranking people we stood there I'm just kind of in some sort of a makeshift military formation I read the protocols and quietly we're back to the room and uh\n[noise] different people have different takes on why we just kinda serendipitously had I mean there really wasn't nobody who did they didn't even know smiling here where you individually felt it too good to be true\nIt's another lie there may be true but it's going to go south before we [laughter] so it was pretty much a\nShows have you reacted in the ... you mentioned who will be hollering a little bit of at least a propaganda victory move them\nOh yeah yeah I mean because we maintained in Korea are again is defining minutes to go to conduct says even though you're a prison or you're still a fair American funding there as possible for your actions and dedicated to the principal's major country free you know a lot of that goes with okay take the tone of the senior ranking officer conduct yourself in a military fashion\nSo uh it was it was it was pretty uh pretty sedate day but that's how we found out that the war\nWas over when did you actually come to believe that it was going to happen\nFor the airplane broke to around ...\nWhen the Vietnamese came in and gave an actual exit back up a little bit when the Vietnamese came in and gave us the clothes that you saw on TV when we came out which are not close we'd had you know a day before\nAnd we had sandals and ... and they came in was shoes and trousers are short ... little bag to put your stuff and take a lawyer trophies [noise] uh you know that that's when you kind of started thinking okay maybe it's going to happen and then one of the American\nMilitary uniform military officer came into the camp no question that he wasn't American military officer and uh we found out that he went and talked to the senior ranking guy in each other groups\nIn my case navy lieutenant commander Jim Carrey and colonel norm get is a senior air force guy and he said OK the war's over this legitimate release just done early release of snap propaganda go\nPrior to that was there a noticeable improvement in conditions in terms of food or less meetings or [noise]\nUm\nYeah I'd probably say the last months you know after after Christmas in Nineteen Seventy two but again you know I was up at a at a camp on the Chinese border where there's just no hint that the linebacker to operation to be fifty two raids were happening downtown ... uh the guards were a little uh\nThey knew what was going on and then they started acting in hindsight you know guard started acting a little differently and uh he says there are a little more aggressive and mean because people were bombing and killing Vietnamese downtown you know so there was some of that now the same time there are other guards who\nWould make you know all bleak references to war and soon your goal soon things like that but didn't you know the contacts wasn't there to really understand or believe what what they were saying and then I Believe the day was the thirteenth of January and impact us all back up on the trucks and\nThis time they didn't live photos and then handcuff us\nAs they had when they took us up to that to camp and a trip that took a three days to get up into the mountains took about one day to get back down going down hill or something and they put us in the big a\nBigger rooms in a different part of the Hanoi Hilton and I think now they're like Fifteen or sixteen hundred twenty guys and they in a room or that I was there a you know and we started to begin to understand\nThat that something had happened and then them to sit on the twenty second to the Vietnamese got us out in the formation and told us that the war was over\nWhat had happened was in ... was linebacker too oh yeah that a sign we got their attention\nWell the guys are in Hanoi or at the time you know you know where they have a very different tests to argue about what was going on your own ... rocket enrolling in airplanes and falling out of the sky and missiles are growing up I might have been quite an exciting firework show there for a few days but uh we missed all that up on the briar patch camp\nTell me about coming home\n\nHome ... ... ... it's an interesting things after six years you know you get kind of comfortable in a lifestyle it's a\nNot a good lifestyle but you're comfortable with it at all of a sudden somebody tells you that you're going to go home or you don't know what you're going home to could be a good family situation can be a bad family situation [noise]\nUh you may learn something that is life threatening that you don't want to know that you can be done I mean I for example hadn't eaten anything solid in two years because of uh some rather severe a jaws and teeth damaged Vietnamese did to me\nA ... you know I knew I felt that but I didn't know why\nBut I was comfortable with okay some but it wasn't really wanted to make sure I Want to hold and sign up to you know maybe you had cats or maybe you had to have major surgeries or what kind of an environment you are going into it may be all this antiwar stuff is a is true\nAnd I'm a young fellow I'm a you know just a\nThirty year coming up on Thirty years old you know my military career you know my my classmates from the academy were much more experience much more season that I'm I'm behind what are you going to do so there's a lot of professional and certainly a lot of a personal uncertainty about what you're going back into it and it was a little scary and I would say that\nUh\nAnd to edit it was a little scary and I would say that uh at the same time we had an experience that\nAs you could see maybe downstairs

E.\nSo we got\nGoing in that one and as promised\nWe put together a black fish\nOn tape that I loaded into computer a few years back when we first started because it's a real passion for mine I used to do a lot of fish in years and years ago when we had our truck with camper\nAnd there was only about Seventeen of us at Fort catty in Jamestown and at that time we had one water spec it and we had one electrical outlet with Seventeen plugs going on even\nIf the electrical inspector ever saw that but those were really good times at Fort catty and James down at my old Powell my father in law able park at\nIntroduced me to to talk fishing up at the tail and we had a ball up there I saw him a couple of times I slid down to rocks but I was young and full of something and then I go as you would say and I'll tell you one little story about able\nOn the sink as you can either used around bottom tile or the yard diamond shape ones are either ones will work affect all the good a lot of times I use a fish find a rag\nAt slide right over the amount of element lined in little plastic they can come and yellow are white or black\nOr put them on your mind and then tie your three way or hook up your sink a right to that it'll come up and down the line and it won't ah put any weight on to the line when the fish picks up the crab\nCetera hook and you've got to set it into his bottom drawer because he has a lot of teeth like when you're a tournament large mouth bass fishing fishing plastic set at her quickly and most important of all keep your rod tip high\nKeep constant pressure on him because he's trying to get caught up in those rocks to get off that book a constant pressure to keep that fish off the bottom and off those rock pile ... always away from the rocks\nMost of the time you're going to end up ... fish over the rocks if you've got a buddy would you tell them you got a good size went on that he can knock climbed on the rocks all that time it would they weighed\nAnd also uh other guys that have fishing alone will use or some type of line with are grappling hooks on it for the bigger fish to get them up and over\nAnd it's hard to do it off the bridges you'll have to take the fish bring it down to the end of the bridge and then try to land at you know from the bottom part where you can get access to it\nStrong Monticello Nightline a I recommend and I've used as he is a Berkeley by brand or ... and ... the ex she has a lot heavier for that type of fishing along the rocks and a leader is highly recommended\nBe careful not to slip on the rocks\nAre especially as the tides coming in and out the black slime and stuff like that is very slippery a lot of guys would you use felt bottom boots and now also use cork is around the rocks at a very good investment for your safety when you see the size of the ...\nYou will automatically know better than to put a finger inside that pop up awful jaw\nIt's a great white uh flaky fish a lot of people catch to talk and make fish chowder with him\nI like to bake them myself with potatoes and onions inside and it is a great great taste eating fish and it's also fresh fish that you catch yourself you know what you got if you catch yourself\nA great way also to teach young people they hot of to talk fishing it's a very easy fish to catch when they're normally when you catch one you'll catch more because they tend to school up depending on the muscles and the beds are there for them to feed on\nIf you find in area a market would your GPS with your car or anything like that and will help you in future years\nOkay I Hope you enjoy this tape it shouldn't be about six to seven minutes long and I thank you very much for listening\nAnd I'd like to thank in valley Williams as tuned in for ...
