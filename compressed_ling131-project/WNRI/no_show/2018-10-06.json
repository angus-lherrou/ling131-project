waiting\n... by the by any chance a what do you think a mayor ... I'm leaning direction\nI really the only trouble as them wherever your vote famine you're going to want to vote for him again that's probably\nSay that again no no no no\nIt's a lot of Joe ... [laughter] we don't allow those on this program I understand we don't we don't deal with anything that's politically incorrect\nGood for your my mother's quality I got to go All right\nBye bye and he doesn't want to tell us who you're voting for seven six six Thirteen eighty that's our number as we talk with you on a Saturday open line conversation is what this program is all about and we want to talk with you\nGood morning Iran WN ironic\n'cause I think what we had to hang up and they and they've made blueberry muffin is this\nOne [laughter] ... a month and mix is a wonderful anyway\nI'll take that from the get it and I like to leave her to vote to al ... the mayor okay stonewall he's going to look into that thing up\nAnd I think maybe if I tell me correct me if I'm wrong that it might cost ... million cap I'm not sure but at least you got to look into it and uh hopefully finding the money to do that\nMy dad had a problem with it I don't do that and I\nSaid you know are these six I'm camp tax the problem\nThey talk about those ... so I don't know even if they kept there is some not close to call at ...\nI Do my big dome over the whole operation [laughter]\nBut I mean that's the money for the call came to the may are okay academy or a\nOr we can find money's ... favorite projects no question about that\nYou know I mean if more people being affected by this tank\nIt is hey ended up being educated in that place and then my last thing is you talk about somebody who was going to be up they'll take the building\nAnd uh if they didn't make a go of it or something and if they didn't make a goal that it wasn't going to cost the city anything it would be their loss right\nAnd I then saying that about ... ... ... if it will not cost the city any thing and any improvement\nAny building they do all of a deal\nIf they all and that base meanwhile those buildings will always stay and always be cat we need every week\nPayers need everything we linked they can get I just don't know why just fit in dragging their feet well\n... ... ... where is the city dragging their feet in your opinion [noise]\nWell it may not want to talk to them to see what you know\nYou're talking about Mr ... had a salary okay that that's what confuses me okay so you're you're talking about Mr ... plan yet okay to finalize the downtown area specifically I guess around\nRiver island park in that area\nIs it the only thing they only need I think at this point is the backing of the city for the people with the money will come in I just don't understand why they won't do it\nWell I Know that that would be a good question to come up with um if there's another male role for him\nUm and uh that you present that\nQuestion to both candidates to find out exactly where do they stand\nOn the proposal but in my mind I'm Still it's still not clear to me exactly what Mr ... wants to do I mean it sounds wonderful I mean it sounds almost ah\nTwo good well it does sound too good to be true to be honest with you um my ... I don't think we've heard enough from him as far as I at least I Am and I I I'm not quite sure\nWhat it is that he he he he I don't I have some idea I mean but how do you do this I mean this is a massive massive project so but anyway I think both mayoral candidate should take a position on it if they can\nHelp you know he has he says what\nIs it it will it will discuss it with them and um that's my like feeling at 'em and sick and suddenly correct me he thinks it's a good I can\nWell if that's the case I I Would hope that the mayor would be willing to listen to a ... lot has to say is well I mean you don't lose anything by listening to someone's ideas whether it'd be missed the ... or anybody else I Would hope everybody is open to any\nIdea that you know that she's not going to listen to him not even sit down and talk with him what\nWhat if you've been listening to talk to people on TALK shows not gonna do it and I think the ferry slot I mean I could give it credit you know what she got a house that good a line that slot\nAnd let's put it this way now that's a question that we should put to the mayor are you willing to sit down and talk with Albert ... yes or no and if she says no\nWhy not I mean I I don't\nWhat are you have to what does the city have to lose by a I'm listening to what it is that he wants to do I mean I don't know if that's already taken place maybe she thinks it's a waste of time I mean I don't know I don't want to put words into her mouth and\nNow like I say you know\nWhat I'm trying I mean I go ahead I'm Sorry you know you're going to\nAllow yourself with people that know\nDifferent things better than you and that and that makes you look even better I mean look what she did I went back a scandal I think he's wonderful I think it's a great job with the city I understand it up that last but boy\nThe boy died I Know the money is there that we never had before but he's trained\nPraying people do different things I mean\nWho knows how to get as much as they can out of our tax\nDollars or whatever and they get the city and get their money with either of those employees have Leah\nSo you know and I I always said I don't believe that need to have all kinds of degrees if you've had experience in a ... for a lot more than having a piece of paper\nI totally agree with you there yeah so those\nFor those reasons I Will vote fail and well some other reasons too but [noise] I mean white white and keep\nTaxpayers I'm getting the band trip and they say we need all the brakes we can get because they can't afford any more taxes\nI don't think you're going to get any argument there [laughter]\nNo I mean a well anyways have a good\nDay All right thanks for the call 'cause I have\nAn open line conversation on a Saturday morning feel free to join us if you need a contractor for any project may I suggest unlimited construction company\nThey are\nGeneral contractors and that means they can do just about anything\nInterior exterior\nAll commercial and remodeling is what we do an awful lot of Oh absolutely if you've got a kitchen that uh [noise]\nLooks like I'm Lucille Ball or use the kitchen and nothing has happened since then it's time to do a little bit of updating wouldn't you think the same thing with the kitchen I mean those are the rooms and get all worn out the kitchen and bathroom I'm ... and that's one of our specialties\nThe remodeling of kitchens and bathrooms\nAs well as creating family rooms and putting up additions we can do all that you can call the owner whose name is Dennis ...
