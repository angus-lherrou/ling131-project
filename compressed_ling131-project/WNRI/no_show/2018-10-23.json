topics of the day before we get to a maintenance of you know I've been doing this a long time uh Dave and I don't get too often or an signed letters I think I've gotten less than five in my uh forty years in radio\nI feel like these types of interactions with people happened less frequently that when I first started when I first started here\nI was criticized pretty frequently I Would get these things saying I didn't understand music I was an idiot or and I feel like most of those have dissipated but you have managed to take off one of our listeners\nYes and and it really has to do with a\nWith the way you are politically on the fence you know so anyway the name of the letters all typed out an sign Roger ... again\nAnd I'm I I'm you know I've told a few sibs in my day but I I didn't know I had a reputation as a lawyer but anyway here's what the guy said\nWell woman on Wednesday October seventeenth around six thirty AM you stated trying to me\nThat the Saudi Arabian a journalist or ... and um I didn't know how to pronounce his name ... right and I had nothing to do with the United states\nYou commented that I'm a CNN was over doing their coverage while Fox was covering a metal awards ceremony from the Vietnam War here is where you lied he lives in Virginia and Virginia is in the United states\nHe is a journalist for the Washington Post and the Washington Post is in the United states\nAnd Washington is in the United states actually he's not a journalist spoil them he's a contributor\nUm and I would say that since that time the city has was has changed um and I think we can all agree that\nSince then it's a different city um\nYou know in in in from my perspective a where we're at now I don't think happened because of let's say one person or or one thing or one event or one situation\nUm [noise] to me from my perspective I I think it's a sort of a systematic failure or what what's happened to the city I'm ... years and decades of of poor choices I'm Bad decisions um sometimes we make the decision just for the wrong reasons [noise]\nUm so you know that's what I'm here for is is I was tired of watching my city kind of spiral watching our city spiral kind of in the wrong direction um and I figured what better time than out to really jumping in and try to right the ship\n'em so that's you know that's basically why I decided to run for city council\nUm we've got to a number of choices out there if it was just seven choices to make it easier right to free up but we have more so so what makes you ... are different from the rest of the uh the flock says\nThe free question I'm so first off I'm I'm not a politician I don't I don't have a political bone in my body I'm basically I'm just one guy trying to fix the city and this one guy trying to fix our city um\nYou know I'm I'm I'm younger you know in in terms of politics and in terms of city government I'm a little younger than most um and I see that sort of as an asset I'm I'm not I'm not jaded I'm not I'm not corrupted I'm not I'm complacent\nI'm I Am I still have a positive attitude for the city I still think we can honestly turn it around [noise]\nUm and with that you know I just want to say being younger doesn't mean I'm new okay I've actually been around the block I've I've been involved in politics and and I've been um\nYou know following the stuff for years and years and years I'm Still not new to any of this stuff um I read the city charter cover to cover um including the code of ordinance is a zoning ordinances I'd been through round general laws open meetings are robbers rules of order I've been to most of the city council meetings\nOr work sessions zoning and planning board meetings\nSo I've been involved in stuff you know knee deep and the stuff\nI just haven't had a seat you know I haven't been one of the decision maker so [noise] I Know what I'm doing I'm I just haven't been have\nYou know in in the right spot to really make some changes um and for some people when they when they get\nChanges um and for some people when they when they get elected to something like this where they take a position like this\nSome people to take some three four months sometimes six months to really get acclimated and really get their feet wet before they they get comfortable enough to actually make the changes and and participate with me you get that from day one\nOkay I I Know this stuff are already so I'm not I'm not green to any of this um and I would say\nYou know one of my strongest points is I can really have a conversation with just about anyone\nOkay I'm not on any teams any squads or any any camps of people\nI get along with everybody very well um and I think one of the reasons I can do that is is I bring with me um respect\nAnd I bring with me integrity um those are the two values that I that I hold very dearly um and when I have conversations with people I can look them in the guy and they know whatever I'm telling them comes from the heart comes from my own brain comes to my own mind [noise] um and I I value that very strongly so [noise]\nI've had conversations with basically all the candidates already um I've had meaningful conversations with most of the city council members already I've spoken to so many people in city hall so I\nI I can get along and I can I can really Galvin eight you know this city government you know I see myself almost as as the glue\nYou know if I'm On the city council I can be the glue between all of the council members I can be the glue between them and the mayor between them and the the directors between city government and the people 'cause that's that's that's my my ... my strong suit\nThomas ... would like um I think a a good phrase would be a seat at the table of the socket city council and also I'm hearing from uh the last statement that you a field you can be a consensus builder among your counsel colleagues\nI feel like that's that's been lacking for so long you know when I when I go to the city meetings and I I sit there for you know three and four hours and and I I see that [noise] you know the the agenda is so short yet you know what what comes out of a four hour meeting is is what I got to ask and\nYou know I I think we need somebody to just kind of wrangle everybody back in so we can push forward that's that's where I'm here for\nAll right and what you're here for if you're just joining us um his voice is a Thomas keep us here in person he's a candidate for\nThe city council of the city of when sock it in the November sixth election and his purpose of being here is to\nLet you hear about some of his ideas\nAnd also some of the issues and so you have a a few of the issues that you'd like to um to talk about when I'm going to do for the sake of clarity is just a issue I'm a is named them let's say issue number one issue number one that will go to number two or three sounds great OK number one\nI'm so you know I Want to talk about business um I Know everybody talks about business but I Want to take it from a different angle um [noise]\nI think that the businesses that are already here that are already established all the businesses that call when sock it their home I feel like they get overlooked I'm far too often\nUm we're we're always looking for something better we're always talking about um getting new businesses and industries but we do we tend to kind of pass over the the people that have been here for years and years and decades um I Want to kind of reach out to those um those people in those businesses\nAnd basically say you know how can we help you\nUm meanwhile how can you help us as a city how can you contribute to the city a little little stronger you know so we can we can get sort of a mutual growth between the two of us I Want to reach out and say how can we make you running a business inland socket how can we make that easier for you because [noise]\nTo be honest as a business owner you know in any small business owner knows that you have a thousand things in your plate\nSo doing business with the city should not be one of the hardest things on your plate you know in in your day [noise] um so I Want to I Want to reach out to them have those conversations in and say\nYou know let's let's make ourselves more efficient and lets us make doing business with one socket that much easier [noise]\nUm [noise] I mean his ah for instance is just physically physically doing business with one socket um any other town I go to um you know I Do real estate throughout the entire states come in and out of town halls and the other town hall I go to generally it's one floor\nYou're park in the front hey you walk through the front door\nYou know where to go yeah somebody for help and they'll they'll say I'm Sorry you know I Can't help you here go to the next window and John can help you so you go to the next window and guess what they're John hold your hand takes you through whatever you need gets everything done you're in and out you know have a great day on TALK it had\nIts four stories\nOkay half the time the elevators don't even work I'm you climb three sets of stairs you're hoping you're in the right building itself you get through the door you're waiting in line behind ten people\nYou're hoping that the right line to be in and if it's not then you have to go back downstairs go outside back through another door back oh three more stairs and hope that the right door [laughter] okay [noise]\nIt's frustrating you know that that just physically it's frustrating um\nYou know there's not a lot a lot you can do about something like that but it's just the mindset and and and how it feels from an outsider coming in and doing business that's not the best introduction let me tell you\nKnow I'm supposed to interrupt on these interviews up but you actually are struck a chord with me I'm so under I'm your first issue here of business\nI Would imagine you would be in favor like I Would be in favor of a business development center office located maybe on the first law of city hall where you could wear it says business development center where you can walk in and say to somebody I'd like\nTo develop a business [laughter] slowly you know interrupt your sure but I I uh you know you struck a chord with me yeah so you know it's almost like the city expects\nEverybody to know exactly what they're doing where to go how to how to operate in it it's the exact opposite of that you know once you enter city hall or or enter somewhere where you ... you're working with the city you're you're kind of clueless and it's it's overwhelming for somebody that just this is not their gig\nYou know I can do it I can do it because I Do real estate and I and I I'm In and out of these places I Know I Know exactly where to go ready [noise] um but for most people it's overwhelming um and it's again it's it's one more thing that just adds to the pile of of stuff that they have to deal with\nYou're still failing one on a three kids okay and and to me that's that's that's still when I was in school uh sixty seven is a D. and D. was failing so so the school system is is literally failing itself [noise]\nUm and I know I'm not a school committee I'm not I'm not running for school committee\nBut this is just some of the things that I keep in the forefront of my brain and I say you know there's certain things that the city really needs to get better at it and how can the city council you know person can I can strengthen the city and and can I make the city\nUm that much better um this is one of them this is this is one of the you know the priorities that we have to really focus on and and support and throw for our way behind\nAn issue number three is a real estate and well how real estate um cells in when socket the people looking for good schools\nMay reject one socket and these are young families that are you know could show could breeze and vibrancy into the city that go to other communities are\nSo I guess the council as a council member you just have to encourage the school committee and fund the school department or properties to try to um maybe get those numbers graduation rate numbers up\nThere and ... I'll be honest sometimes is saving money um [noise] so here's a here's a for instance and it kind of wraps up all all my issues together today is um [noise] um so when stock in high school a couple of years back they just hired a new a new head coach\nIs young guys I Believe is twenty seven years old now okay so you know very young very energetic and in in commands a lot of respect from the from the athletes\nThat same year when socket went from division two football up to division one grand division one that's ... year Hendrik ... that's your Shay high school that's all your your big names and you're you're heavy competition those guys recruit their talent and and when socket is up there so we're we're in the big game\nI'm also\nThat same year um when socket their defensive coordinator okay this is the guy that's coaching the defense he is actually a former New England patriots\nOkay coaching our defense his three Super Bowl rings okay so surprised all that together we have brand new young head coach we bumped up the division one and we have a New England patriots coaching our kids\nOkay most people don't know that stuff I didn't know you didn't see\nAnd that's something awesome that's something that we can kind of rally around in something it's not huge but it's something it's something that we can grab onto and just run within and it'd be nice to just every Saturday fill those those stands and show the kids hey guess what your community and your your city\nCares about you loves what you're doing in in and let's get behind this stuff and it doesn't cost any money for that so simple\nUm was that your wrap up or or can I throw a of a question in a because up and it's not going to be a a a curve ball you're in real estate and uh you talked about the residential real estate and uh you don't mind if I'm interested in commercial real estate so I go up to plan a fitness every day\nAnd I look at upper diamond hill road and and and I want to find out why\nUm we we can fill those plazas a maybe a ... Internet shopping as a you know killing retail all over or something but as a city council member\nAnd as a real estate professionals do you see any any role in and trying to encourage or the commercial real estate development of the policy is\nAbsolutely him so that wasn't a ...

I'll be honest commercial real estate in in business moves at a very slow pace so [noise]\nAh one of the things that went sock it that we we've really become accustomed to as having things happen immediately and that's to be honest that's not how things work um in commercial real estate it it can take sometimes years for something to really come to fruition\nSo just to see something start and expected to happen overnight isn't realistic [noise] um it's it's coming stuff is coming\nYou just have to ... you have to be patient okay and there there are things we can do um obviously the big you know the the the hot item is is the commercial tax rate and there's no brainer everybody wants to bring that rate down okay we have to do it responsibly\nUm and we have to actually set goals to to to get it down okay I don't think we actually have goals we just kind of when you you know every every year we drop it a dollar or two and you know what are we doing next year or five years from now nobody knows I'm so that's\nSomething we have to plan for and and really designed around um but there is stuff coming okay I Would I Would say hang in there um I I Know a whole lot of lot of projects that are are just on the horizon um\nWell a lot of projects that are are just on the horizon I'm you know big for instance is the the train station that's\nThat that's ready to pop 'em I just went to um the meeting at the at the station it was very very enlightening and and you know very positive and it's it's going to be something awesome I'm and we're going to build around that and it's coming notes hang on\nWe're almost out of time so now we're going to give you a chance to wrap it up if you're just joining us or you missed a good half hour because um he had a lot to say but his name is Thomas ... he's running for city council city Oakland socket\nAnd uh you wouldn't be the first to get elected that didn't make it the first time sometimes it's a baptism by fire as I said but er here is Thomas key\nTo wrap up by his statements for today\n... ...

you can be very boring uh so what I Try to do is I Try to make it as lively as possible so I'll bring in a lot of what's happening in the popular culture\nI'll Try to have them used both figurative and non figurative language or to understand the use of metaphor which is this is an allegory so that's an extended metaphor in other words an allegory as you're talking you're using characters to speak about something else entirely I kinda like intimated that early when I\nLiked reading about king Arthur because a lot of those tales were\nAllegorical uh especially in this in the searching for the holy grail and what that stood for\nThis type of book I didn't see anything vulgar and it it would I Would say young adult probably eleven or twelve to right through adult um any race any color this book is a universal set\nIt's a good a fireplace read your last we stop as a chapter anytime you want in it and you don't lose your place on us it's a never ending story as far as I'm concerned the way it's laid out\nI'm In this particular category of ... of the over fifty genres out there would just sit side by over to fit any other cat or a non fiction\nI Would think that um some people probably can't see the science fiction and it yet because they've got to weigh themselves through the uh first trilogy but at the end of the third book or you understand that what's happening in here is not what it seems\nSo it is science fiction based because this is a scientific ... that's what I Do right\nNow are on the Amazon and Barnes and noble they have like you know the categories and stuff like that what did you choose on the\nWorld generally if it's the class of science fiction fantasy okay but it's also called speculative fiction suspected of that's what I was looking for and it's also known known as a mythological uh and it's also a a a a\nI I think it's a it's an allegory of modern ... morality play because it's it's heavily allegorical\nYou'll have any thoughts on this or doing a pitch for type of movie or TV series where they\nAre I've thought of it because the way I as I explained the first time it's about a year since we were here last him and because that was in September I think you know September [noise] um\nSo you're a good writer and you also have a good memory when was this other times when I asked my wife so she says terrible [laughter] maybe of selective um\nI had I've written this from the perspective that I was a camera\nWow and what you're looking at is what you see through the lens where the where the maybe the appeal that this could easily translated into a movie or ... extended series\nWhat a fantastic animals that have been on a so when you see when you see the scene of a of a wide pan or actually when you're with Matthew 'cause he's a hermit and he's religiously based uh suspiciously based individual but he's older he's he's an elder person senior and uh\nHe's arguing an abstract argument which he does constantly so he's not paying attention to what's around him so he falls in this\nInstantly so he's not paying attention to what's around him so he falls in this ditch which is sort of kind of funny because it goes along\nWith the argument is making a\nMany scrambles out and he's not paying attention to the roadway he's not paying attention to what he fell into except it was a ditch he he kind of walks away any here's this\nNew ... and it it east can't figure it out there is is there was a baby sounds where's the baby three remembers hitting a bundle\nSo he goes back in and there she is and he picks her picture up grits are out of the ditch and then he said the camera is all on him very close up and then all of a sudden the camera pans out and you see the roadway and you see the destruction of a caravan which was part of the babies parents\nCaravan and the fall everybody's been murdered 'em and then\nYou see him collect things that he thinks it might be good for her he doesn't know yet that he's going to keep her a\nGift clothing and he finds an old he finds a diary did he keeps because he wants you to read it when she gets older because he believes that's her parents\nNow later on in the book when she's a in a safe environment going out on the fires collecting things and stuff she comes across a very interesting scenario that happened to me as a young person I just resonated with it soon as it happened I thought I was having a flashback [noise]\nAnd I can see now how you wrote that that you talk about writing through the lens of a camera was one she come across hearing the sounds of the wolf\nThat's in trouble weird weird sounds she had the fear of the wolf you was instilled that\nBut you also instilled the curiosity to find out what the heck is going on is the wolf stuck on the trap of what's going on here or something trying to lure me in that this misery and no phosphorus and then she comes across an adult mother a wolf having her litter of pups\nAnd she's having such a struggle you could feel the pain the way you wrote it and one two three seven pops\nAnd it was like building up to a drum roll coming up to the end of it and then the mother dies so now she's left for the pups die\nShe has a responsibility she takes the three pops ... come out with with the\nWind and waves are whimper yeah yeah [laughter] you even describe the weight difference of sob saying that is that that is a little later though the smallest one and she adopt that one star sleep over and stuff like that\nBut how they protect her and stay with the family throughout that part of the story I can really relate\nA little their little wolves than I like the big we'll see how they're like\nThey're tiny yeah and I must confess that we actually used to breed Maltese puppies holes and we had three three three of them and I'm from one litter and I actually named them that while and uh\nUh we are writing what you know yeah so we use or was was my favorite and we kept we use are\nWe actually had her sold\nWe actually sold it for two thousand dollars and\nI don't want to talk about it much but the ... I didn't want them to have the dog so my wife was at work so I called her up and I said I'm I don't want to sell the dog she's ... do you want to do with it I said well can we keep her and\nShe said okay so I gave the check back\nTwo thousand dollar check back to the people and that dog was just an astonishing it was you know I'm not a little dog person but I this thing on me you know so that is based on the the story at the ... of those dogs or wolves are\nBased in reality about these three little puppies\nSo that dog that was ... her back was your back right okay that's what I thought and there again it comes back full circle you write what generally you incorporated into that story [noise]\nNow I I'm into the middle of a book that I'm doing one of the three books are going right now but I'm trying to write a young adult book in ah Connecticut area are relating to youth baseball\nAnd I'm using that element as I'm writing it through the eyes of young ballplayers\nAnd I think I'm On the right track on that by just listening to your view of going through a cameras lens I'm related to that to what I'm trying to do accomplish in this book that I got to go and I think I'm On the right track on that\nAnd I think if I target young adults it'll also attract adults right I think it's you know it's right there\nI think that happened with the book the natural yeah as it did attract the attention of a adults yet and that was a good and it became a movie with Robert Redford\nAre great movie half well testing was on that was really done with class there really was this would be on that same type of wine a good baseball story\nBut I've incorporated animals into what I've incorporated a lot of suspense into it in fiction and I got this all played out how this book is going to come out but I the biggest problem I'm going to have is projected to sixty six to three hundred pages and I could have already started thinking of the editing process and\nThanks you got to keep them two hundred pages or less right I I think that's the rule of thumb so I'm slowing down my process I got the and I've got to start this outage rock\nBut the middle I have their freedom to change it as much as I was yeah or extend it the way I Want\nNow you started as we did book one year in book too you're already got books regard one with the cover and you may go up to seven nine Ninety One of my goal is right three ... so you have to stand in the finish in your head\nYou don't want to be a one woke wonder unless that your goal you want to do with a thousand bucks put down your bucket list and that but\nI truly think if you had the capability of writing one bar does all other things that you should be writing 'cause you've already prove that you can do it right and you may surprise yourself jumping into a completely different genre and hit a home run whether\nStephen King uses the metaphor of a well\nHe says uh Iowa right until a well run dry well so I I think that's pretty wise metaphor and I think that when when a person writes one book they may be surprised at that well\nYou know that you know December get that bucket descended more in depth that in and start writing another story because where one came from it I think it's easy to eat more easy easily done to do the second one than it was the first one\nHow old are you a lot of time for writing you know you've still got a partial Korea going I don't think his full time at this time in your life so it's on a part time basis but you're trying to dedicate time to do your own space for your writing ... type of day morning\nTry to do it in the morning when I'm fresh 'cause I'm older now and so when the day whereas on I I kind of ... I'm looking forward to nap time shift and uh\nUh so so I I think I have the clarity to write this type of to to to write this kind of a length is like the story I Need to have all my faculties with me so I find it to morning say eight o'clock\nTo maybe eleven that's when I write for I'll be a story boarding\nAll I found in my interview process the last couple years a lot of the younger officers that are full of ... and then I guess I can say that over the F F not I'm One of the pay a fine [laughter] but they're now getting their whole workday done their family day is done\nAnd they're writing halfway through the night right you know from eleven o'clock at three o'clock it's their world and then they wake up an hour later after does off in that part of their dream the mind is still work in his eye writing again and they actually they turn into zombies after a while\nAnd there's got to be some format to orchestrate a day maybe this is an idea for another book or marketing\nHow to orchestrate you're gay with social media and family life and all the other influences that are killing us now just sapping on day a valuable time maybe don't turn on anything until noon time\nOh I yeah definitely that they get to stay away from the TV stay away from the radio the fame or living now I'm On stay away from the ... I mean you have your traditional media that you want to stay away from\nAnd you've got the the new ... the social media you want to you know because you're you're trying to write in ... contact people I Would say you gotta limit that\nYou know 'cause it it will sap you\nThey are the people creating these platforms want you on there so they will use any\nType of psychological uh aspect they can just keep you on the on air supply and it works you know 'cause if you have to just walk down the street and see people crossing the road with you know where their nose in a cell phone case where can people by this book or Amazon\nUm you can go to a steep or displace\nStillwater global yeah Rhode Island's knows bookstore I'm writing down time but they're good\nAnd uh how about your own Web site on the Web site yes okay that way you control more of the profit down now to when you have a direct sales immortality wars dot com and then also um you can get an autographed copy by going on Europe ... website also correct you can request that no problem\nAnd also you do have a website that has a calendar of wherever we can look for your book signings\nIt's on it's on immortality wars dot com and there's a a banner at the top of the home page says events okay you go there now you'll see that I have this interview\nOkay now also on this um we have a bigger event coming up the authors ... at the roads ...

are desperate to\nPoverty have no money how how do they have enough money to get on a train it\nThey're not going to be able to get on the train\nJoes buying the dream tickets\nWell that somebody is somebody that has to get to read pay these people to at least get into our country and especially Rhode Island and then once they get to Rhode Island there's nothing easier than getting welfare and you're right I mean I Know more people\nWhen we had a business that came into our straw and there were a little sad and I I can guarantee cage that they had money but that's the name of the game the politicians want to help people like that so that they can get the volt I we get a bunch of politicians that as far as\nI'm concerned we should get rid of every one of the my personal opinion goes on a Republican is because I care for him I said I'd love to see it go forward but I stayed isn't going forward when I see in the newspaper that I read that we are so down\nAnd those tapes but that I read that we are so down we don't do the proper things\nIt makes me feel bad because I Love my state up but yet we don't do anything about it now how can we do it if we can try to contact somebody for online I think\nThey don't bother because they feel that part of this world that is the senators representatives and everything else I mean so you know what\nI had voted all my life as a Republican and I feel proud that I had the opportunity to be going in a couple weeks to vote and I am so proud of and I was so proud to see that as rating has gone up so I think he's going to make it also comeback is president\nI think I'd been running oh one like him and I don't care what people say in the state about me I mean I Know some people at Democrats that's my opinion and I don't have to expect anything from him because I had worked all my life and I don't need to go to welfare to get my uh earnings\nSnap tonight and unless an all these people that are getting government services they need to get jobs we can't with them and all these people ... Raimondo telling the Caribbean people come to Rhode Island will give you everything for free and get on welfare and we can't afford to lose Caribbean people\n... ... ... and Jan not only that but if you see the things that are happening in different areas of Rhode Island I mean someone's getting shot and\nSomeone's getting stand as this fights\nI mean I never remember when I was younger I mean and I was around a lot of people 'cause I Lived in an area where it was federal help but\nWe had the nicest people you could ever need and a lot of the foreign is they came from the Israeli or other types of the world and yet they were courteous\nThey went to work and they made a living and the children got an education but not all of these ... that are coming in and yet you can't it can't I said to anyone because they get very upset if that Democrats\nSo I don't know what's gonna happen but all I can say is I Am working I done just to see my friend to come in that trend and as governor well I Hope some does come in\nCars are you only have you have in\nIt he deserves it is a is it a gentleman all key but he's a very nice man I mean I he is nine there and I like him very much and I don't need anything from him but he does his job he walks around and see things going on and as always\nVery low key and this is what we need we don't need Jasmine Guy I think that's something we've got some senators and representatives they think the president of the United states there I don't want to mention names but there are at a point where\nThey really want to stay in the house of representatives they'll set it and do what they want to do they have a ball they're not doing anything for the people in our state they just going around doing for themselves\nTried and like that's the ...\nOh yep you'll out I like Tim from day one and I guess he ... he probably wouldn't like me but I could care less I mean I express my opinion and I know that many people don't like it but I think I'm being\nAnd the president is doing the best he can with the Democratic party that is against the period autumn lie\nI looked at how even everything that went on with them the legislature I'm sure I think John it's really a group of them I think some of those Democrats in Congress really would like to switch\nBut they have I don't know it has to be making deals because anybody with a half a brain would know that Trump is joined an excellent job I mean everything that he's doing I mean how can they not even say\nLet them stay another four years but they don't\nI mean that's the way they are and they're not going to change and I remember for all the guys that I voted that that's where the Democrats were always that way they know how to give people jobs and people are happy getting old

her show on Tuesday we'll post many times I call him that it's sort of the year or two people that you should know about this is a perfect example\nTo me of you don't have to be an elected official 'cause neither one of Rob Cody or can block our elected officials but they pay attention to what's going on\nThey do know the law and as far as when I say they know the law they know that there were certain public documents that should be transparent should be made available to the public\nAnd Rob Cody who I have tremendous respect for who is I Would call them he's an active citizen advocate and also like you know Ken Block ... lives about what can block has the business of work they found it odd somehow\nCan block has the business of work these founded on somehow regarding some of the payments the amount of money that we're being paid with the war fire department\nSo they started to record request and these are old records hopes these are public documents okay this is public sector paid for the public teacher contracts buyer contracts state contracts these are all public sector not private\nPublic sector you are paying a city treasurer city or whoever it may be some of the worst city a town B a working you have a right to know exactly what they're being paid they may not like it but that's part of working for\nThe public sector will they started to get some of the records by some of the work fire department and it just didn't seem to add up so not only did it not not add up\nBut they discovered that they seem to be as our legal experts ... described almost like a double dipping going on with with the time\nWell this has triggered\nWhat they're finding now is the lack of what a word but these so called sight deals\nWhere you have the deal but it's basically put in motion never OK city council town council may prove that goes on and then they have a separate side deal the signing off on its up no one knows about this ideal except in Warwick they filed a grievance because they weren't getting this ideal and that is triggered suddenly everybody should be looking at\nAre there these so called side deals and then it resulted in I Would call it harassment were then they tried to go after an intimidating can block but now it sounds like we have another victim here and it happens to be the tone obese credit joining us right now is our friend the\nOne and only can block good afternoon or\nGood afternoon John how are you this find\nVery well no I I Hope I tried to set that up a little bit but what I'd I'd like to as we walk through this little bit I Would be curious issue when Rob Kuti was starting to look at some of the cost starting just with the work firefighters\nWhat what triggered basically if you guys realize like this this doesn't make sense how old is he being paid off never mind the incredibly generous to pay of twenty six days but would suddenly how did you discover that they had this this so called side deal\nSo the contractors put in and do not it's rare to find there were votes on it and then I say to the firefighters of a certain town on the city will tell you what\nA ten thousand dollars finds its way into my desk drawer I can uh\nWe'll do a little side deal here and you guys can come up with something like that I'm not saying that that happened but it's certainly open the door if you're going to start these people are going to start activating in doing basically be quote side deals on their own which is blind to the public and even the council I\nI don't see how that is in a criminal act in an element of fraud\n[noise] yeah I I I consider it minimally fraudulent because it violates all check and balance processes\nIn place but according to your daughter corruption that included ...\nAnd and and the blame goes to both sides of the negotiation in this case yeah because both sides know you're not supposed to do things this way yeah and where they look here's the real problem the real problem is all too often\nThe labor unions are negotiating with friends and family yes right exactly\nRight oh they're they're they're not negotiating with somebody representing the taxpayer is that right there negotiating with somebody willing and able to do whatever they asked them to do violate the law to provide them cash outside of the ... the contracted outside of legal avenues\nSo yeah it's a huge problem it's fraudulent in every way and it might be fraudulent legally I I Can't make that determination\nBut I Hope it is and I do hope that law enforcement investigate it and you know what if we if it is not a violation of law in some way well we better change our laws to make it\nSets right now do do we know I I don't know for police could investigate this because of their ties with fire and also maybe with the city or do we know is there an investigation going on in the state police involved or or do we know any of that\nI don't know I don't have any specific information about you know what law enforcement stewing\nAnyway and you don't want to you know any ... you know what I Do find comical is the new head of the union ... new sully he filed disagreements which basically triggered\nBe alarmed builder Solomon beside deal had been in place that's how either either were ignorant or be that's just how you know greedy they were\nBut on top of that I like his comment to the Providence Journal asked about the twenty Thirteen language wasn't in the twenty fifth in collective bargaining agreement that's the previous union leadership and then says the\n... I Hope to quote move move forward from this well if I was involved with them like this and there should be refunds\nFrom this well if I was involved with them like this and there should be refunds war the mountain literally hundreds of thousands of dollars it sounds like you could easily surpass one million I Would also want to move on from something like that\nYeah I I find the whole book the union has changed their story a bunch of times over the last six months not a whole lot differently than how war city administration officials\nHave changed their story okay uh so you know the union doesn't have clean hands here the union obviously knew about the existence of this ideal because they were compensating underneath that\nAh right underneath this ideal and it was way out is back with what the contracts that they could do a I confronted the fire chief in the city council meeting with all of this he never volunteered at that point in time that they were operating under a secrets ideal\nSo you know I mean it's it's there is no way the current union has clean hands\nUh and it's not like the the union president now had no idea what the union president before did a I refuse to believe that um it frankly in the same way that I find it very difficult to believe that mayor ... didn't know that his city solicitor was signing agreements behind his back\nYeah that does seem a sea very odd and can I just want to circle back to get books good afternoon it's John ... show was speaking with Ken Block\nWho I'm certainly has uncovered the Cybill can so basically how would a city in town soon we're listening right now I'm not sure how do they find out it'd be a city or town is involved with one of these quote side deals\nWell uh we're going to try and find that out on behalf of every city and town we're reading and apple requested open records request to every Rhode Island city and town asking them for a all the particulars of all of their side deals for the last ten years\nSo uh we'll put that in we'll see what happens I suspect\nThere'll be a lot of people throwing up on their shoes and a ultimately we may have a you know we may have to take action to get this information from some cities and towns uh who choose not to obey Rhode Island's open records law\nAnd we're going to need a new attorney general which we're going to get ... hopefully very soon yeah because this the one we have now as just massacred Rhode Island's open records laws and and I wouldn't try to force this information out of any city and town underneath the sky we have now\nI agree with you and also what is um [noise]\nHe's crazy is the fact that and I'd like how you even pointed out you know here you have what was uncovered last night in this meeting in east Greenwich and instead the Providence Journal bully do is report on what happened and then when the big part of the story\nHappens to be the last night there was a woman who they celebrated who turned one hundred years old\nYeah the the journal reporter [laughter] ah I'm going to be as ... as a nice here as I can be given the circumstances\nApparently had no idea the importance\nOf what happened with these a discussion of all of these side agreements or it it it it given that this has been on the front page of her newspaper for three three days last week\nThe fact that she barely covered what happened here in east Greenwich is mind blowing to me and and and honestly you know it's embarrassing for the Providence Journal to to have missed this story this badly\nOr I Would suggest you probably shouldn't be covering these things anymore\nYeah I don't I don't understand that with everything on other than\nMaybe it's possible that the reporter just did not understand the significance of the story I mean to find out about eleven secret side agreements were exposed a obviously you know open the door that that is the big part of the story\nAnd then the eastern his last night\nThese eat secret agreements never seen ratified by the town council costing taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars\nThat could be obviously involved financial consequences and then instead it's just a quick little thing at the end of the of the paragraph that some\nAt the end of the story excuse me that that isn't exactly you know get the gist of the story um can uh give give out your has\nIt's not as popular surprise\nWinning but no one has job but at least I'll give the journal credit at least they do have an editorial\nDangers of secret payouts I have to admit I this is something that I was unaware of and they go through ... in ... in ... strong struck the deal\nWith the venue firepower to union president William Lloyd adhesion insisted hadn't known about the deal he would not have approved so at least Solomon his civil didn't do it can do we know\nDoes this type of side deal exist in the city of Providence that last time I checked when you were trying to find out um with with the city of Providence and environment is ... what do they have it wasn't like an eight hundred page contract\nYeah I spent the last month trying to get out of the city of Providence the exact contract language in effect for the fire department and the police\nAre I think I've nearly got what I Need from them now and I'll be able to tell you exactly how many pages when I when I did this and twenty Fifteen\nI was dealing with more than seven hundred pages going back to Nineteen Ninety something oh my God it goes ... ... so ... in war work and in east Greenwich and in fact in every Rhode Island community\nThe contracts those municipalities have with their fire departments\nAs a single document they ratify the complete contract every time\nThey renegotiated immigrants they don't do that they don't Providence they bring out a a two to twelve page memo\nThat says you know incorporate everything that came before and we're going to change the stuff okay so then you've got to go get what came before modified what came before that modify what came before and he had literally had to go back to the early Nineteen nineties God get the original document they started doing it so now\nSo you know you want to read the contract to understand what's in it\nYou got to get the first sentence out of Nineteen Ninety two then you've got to look through all the other documents to see if that sentence has been changed by anybody along the way and now you know what the first sentences then you've got to go anywhere it's it's it is a ridiculous situation there's no way\nThe city can possibly know what's in effect said hey given point in time friday because they have to go back\nAnd do exactly what I just described to you literally for every sense it's a ridiculous situation and frankly every ... or Providence mayor who has signed an agreement that allows us to continue is is just\nHurting his or her own ability to manage to the contract because they can't possibly know what the contractors\nWhat do you say you've seen on the news you have all these illegals now they're seven thousand strong and building the ten thousand euro members of gang members cartels you could have members of bum terrorists than they're marching their way there one thousand miles from the U.S border\nAnd President Trump is saying there's no way that I'm In fact going to let them in should we let

was and if I let you go I had a discussion earlier today with a friend of mine who\nIs very liberal and he said to me you know these people are leaving a horrible situation and we have to give them refugee status\nAnd I argued with them because last week from what I understood\nIf Mexico offered refugee status to any of these people that are crossing the border and they were these people refused it that we did not have to offer them refugee status because they had already been offered and refused [noise]\nThat's what I understood that we have a discussion about that maybe I'm wrong maybe somebody else they could uh clarify the situation\nWell what we do is onset of sending the money the since the Disney middle middle of a marriage after all America or give it to Mexico and we'll feed

guess for the call that it wasn't a man with a girlfriend in high school or Cory Booker um let's kiss kiss\nTrying to track it broke her and she swat it on his hand away and um\nI guess to that was the end of that and in Nineteen Ninety two when he was a student at Stanford University he wrote a column for his college a paper\nIn which he recounted the groping and used his own behavior to underscore and starkly personal terms how he feels had shifted and\nA ... and he had he had a more a respect for a woman\nAnd I remember reading not during the Kavanaugh hearings\nWell that's when it came out but when I was doing a bona gay convention\nAnd that a gay convention\nThis is one of the Cory Booker accused of sexual assault by a gay man and the gay convention that's the latest song and

story maybe that's why I Want to try looking it up on that what L\nL G D D D you or whatever\nIt is on the on the thing is that if it's true for me to ... you know going both ways\nLoud [laughter] I

whatever they're in you know hopefully uh they'll they will maybe they'll get a little ah ah maybe they'll get a little spots I don't know [noise] so what do you think of that news\nI think that's great news myself\nIt is and nowhere in the news you know we can't find it but\nIt's there if you really look for their\nHannity ... and and he talked about it\nBut he is about the only one\nSo anyways I thought that was great news for us as a as a country and also bad news ah California wants to secede as well no um they're actually pushing more and more for it\nUh I don't think that'll ever happen in the military complex in I'm In California is humongous\nWell what we do we just turn the turn the uh the the the wall to wall of kind of phone yeah all the way inside and then we treat the biggest like\nKorea and they they are our country and we don't have many aid\nI think it will go a lot worse than that I mean if it ever came right down to it I think it would be civil war [noise]\nI don't think they can succeed by federal law\nI don't think they can also see but I Know that they're trying to make it you know they they can ah refused taxation they can refuse paying taxes [noise]\nOne of the things they're trying to do is big three different states on account on the phone yeah what gives them more congressman\nYeah there's um [noise] well no that that yeah they're trying to make three different states out of it but that's a part of the part of the appeasement for secession\nAnd I think it's a I think it's I mean I talked to somebody who who was a very very knowledgeable I didn't like what they had to say a but it was very knowledgeable about the secession idea\nAnd um they shouldn't you know a week we our economy is booming and we don't you know we don't we have more fortune five hundred companies in this state than any place else in the world [noise]\nAnd then they're right so I don't know I just think I just think ah you know some good news and some bad news\nWhen I Do know that there's one county in California that the residents of that's counting ... to ... percent of all the taxes on this thing\nWell yeah it's good to be there's Eighteen million people in the LA area\nEight ... million people in the LA area where they kill us well she never see anything like it in your life don't get me wrong there's a lot of people there's a

... how she's doing this to him [noise]\nWell you know they say politics is dirty business but um it's really not politics it's dirty it's the\nPeople you don't spend ten grand beat me up the other guy do Brendan grand tell me about your record what you've done not that that's where you should be a positive campaign\nWhat did she did she sell because it's been a while and I you know please forgive me for those of you who can't stand listening to this but it she's so Providence street field on\nNot yet a somebody did but there are a little much lower and I don't know the city council is going to uh go with that\nShit Ken eight am I correct the so barren fields Detrow\nOh well she tried to go to court were thrown out of\nGoods were forging loom application she she was signing his support by uh the school committee that didn't know anything about it and you know and then not properly done the control of the school committee she can't do anything with that property unless the school committee gives it to the city\nThey have to have to give it to the city then it's been a city or would it have to try to break the deed\nBecause the school committee elected now or are they appointed\nThey're there they're going to be elected in two weeks and be elected in two weeks that try doing November sex anybody could run it that's a pretty decent people running yeah you know like ... like oh\nWell all of the many of the people who served on these appointed they're running okay and a woman named you probably recognize is I mean NATO\nIs she right she's running the school committee oh wow you know and ... vote for that one young she brings a lot to the table she well she doesn't take any crap oh no no no no\nShe doesn't she shares a straight shooter\nHas its good then\nThat he transferred into the one Eighteen engineering that could be activated and they go on the Cape and there was shooting led\nAnd then polluting or are we let me tell you that that's ridiculous\nWe have a a polluted banking I'm able to roll ... all the time would lead in the field in a in a bank okay\nWhat I was told that they go to a lot of ... oldest air force base every year as qualified and nothing to do with preparing to go to Vietnam okay waiting these oil is ridiculous plus the fact\nThat what do you enter the natural God he ended the one eighty one hundred and eliminate deep\nIt generic company so what do they transferred to\nOkay\nThen he produces a W do form okay and the W. to form is very clear that a\nTotal active service which would have been for boot camp in school it's three months twenty six days what even than if you're a God's been was activated you want to serve a hundred eighty days to be considered a veteran even beat that\nOkay so it doesn't qualify under that either that or it's just unbelievable and I'm looking at is that if something he posted\nOkay\nI'm not saying that in service to God's honorably I never try I never tried to make them a non veteran all I'm doing is really low law\nOkay read the law\nAnd this guy's gonna rip it off the city when you've got hundreds onto a God's been out there that never never put in for it because they knew that they didn't qualify your God's meant that did qualify\nAnd your military people that says active duty than and qualify evidence of during the conflict\n\nMy understanding is that even a previous\n\nAssesses but if anyone socket would never approve of this\nHim getting a uh that the all you had to serve in the conflict okay well let's go back what\nThe application these signs\nOkay well let's go back what what is the application he signs\nOkay this is what he says I Richard Stein it\nServed in the armed forces or the United states in Vietnam War and it was honorably discharged chair of the date of active duty being July city at Seventy one\nThat's what they come out of school okay data discharge Nineteen Seventy seven\nSeventy one Seventy seven as what six years hello anybody on\nOkay that voted two thousand ten unbelievable\n\nYou can decide okay well I'm telling you is is that when I had the discussion with them okay when he was running the first time and money while the other way I supported him when he ran for other\nPolitical offices for representative\nAnd I asked him about why he did go in the military he said my father maybe joined the gods\nOkay and I said well\nWhere you were a minor he said yes well according to this he was not a minor it was and I and when he joined the gods\nI think it was Twenty years old\nAnd then when he said yesterday that he wanted to go to Vietnam and he trying to engineer into a company that was going to go well very simple you walk down to an army recruiting office raise your right hand and you were going to Vietnam\nNothing but watchman Noah is what it's talking about for some reason he feels that if he served on the gods\nAnd it was not considered a veteran he doesn't get a VA cod I said well where's your vehicle to go to Providence VA autumn have one he talked about yesterday some brigadier general calling them send them the Lawrence change I never said he couldn't get a mortgage\nOkay that wasn't what would be an address\n\nAnd then he said he was like Jessica mosh joke of mine for governor God's wasn't a naval reserves he was active in the United States Navy like Roger joy was asked to the United States Navy\n\nOkay they enlisted\n\nI mean I I Know many more are lieutenants after people the reduced the four teams you got me talking to myself\nAnd the and it doesn't many of my email is have done what I did and your Google what is a veteran and all the states come up and I gave it to him when he was running so he went on them understand and I think that's why I change this card\nYou should be proud to be seven or ... but don't tell you I said my country\nYou serve Richard fat and in what you did okay you want an obligation to the United states since your age you had a choice trying to God's or go active\nBasically that's that's the choice you had\nAn end up by the way I support both decisions\n\nOkay I see nothing wrong with with him joining the God's already buddy joining the gods\nOkay who don't want to go to war\n\nBut many people dead and maybe God been did go active\n\nAnd they get their benefits now during training when he went to can't drum if he got injured he would be automatically considered a veteran of the United states\nBasically\nThat's what it comes down to so I'm done with this and this guy I mean it's a the the uh uh [noise]\nWhy he can't come just apologize this guy from there to keep seeing everybody in Woodstock and he's not perfect you're not a perfect person open no one's perfect but at the does he ever take responsibility for anything\nTo anything that he does we're still waiting for the Pandora's box\nThat he's steady insulted the entire council that the first the first in history when socket tell them that they had to vote for his legislation or else which was by the way under his own words stated he was asked to put it together by the by the planning department which made it was every legislation\nHe just sponsor for the administration but instead of going through the council president\nAnd by the way he he gave somebody some sheets a buddy different socket my gosh he's got a big a list of the mayor\nHe's only won the southern counseling but I don't want to break the news to him because he done this on Facebook and not only to putting out of a flyer that he says he ... he's a he was in charge of to rabbi clinics\nBats right not rabies rabbis\nThat's exactly what it says\nI I I don't want to break the news to you we've been having rabies clinics and they said he would socket fun I was a councilman\nOkay [laughter] the guy is in so it was so insecure you can't do a job as a legislator he got to do everything via like a boy scout\nJust do your job right but I just ... I had a right is legislation for the attorneys you never hear about that idea\nI'd only way you're gonna stop or you you got to get control of it not against the attorney but it just becomes a control of the council you're paying the bills so what's what's what happens is the first thing they do it the iron attorney and he loves to do it\nOr the or the city's live sort of a sudden it's okay what do you think he's going to say it's not okay [laughter] good afternoon Romney yeah\nGeorge Burns side yes I respect lots are very knowledgeable\nI agree with a lot of things you say but I Wish it would be that big a man and get off its back we all know what he's about I I this is the last time I talk about it\nWell let me tell you\nI don't know who's who are political adviser is but we don't we can't men and campaign managers as Bob moral ... housing authority okay on believable unbelievable Bob\nHope and you even never mind and after the Iranian yeah\nJohn your previous caller reminded me about that male up yes I could not believe that they said that to my house\nThey the picture they put it that made it look like it was as far as the show for baby\nDiscuss thing at all the accusations of things I think that's a character Sasha or assassinate borderline on a\nA a a\n... get a lawsuit against that I don't believe any of those things are there Saturday in that fly at all the money she must suspect in the house you have your dad city to send that to my house\nReally upset about that ... that is corrupt in my mind that a politician she must be scared like he needs to wear diapers Vegas Sarah for having this show by\n... by a female\nIn Nineteen sixty nine I enlisted in Rhode Island and National Guard I spent six years sixty nine Seventy five was honorably discharged in Nineteen Seventy five although I Am proud to serve my state I have never consider myself a veteran\nI don't have the VA card and I don't have any privileges afforded veterans\nMany of my family and veterans did go to war in Vietnam so I'm getting back severely wounded and it's embarrassing to sing mystified tells himself as a veteran and a veteran of Vietnam especially since he only served in the national guard\nGoing to boot camp and having them to train centers do not consist of active duty summer camp or two week deployments each year consist of active duty or Mr than you and I did not go to war\nSo we're not veterans only national guardsmen with Twenty years of service or given veteran status but none of us who served\nOnly six years I have a great day polls Jay CPA\nCandidate for school committee by the way and I'm sure we'll be elected\nGood afternoon your honor yeah good afternoon John Hi Hi\nUh having now is the fact that term very long time um I think it's disgusting way he profiled and my last name ... I think his friends for a long time ago they're riffraff yes his\nBrother was killed in Vietnam like probably come back the crap out of ... a ... it's disgusting and my question is so what is the process\nTo get him to not only a theory poked from receiving that but to get back the money 'cause I think talking about\nIt is great because you're bringing it out in the public who has to do what in order to get them off\nOne of the first thing that has to be done is on the uh the council has to meet with the assassin\nA and a gonna go over because because if if in fact he's entitled to it you've got hundreds of God's men and other military people peacetime veterans that even served on active duty\nThat never ... applied for the exemption or because they didn't qualify for an NFL qualified you got people that\nThe ... years and years ago that adopt and getting the exemption or because they were turned down or they never I don't like they took position I missed the ... is that they're not considered veterans if you're a veteran of the time\nAnd I think you're right you know I I'm not gonna read\nYou that because you're reading it read English very well everybody\nHeard it said ... and I remember when you were talking about this when you were supporting him and it had been a subject on your radio program how many years back\nI and I know you and told them I think that's kind of work but you know he must have known [laughter] uh it it wasn't really a something that should be John and he kinda dropped it I guess and how long did you say and receiving that ten year\nTwo thousand ten two thousand and ten okay for seven eight yes\nWell then ten thousand ten okay for seven eight yes\nI I really hope that the city council a person that I Know I contact the city council and guy command it because I think it's high insult to everyone who\nDoes the right thing doesn't try to pursue it and you know has bullying attitude I'm sure that he went in to speak to the faster it was a time and just you know try to intimidate bully I his way into getting way he wanted\nTo see one of the things they asked for the DVD to fourteen showdown active duty\nAnd I think in in what they see active duty or you know they they're not in the business of of uh of questioning a I'm a veteran okay and he ended the fact is the reason that that a deployment on on uh up to when they go to Sam drum is active duty\nFor some reason because they get paid by the government\nOther than from the state so for for the time they are on active duty the only thing that that the de do for dean is it's a show that he got he was activated the go to the training\nOn the boot camp or not the boot camp with the training requirement of the gods instead of getting a check from the United state of Rhode

been known in the community for thirty one years I'm not a native of from the one sock it to the Blackstone valley originally native from were stack 'em but I consider myself a grew up there as a kid as a kid up until it was about sixteen then I moved to New York and a\nHalf my life was in the New York area both in the military and every time I left the ... coming back to New York again to continue doing it until I got it right [laughter] and then one day I find myself retiring out of the military and I came back to the east coast and for some odd reason I came down to the Blackstone valley and fell in love with a\nWith the black some valley fell in love with the people here and the attitude or\nEven though the the area was depressed as it was thirty thirty one years ago it's still had a quality to it that drew me to want to stay in to become a part of this a unique community\nNeeds a place it's easy to fall in love with them and if you don't believe me and you never left when the socket delicious [laughter] [laughter] it's just as a as a ... when you've been to other places have a great community to be part of um which did\nNamed ... I mean I I mean I can remember knowing you as Johnny\nLong before I ever knew Richard ...\nAre you remember when you got that Monica was at a do talk radio to have a prior\nNo I just did it came up but in the course of course my military career I have dual labels service has was a ... pound gone by Mr a day on about being a naval service and leaving there because I didn't have the hips rebel bought him some [laughter]\nAnd joined the marine corps um\nI'm Sorry [laughter] and joined the marine corps a but again\nI I'm very proud of my um my door and they will serve as a ... not only having started my career in the navy but finishing it in the in the marine corps and I'm going to get picked up because I was going to research it and that's how it came about and uh\nI'm a Vietnam veteran uh I Know there's been some controversy about the local a city or\nIndividual were mystified and that's a schedule for another discussion sometime later but ah I Am had boots on the ground sprinter was over in Vietnam during the Tet Offensive so\nWhen you um [noise] near time of the western New York or when you hear how do you ever thrown your hat and a political\nRing fired and there's some never never numbered I uh I'm not a political a candidate and in the sense of being an animal and and wanting to considered politics as a career move from I'm going to be Seventy three years of age I looked at the candidates that were running a\nWith no disrespect to discourse as like Melissa Marie I just do not like her politics or she's a progressive liberal\nAnd uh I'm a moderate conservative and are both drank Twain's won't meet basically a eye for the twenty four years that Senator Mark Cody has been a a elected senator and the for the state Senate ah\nI've like him a ... I like he can use an old line Democrat I started my political career and on\nDemocratic side of the party a many years ago but then they found between the Republicans and Democrats I just didn't like way either the parties were going and I decided it was time for me to consider being an independent and from that point on I have been [noise]\nThe or independent or Monica around here if you look at the the voting numbers are they even outweigh the Democrats independents that alleges\nAbsolutely but it's getting those independents devote All right and not vote for the Democratic side on the Republican side not to say that either side doesn't have its candidates that are decent people what's at the interest of or their constituents but I find that over the last if you look at the history of the political interest in this state alone\nTrust how the state would spend the money up so um but I Would keep it here in the home you know the community that gets you had\nWhat we don't deserve to have to look a definitely and I buy a new pair of sneakers that'd be on the top of the list as well uh Richie Caribbean studio talking some Senate affairs marijuana is bound to come up with ... what is it on the medical marijuana Massachusetts is moving into the retail\nThey have a decriminalized and regulated it has gone ahead here uh they've been kicking the can the conversation down the road or however um it's bound to hit for a for a vote or a study at some point in time or we know of other states in in even Canada recently\nThey criminalizing indeed they have a viewpoint on a marijuana should it Senate about\n... yeah I I I Would but yet you know I I got to look at it into the news because in my earlier part even in the military I was worked with impunity in criminal investigation division so we used to bust people for marijuana in the military uh\nAnd being in law enforcement being a deputy sheriff from Southern California the same thing so now here we are two thousand Eighteen Nineteen we're going to legalize marijuana in the state but it's still not federally sanctioned a\nWhat do I like I I think if it's regulated properly it's like any other drug if it's regulated properly and conducted properly I think there is a uh the the possibility that it will uh it'll do well uh\nIt's no more no less and I I don't want to try to compare it with alcohol 'cause they're two different you know it's like apples and oranges but if it's well regulated I think there's that possibility that it will\nHelp our society for those folks that need that to\nA pet\n... from uh the marijuana to help them out in ...\nThe uh conversation is going to be a lengthy one\nI think it'll take probably more than a year to get through and everything because once he goes to study can be there for a little while his one's going to be studied uh but uh you know the boom Massachusetts said just bone passed it a an issue like that is such a hotly debated wanna\nYou have the ability to legislate it through the house through the Senate you also have the ability you put it on the ballot let the people decide absolutely let them do that you you prefer the ballot let the people\nJust absolutely I learned I think that people have the right to make the decision as to how our society should go a good bad or indifferent majority rules and that's exactly how it should be\nEthics oversight of the general assembly you have a an opinion on that or the ethics commission or the ... our general assembly our general assembly\nI'm skeptical because I mean you've seen some of the the stuff that's happened over the years you get a studio thirty eight you know you had that problem there the situation that came up\nStudio thirty eight you know you had that problem there the situation that came up uh you've had other issues over the years with uh the uh with the way the uh the political\nThoughts have gone in as taking this state and I don't see that uh we should depend upon\nThem to to to dictate everything that we do in this state I think it should come back to us also in in the form of being able to ballot in other words it goes before the house they say okay let's pass it so it goes before a referendum and it goes on the ballot and then allow the folks in this state to make the final determination to decision\nI uh have a an update here I received the communication from your opponent you're addressing earlier on the subject of a debate show\n'em and er here says open for one if I can answer invited so I Will attempt to coordinate a with a with the candidates maybe we can\nGet a radio form at least here certainly station\nAnd uh and do some thank you for that Melissa appreciate it All right I'm I'm a little a little outrageous I can invite 'em all [laughter] see what happens this of this for an hour of us Richard Caribbean studio asking for your vote will keep you updated on that and we'll keep you updated to a ... of it\nBut let's say something or may move along their ... we are talking to Richard ... and we want you to familiarize yourself with the man known as Johnny is running for say a twenty four\nOr pay for my rich you guarantee a you talked about veteran and a veteran services are of course you're deeply familiar with those are as a state senator you see anything you can impact there for your fellow brother and I\nI think that any programs that are available especially for disabled veterans I'm a disabled veteran but I'm nowhere near the disability that I've seen in\nSo many my fellow brothers and sisters down at the VA hospital for the last thirty some odd years that had been going to lead facility or so whatever programs I can get a negotiated with veteran organizations to help fellow veterans I'm willing to work on their behalf [noise] uh I'm also wanting to look at\nGetting the steak stop taxing\nFolks that are on pensions this thing of ... of taxation upon folks that on Social Security and other types of pensions is absurd\nIt's an insult I mean these folks worked all their lives and everything to get to where they are to retire and only have the state come back and say all like on the tax you on one of the ... I mean I I think the average a Social Security pension is a thousand dollars and change among the sinking attacks them on that really\nI mean there's just no sense in that does that said absolutely absurd it's an insult to the folks that have made this country what it is that given their blood you know they've given this there's sweat and tears to be successful hopefully to come to where they are in the junction of their life they managed to survive\nAnd now the state kick some men to face and says all but go get it get a pension and we're going to tax you on that I'd like to see that stop I really would not because I'm an old guy All right I'm Sorry ...\nNose or\nOnly ask me how old I Am along with the marine corps and my birthday I'm three hundred sixteen years old I'm looking for a big dog going good for three hundred and sixteenth [laughter]\nThey ah they ah men in Studio Richie ... running for\nState Senate district twenty four of course we're talking about um the northern half of one socket yes and a north Smithfield area as well or he is running as an independent\nOr he is labeled himself a moderate conservative is Cindy I'm which isn't so far right wing he's falling off the table but he can see across the party line capsules so to speak or a fiscal conservative\nWent somewhat I Would say yeah I Would like to consider myself and within that was\nA good question is do we have a a a revenue problem or a spending problem\nIs is that both [laughter] we have a revenue problem because we haven't learned to read the the people that we put in office to represent us how to bring in\nEntrepreneurs with money that wants to come to the state because they want to invest not only in the car and put the future of the state so we have to look at that spending what we already know we're in debt so stopped Hispanic\nOr what we we all have our own budget within our own means I mean we have to stay within that if we don't\nWe end up going in debt we end up filing bankruptcy God Forbid or anything else we ended up losing our homes or whatever it may be or anything else on moving in our lives because of the ... of what were we were caught ourselves doing\nWell in the same thing holds true for the state it's time for the state to really take a look at itself and say this is where the spending starts this is when we regroup this was when we start putting our dollars to good\nInstead of spending previously and spending to the bat ah we lost the protected Red Sox why again from negotiation a bargaining a\nAnd then again you're up against Massachusetts ended up against the cosmopolitan city like Worcester\nFor what it's what the hell of a heck of a lot bigger unprotected is has a lot more to offer and why would I if I were a a a person that stock in the ... Red Sox and I was given an offer like they were given up there it was hello goodbye you know\nAnd that's exactly what happened here and unfortunately politics played a role to play a role in Massachusetts but yet the politics up there\nWent down the road with the opportunity of right wing of grabbing a hold of an organization and bring 'em there\nWe lost All right\nSo again so we get to protect the red Sox for next year or two in there by by and then we'll have to take the train up to ah hopefully the trend will be on the runway can take it up to ... to watch the uh ... whatever they're going to be called the ... once our country whatever who says okay you know it doesn't sound like\nNo no it does [laughter] you know I'm not sure how uh other mass God's gonna look at it\n[laughter] [laughter] I'm trying to figure that one I really you have you on the air I Can't come up with the kind of a chef ... going to the gym\nOr ... or ... calling us fight and in my cell

our\nRoads and schools weren't just repair\nWas struggling but over the last four years under governor a Mondo we've invested in our school taking strong to reduce gun violence turned our state and there were powerhouse renewable energy and we've seen a surge new jobs the brewing to manufacturing\nI think I ride\nA you know I don't know maybe it's me or what but when there's so much aid should

getting my nails done and\nAnd then now place and I ... I mean\nFinished her they came over to me I don't know\nFinished her they came over to me I don't know if that was in a wheelchair or what and she says the lord bless you and then she paid might tell\nYou that was nice [laughter] yeah but I'm just saying\nThey're honest people out there right\nYeah yeah but everybody is so I don't watch much television because I Can't stand all the fighting and unhappiness ... and I switched the world would change [noise]\nWell I you know when we look at what's going on in the um local area of cause the campaign is on and I ... I really believe that this particular campaign has brought out the worst and some people you know in this\nIn politics often times does that but this particular election year may may win a prize when it comes to nastiness and\nUh you know all that goes with it but um yeah I I think we're there there is a lot of hatred in the world it's all around us ...\nBat Mm Mm because we have to I'm not trying

number as we talk with you All right\nEmail comes in and it says ah the mayor's nasty attack ad against our brand\nIs a joke who does she thinks she's kidding all the garbage she's peddling about al brain is old news yet she included him on her team back in two thousand Thirteen during her first mayoral run but now he's a bad apple really\nShe says al brand was a member of the city council it almost drove when socket into bankruptcy she'd be gets the mentioned that her campaign manager\nA moral was a member of that council so is there a dear friend and biggest supporter Chris ... who has been on the council for eleven years\nThe real reason to city almost went bankrupt has because Lisa as a state rep cut millions of dollars from the city state aid to education which resulted in massive deficits and the school department [noise]\nShe has continued or attack on the socket education department and the Catholic regional school system with her pet project\nRise prep mayoral academy which siphons millions of dollars from the moon socket education department and is taking a prime piece of commercial real estate\nOff the tax rolls person\nSays dishonest Lisa tells us that al brand voted against new businesses in the city nonsense\nShe's the one who killed the sale of our lady of victories when none of the neighbors objected she also tried to kill the development of the old middle school because of the council didn't select her friends from Chicago last ... why doesn't she tell us\nA well we won't get into that okay anyway that's enough [laughter] seven six six

governor\nHe'd like to make changes at the DMV department of motor vehicles he said he would like to see staggered shifts\nTo extend the hours at the DMV that would make sense you know when you think of it are they the DMV is never opened in the evening not that I'm aware of anyway that's very inconvenient I mean you know there are people who work\nI mean I Know that you have to look hard for them there are people who do go to work every day and those who do don't have the opportunity to go to the DMZ during the day unless they take time out of work so yeah I I think that's a good

the ... thing you just said mhm I Can't help it if if the heck out of me that the government will so a company like both wagon and the folks\nWrong don't get a dime for the government gets on them on you know and ... on island gets ripped about the people in cars don't get any you know\nThat's a good point yeah you're right that the owners of the Volkswagen vehicles themselves I don't think we're in for anything where they\nHave happened a lot with stuff like that if the government money for them so mhm wow wow I I don't get that aren't really in the logic of our government\nGovernmental employees that way it was a couple of things that I called you on the first one wants to three weeks ago you were talking about how much dislike early signs that\nYes and I didn't get a chance to call I was going to call it was one time in my life when I enjoy the early signs that's and that's when my kids will just made life so much easier when it was\nDark out [laughter] you know it was just so much easier for them to bad uh-huh I like that yeah that's true that's true\nAnd the other thing I was calling ... you were just talking about um oh my gosh\nYou're talking about a moment ago\nWhere we were talking about jobs that are available you know has has has Brian K I imagine\nA lot of has gross sales are just people being in a store and see something and just get without planning on purchasing it\nOh well that you know that makes sense that doesn't make sense\nI imagine that with a large portion of their sales and that that's why I think are hurting uh-huh mhm yeah retailers rely on a big way right\nYes yeah you're right uh you know what do they call that impulse shopping and do you see something in nearby ... yeah\nI mean they pay a lot of money to have their products putting certain location ... kept those impulse purchases so\n... you know shock yeah and that's one thing about Toys R us I mean that was a toy store I so when you went in there it was toys aware as are now I I don't think there are any major toy store chains out there are there I mean and not\nOr aren't any that I Know and I know that it's been quite a while since Toys R us all the most toys I'm pretty sure\nWal Mart or with them a long time ago now what they're probably deposit back nearly as large as a Toys R us\nHere but I did hear I it seems to me I heard somewhere and I and I want to say it was [noise] I don't know if it was target it was ... or Walmart one of those changes may be both\nSaid that their plans are to expand their toys selection use more shelf space with toys knowing that the toys are us and gone\nSo uh that would make sense to you know ... yeah yeah they want a casual air toys sales have particularly\nFor the ones located where Toys R us says we're located\nRight right 'cause those are big ... those big stores I've been to the one where is it up on an adult burrow on route one and that that was a big toy store and you know quit a selection illness\nTrials world but what are you going to do\nYeah I remember a child who were on we had one here in one socket [laughter] yeah\nYeah yeah I thought it was just as good or better but oh well that was a kid so [laughter] well I have a good day and enjoy the early ...\nAll right you take you a nice hearing from you buy now open line conversation is what we're\nA nice area from you by no open line conversation is what we're offering you feel free to join us love to hear what's on your mind whether it'd be toys [laughter] first heard the politics whether it be though whether it's entirely up to you or whatever it is that\nYou would like to discuss okay seven six six\nThirteen eighty\nAnd again we were talking about the weather at the outset of the program a things seem to have passed by and I'm\nHopefully uh uh the weather will continue to improve but it was a pretty hairy situation about two hours or so ago on not far from here in North Providence where a a tornado actually touched down\nAnd there were some very severe thunderstorms all across Rhode Island in a well sections of Rhode Island and Massachusetts and we did get some lightning some you know here in greater one socket some heavy rain too but uh we lucked out but there are areas where\nThey were hit hard\nMaybe you have a comment seven six six Thirteen eighty that's our number [noise]\nGood afternoon Iran W went awry me hello their\nCar and I thought that quite yes yes planes Iraq ... ... ...\n... ... it's going to be what they're doing that and I thought oh\nYou know that I did hear something about someone was looking into a reopening the toys R Us is that a done deal or is it just in the talking stages\nI'm Talking right now okay [laughter] mine that I thought\nOkay I'm not familiar with that uh that chain or men do know anything about that store chain\nNo no no well again it seems like they've left to avoid with toys are us are being closed it does leave a void and as I was saying to the last caller I don't I don't know of any other toy chains out there I mean I Know I Know most of your big stores have toyed apartments but that's about it\nAnd now they may be like yeah you go on and and wrote about that at a ... or ...\nYou know I remember that I remember that\nWell we'll have to keep our eyes and ears open and see if in fact somebody does take over a toys are us and are they better hurry up and they plan on doing something for the holidays because they'll be like well we know it [laughter] that's a big buying time that's for sure\nOf somebody that play or not and I yeah and you know that that\nWell that's true too that would create some jobs 'cause I'm a I don't know exactly how many people lost their jobs at Toys R us but it's got to be substantial because that was a big chain stores all over the place so\nAn awful lot of people most of the lost their jobs the only good thing is there are jobs out there especially at this time as we approach the holidays so hopefully those people who lost their jobs and find a new job in you know ... some other\nRetail establishment\nWell thank you for the call and we'll keep our eyes and ears open how's that\nAnd I think that okay that's a painting like again and she had all the people\nWho yeah that's right Hi Kay bees I forgot about the bees or you know I was thinking a child world I I remember a child ... but you're right there was a KB wasn't there\nThat go in and then I went off you get there that you ain't got no\nWell we do have the empty stores space that's for sure\nYeah dining out okay so you know [laughter] you know that there yeah yeah well again thank you for the call okay you know by now that are in the same here but I Know say\nOkay a toy stores\nYou might have a comment seven six six\n\nAh [noise]\nAnd this email says the mayor's um behavior\nAnd animosity towards Mr Brennan is a disgrace\nShe should be ashamed of herself what she is saying about that man\nHas more class and she ever we'll hope to have let's send her a message on November sixth that comes from Roger\nKay maybe you have a comment or\nSomebody wants to know if the forums going to be on the radio tomorrow night yes WN are I Will be carrying the candidates forum on the radio do you want to be there in person it begins at six\nAnd seven eight and it's being held upstairs at a severely ... or ... depending on which way you want to look at it on ...\nStreet here in the quiet city of one socket time\nWe'd love to talk with you again about anything feel free to join us it is why we are here\nTo do so blonde is your independent candidate for Senate district twenty four when socket north Smithfield you're tired of Rhode Island politics you're insurances and taxes went up again you're pensions went into hedge funds under Raimondo and your benefits were caught\nBy politicians you're a senior citizens still with no Medicare backup like Massachusetts a working families minimum wage will be a dollar fifty an hour at a less than Massachusetts\nThis January if you're paying taxes on your cars and trucks to get to work for the luxury boats worth thousands to millions of dollars are still not paying\nAny sales or property taxes in Rhode Island this is your life under decades of this Democrat leadership\nClinton do some blonde was a Democrat and has now is your independent candidate you want to change do not\nYes and then unfortunately Larry like you were alluding to is that when you ... receive money\nThat people will give you money don't give you money because they like the way you look ... are they giving you money when the expectation that going to get something back in return and an incumbent mayor will always generally all raised their opponent unless they're pulling someone extremely well known\nBecause uh the people donate money to incumbents are people either a doing business with the city and want to be able to continue doing business and be a people who are looking to do business with the city so many times they'll see you know attorneys donating money developers\nUh people of that nature you know they're going to do business with cities and towns they want to be considered for contracts and for purchases so they donate to candidates who they think is going to likely when they donate to that Kennedy the most\nAnd so many of the big company so that they do is they donate on both sides so this way here they win either way um you know so they you know whoever gets in the ... the dog show and that's the that's the evil of politics\nIt's it's the buying your way into politics and then when you take money or a substantial amount of money from any individual or group\nThen you feel compelled to ask to you know do what that group wants you to do because they gave you the money and also when you run for reelection you want them to donate to you again\nAnd and that's a that that that that's the cancer and a political system in this country that just one socket everywhere\nAnd I think one way that could improve the situation would be by having term limits number one yeah and probably finance a um\n... somehow control the finances of uh of campaigns you you need to limit how much money as a person can spend in a campaign\nRight I agree with you totally Larry a congressional races presidential races um city council may all racist everything should have a limited amount of money you can spend\nAnd you should not be able to get any donation some individual some companies corporations some lobbying groups\nWhat each candidate should be given as a ... allotted amount of money\nSome some ... some kind of pull on money and I'm a and also you get a lot of them out of TV Time radio time in the newspaper time mhm everyone would have the same you know ...\nI wanted to say it was back in the seventies or eighties I forget now do you remember when they first started that dollar from\nYour income tax or you could donate a dollar or two I said wow what a great idea this is going to be here I'll give everyone a fear\nShake you know regardless of who you are ah as far as uh seeking political office and but it never worked out the way it was supposed to I mean I don't either I I Do they still do that I you know I don't need any attention to be on his was in the ...\nThe problem with that that uh the whole thing is I understood it was that if you accept the money then you had to accept that a lot a lot of money and then you couldn't take any more money from any which helps icy and as a consequence when you go on a national level senators congressmen presidents\nAre they generally don't take the money from there because that limits how much money you have ... and now it's your opponent decide they're not going to go that way and they can raise\nSay a billion dollars ... now now you're a big disadvantage you\nKnow what I mean you know and I understand yeah and the way if you look at the last presidential election Hillary Hillary Clinton or raised over a billion and a half dollars\nUm saw as Donald Trump had accepted the money from the government he would've been hamstrung he would've had maybe a couple of hundred maybe a hundred million or two hundred million the most ...\nBut he didn't take any money from anybody so that Matty only use his own mount right Reggie they want to be beholden to any body or any special interest group ...\nSo this is the problem a problem with our government right now Congress or state governments it's the best government that money can buy you know whatever lobbying group or whatever special interest group comes in with the biggest bags the money they're the ones you usually get their way in our government\nHas a ...\nAnd we wound up people don't have a lobby\nSo we don't have bags I'm ready to go up there to convince a politicians to go one way or the other ... and especially think about this lottery I'll leave you with this thought as your state if your a I'm a U.S wrapped gave us representative not a sign of your time is only two years\nAs long as you get elected you have to start raising money immediately and that's true that's true\nThat's true and and so you know they're they're constantly calls towering to the\nMulti millionaires billionaires and the big corporations and that's why we scratch your head and say why is that our government serving the people why is that our government going do the right way and that by the way is Democrats or Republicans one party is no better than any other\nAbout accepting money some special interest all lobbyists\nWell said well listen I Want to thank you for the call is always\nYeah Larry take care of a wonderful evening and make sure everybody get out there first of all being informed voter and

welcome to the job of real estate show I Am Joe and I'm your host\nEvery Tuesday evening right here on W. N. R. I. Thirteen eighty on AM dial\nNinety nine point nine FM or Ninety five point one FM and we are here for you're listening pleasure to discuss real estate for you the consumer all aspects of real estate buying real estate selling real estate ah\nRenting real estate and we have a special guest tonight I'm this is the height of the political season and um I invited the two mayoral candidates onto our show and onto my show and I'm\nThe mayor she responded so she is going to be our guest this evening or by the end in petition was extended to her opponent and um we haven't heard back so\nThat's why he's not here just so that everyone knows and um I Would like to\nWelcome mayor least above Eli hunt hello mayor hello how are you this evening doing very well very well thank you for coming onto the Joe liquor real estate show absolutely and I'm you\nKnow I Am very happy to see everything that's been going on in the city for the past several years I mean from a real estate perspective as a realtor you know we always have to we we you know we sell the inventory that we have and the opportunities that we have\nAnd you know sometimes it gets tougher and other times it gets easier and it's been getting easier um\nAnd by that I mean it requires less selling of the city of houses in when sock it to get people interested in them because there's a lot of value there\nWe've actually been hearing that too so it's it's exciting news\nAnd it is it's a combination of things and maybe you can tell me what you think also as a realtor yet but I Know what we hear and what we're hearing from people who are buying homes people who are actually will is looking to sell homes and so it'll be interesting for us to compare some notes\nRight um yeah so it's because there are different aspects of you know the real estate market too I mean you have rental the have landlords who are renting an apartment and then you have residential single family homes and then you also have commercial real estate and mixed use real estate right you know and one of the things that\nAs you know as a realtor\nThat I did something I'm very concerned about is private property rights and the national association of realtors we have the realtor party which basically the purpose of that it's a nonpartisan\nOf realtors that supports candidates or elected officials who support private property ownership rights and you know we have those kind of like a litmus test of questions and issues you know or that we ask people who come before us to get a\nGet support and I know one of the things that I've seen here in the city when sock it is you know there are a lot of things that are done that\nJust you know little things that increase and improve the perception and interviews ivy property values long they're\nLike you know and a lot of those things come from a the chief executive office because you know you you leave from the top and you set a tone for you or whoever the mayor is at any given time and I think you've done an admirable job of that um you know I Know the last time I uh we I had spoken to you we were\nReceiving phone calls and they were you know there were street sweeping going on and then I think you know\nReceived and phone calls and they were you know there was streets we've been going on and I think you know that is significant to homeowners because you know your kids are out riding bicycles are playing and they could get getting the sand and must have mixed neighborhoods not look as attractive when it's all the sand and rubbish and the threat er and that that happened to the end of the winter you know\nIt's interesting that you say that someone sent me a picture about a week ago and I don't even know what the topic was but it was actually a\nIt was somebody walking down the street and they were on mental road right and they did not send it to me because of the sand in the street they sent it to me because of\nBusinesses pay taxes and that helps keep the tax rate lower ...\nOn the residential side so I think that you know you've got a good job um of getting businesses to locate here I mean not far from the station here we have ocean state job a lot of ... where you know Walmart building you know interact to supply\nRight yeah which is fun right that store yeah um but yes you're right so back in two thousand Fifteen\nOur commercials tax tax rate was forty dollars\nExcuse me forty dollars and Seventy cents right it was reduced in two thousand sixteen reducing two thousand Seventeen and reduced in two thousand Eighteen so ultimately it went from forty dollars and Seventy cents down to thirty six dollars and Nineteen sense right\nAnd uh as far as a commercial property and you mention\nA and and you know you have a good handle on this so ocean state job lot was located in woman he'll plaza and sometimes you'll hear people say well you know that's really not a big deal they went from one plaza to another plaza where it is a huge huge deal yet when you have someone who is leasing space mhm and they did\nThey decide that they're not just going to\nIncrease the square footage that they have they're actually going to invest their great put roots down here and they're going to buy a building and then not only by a building that's big enough for them they're buying one of the biggest buildings in the city of when socket right and they purchased as as you know the vacant Walmart building\nAnd that they can Walmart building now ocean state job law actually has ownership\nThey're rooted here that means they're committed to hear from you know every time you have someone like an ocean state job ... others who are renting space you always have to wonder you know are they going to stay are they going to renew their leaf right you know will they move over the line from\nBut bill buying a building and staying here and then taking that\nAcquisition in a very short period of time getting tractor supply company to commit right to a good portion of the remaining square footage that's a brand new franchise to our city so\nThat's also and the thing is who I just wanted to point out in the ocean state job ... is a is what's known as a regional player okay there in New England if you go to other parts of the country they don't know who ocean state job motives but tractor supply that's a national company\nAnd why that's significant folks for from a a real estate perspective is because when you have a national\nCompany they're typically a credit what's referred to as the credits tenant that means their credit is so good when they signed a lease or ten or Twenty years you can literally take that to the bank\nWhen you're on that property you could say hey I've got this credit tenant who's going to at least the space to me but we need to build out can you give me the money to build up this space and the bank will say oh sure that's your tenant\nWill do that right you know and my friend Dan finer who's watching on Facebook Live another commercial real estate guy knows that all too well as a as well um so it's important to get not\nOnly the people to come by the businesses relocating within the city you know because all too often when businesses relocate it may be out of the city they don't do relocate down the road or half a mile and then expand space and death by purchasing the property that's\nVery significant because they were not scared away right by any of the book the man that people talk about when the when thinking about when soccer mhm you know and I think that you know\nWe need to continue we Rhode islanders\nKnow not just one socket folks to trumpet our assets and talk about the good things that we have\nSo we visited um the chamber of commerce and a tractor supply a coordinated a ribbon cutting on\nSaturday okay yeah\nI'm I'm always interested in seeing like the license plates that are in the parking lot yeah and I think there were as many Massachusetts license plate\nIn that parking lot as there were Rhode Island and that's a great thing that the rest of that means we have people coming the obviously the you know those plazas are right on the Massachusetts border yes and they're coming into our state and spending money like so oftentimes\nBeing on the border we are also we would cross the line and go into Massachusetts to to shop right and you know that happens with with me on occasion to because of the fact that and we've been working and we're getting a little closer um we my goal is I Want another supermarket\nIn radio when socket I price right is wonderful and nice to have them there I appreciate that\nSo I get a price right is wonderful and nice to have them there I appreciate that they're here right um they just upgraded there sign which tells me they're not going anywhere but at the end of the day we need another option\nFor supermarket uh uh we have the space mhm uh we have vacant land we have us uh stay such as fears or the ... the\nThe plant fitness area that was at the ones occupies a because of course they expanded so we have room will find a place for them\nAnd I've been in some conversations and that's one of the things I hear quite often and I know who ever opens a supermarket here will be tremendously successful\nSo it's a it it's you know I've gotten very close on a couple of occasions and then when they call they always you know call it the senior eyes he eyes takes a look at that final write a presentation to them I guess um they had a bit of a change of hot ... like you said a commercial rate is going down\nRight um I streets are getting paid and public safety\nIs another ... for people coming into the community and we are consistently improved our police and fire departments or you know in addition to their fleet they're meant everything on to say you know what this is a good place to come\nYet I think that the leadership and the police and the fire department as exemplary they've really done a good job of turning things you know putting it on the right path things there and from what I can tell obviously I'm not a member of the police or fire department but everybody is a respect leadership\nRight and I think that's significant\n... and you know it's important um\nI think a ... another thing that I hear quite often and I know that um I think of I always try to put myself in a situation and say you know if I Lived here or if I went here or if I did read you know what what would my feeling be on my thought space and from from the time I got elected a blight\nIn the community was something it was Twenty years of accumulation already light and nothing in place to try to to combat that\nSo we have demolished approximately twenty six property but what has happened is and I and I like the story that um was told to me\nBy someone I just recently one of a ... a actually it happen twice but one property that was demolished that the city purchase price and the the person said the house that was demolished was so close in proximity to the uh budding house that\nWhen the house came down it they were they they they said something to the effect like\nI have not seen sunshine in my window and goodness I never had the sun shine through my windows right because of course the house that was demolished was like three and fear away from the air's right so ... and when you drive by this is a house on black swan street and you now see that\nHouse and you say what a totally different perspective for these people and something like that adds\nValue to the properties and due to the whole neighborhood\nYou know I'm so it it it is significant folks you are listening to the job of real estate show we are here with our special guest mayor Lisa bowl deli and mainly ... excuse me and I want to thank our sponsors for the show John ... at first homework itchy is our lender of choice for the job with real estate show\nAnd if you're going to buy a home at some point you're going to need to move your belongings and we recommend gentry moving and storage they have clean trucks clean quilts and movers who take care of your belongings as if they were their own

have green home solutions that will take care of the inside of your home remove any smells or cleanliness issues that you have with all natural materials so there's nothing caustic or new harsh chemicals that they use\nThank you very much to our sponsors and it's about twenty nine minutes past the hour\nAnd as I said we're already hearing W. an hour and a harder when socket with the mayor when socket talking about a lot of the things that impact\nValues of homes are talking about commercial real estate and the city of one sock it obviously has lots of commercial real estate they have some that valued highly like where the new\nOcean state job locked building but then there are other properties that maybe not valued so highly in their current condition with their current use if it is being used at all\nBut what I see there is I see opportunity\nFor an entrepreneur I see opportunity for someone to come in and\nDo something with those buildings to add value and then also in the process make some money for themselves because that's why businesses exist to make money um you know we have a lot of old mill buildings in the city of one socket some of which can be an have been converted to residential\nA residential housing but there are a lot of other types of uses mixed use properties that can be very green quote unquote um utilizing different forms of uh of of an issue so you're you know not petroleum based products but maybe using a combination of wind or solar um\nWhere you place that plant that manufacturing company or or or move your business to um it's a huge savings so there'll be looking at communities are like when socket and put socket and other urban who have these zones yeah so we're we're excited\nThat the amount of something it it's very significant and it's something to be excited about because you know when you're a municipality or state\nIt's a competition so you're trying to get people to come in and invest money in either develop a neighborhood or you know a plot or put a building up and have their business there or have multiple businesses they're like you know retail plaza or mixed use plaza [noise] you know if\nYou're a national investor\nYou can go anywhere so you might be looking at\nOne socket you might be looking at some place in South Carolina Indiana Wisconsin that's what they look at it so it's not so much that they're sick well when soccer compared to North Providence compared to ... corporate ... your ... they're looking at a national level and if you have something like\nThese opportunities owns that makes a big difference and really increases the attractiveness of a location because\nThat money goes right to the bottom line of the corporation that doesn't go to the government it goes right to their bottom line over to publicly traded company that's always good you know one of the things that when socket has regret decent population density good highway access to get access to other\nMunicipalities Boston Worcester Providence et cetera that these are things that make when socket attractive\nAnd you know the mayor of being an ambitious and going out and getting these designations I mean if you can't sit back on your laurels and and and not do anything unexpected these opportunities to come to you\nOkay this is the type of opportunity you go out and you hustle and you seek out and that's that's when you get recognized and where when socket citizens and north impulse northern Rhode Island are fortunate that the mayor when socket has done this\nYou know every time when I call the mayor when sockets office I send any I get an email back I get a phone call back responsiveness that's significant and it's not just at the mayor's office\nIt's also other departments within the city which is different than other municipalities in Massachusetts in Rhode\nYou know getting a return phone call you know I'm working with I have a listing over a monument square or to a\nCommercial property to release across from the stadium and there's a program that the city has where you can get grants to redo the facade to update the facade of a building and that you know these folks that's what they're doing so it's another feature to market and of course that you have the magnitude of the stadium\nRight there that's bringing people and well if you have a business that can tap into that it makes sense to locate right across the street and there are a lot of little shops over there that we're going to get some folks into\nA you know for the next several months and then if you can get a business it can also tap into the school next door you know to be can school I mean that's yet so you know there are a lot of things here and everything works in concentric circles you know I'm\nSo it's you know you do start small like that right over there near the stadium and build things up and down towards when I'm In St\nFight and talking about main street so\nI think you can visualize if you are looking at our downtown area um you know the ends of our main street up they they have activity and building up that that center yeah I always say it's like a dumbbell to have weights on the end it gets a little thin in the middle\nBut we have a lot of things that are either currently under way more will be um we'll be moving forward shortly right and I can see it of course I live it every day this is this is what I Do twenty four sat right I\nI Want to point does someone just trying to Facebook Live that didn't win socket ... office is one of the most responsive and the state\nYou know what that's great to hear we do we have a very good she's very talented or we have a a lot of talented people who work within city hall and I'll ... very dedicated and they see the changes they see the the momentum and they see the progress and when you are part of that\nAnd people are recognizing that you're doing a good job and makes them feel good right so I'm speaking about main street so so like you were mentioning we have the stadium theater we have become charter school we have restaurants um we have you know the Y. M. C. A. is that one\nAnd so all of that is happening and that's the other end you know you have the good old yields English fish in the ... River Falls him of working culture um and back to the other side we have the veterans museum so all of this is happening and you I can feel\nI can feel all of that movement and all that good ah that's underway and now we have another segment of the bike like ... broke ground and that will be coming right up into our main street areas underway now the construction is happening so\nThese things are taking place and it's almost like that puzzle where you just keep putting down other piece and you start to see that picture come together and eventually you get that critical mass right and we have\nAnd as you may know um the the the I call it signed sealed and delivered a two cells main street so the form of vintage restaurant\nIs vacant for a few years and\nAh it's been bought 'em it's closed it's done freedom they sold it to\nA to a Mr Koppel is mhm and he's working with another Greek man who was a chef in Boston oh he wrote a chef and grief\nAnd he will be in charge of the restaurant or a so they've closed now they're in the process of beginning the renovations to it you know their goal is to open in the first half\nOf two thousand Nineteen so they'll take the next five or six months to pull the whole restaurant together or their plan is to is to serve some Italian dishes some Greek dishes\nAnd then sprinkling some seafood okay so when you think about the fact that the form of vintage ... are we call it sweet basil right now I'm ... they're not certain if they're naming it sweet basil men still up in the air but once that restaurant is filled and open and thriving think about that\nEnergy that comes with that with the bike path will literally travel right\nIn between Vince ... we'll call it ... and one main street and their horses over the main street and ... and lands right in front of the old English fish and chips yeah so you see the bite\nWay is under way that I ran out and run and be a conduit of bringing people in from outside the athletes\nAre and they they you know if they're going to take their family on a bike ride they say you know what let's try this new segment and oh by the way we can\nGo to the museum of working culture we can uh stop at vintage a sweet ... River Falls yield English New York lunch what have you can go look at the waterfalls ... ah we're currently working to try to bring the riverboat explorer back\nTo the market square area because that's you know tourism that brings people also it's currently moved to cold spring park here in addition to that we have a lot of uh\nAnd part yeah in addition to that we have a lot of uh a lot of other activity in that\nI'm more quiet zone of main street right um it's underway it's nothing that we can like disclosure time we always got to get the green light from the from the either the broker or the owner or other business owner but I think what is truly monumental ... is\nThe rail yeah and you read my boss and surface rail he has been working on this for approximately well he met with me about four years ago and he is\nAs determined as they come from a he actually had a briefing last week the up and\nBrought everybody up to date because when you have a when it's quiet and you don't actually see activity people think oh what what happened with the project right not happening it's not moving forward that is such a huge undertaking ... I mean just to put a a\nTrain on a track yeah never mind everything else that goes into it yeah so he you know gave us the breakdown of everything that's happened where he is where he thinks will be he'll be at a certain time he went through the trains that will be running the cost of it\nBut think about the fact of having rail right on your main street\nYeah it is fairly high monuments are it is exactly I mean it's very significant and then also you know when you you do have these vacant properties crisscross the pharaoh and we had I working together and he you know\nPop ups you know these these little restaurant I mean restaurants are retailers they want to try something you know that's a great way and it's you know thinking outside the box that's what a lot of the folks\nWho work for the city do they work hard they think hard right which is significant\n... and you have that you know there are times you just have to try something that you've never done before and I always say I find it interesting when people travel and go on vacation whether they're just go traveling in New England travelling out west down south whatever is they'll go somewhere for that\nParticular attraction more activity and they think it's great right there on vacation tables and chairs or on the sidewalk ... on the sidewalk music is playing or whatever the case may be\nBut sometimes you get into a community in that community is not accustomed to really breaking through enjoying things\nThat you've never done before and you have to do that yeah you have to try if you do not try you do not know if you will succeed and you have no idea where it will take it right so it it's very important to try the the ... and and obviously think it through the responsible but if it looks as though it can be successful it's worth a chance right", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Woonsocket", "day": "23"}
