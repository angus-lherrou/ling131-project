everybody and welcome to another edition of here for you the monthly radio program on several doing All right where we talk about a hearing issues today we'll be talking about the subject of a\nHearing in the brain cognitive processing\nAnd aging and I hope that or you'll enjoy our discussion today because of there's a lot of information that will be coming your way with Dr Richard but boy and she is a specialist in the field of all the ... and a little bit about her she earned her clinical doctorate in audio allergy\nFrom the school of audio allergy at the Pennsylvania College of optometry back in two thousand and five she has a master's in science an audiologist and a bachelor of science and communicative ... orders and earned from the University of Rhode Island and today\nShe is the owner operator unlicensed audiologist at here for you earring in Balad center\nAnd you'll find that a lot operation that the professional office in the tone of Lincoln we're at six Blackstone belly place we three seven or centrally located a\nFrom a from the Providence theory and all that we have these two FM signals Ninety nine point nine and a also\nNinety five point one I was listening to put it in a little shameless plug ear\nBut I was listening a down in Warwick the other day to the radio station downtown Providence a on our FM frequency a booming in\nSo far out our province of listeners um again that's just a few minutes away from Providence and of course just a few minutes away from the when socket area to ... you know the Lincoln malaria anyway Dr boy and his brothers and good morning to you\nThat morning Roger so nice to be here\nNice to have you here and I hope you having a pleasant summer so let's begin with the topic a call cognitive processing hearing the ... brain um what does this all mean Noah with somebody says that to you or what what are you going to answer back so\nWe we\nHave our all of our senses are sites our sense of touch our sense of smell are hearing our taste all of these devices help your brain to decide what's going on in your world around you and ah\nThere's quite a bit of information out there about cognitive processing and the aging brain now and talking about mild cognitive decline and more serious issues like dementia or Alzheimer's um other cognitive ah\nConcerns um\nStrokes and I'm\nA hopefully not a cancer our brain tumors but\nUm our brain is an Oregon and it took quite remarkable Oregon and um I always refer to it as the great and powerful ... and uh it it pretty much control of your body and your safety\nAnd your wellbeing so with the auditory system your ears collect the sound from the environment and they work really as a conversion system the air converts found pressure energy into electrical energy and it does it end frequency specific\nManners so each frequency travels along along its own strand of the auditory nerve and I usually describe it like a twister licorice if you on on twist it to his lawyer liquor as they are all these different ropes the auditory nerve is similar uh and each little rope carries its own frequency\nThat information travels from the air into the brain and then each section of your brain does something different with the information as that process is through so if you can imagine a a relay race you run your portion of the race and then you pass the baton to someone else while is neurons they\nThey send the information to the very base of the brain and um\nFor example the very base of the brain determines how far away the sound is and what direction is coming from the information is processed and carried up to the next section of the brain again like that little relay race and uh and there we talked about timing differences so bits of music or separations and syllables or\nWords or send pieces and\nUsually joke and say in the northeast you know we talk and book chapters so I'm a sell those different spaces and and um any intent I think behind it\nIn the third section of the brain that for your auditory memory live and that's where the collecting information from the lower compartments is put together and the brain creates an image or decides what the sound is so if I'm walking down the road and I hear a dog barking or\nWould you remind us is an email a doctor boy in about a cognitive disorders through isolation\nMy mother in a nursing home staged a two hour or so and in listening to the radio program I've got the feeling of isolation could a push this problem further on down the road says isolationism\nSo isolation we think that a lot was on elderly people with sharing last they can't hear they miss here they get embarrassed and so what they normally do history tractor pull themselves away from social engagement is also invited fears that can you know Ken ah\nAh I shouldn't say anxiety fierce I should say anxiety issues that can cause people to pull away from public ah\nInteraction but it leads to depression and um\nIt's it's a huge problem is in the elderly population and so we want to do things to keep people included and if you read books about longevity and in villages of you know people living regularly\nTo a hundred and five a hundred and ten years old and you read and study about those villages and how they do things their elderly are included in every part of their lives so they keep their elderly at home and they help to prepare meals and care for the children and they're active and involved in so isolation is a big problem\nShow after a discussion are discussing this um we have mentioned uh you know exercise and so forth but this is a problem over cognitive disorders in the brain is treatable jokes or somewhat treatable\nSo again in the terms of of hearing the way that we treated as to get hearing aids and and keep the sound of the flow of information going into the brain so that those neurons do not fail or it's not reversible\nFor wants to the disease process happens or the failure happens we can't we can't fix that so it's kind of like a here's another analogy that I use regularly when you are you drive your car and I'm dating myself here uh\nSo forgive me but um you're driving your car and you have a cog in your fuel line and you're you keep driving your car and the and the engine is not getting the fuel than it needs to do its job the you're depriving the engine of a proper flow of fuel and you keep driving the car like that and the engine is going to break down\nIf you take the car to the garage and get the um the fuel line fixed or change the filter and the fuel line it's not going to solve the problem in the engine to think about your ears as a few in line for the brain and you're if you're hearing loss you're basically driving your car with a cog fuel line in the engine isn't getting what it means All right\nSo sociability and um and certainly um\nExercise uh is um you know just a a natural thing that everybody should be a be watching whether the says I'm you know whether you're young or old this is all part of the above the hearing process up because I Would venture to then every program a\nBut here's another aspect of it is an email from a listener\nAnd she wants to know she said this is not your company she said but I'm offered a twenty dollar gift card to Dunkin Donuts if I go in for a hearing assessment no I Would imagine that I'm a ... I guess this is a\nCompany that does during assessments you know an audiologist company and you're not here to knock the your competitors but I just wanted to find out whether in fact ah when people receive these mailers now this is me speaking of whether um whether that's something that ah they should be watching out for the subway\nSo I Will tell you that all of us are\nPhysicians I'm I'm a doctor of ideology I'm hearing instruments specialists that place like Dell tone on miracle ear I'm audiologist private ideology clinics we all have to do marketing so we all have to advertise our skills and\nThe way that we sometimes bring people in his by offering some kind of little gadget or\nYou know ten dollar gift card to get a cup of coffee or whatever so it's just something that we do for marketing purposes or it doesn't mean that the facility is low rent or not qualified to just means that that's the marketing technique that they are choosing um and ah\nAll of us do it around\nAnd finally or another of what's really\nInteresting part of like a kid I I have occasional does he does and I wanted to know whether that could be a hearing problem I remember from the earlier program that you mentioned dizziness show or what does that is\nSo that the stimulus system in the auditory system are connected and they are located in the same um um\nPlace in your anatomy so um there are hearing there are diseases that can cause dizziness and sharing lost something like ... but dizziness doesn't cause hearing loss typically I'm intermittent dizziness and more often\nI'm intermittent dizziness and more often we we more often find it related to blood pressure to take medication\nUm lack of exercise um those types of things on a than I'm hearing issues if you're dizziness is for example if you have many years disease when you get dizziness\nThe dizziness is disabling it's it's in most cases crawling on your hands and knees to the bathroom disabling it's severe dizziness you really don't get out of bed for a few days and it passes and so it comes and goes and we usually see it worse in the spring and the fall\nI'm more of the spring and the fall but we we do see the symptoms rise up\nUm during that time and it has to do with the ... or the\nThe liquid in your ears and\nOn something called high drops but that is not intermittent dizziness that is um that is you know profound dizziness there's also something called benign proximity proximity position vertigo which has to do with um sort of a spinning dizziness for example I roll over in bed and all of a sudden I got really really busy uh\nFor about sixty seconds or less\nThat's benign proximate oppositional vertical not something that can be corrected with a physical therapy maneuver or if you're experiencing that type of business you can give the off the call and I can recommend there is um to really sharp physical therapist and I'm aware of in the state that are very good with resolving not issue\nA one in Johnston and one in North Smithfield I'm and I'm happy to give you the actually Dr Dan mark hot in North Smithfield and I'm a doctor or an pappas and Johnston\nUm both very very good at resolving that issue but most often we see that dizziness when we tease it out into the history Roger we find that it's really more related to a\nBlood pressure changes for example from standing or sitting sitting too long standing up in a while I'm a little bit dizzy but there are other things that can give you the feeling are sensation not really business but light headed mess so it's something you should mention to your primary care doctor\nAs Rick closed out the program today I Want to mention that the one of our listeners dropped off to the radio station and um I don't know if you get a A R P A magazine but uh she said um\nWould you give us the doctor boy and I said I Will but ... says and this is maybe for future program loosen up hearing loss America's silent in rowing epidemic it should be a a magazine from may but says ah sixty percent\nOf people in the seventies so for hearing loss forty five percent of people in the sixties suffer hearing loss twenty nine percent of people in their fifties suffer during lunch\nDo you agree it's America's pilot and growing epidemic is the article or your future a reference but I'm a was that I'm a a a headline that you would say well it's certainly a problem I don't know if it's an epidemic\nSo we've known about the problem uh you know epidemic of sensationalism I guess but you know epidemic makes me think of the plague or something really horrific and hearing loss was not fun that's for sure for sure but hearing loss is not a life or death concern it's the quality of life concern\nAnd I did read this article and may is better speech and hearing month so often times they'll do some kind of a pop headline like that and it's great because it brings awareness awareness and educate people to go out and get your hearing tested\nYou know get a baseline and and I love telling people it's the best part of my day when I get to tell somebody who has normal hearing and ah so but get you're hearing tested and\nAnd then find out and learn and educate\nWhat your options are and decide what to do what's right for you\nIf you'd like to speak to a doctor boy in and she her in person or you have to do is call for office said four\nSeven five six one one ... and then once you call and make the appointment you drive out to six blocks dome deli pleased with real seven in Lincoln Rhode Island and meet Dr boy and have the testing and look consultation and get yourself a Jew or a better place\nWith your hearing thank you for joining us on our program and we'll see you next time around as they say\nAbsolutely it was great to be here Roger thank you\nDr ...\nW ran out right when the socket\nAnd then they complain\nYeah all that they certainly do yes well I vote\nReady for a while you're ready for that she a lecture\nYes what do you think's gonna happen no well any predictions or maybe one or have you decided how you're going to vote or\nDon't you know and I I'll tell you asked that I made my list I Know I'm going to vote for\n... not going to vote for okay but\nBut you're not going to let us know until after the\nWhile Larry I ask you a couple of weeks ago you said you got in a way\nI Am I\nI ask you a couple of weeks ago you said you gotta wait\nYeah I Am I I don't want to I Want to stay neutral out here to be neutral on the air\nYeah All right but we can't ... know Shasta\nAll right [laughter]\nI Know of all along not going to vote for I listened to the city council all every I never missed a city council ... hey by the way I saw ... feeling a little free shot at\n[laughter] when I went before the council\nWhen you add the district's about what is it in a prominent journal\nIf well all the crimes figures yeah that's it that's ... yeah I I and you know what's interesting is as important as I thought that was a I haven't heard much discussion on the part of the candidates out no and I wish they would discuss it to be honest with you but we\nDon't you think that kind of quiet\nWell uh I think they're very quiet matter of fact ... how many people running for city council is it clear team I don't even know how many there'd be a while I think it's Thirteen\nTwelve ... you might be right it seems like well the only somewhere around there\nAround that's why we didn't have a primary\n... do you know who's running because I don't I Can't I have that information written somewhere and I can't put my finger on it anymore and the other day I was trying to figure out who's running and I couldn't even come up with all the names ... there are some we've heard absolutely nothing from\nWell I Know of course Chris ... and running and militia not right that's\nCorrect yes all the other side rather not run\nYes but how else is running while they're at\nKing I didn't hear nothing about in\nI've seen a couple of signs around the city I have\nAbsolutely no idea who he is or what he stands\nBy David soon as she\nOkay well Dave sushi I Know personally I I Know him so I Know a little bit about him a so that was one that I had on my list who else is there that um how about a ... a is Mr don't run\nRajan Gillette but are you hearing saying\nNo I haven't heard a word from him I mean we know him from the past but I don't know what if he has any new ideas up his sleeve or a lot\nOf our and Larry is I Know for all you don't like Mr ...\nWell no no I'm not that it's just that when he was on that council I think he had a solution for this and that but I don't know well\nWell you know it's sort of like the two mayoral candidates I'm you know right now I'm Still anxious to hear\nMore from both I Want to know what their plans the next two years is actually and I you know I I've heard you know for example I heard ... are you know he's been making himself ... and his commercials and then he ears on fill a British show on Friday nights and\nBasically he wants to open government you know and he wants to people to know what's going on in the middle of the counseling on what's going on yeah not nearly as secretive is the mayor seems to be in his opinion\nUh but I'd like to know more than that too from him and I want to know what the mayor\nWhat uh what are her plans for the next two years as if more the same and if it is well be specific ya yeah anything you're going to do differently but I I don't know there's been very very little set of substance in this campaign so far\nWe're about treating all week\nThat's about it that that is about it about it and I can't even you know going back to the city council forget the school committee I mean I don't even know or the ... I mean we've heard from a couple of them but yeah very little there as well\nI think as Paul Jay ... ... ... yeah yeah and I think Eli NATO's tell huh\nThat's true yeah shows that's true she's running as well\nAs well I made up my mind was not tell you right now [laughter] you\nAnd I laughed at Cal State and a lot but I think a couple I guess that day on the French on the city council mhm\nI tell you that before yeah yeah you think some of the ones who are on the council now run on the fence as far as getting reelected\nWhile I'm now\nI ... I think ... I don't know\nHow you miss the fact that fan no okay well I was wasting time saying that [laughter] I'll tell\nYou I never voted for him to threats dying okay so I won't vote for him I tell you another level for him to seven times\nWhat is it about him but you don't like\nI just don't like it just the way he come to strike I don't know I I Can't really ... what I watch on the city council that I Want to turn it off because the way talk shot I don't know\nThe way he ... he presented\nWith you know like he knows everything the watchdog the taxpayer and you know [noise] it it\nDoes it it's not something that you can support\nWell not really ... in my opinion\nThat's what this program is all about\nI mean not that I don't like the way he presents himself and\nGetting back to the city council for a second yeah you're going to have to help me with the owner [laughter] All right I'm I I I'm putting my list together because I lost my other list I don't know where I put\nIt right you have missed the gender and writer John Brennan right we have missed the ... right ... yeah I'm ... yeah we have um\n[noise] let's see Mr sue see Mr warned Mr Keyes Mr\nJillette so that's right and let's see there's one two three and a woman named Larry say I've got a few missing I've only got nine here that's it\nWell yeah there's a couple of others to help me help me [laughter] oh that's\nAnother one ... number one was in a\nRow K yeah he was on my list I'm Mr ward he was on the council or a good number of years I like\nIt is very intelligent\nAnd he's a you know he was one that has kept himself a\n... you know he calls the talk shows periodically he gives us his opinion on many many topics so it's not like he's\nDisappeared you know like you have the candidates who reappear every two years and in the meantime they go to sleep you know you don't hear anything from them in all of a sudden ... campaign time so oh yeah I'm going to get involved again yeah I like people who stay involved\nI well I like John what I always liked him ... Larry so that Thomas ...\nOkay Keith ... is on my list\nTo as long as I forgot her name I I really don't remember you know\nThe eye and that's what I mean they ... some of the candidates have been so so silent that we don't even know who they are and you know some of the someone mentioned the other day well I think it might have been my lovely wife who\nPays attention because she she you know she she likes to know what people stand for before she goes to the polls she says she says I haven't read anything in the newspapers about who these people are and what it is that they stand for arms day you know and that's the other thing uh I\nSo that they stand for arms day you know and that's the other thing uh I don't know if the candidates have been sending anything into the newspapers but there's been nothing in the newspaper I ...\nI think it's been very quiet\nAnd left we're going to get it all in the next three weeks\nYeah that that's what I that's probably what buck up or you show up and vote for oil ... are right [laughter]\nWell I only had one for I hang up and go at it you know my cash haven't you don't like cats haven't you write\nAll us on a regular basis and\nYou get your check at Greek restaurant\nAnd they were working in there this week I again I see them working in there periodically what's happening well I don't know the last I heard was about uh maybe three four weeks ago\nI had heard that they were supposed to be opening around right now someone said oh it's going to be they should be open in about three weeks there was that parking issue you remember the ... talking you know and we go in ... I mean whether or not when sock it can have people talking on the streets are not so that that was a an\nIssue but supposedly\nOn the owner of that restaurant work something out with Mr Bush era who owns the building next door and that's the last I heard that something had been worked out they straightened out All right uh so I I I don't know uh but you know I I I\nDon't know if there's something else that they're working on the other a mystery is um the older sibling location that say oh yeah that's I I've seen I mean they spent money\nResurfacing they put it in a parking lot I mean I was a big expense yeah uh I've noticed wherever they seem to be changing some of the windows but that's an ever a slow process to wherever I guess we're always in a hurry but these guys have to probably do what they can do when they can afford to do it and I\n... no no okay\nVoting actually if I could vote and was there of the people that are on a council it would be annoying because he's controversial but he's very smart and he knows what he's talking about\nJohn Brennan brings and another great aptitude and that she's a lawyer and he can even a criticize a town or when he's off his points so he's an asset\nA general as old as an asset easily was done well like house all the years he's been there are any tries to control fattening and the mayor and which is not easy ...\nAnd um let me see you you're not having two of them aren't even going back to re election\nThat's correct yes Sierra I don't know he um is that um\nI don't know for an informative but she really is and it's got doesn't contribute much mhm a size oh I can say about her and I think that's the ones that are that I Know I don't know any of their new people\nYou know it's interesting because you live in Cumberland why is it that you're interested in when socket politics because if I were to reverse the table\nI have zero interest sad to say about what goes on and Cumberland [laughter] I really have no interest in what goes on in nearby ... it seems like I I have a hard enough time trying to figure out what's going on and win socket I\nCan't try to figure out what's going on in neighboring communities\nI don't know ... when I noticed that connection you know [laughter] when sock\nIt represents to me what's happening in this country was cities um you know\nIt's more I don't know it is more interesting to me and I've been on when I was in North Carolina I was on the planning of a word I was on land use committee um it was very active\nWhen were you doing in the Carolinas when was I yeah when did you live there for awhile\nBy six years okay and then we my wife my grand kids moved up there with their parents which is my daughter and her husband ... and it was very hard to keep her down there so after six years of you know coming up here and everything it was getting to\nWe're missing much right now you're originally from this area\nOriginally was born in New York grow up in Long Island ended up in Connecticut or most of my adult hug and\nNorth Carolina and now I'm back up here\nWell that's interesting so you moved around quite a bit [laughter]\nAnd military as you did\nUh-huh well yeah that that experience to take me to to Florida once but in your case it seems like you moved ... [laughter]\nWell you know ... ... what happened is a lot of it was a local moving I mean it's not that far away mhm\nWestchester County from\nYou know um where I ended up in near Hartford which a lot and that's actually a three hour drive but in Westchester County I Lived a couple of different places there and that's the way it does yeah\nYeah yeah you know has Rhode Island to see I'm a I'm a typical Rhode Island to my wife was talking about going to war with this weekend and I said oh my goodness we're going all the way to ... [laughter]\nI'm the same way I'm like I got\nDown to a province I Will find somebody else\n[laughter] I don't like the city [laughter] I don't even have restaurant\nHere to go to or you know drop here but locally you know as we get older driving doesn't seem to be quite as exciting or much fun and you\nKnow I I have to agree with you there I I totally agree with you there one I remember as a\nWhen I was younger I used to enjoy and when we were younger we takes and just get in a car and take off and we didn't even know where we were going to go but we always went somewhere but now with any excuse I have to stay home rather stay home\nThat's what I Do I mean we used to one time a three of us is that drive from right outside of Hartford to Myrtle Beach ... hours\nAnd you imagine a you wouldn't want to do that today [laughter] and plus the traffic to that I mean there there were times why I I don't know maybe it's just a ... as we get older and everything seems to change in our minds of cost but\nAh I I don't remember all the traffic or that we have to put up with a today I mean you know it it's I I just don't find\nDriving around is is a pleasure it's anything but a pleasure\nI agree and the only last thing I'll leave you with is uh I'm I'm surprised that the Democrats can lie so bluntly about things and nobody corrects them I mean\nUh if you listen to a Trump and all his rallies there is going to be no exclusion for prior medical problem\nI Know and there's not gonna he's gonna he's the one that's going to preserve Medicare because the uh Democrats want to use every put everybody on it in ... states and therefore the people that paid for the privilege and the right to be on it there will be taken away from them mhm\nNo but I never gets out\nWell unfortunately much of what we hear is so lopsided and uh as much as I don't like to pay extra to subscribe to a newspaper I you know I give the wall Street Journal\nAnd ... in ... I find them to to provide the most balance of any kind of ... all the printed media that I have checked out including you know various Web sites I find that the wall Street Journal is the most balance\nBut I read things in that newspaper that I don't see anywhere else I had been focusing on all the trade deals that the president is working out\nBetween Mexico Canada and now in his that seems to be in place and now working with with the Chinese government and and we know nobody in the past ... talked about the imbalance about what trade\nAnd I mean it was not a topic that but I never heard a Democrat bring up that topic [laughter] you know\nWhat white Trump is such a good president because he doesn't care aide as far as his personal wealth mhm care less right ... ... it's a bully personality but it's a needed personality when you deal with\nPoliticians to use the smiling and then going behind your back he won't let that happen you don't crush him because if you cross some\nCable not is not timely to it yeah yeah yeah and he's got a four to to to make things happen\nAnd yet we have to say half the nation despises him so [laughter] you know\n[laughter] that it's it's a it's an interesting time but we live in as a corrupt personality oh yeah\nYeah and so on are so different from anything we have ever seen I mean in my lifetime or you know I can think back all the way to eyes and how it's it's about as far back as I can go and um yeah uh I I've never seen anything like it and I don't think most of us have ever seen anything like this because there's never been\nI I've never seen anything like it and I don't think most of us have ever seen anything like\nThis because it's never been anything like that [laughter]\nLike if he really had the support of Congress\nOh my gosh what could be accomplished\nIn really have supportive there I think last time I thought it was three hundred appointments and they have gone through yet ... as a Democrat so he's got the state department under man it got so many places are under man and even in that situation\nHe's still doing what he's doing mhm mhm said doesn't have much sleep yeah yeah yeah I knew him and his rallies and weighs Seventy two years old yeah God he's\nGot a lot of a lot of energy yeah an awful lot of energy\nYeah so I I I Am very happy I voted for him when I first heard him a contradict McCain I was very upset being of is like you I'm a veteran mhm\nAnd um I have really turned me off and then I start to hear more and more about him and I said this guy talking about change yeah and we need change and it's because this country and\nThat's what I was looking for and that's what we got and I'm happy with it [laughter]\nToo and we have a radical groups and I think if Congress was supportive of him he would get some of that straight now to where people can run around in the street with math science or you can identify him\nRight right which is really very dangerous that high agree with you there but All right I'll let other callers takeover because it was good talking with\nThe same here today as it always is and I thank you for the call okay by now\nBy now right interesting call indeed I like David as well get a lot of good call was on this program and we thank you for being part of the program because the people who call of the people who make the program\nWithout a doubt nobody wants to listen to my big mouth for three and a half hours that's for sure seven six six Thirteen eighty that's our number as we talk with you we have a message from Mr presided if you have a painting project or if you're looking for someone to do some painting\nSome vanishing some standing called ... and son general painting we've been in the business for over thirty five years [noise]\nUm where family owned in family operated got a great reputation\nUm again we have loads of satisfied customers\nWell I don't I don't hear about him I I Can't I and they were just so many things I can stay up nights worrying about and I are at\nWar and being informed about that's about the warring\nWell it might be important but I think most people it is an important it's not as important as all the issues facing people every day how are they going to pay their rent how are they going to pay for their health insurance how are they going to hold onto their homes after they retire\nThose are issues that they think are of great importance to a lot of people ah who ... I Can't concentrate on what's going on on the other side of the world\nBut I don't think it's either or you could be I mean your brain that\nWhen my brain is limited I Know your brain is bigger than my brain oh no you can you can handle more topics that I can but I'm limited ones\nI met one brain that your brain on a woman one brain can can sustain a great deal of knowledge and we don't have to be worried about it because it's out of our hands but we shouldn't be informed about it let me ask you a question of how many how much money do you think some of the yes\nYour average one soccer president gets or Social Security [noise]\nOh I'm sure is very little [laughter] and that's why everybody lives in a high rise of economic ...\nUm ... the average I don't know probably a little over a thousand dollars\nOver a thousand or ... percent as a hundred\nAnd one percent would be ten dollars ... so put twenty dollars for well willing to care about the fate of\nSnow but I think you know that I think that one that forty twenty ... twenty thirty forty\nDollars a month on average or whatever it is I think they said forty dollars on average yeah will mean more to more people then what is going on in Turkey or Saudi Arabia\nAnd that's why the country's going Alan had bad you know I think uh well we have people in Washington who\nCan handle those issues you see I mean\nAnd that's why we elected people to take care of all these things\nSo they shut in stuck I yeah I Know that's what they said we'll start guard yeah no help straighten it out I'll straighten it out\nYou don't want to give the guy credit for anything he's done nothing I mean I Know how yeah how about the trade agreements that he's worked out and the fact that company foreign companies are going to be investing in America to avoid some of these towers\nYeah yeah\nThey haven't heard about ... I might not be in the publication ... was that in your dad was in my Wall Street journal you better believe I\nActually did its way Larry what exactly did it say\nThese the uh I think it was ...\nThese the uh I think it was the city's\nUh is going to be opening up a big part of plants I forget exactly where but again they because a lot right now the a formula has been rearranged as to the percentage of vehicles made in this country\nAh that will be exempt from Paris I forget the numbers like eighty percent in other words eighty percent of a vehicle has to be American Made including everything that goes into it\nIn order to avoid these new tariffs that have been put in place\nSo you've got um companies like Mercedes and BMW and the others who have been importing their parts from all over the world to save a buck here on a ... a buck they're\nNow they're ... ... examining that and they're going to be opening up more plants in America to manufacture parts for their vehicles they already have plants here manufacturing vehicles but in order to avoid some of these terrorists they're going to have to do that which is going to create more jobs in America\nYou don't believe okay let's say I'm challenging\nWhat you're supposed to know everything you telling me I happen to know what's going on in Turkey Saudi Arabia I Know what's going on in\nAnd you got to read the wall Street Journal and find out this thing\nI'd say that at all is whether or not I I read a welder believe everything you read very\nOdd no no but I I that's why I read the wall Street Journal because of the only newspaper that has a balance other than that everything you read us from the Washington Post the calls for the Washington Post the Providence Journal is Ninety nine percent Washington Post\nThose are all propaganda machines and the water is always can throws the minds of most Americans\nDon't watch Fox News right no I don't see I don't know [laughter]\nOh no no no why\nWhy I just don't know why would I Want to listen to the beach right there if I rather rather and if I if I was gonna watch anybody's news I probably watch Fox News but I don't watch them on a regular basis\nYou should try to see now I don't have time for the BBC good [laughter] I'm a busy guy\nOh I Know I Know you are [laughter] I Love your Larry Hi you have a good when my friend by by going to run as a matter of\nAlright but by now [laughter]\nBarry goes Dave King knows how to rattle cases it's All right well rabble it back\nMaybe you have a comment seven six six Thirteen eighty that's our number on a Saturday morning and we are here to talk with you\nDo you need a hair cut today my friends well if it isn't today and there'll be sooner or later God willing right Julie they hit ... and a ... style is is the place to go there are thirty one man who wrote it hamlet crossing\nThey've been there for fifty years talk about an institution my goodness and the same building same place for fifty is not too many people can say that Don ... lawyer senior started it all at thirty one man will road at him look crossing over fifty years ago\nNow he has his family working with him as this is family owned family operated they're all ... six bombers on duty and uh you take your pick\nThe weights not very long with six barbers on duty\nWhere open today until noon time on Saturday is we open at seven thirty and we're open until noon time Tuesday and Wednesday eight o'clock until for Thursday and friday eight o'clock until five so if you're new to the area\nOr if you're Bob or has retired or you don't like the barber you have if you're looking for something new\nGo on to Don's bobber stylists\nThirty one man will road at hamlet crossing and you may tells them that Larry's sent you how's that I Would appreciate it very much\nAlso on a Saturday morning we have a message from Ed curry all the crew investment group and let me tell you what's going on there the courage to investment group offers personal management of investment accounts and depending on what you're looking for they can create an manage a portfolio\nThat provides you with current income\nGrowth for the future or their primary focus which is managing retirement money from client rollovers of their four O. one K. plan after they leave the workforce well whatever your goals are\nThe ... investment group can put together a program to assist you in preserving and growing your assets and don't forget ed could rule\nHas been in the business of investing in managing client money since Nineteen eighty seven that's thirty one years that he has been helping people just like you with their investments so called adult Paul at four O. one seven six five eight eight eight zero\nSecurities er up through both in global capital member fen ... and ...

minute limit we don't have it anymore\nWell that's too bad because that gentleman\nOver the gentleman from Cumberland was really interesting but the next guy a and I I kept trying so I'm going to limit my my comments because it's very annoying I think I've been waiting maybe forty minutes all told number one [noise]\nI'm Glad that I and you know why what tracks all the time I'm Glad for\nAccess [laughter] doesn't carry the entire rally I mean [noise]\nJust adds I really don't think they should cover\nTwelve hours a day hurricane coverage I mean you can you can show pots of the Trump rally you can show pots of the hurricane coverage\nBut that's not my idea of interesting television so I I'm One of those people will probably has turned off I mean I'll watch Fifteen minutes of Trump but I'm not there\nYou know what I mean I I've been enough is enough I mean I don't want to\nWatch uh two hours of a rally I Want to watch the programs that I enjoy the five cow send us some time Sean Hannity certainly I'm On Sundays the next revolution so for them to\nCut out all of the programming to cover non stop\nHurricane coverage nonstop Trump rallies it's a very poor programming so I'm Glad that they're doing it it doesn't necessarily mean\nThat Trump is not popular because that's just an onset quicker and he does that all the time he he takes one thing and makes it means something else and it doesn't follow that's what ... means in Latin name doesn't follow me and I was really glad\nThat you said that there are issues that are more important\nTo every day people it just listen\nJournalists we'll how dangerous their wives are certainly if you're a journalist covering Saudi Arabia hello\nFind a new job God Bless you [laughter] I didn't want to get\nSaudi Arabia has been an ally through the years Democrats and Republicans doesn't mean that that it has been a good policy but but it it has been\nThe policy you know this is just so he reminds me of one Williams Juan Williams can never say one positive thing ever ever\nNot about millennia Trump I mean about nothing ... and it it's so unfair because I actually gave me shallow bomber shadow because she came out against Eric Holder\nSaying when you go when they go low we kick 'em I mean imagine imagine saying that now he's saying I didn't mean of course he meant it that way he he's not saying that we should kick them physically but there are people who will who will agree with that so\nI'm going to get her off I'm going to practice what I preach I'm not going to take up more than five minutes of your time because sometimes it's very annoying if you're holding on but the guy from Cumberland was a very interesting because you could tell by his accent\nThat he didn't come from an air right Larry good for you for saying well maybe my brain isn't as big as us come on and you are right we elect people to take care of things for us and shame on them if they don't but we can't follow everything Larry\nI Know I Can't [laughter] story is they cut\nYou up and took him out pieces no that's not nice but it was he complaining when they were heading Christians when ISIS was heading Christians what was this guy\nComplaining I and I don't know I'm just saying that that is unacceptable any of it is unacceptable Larry it doesn't matter\nWhether you're a Trump supporter run not a Trump supporter or you know to be cutting people's heads off\nHow did Trump supporter or you know to be cutting people's heads off is meaningful torture\nCome on and this is two thousand eighty well it certainly is

I'll just share with very lucky\nWe have a bumper crop a very good qualified candidates local state and federal level\nAnd um you know you try to support them they can't support everybody but you can't do that with your vote mhm so um yeah I'm a big supporter of ah a number of the candidates especially judge Robert Flanders\nUm Tuesday my husband and I we went down to ... to his headquarters to watch a debate between him and I missed the White House mhm and your first caller up the de la ... she was she spotted that he was nervous and you know you can't help it\nThe first time you're in a live studio you know it you're not I'm\nUsed to that where White House has been in for what twelve years so uh last night on a news Ken conference\nUh channel ten at seven thirty there was another debate at Flanders really came across strong so uh that didn't they will be replayed\nOn channel tens news conference Sunday Morning at eleven thirty\nSo for those who watched the debate last week on Tuesday they can watch this debate and they can see that a friend just came across much stronger now so I'm you know he is such a fine gentleman\nAnd he's brilliant and I think he would be a great a leader\nAs supporter for Rhode Island so and that's why I Am supporting them\nAnd um [noise]\n[noise] yeah the point I wanted to make a they got in your first call that that you know she wasn't too hot on Roger Gillette Mm ma she was speaking more personally you know if you look at Roger July history of supporting the tax payers sibling socket yeah\nThat would that goes a lot further you know he may not be her cup of tea but you know if you look at how\nWe supported people in one ... you know I'm going to give him my vote\nAnd does is just so many of good candidates even on the scope come in and he was really surprised to see when ... discuss ... uh she she is a lawyer and she's been a professional for years very smartly\nSo you know um I did happen here\nOr is it Michael very on\nJust show yesterday yeah who is running against Roger pick out I was like wow yeah I I said what a great candidate\nSpoke well noses issues you know it's just that a lot of people don't know them and it's like you said earlier you know you don't know a lot of these candidates\nUnless they have somebody call they can't call for themselves\nWell you know what they do I and I've invited candidates if they have something to say and they can keep it brief\nThey can send us an email and I'll read it here I mean I'll do that for them because uh yeah uh you know I I think we need to know a ... something about them what is it that they stand for especially anybody who's not ...\nI have no great involvement in the community I mean there are certain people you know like we haven't heard much of anything from Dave Susie but everybody why would the everybody knows the Sioux City but he's business he's involved in many organizations I've known him a long long time ah so I I Know who he is and I know what he stands for\nBut there are others names that are not even familiar to me um those are the folks that uh I have to get some information out there\nThat trend that set up that Larry All right thank thank you Steve [laughter]\nAnyway driver you have a great Saturday morning okay All right I'll tell you what they think you have a great Saturday morning do I know he's laughing in the

he's been anointed by God I Love you know halfway religious guy credit believe there's a certain amount of truth to that\nBecause it's just like anybody that went against Trump and I'm Talking like that's a a\nJudge in Hawaii now they have all that seems like there's a punishment common even that little red hen restaurant they still haven't recuperated physical against Trump there's a higher power to the bottom punish me\nI think you're getting more and more evidence backfiring one hundred percent of anything anybody does against Trump backfires real\nInteresting observation that's for

houses open for dinner seven days a week and the prices are reasonable\nNice restaurant we're talking about the roast house farm street in nearby Blackstone, Massachusetts\nGood morning Iran WN All right\nGood morning today I'm calling because I've been really troubled about something I've been wanting to call and and every time I go to call it you're not on the air anymore and I've just too busy [noise]\nUm [noise] the reason I'm One of the reasons I'm calling is why does the city so much want to sell a a field and the Irish field I mean are they still want to sell Barry field I have not been reading the paper because I don't get I get a second hand\nSo are they still want to sell about Barry feel\nWell there are some people who liked the idea of at least looking into it including myself I think the city should explore all possibilities of selling Barry field there are some who say well maybe we can't because of the deed but um I I don't know I I say we should at least look into it\nWhen sock it is very we have very little land very little open space to sell any body and uh you know Barry field is is a great location for somebody would be looking to build something and that would bring in tax dollars maybe even create a few jobs for the city\nSo that's why I liked the idea they aren't field has is in the process of being sold the last I heard there were two different parties who are interested in purchasing it\nAgain it's a parcel of open space yeah I mean we have some we have a lot of parks and win socket for city our size we have I think we have to I I hate to even say this but I Believe we have too much ... space in one socket we've got so much we can't even take care of what we have\nYeah let me go to the park for example look how huge it is going to cold spring popped huge park we can't even take care of those parks\nAnd then there's that park that's a down by um well right next to W. now right at the one that goes beyond the houses\nThat are totally abandoned totally understand and\nI don't know why they have a bill that one that that was I've never been in it I mean I I've seen it but it's kind of like it at dinner at center and\nI don't know very strange place it's cold water state I think it's part of the old water state matter of fact everything in there as had been destroyed by vandals or there's there was nothing left there was completely destroyed by vandals and it became a hang out for ... ... people were camping out in there\nOh yeah when I was on sixty four and when I was a [noise]\nWhen I was a young teenager I used to cut through there I used to go beyond with my short cut to go to my grandmother's house and she lives on ... street so I used to cut\nFrom um [noise] what avenue is you know yeah it was from what avenue to um [noise]\nI ... well anyways it would be to get from point a to point B I get behind the the which are called the restaurant rate cut across\nAnd I get to a certain point and then I run like heck I'll Wait till I got to the other side you know [laughter] 'cause my ... says I don't go there you know they they men they gonna catch you and all this stuff before it used to use a short cut all the time\nBut then after she said that it kind of scared me yeah you know\nAnd then and age I don't think too many people would be using it as a shortcut there's really\nNo no I wasn't it wasn't a and I look around and I never thought anybody and I never had a problem uh-huh they used to be my shut the matinees house yeah so and I and\nThat's another big parcel it's owned by the city and uh I don't know what the plans off on that open space or whether or not in the city would be interested in selling it and whether anybody be interested in buying it was a write off diamond he'll wrote in the street across the street from us here there is is that open space\nYeah see my my only thing is and and then as that corner up by now the blue and bond road\nUm and the dirty politics yeah the Dems up biting their nose to spite their faces and you know and like I said there's a lot of people when Trump got voted in as a lot of people that I Know\nI'm ... that have been praying for Donald Trump to really um rise up and be able to do good things and um you know sometimes I don't understand\nWhy the other side judge several ... he's he's finding all these people that do these riots\nAnd ah that's ridiculous and people like you know the shooting that they had at the park that was so inappropriate there are some people that are not well out there and they're going to take to this um rhetoric\nAnd they're going to go out and they're gonna do bad things and the rhetoric should not be they shouldn't be doing open lies about things people should just be\nJust be doing good for the people doing their job\nUh but you know it is they get into politics\nAnd then they have connections and they meet people and then next thing you know the people they end up being pretty wealthy and I do not um how should I say they go in for they come out wealthy because they've got all these connections and all these\nAre often times that is the case that right well let's turn now\nTrump came in came in wealthy and he knows what goes on behind the scenes and and I think I to me myself I think he's doing a great job\nAll righty really do All right well let's see if anybody else as a comment All right take care of ... a year to buying oh by the\nRiver Falls restaurant knows where they agreed snakes they agreed seafood and they're great pasta and don't forget they're

one I was talking about the election and with that I heard a comment like no I'm the man about Palin mhm says she doesn't have a quote now I always thought it was pretty classic guy\nI dropped out of terrible shot to pick a person that's what I thought this guy was I mean I always thought on one with a funny guy and I said you know I hear him and his calls I still do that with the wheelchair shot to wanted to say I looked at what she does have a quote I mean\nI think if he reflects on that comment he realized that was a really bad thing to say about another person I really I'm very disappointed in him\nMy gosh they wasn't impressed by her presentation so I don't know I didn't hear I have\nA clue and and the thing is if he's not impressed by a presentation that you have to go on a radio on Alaska so everybody else get asked that he wasn't impacted by the gate that if you didn't have a quote the thing is that one of the support for football belly aren't quite as simple that's why she would attack this that\nAnd it was wrong and I'm surprised 'cause on the dog because normally it can be very light hearted ... ever having to do that today at disappointed me it really that\nUh and another thing we're talking about uh if it from my wife I told my wife I make the Scottish for her because she really a phone call for it though I I Am\nBut you're talking about what they were trying to find out what that invited to operate right and uh and shakes out of a soft you being a failure political risk if he'd rather on it if you can't advocate for some kind of the parade how's he going to advocate for the city and was socket\nThat's all I mean\nShe's just back I think I told her I I I'd type ... on that one but you know it's a it's a good point you know if you if you tell them if you can't get into parade it can't advocate to get it for me I got an out of a lead guide banned from him and he's a male candidate but that's another story altogether\nBut I just want to I Want to give him a pale in a shout out I really do notice that well but I'll tell you that for somebody to say a comment like that about that you have a clue I heard on the air and I I mean on the man that that's that's a bad after private him because he's a class\nAct okay I Want to leave it at that All right well thank you\nI did have a class act okay I Want to leave it at that\nAll right well thank you for the call by not\nBuying up well whether it be missed pale and or anybody else uh I think they all have their work to do if they're looking to get elected they've got to make themselves known\nAnd um you know take advantage of any opportunity to do that like walking the streets knocking on doors I've again I've I've mentioned are the candidates if they have something to say\nTo explain to us why we should be voting for them they can send us an e mails try to keep it short and but I Will read them on the air I can assure you I mean not saying that you'll get a ... and get elected as a result of that but at least some people will get an opportunity to know what you're all about okay\nSo far we've had two candidates out of all the candidates who have taken advantage of that [laughter] that's it yes uh this person says Larry I'm very impressed to hear that President Trump said buses to Florida to evacuate people in the path of the hurricane\nAnd my Seventy nine years I don't believe a president has ever done that before\nSay what you will about him but he's certainly seems to care about all Americans\nI think he does to to be honest with you maybe you have a comment there uh\nThis person says I was once a deplorable Trump it now I Am a Trump or tour very well said [laughter] that's interesting cute to a nice little a cartoon that go along with it\nThey're maybe you have a comment let's see I Want to make sure I've got all the emails read\nOr this person's says Larry in all fairness el brand delivers his message every Friday on WNPR riot six will with fill the brick and also with his radio spots on W. on our rights yeah he's getting the message out there I I think he is I think he is\nNow I don't think uh you know al ... I don't think anybody is saying that al brand has not getting the word out\nThere\nBut boy there's some other candidates that for one reason or another and not All right that being said um we have a question for you from Vern Rainville Britain Rainville wants to know if a tree fell on your home your garage or your shed while it's probably covered by insurance\nAnd did you know that you have two years to file a claim\nI Would suggest to contact the local adjuster that represents you not the insurance company I'm Talking about Vern Rainville\nHe has your best interests not the insurance companies interest and he will assess losses whether they're larger they're small and if you're not sure if you have a claim guess what burn will go out and advise and you take no out of pocket money no money up front\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n... fun it'd be a runner ... burn I'm trying to stretch in ... and I am lucky that I ...\nOr cut that out of a day and she actually has sort of an changed ...
