like Russia Russia Russia Russia was it seems every single minute if something uncommon but what kind of campaign when the Democrats put up if Kavanaugh wasn't the nominee in other words if where now and it could happen and I'm looking at\nAmy Coney Barrett or John Larson or Thomas Hardiman or any of the others that Trump had on his short list after all\nThey did the pile on with cabin on now is whether or not he threw ice in a bar I mean it just goes on and on and on and I for one thought that is what happened when you don't say okay time out we are done that is that no more time it's over

I'm ... years are pretty much salt water so how do we know there was a really cherish well\nWhat do you mean sanitation what if you just had it in a bottle never open the bottle like a fine line or that's never opened her a bottle of\n... that's never opened a what is she what she's doing is drawing attention to her in spite of some of the people magazine reports and other reporting oh she's drawing attention to mental health issues like depression and we have to try it out I think it's a gimmick um\nBut if she wants to make money at it and be as big as her sister and her father a or what's wrong with that I mean I think it's a goofy but I also think it's a creative publicity stunt\nBut I'd like to know how you enough curious George Bush so you think about the actual monitor you\nWell you got a broken heart that she does she would just cry or wait until she's got a bottle full of twelve thousand dollars or\nOr or you're just ... cents of water and\n[noise]\nUm one thing she that Mike is that you should not drink so in terms of corals issue we're about hygiene and what sanitary she did give us more warning do not drink my cheers\nSo I think the first person to buy it is\nGoing to drink or tears [laughter] that that that\nI were were living in an insane world and I can't wait for the next thing to come out I mean\nHere's the next thing she's going to cut her wrist and people are going to drink or black\n[laughter]\nBut and make money on it Merrick\nAnd away so uh I guess as you said you can't uh each successive she successful at it but it it's crazy and there were a lot of crazy people out there that go for it like a narrow said with Mitt\nRomney yeah with a pet rocker whoa what are the troll dolls I had a zillion of them I remember the troll dolls I thought they were fantastic and they were on my desk and little ones the big ones and whatever but they did it's rather creative and I\nThink she's piggy backing off of her dad's eighty breaking heart a hit don't you Carl isn't there an aging breaking hard somewhere in there\nOh we're absolutely or just the idea of doing it was just hilarious frankly be or be ideal but you can go you so we're most the salt water for thousands of dollars have added\nMike what is your new and creative idea to make money on the Internet\nWell it seems like the creative thing is set up a go fund me account\nAnd uh that that seems to be the easiest thing to do today and a lot of people are doing and uh that seems to be nice and simple and and go for a I'd probably can't get any more esoteric than that that seems to be the easiest way\nYou know the Gulf on me Carl is an interesting phenomenon because a lot of people can click but when it comes right down to it or they actually sending checks\nSo for example back to our previous segment about cabinet there's this go on me for Dr Ford right and she's supposed to be it ... it is is supposed to do and and made already over half a million dollars but it's a question of how many people are really got to pay into it don't you think\nOr no because ... will credit card payments so that money to spare our our ... go fraud me because our big about half the campaigns are just total BS\nAnd the rest of the place and there's a place on there isn't it I I could be mistaken then there's a place on there where it's just that commitment sort of like if I go out and get a sponsor to run a marathon and then I run the marathon it was just a commitment a dad got when the marathon maybe before the sponsor will say All right here's your check\nHere but I think these campaigns are actually you know for the most part cherish and look what happened with the ... guy out in ... New Jersey where all this morning was raised and then the people that sponsored it and we're controlling or the structural we ... we still ...\nWell you could be right on that I don't do those kinds of things um because now you're getting your credit card over the Internet for something that is you know who's who knows who's behind the go find me\nBack to this though I Do think we all do we all agree that this was kind of a creative thing to do especially since her father had the big headache you break your heart and all that and she's trying to find a career or on in the shadow of Miley Cyrus dirt sure\nSure you know whatever makes money as long as ... and well what I don't like is that this is a big attention grabber for mental health issues like depression when it's a teenage heartbreak and or maybe I think she's in her twenties now um and it's just a cool way not to make cash\nPower to her I guess I saw some of the videos the song isn't very good but I find it pretty ... or the publicity\nWay to clothing line is doing well to some\nOn singing America reason first come first\nThe largest banks in the U.S the martyrs health insurance companies and the U.S and the three credit girls when you in addition to Equifax Experian ... gym in those three industry groups collect more\nConfidential information than any other business sector\nAnd those three industry groups banking interns and credit bureaus have more financial and IT resources than any other industry group and all three industry groups including the top ten in banking health insurance\nHave all been breached the three credit bureaus have all been breached by the way not just once or twice but multiple times a big contributor is what we call the insider threat you can have all the I.

presidential run here in America Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts and of course Bernie Sanders from Vermont there may be others a while they don't go so far\nAs as suggests the elimination of private property ownership as in real socialism they are pretty close to it warning Sanders both argue that there is a dramatic and unfair\nInequality in America and that we should tax tax tax the wealthy and corporations at a higher rate to redistribute that money to the rest of the society might take it away on that your thought\nWell you know it's interesting because when I was back in college they best thinking at that time was that communism and capitalism would meet at socialism\nAnd I never quite understood that I never understood can sort of get there and now I'm beginning to see that I'm seeing how that could happen would appeals to different people\nAnd when you mix some politics in there that is a pretty bad when you see people uh you know like the fellow that's running Venezuela\nAnd uh some of the things they're doing it yeah I don't see socialism ever survive\nWhen you say you learn that in college maybe it was just academic rhetoric for the lecture\nIt could be I
