I I think now if we could end up having more people come forward regarding or people that have had incidences\nWith um [noise] he talked him in the eyes and so shallow than slapped him at the first time hearing this so now there's more that is coming out so now we're going to have maybe ... people coming forward with stories\nThat are somehow they have been either assaulted in some way\nOr been in some kind of an altercation with Joe ... I don't know so it is a never ending but I think it is interesting folks um what this is going to come down to a couple of things to one the polls continue to show a huge discrepancy where Joe ... who is in this race for governor\nIn you know does that affect your vote I did post that on Facebook by the way my Facebook page somebody just check some of the comments regarding I did posts\nSome of the comments\nRegarding I did post would this affect your vote the fact that it has come out the trailer was apparently thirty four years old and beat up good afternoon by the way every band on Facebook Live a ... a poke veteran now apparently it would seem that way\nUm Flanders is a man that's right uh yeah I'm not a fan of I'm not a fan of Senator Whitehouse I think we could do better folks but let me uh let's see drill a part of the state many does not mentioned\nThat he was arrested he just put that it did happen and then I posted a\nWould this affect your vote the fact that true low was thirty four\nAnd was arrested for assault of a teenager [noise] um let's say he seems like a little off writes Bob uh David writes touched by kids and you're going to be walking with a permanent hobble she's smiling up this\nI'm David says follow some pride drop out you know the state needs to change both of you said over and over again fungus the only one has a chance to be Gina Edward ... made a pact with the Jane a devil and we're going to pay for it\nI'm not a you know had enough Republican which happens to me to speak to this right you are not Eunice right you're not going to when you're splitting the boat and making ...

Ryans appliance repair\nAm I dialed him up at four O. one seven ten\nAnd you're there on stage and and it's it's not easy\nAnd someone like White House it's very skilled I thought Sheldon Whitehouse Senator Whitehouse I thought it I found him very smug last night and what I Want you to understand if oh say can you can call in seven six six Thirteen eight if you have a thought on ...\nOn the governor's race or if you saw the debate last night I just don't see what would we have to lose wherever you are listening right now\nIt's one forty two in the afternoon\nWhat what would we have to lose we have Senator Reid in Washington what would we lose\nBy having a Republican representing Rhode Island and I always did it's always on best\nWhen we've had a Republican in the Senate and we've had a Democrat in the Senate both parties are represented what do we gaining I having four Democrats in Washington ... ...\nRead at Sheldon Whitehouse read isn't going anywhere resented read is highly respected highly regarded with Senate Armed Services Committee what what would we lose\nBy having a Republican down there how about this\nHow does this sound to you that we have a Republican senator\nWho sitting down with Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell doesn't sound positive you how about in Massachusetts what would be the loose Elizabeth Warren wants to run for president she is running for president let it run for president good\nA letter run they're all going to run\nAnd they're all going to lose they all think all the Democrats they they're going to be Trump they're not going to be Trump no way he's going to be no way the guy's a winter he is doing everything delivering he said he would\nAnd the countries getting better what are we here last night from some of the White House he's against a wall I thought he should have been pushed about the border\nI think he should have been pushed about illegal immigration and I think he should have been questioned about driver's license his buddy was a Senator Whitehouse also last night\nWas not question about the fact that he's talking about once we get the gamble back that he wants to impeach justice cabinet off I think that would have been very fair Senator Whitehouse will not reveal who was the reporter\nThat he leaked the story to the fake story about Brett Kavanaugh it's much worse than I thought he initially said he just gave information\nTo this guy from Kevin in what much farther that he gave a big story\nTo reporter and then he congratulated themselves last night on the debate on channel twelve Sheldon Whitehouse saying well I should be commended that I did not that they didn't publish the story well it was a big story it was a made up story why would they be publishing it in the first place\nAnd the other thing that really folks\nReally when you think of how pulling it is\nSenator Whitehouse feels that the crock pot from Kevin in whom fate made up a fake story about judge Kavanaugh\nAnd had had\nThe pat him on the boat\nThat he feels that man deserves an apology Batman deserves an apology yeah\nJoke pillow will not apologize to judge Kavanaugh in his family he smeared judge Kavanaugh they made that stuff up that ... that woman she made up the second story about being a ... a cabin or expose themselves somebody Gail made up\nA published in the New Yorker all nonsense no one could backed up any of this stuff Christine Dr Ford upstairs downstairs how'd you get the party I don't know who is there I don't remember where it was about I don't know how'd you get home I don't know who drove you there I don't remember\nAll of it he Senator Whitehouse is right there with Feinstein he's right there with Cory Booker he's right there\nWith Blumenthal of Connecticut he's white there with a metal Harris he owes justice\nCabin on an apology but Sheldon Whitehouse just so jealous because Sheldon Whitehouse he fancy dumps out that he'd be on the Supreme Court that's what this Israeli about during the Obama years White House has flowed out\nAs maybe someday he'd be on the Supreme Court he is so jealous of Brett Kavanaugh that should have been brought out what does that mean when we get the gavel back where you go to a peach cabinet or should have been asked about it a Sheldon who was the reporter\nBut you gave that big story too terrible

like you've been in the sub marriage a long time and that are leaving this guy or the boss is out of the questions so you\nKnow how to minimize your aggravation and and you're trying to do that by prohibiting these people to come for the holidays but the fact that the thing that struck me about her\nIs that she didn't have children they didn't raise a family because she knew she'd raise them alone so this guy has a history and\nA tradition of being lazy and letting her carry all the weight so she has resigned herself to a bad marriage below the question is how bad\nAre you going to let it

welcome to our program is a talk show\nOne says was up right here in one socket the go to play ...\nAbsolutely ... and nothing is is to be taken advantage of everything has to be earns because it it can change so fast\nAnd and maybe we can give it to another success story of a company that is morphing and become incredibly successful and we have a lot of pride in that the right here in with soccer Rhode Island which is CVS ...\nUm I Know I think you talked about it this week the U.S Justice Department had actually officially\nPulmonary approved the hum a CBS in ... now and now that that combination of companies is going to have the second\nLargest amount of sales in the United states just behind Wal Mart and there's somebody who's earning thirty five million dollars Larry ... running every dime of it by making these decisions to keep\nCBS one step of the competition which biological ... soon could be Amazon but you don't know where the next competitions coming from but to have that integration\nOr with ... and CBS and then obviously can mock a few years back um is a pretty incredible and those things are\nI hate being in my opinion CBS him from being the next ah stairs because obviously you could go and say okay Twenty years from now CBS is everywhere this eight thousand five hundred stores nothing's given you have to match what the people want\nSpeaking now CBS is involved in three major\nSemi related business first of all we know them as a pharmacy chain with a you know the uh with the pharmacy in the background but I'm now replacing a lot of the business um and or adding to it is a health\nCare management that was the second thing that they bought a while back with ... and ... and now they're getting into um now they're getting into competition with Blue Cross and up and United Health\nOr so a guy like a Brendan Murray who sells health care I'm\nAn insurance might be able to be offering a third product a Jewish customers as you sit down and say what supplemental health care plan would you like to buy I don't I I think that there is in that business up I Know they are because we're getting ready to run some radio ads for a at\nA very very shortly

him my I guess up the money to buy the others as um\nThat's the one that gave him my I guess the the money to buy the others as um the pharmacy business\nWow what a big company they are where are they located or one soccer an alley that almost ... quite in walking distance from here you know one one thing that always struck me when I when I study CVS\nIn the pharmacy industry and we've talked about this online and off line that only the only twenty four percent of all prescriptions are actually renewed\nSo the vast majority of them are one and done mhm so there's there's a lot of uncertainty and maybe it's the flu season if you go and read a Walgreens\nUm report quarterly conference call or or CBS\nCertain things are going to affect their bottom line if the flu season is very bad\nThat's going to have an effect but they're trying to maximize revenue for a square foot for sale and they're always looking for things so [noise] um it it is a lot of great leadership and we've talked about this we know people work at CBS it's a very demanding company\nThey demand excellence and um they they get it out of their employees as a matter of fact the revenue for employees twice as much as ... it's like seven hundred thousand dollars for\nFor employee I Believe and Walgreens is half that so it's a very very fishy company but um these moves you know getting tobacco off the off this off the

I Believe if people aspects of money to fight for the game can't feel old it don't have to worry about anything and if it take out a few follow one ... cash\nOne 'cause you need extra cash take I think I have three months and the interest rate\nBut you don't have to catch and have one\nSo that might be a\nGood idea to him in now I have I'm reading your age category I had the opposite philosophy you know I'm not as conservative about an investment as as you are because uh because of my age if I were younger maybe I Would be a little more conservative now I don't care [laughter] sorry\nGo ahead and sell it on that but I\nAlso bag no outrage my age I don't ... I Know you know if I Need a little extra money I Would cash in a small C and granted white out when he said the would\nActually I I Know what\nIt's all so [laughter] I couldn't even feel a little not I know Kavanaugh let's face it too bad and I don't know I'm going to take the lid on the way that they have to but they said\nIf you can't say that would have to say [noise] I I I Can't believe it would bring that up [noise]\nHey I'm finding is [laughter] is this is an international situation and I go\nThrough all of a short drive back in the White House um I don't know what that was\nThere there there was indications are about like a toga party and there was inappropriate um comment that he made that if you held him to the same standard as the judge Kavanaugh than ... than it falls in the same amount and it it just it it's just a\nA place you you just don't want to go I it just doesn't make any sense if people are talking all stuff and the kids stuff like that it's somehow that really affects how they're going to be or you\nKnow a ... a functioning adult especially when the judge Kavanaugh has been a well respected judge for ten years twelve years and it's ... and very few of his cases overturned in the Supreme Court has already used or a half dozen or more\nOf his opinion pieces as their basis for their opinions and just didn't make any sense you know and and it's interesting to not to spend a whole lot of time the White House but if if I'm Biden was right as a vice president Biden was there a few years ago\nI'm In a rally and he had said that Obama had considered White House the Supreme Court justice maybe he's frustrated maybe it's going to take it out in on everyone's that you didn't get that opportunity I don't know but I Try to keep an open mind\nI get my sources of news everywhere and there's no way I I I just surprised that\nSenator Clinton hold himself or more decorum so close to the election and I and I hope there's a pushback against land is in there\nWe're going to take another call they give you call and I\nAnd I do want to answer her question is is even off the air that you know I see these have have their place you know the more more money you need it may not give you the ratio that you need but certainly um it's an asset class that that makes a lot of sense for certain people and\nI'm just ... you know there's the brokers CDs as well so is he just don't want to get a you know a long term CD and then get stuck with it and I think she said that that's not what she does\nHere's another comment from another listener hello panel the morning on Saturday\nI have a sense that you're not going to make the case for White House wars though right [laughter]\nUm gosh they're question and I didn't want to give you a reason why they would vote for White House\nRight yes that was my quest yeah well\nYou're a senior scientist at the high rises a White House has given them any reason because he's stealing a page from Davis ... see a plan to being a Republican\nHe would still I ... it would reduce it it would take a Medicare away from you and that's the reason you see that some of the people\nIt from you and that's the reason you see some of the people are afraid and like a White House I wouldn't [laughter]\nYeah the fear that fear a politics of fear saying okay you know you work your whole life and we're going to take your Social Security way and and take your pensions away and have you know the death pianos and and then and all that stuff that's definitely the the the\nDemocratic play ball there's no question about it you're right there\nRight I mean I'm sure when it has a trademark on going back to China shame still work for him\nYeah I mean class warfare is is\nIt is something very popular with the Democrats in and my my knee jerk reactions go back to Terry Mari right here when socket Rhode Island and go back to Tom Ryan who who were both came from very low means and of course I'm not thrilled with the earth you know the building that stadium in Providence oh Pataki for their for their\nSoccer Red Sox and that was sending nuts but most of those guys made their own money and when you create a class warfare where somehow you have animosity towards people who are very very hot and got successful um that's one you know that's one thing sometimes who say oh jeez you know I'm\nYou know the President Trump inherited ... you know millions of dollars from his father you know if you want to go that route fine ... environments where hardworking people starting from scratch and making it and somehow you you\nYou know make those people out to be the enemy that that's a problem and the Democrats tend to do that except when they have their own issues where they go in and make a hundred Seventy five thousand dollars a year as a senator and then they leave a multi millionaire how does that happen\nGreat question anyway uh tactics of a White House all the tactics of society that scare tactics that turnout scam a run out of my vote\nYeah I I think common sense would tell if I could tell the thing is that historically you don't you don't know what the future is going to have been historically they've always\nMade where the the the younger retirees are going to be a burden like you know knock on effect me but my my my Social Security is collecting and sixty seven or as people live longer you know that maybe that's going to be sixty eight sixty nine but people collecting Social Security right now\nThe Republicans independents Democrats I I don't I don't see them going after I just don't and of course the easiest thing to do\nTo go get on my soapbox yet is ten and a half million people who make more than a uh make more than the limits of fake or which I think this year one hundred twenty thousand eight hundred and ... will sit here and say let's let's let's fact everyone up to half a million dollars that's what's most likely going to happen\nAnd and you're trying to put your finger on a diet against that that's where the there's a lot of money where you know you take a\nA somebody's making four or five million dollars well by January aid they're outta FICA that those people probably would have to pay some tax just like they did with Medicare over two hundred thousand dollars I think it's one point two percent so that's where it's going to happen\nBut I'm the Republicans in my opinion a democratic independence nobody is going after people who currently collect Social Security now that's that's my opinion\nIt's accurate fresh I agree\nI don't have a huge Oh thanks for the call I Do ... program on WN are right we have one more call here we're gonna hit before we go to a new a commercial break hello thank you for your call\nAre you

N. All right\nGood morning this is Brendan Murray host of health and wealth radio heard every Thursday morning on WWE and\nI thank you for listening in on this is a\nA wonderfully busy time of year but it's such an important time of year or so for anyone who is listening who is a repeat listener\nAnyone who is an existing client of health and wealth ink which is my company a and I am the president of health and well think anyone who is maybe listening for the first time ah\nThis is an opportunity to schedule an appointment to review your health care to review your health planning for two thousand Nineteen now of course we can\nI help people with the remaining months of two thousand Eighteen as well so\nThere's a little bit time before we switch over to the new year but then we're what we're doing now is we're looking at reviewing plans that are available for the upcoming year so we were always work on cycles and our business and uh the cycles\nKind of work like this ah\nThroughout throughout the year people are are retiring\nYou know aging into Medicare I'm switching jobs moving into the state for the first time from another state or moving out of state and so health care planning\nSomething that really happens year round people lose their job believe their job lose their work benefits um all kinds of triggers that can require a need to review so we're doing health care planning all year long\nBut what happens is uh you know around round summertime early summer we start to\nGet prepared for the fall because the fall is a big renewal time\nWhere especially for clients but not only but especially for those clients who are I'm On Medicare because in ... in many of the clients we work with are on Medicare original Medicare a and B or getting on Medicare for the first time and so we are a company that can help educate them about\nThe AIDS the bees the seat seize end the ... of Medicare and then help them with individual insurance plan choices that may be available to them in their area\nSo around summertime we start to\nGet certified in a plan for the upcoming season will get notices from a\nCertain companies that may be putting broods into Wal Marts or other retail locations around the country do we wanna you know where do we want to operate out if we want to work in retail or do we want to just um\nYou know serve existing clients how do we want to get new clients so so new agents that sometimes we'll start with maybe a retail booth that's how I started a not in this business but in\nThe insurance side I started nine years ago working in a booth in a Walmart on dime until road and you know people would come up to that booth and\nAnd learn about basically what plans were available and at that time it was one insurance carrier that I was representing us for that particular population for people who are on Medicare\nAnd you know some of those clients is still on that same plan and it's been working well all the way through but over time we were able to add other plans other insurance companies so that now\nThat you're listening if you're in one socket or Blackstone Valley or or even if you're a anywhere Rhode Island or you know if you're over the border Massachusetts um or indeed you can be listening perhaps\nYou know if you're over the border Massachusetts um or indeed you can be listening perhaps anywhere online um but certainly locally\nThroughout New England in specifically in Rhode Island where can we have access to all of the insurance carriers um that you're hearing about it on TV that you're\nGetting letters in the mail maybe you're you're being their advertising to come to a sales event of this insurance company to learn about their plans we are knowledgeable about those plans but we're also knowledgeable about the competitors plans so when you talk to health and well when you call me what happens is you're getting access to\nThe best thing is just not to wait you know if you've got a question picked up the phone\nI have\nOver a dozen agents in Rhode Island that contract through us and that I wrote helping families themselves so some of them have five hundred clients are more themselves so there were helping a lot of people are but the best thing is to have a go to to have someone and if you\nHaven't worked with us but you have a question about your plan or a statement a\nAnd maybe it's not healthcare related or maybe it's not\nA directly related to your health plan maybe you maybe you're concerned about long term care or maybe you're worried about hospital co pays maybe you're worried about what if what if I have to do chemotherapy um you may have concerns that go above and beyond\nWhat Medicare cover you might not know about skilled nursing what are the limitations where does Medicare pick up and where does it leave off when does the coverage stop and\nThese are very common concerns and important things to address the best way to address it is to pick up the phone to give us a call now scheduled time will come sit with you at your kitchen table or your place of preference and we'll have a conversation about what's important to you that\nIsn't going to be everything done in one day you know what we'll do is we'll tackle um one thing at a time most likely if it's a\nHealth care review we're just going to stick to health care but if you call and you say gee I'm retiring and I have four one K. I have for all three bees I Need to know I'm turning Seventy and a half when do I need to start taking required minimum distributions from IRAs\nAh my life insurance is blowing up on me I'm getting statements in the mail saying send in a check or it's going to lapse\nThere's questions in crisis is like that all throughout the year\nYou know I have to have a root canal is there any dental plan that can help\nAll of these questions I'm going to Europe is my insurance plan cover me while I'm there a\n... year round stuff and we can help you any day of the year with that\nBut what we tried to do is if it's Medicare specific\nThan we keep it specifically to Medicare insurance because of regulation for one thing you know when a person an age and should not be educating our teaching you are selling you any other product other than that health insurance plan while there with you um\nBut people have other concerns another question so we can always schedule will follow up time to talk about everything else so we keep\nThe insurance review the health insurance specific to that and by the way ... it's not only that it's regulated and those rules it's also that it's a lot to cover so you know for you to have a good honest review of a\nFormula race for the prescription drugs tears to duck doubles if there are any a hospital co pays out patient procedures to fully go through summary of benefits of a plan that you may be choosing that is that is a task that's probably going to take close to an hour some in some cases\nWill have appointments that go one to two hours or even I have agents will spend three hours with their clients we don't have a we don't have a a stop watch you know this is not like the ah\nHe used to take a cab ride and you know you get in the cabin that the stock the clock even before you went in the ... the the dollars would be on the clock you haven't even gone anywhere you say wow I mean\nWe haven't even Germany where and I already old money it's not like that you know when we sit down\nYou know put away your worries put away your concerns I mean don't put away your concerns 'cause you could ask questions but\nYou don't worry about that you put away your checkbook for sure you know we're just there to help you get informed and yes enrolled\nIn a solution that can put you in a better position so we're not just educators you know we're not ... we're not social workers were not working merely\nTo give you information where we can we go a step further than that we are licensed\nA for a reason we are certified by the carriers or appointed by the carriers for reasons so that we can actually enroll you and a plan\nSo you call me I'd come sit down we talk about your needs we talk about the landscape you ask questions I I I help you think about things maybe you didn't even sink to us\nYou ask questions I I I help you think about things maybe you didn't even sink to ask and then we find is a plan for you and then we enroll you on that plan\nI mean that's the beauty of it it's not like we educate you and then say now go on line or call this eight hundred number tomorrow and be on hold for an hour and a half to try to figure it out no we'll we'll we have the ability to actually enroll you in that plan\nSo give us a call eight eight eight four to nine four seven to seven you can call my office seven eight one five six nine four nine two six or you can book an appointment even by going to our website health wealth financial dot com it all starts with a conversation\nAnd then we will reach out to you so we do zero cold calling\nThat zero cold call and we never pick up the phone and call someone unsolicited\nAh so the only time we call is when someone\nAsks us to call now if someone's in existing client and we have something that we think might be important to share with them or then certainly we may pick up the phone and give you a call but we spend zero time in our business trying to find\nA clients in what we call the cold market you know now cold to me doesn't mean that we don't know you because there are people listening right now who you don't really know me I don't really know you but you know me from the radio and that may be a common bond that\nUm when we get together we find that pretty quickly that\nUm you like working with me and I can help you so\nYou know I'm not afraid of the cold market

the same prescription you get and\nThe pharmacist says okay and that that'll be and they put they name a price person puts in their card pays or takes out their cash pays moves on next person moves up\nPicks up their prescriptions same prescriptions as a guy or gal in front of them but the co pays different because they have a different insurance card man off they go they make their payment you step up there you get your prescriptions you pull out your insurance card\nAnd now you're got charged a different price for the script she said how can that be three of us and we all three of the same prescription all three of us are paying a different price that's because you all had different insurance plans and the importance of making sure that your insurance plan works the way you\nThink it will and the way you needed to is very critical so it's not like one size fits all you can't just say give me what he gave me what she has you know it's not like going to a restaurant where our\nI'm

doctors sometimes people use the same doctor sometimes they don't\n[noise] so if your friends are saying I get this plan you should go to this plan you know I I'm paying this amount that why don't why you do by paying all that money I get this plan\nIt's worth picking up a phone and calling me for sure so if you're having breakfast in someone saying I got this plan and it gives me this this this this and this absolutely call me you know you might be overpaying maybe you have a group plan from your your work\nAnd you've been on it since you retired as a group retiree plan and maybe you're paying a lot of money for it and maybe we can actually just save your money and give me a very similar coverage but it could also be\nUm things that you don't know about that person might be on a\nState assistance as well they might have Medicaid and Medicare and so when you have Medicaid and Medicare that can be a dual status dual too and there are plans designed specifically for that population that may offer different co pays different benefit different um\nDifferent network different choices are then the plan you may be and\nIt could be that the person is a retired teacher or a

sometimes say to me Brandon if if if I were you what would you do or what what would you do for your mom while everyone's different you know so that's a tough question because of the reason that everyone's different\nUm again how are you different you're different because you're on different prescriptions you see different providers some people listening they\nWhat can we do to make sure that that\nThat important thing that makes you tick is is is taking care of and it's not just taking care of by a financial product it's taking care of by a plan you know you could have you could have life

I Want to say good morning to everybody\nIs I'm not questioning when you go into the polls what I'm Talking about is it is very loose how someone can register to vote because they you know all this\nIn quote emergency voting and only going to be allowed which really is early voting\nThat is you don't even have to show an ID so what I when I in ... they are they are fixated on this whole business\nThat in order to go into the polls you have to show that form of id when I Am contending is whether it is to mail ballots whether it's to quote emergency boating\nOr just back at the primary in September\nI Believe the where eight to ten thousand people that did quote emergency boating they went to Providence city hall\nThe friday the Thursday the Monday before primary day they were able to job to a boat they did not have to show ID when I Am talking about is the registering to vote is completely unchecked\nIt's a multifaceted issue John you touched on spring yeah she was one that secretary of state's office how their registering voters technically minimal requirements and no requirements as your guest called then there's also the emergency ballot slash\nA mail ballot which are all wanna hurry afraid a ballot for the person's home ... witnesses versus signing\nIn that person that I have to show a photo ID by the way so you're correct seven thousand people a vote in Rhode Island Providence or wherever and their tests technically bypassing the vote a photo ID law absolutely no question about it\nNow I'm working right now ... as she put out on NBC ten this on Twitter or as far as voting bring up this is from the secretary of state's office bring a photo ID to the polls on election day\nAnd then they say one cent acceptable photo ID Rhode Island driver's license permit us passport\nID card issued by a government or educational institution Rhode Island US military ID card by the um US government or secretary feet a bus pass government issued medical card Rhode Island voter ID card\nNow it says Rhode Island voter ID card but again what I question is if you have people that are able to go in\nAnd obtain one of these ID cards and they don't even have to show any form of identification\nThat to me no love pies it right there but I still come back to eating the ability to register to vote that isn't unchecked process now I'm ... and ... what what can you tell us about that\nIt's the registration I called go to technically it's\nVoter registrations for it's it's the it's the low level of the ring that photo ID to vote once you get that you could just go to the registration period\nOf going in a way to pay for a photo ID it's allowed it legal based on the general assembly now who put those rules that and I I live from Patricia from a log in that now he's been a it's been so many bills to the general assembly\nYeah you have to go back and look into this that's right the wolf can't hide behind a little chicken\nAnd the coach pitch like still she can't hide behind the general assembly now and I\nJust have is a reporter quoted in a tweet that's what position was okay so um it's the registration issues that secretary of state's office by the way I like to request a last\nSixty days early people were registered at her office and that's ... that's interesting and then we can maybe look is that they have a photo ID\nThey write was was all have the let people walking even know that you know John you know I'm In triple can register or the utility bills\nAnd link I Want people to understand that and that means anyone could get someone's electric bill go in and then be able to obtain one of these IDs and able to vote and that that is without presenting any form of identification in ... and let's say part of me go ahead\nIt taking aim was electric bill the edges of the electric bill and if they're following the registration form coinciding with that and they were a couple of minutes that record was oh here's a photo ID card on there they were all set you can't question\nThat for us not walk on the secretary of state's office but its voice of views that needs to stop because secretary of state that stuff I Swear we're going to go with ... ... a bill right is that a requirement\nYeah I was able to say to you in the general populace to register to vote in Rhode Island and you must have a photo ID\nYeah simple driver's license military\nID or you know anything what a photo is cool you know that's fine\nAs long as ... as long as they have proven that they are in fact who they say they are because they were they getting around this is these people are obtaining these free voter ID cards ... getting out with ...\nIs these people are obtaining these free voter ID cards ... getting out with her office but the people are getting these photo Rhode Island free of voter ID cards and they they they're they're not even proving they are\nWho they say they are they live where they say they live to get the card that's correct so what I understand is as much as they're saying in order to vote at the poll you have to present a photo ID\nWhat is disingenuous about that is they're giving out photo IDs without the people actually proving they are who they say they are and I want to give an example and again the there if there's the caller listing he brought us on but folks I Want you to understand I could today\nUnless now ... now they're trying to they're on guard but you could walk and I say my name is Jim Smith\nI M whatever Thirty years old I live at Fifteen main street and the woman takes on my information she takes my picture boom there now I have my ID now whenever it maybe I can go I could get several of them\nI'm pat what also and again folks were speaking of Packwood less I Will keep you but what I find so disingenuous about certain members of media is\nAbout may prominence mayor where here Lawrence I started giving out these municipal IDs\nAnd I was going back and forth with these these members of the media that say oh no the ID it says right on it can be used for boating so I said well what what is the id for why would you need a new municipal I D O that give discounts at the zoo and people can use the library pat you and I both know\nThese municipal IDs the getting out in prominence folks they're giving out to illegal aliens so when they stopped by the police they have some form of identification to show them because if you don't have\nA form of id you can automatically be detained for two hours and during that time the police could then determine it back to be here legally so as much as they keep saying oh no no you can't vote with the\nPet Providence is not following the rules prominence as a century city I don't know why these people think\nThat a city that doesn't follow the rules but they would be following the rules on something like voting with him and his blind date\nOr what they do with the electronic system because when you go with your vote for sure your driver's license for it sort of shapes they probably could not use that Providence I eat for that but they could use it for science provisional ballot\nYes and then it goes board of elections for each of your signature shark technically it is a way to go around the says yeah and it works and the workers\nThat's because they would have to keep an eye on that because you know to relax and maybe not secretary of state's office she was not aware of quick and not doing his job for you know\nI don't know about that I don't know the whole little John ... you can give it a bit of the doubt now I'm going to wait\nTo see um [noise] uh and we'll see if we get a caller that called in where he brought his son pat how can people learn more about the court a lesson for secretary state campaign folks he's around and cut down on the ... to ... go ahead\nOr is there a quarter hours at a split or a quarter or less on Facebook everything as bad as they can resume I buy my direct winds cafe headquarters right All right I think will direct I don't have any\nHandlers middleman understood consulting yeah with a real man talk first among real Rhode Island I was on yeah all my life it's right or the other place I Know a lot of average Rhode islanders\nProblems it mostly for John right now let's get this voter id law straighten out because of boats are so important to remember John it takes to court votes so upset about\nOh how does exactly right ...\nThank you folks various ... caught a lesser secretary said let me go seven six six Thirteen eighty\nGr morning you're next on the joined a peach or show hello\nHello John I heard that you're looking to stick with you again regarding the issue of voter ID card\nI Am that's exactly right now while we are going to take your information off here but a ... pack quarter less would like to talk to you but if you don't mind what is your first name by the way Bob\nBob okay no problem if you don't mind actually\nThe guy to give you the tomatoes too\nOh okay All right if you don't mind thank you and they what what a season they've they've been there still blooming as a matter of fact I'm a thank you for that or if you don't mind just repeat the story I Know pacts listening right now we'll get your information or you'll be mailed me before correct yes\nIt's done for voting if you're just below ideas not for boating why do they have it why do they have it why are they giving them out it's not an acceptable it's worth the board of elections\nEyes here it is from Christine in Myers of ABC six I work in Providence I'm well aware of how it works my job as a journalist is to uncover report when things are not done by the book why don't you leave the channel six studios and ride over to own a veil and ride over to the west end and ride down Cranston street\nAnd do you tell me a exactly what country that how you think you're living\nAnd do you tell me a exactly what country that how you think you're living [laughter] are you kidding me and he was another thing going back to the ball I won't even get into it folks I was going back and\nForth with this Katie Davis of NBC tent folks did it this is I could go on and in fact I Will I'll I'll I'll pick up that conversation they try to argue there were people living in Rhode Island by the way seven six six Thirteen eighty seven six six Thirteen maybe there are people living in Rhode Island\nWho are they just don't speak English\nAnd they've never learned English but they live here that's impossible guess what you can't get a high school diploma Rhode Island unless you speak English\nI loved it thing how do you how do you how do you know that they're illegal gee I don't know or they don't speak any English they don't have any ah id daredevil driver's license that are of a passport\nThat's kind of a red flag while there are many people they only speak Spanish at home\nAnd they home school them so they never gotten the driver's license that never learned English drawn to produce some of these people and show me they are American citizens that is ludicrous you cannot get a high school diploma\nIn Rhode Island or anywhere unless you can speak English but I don't understand is why the Rhode Island media is in such a hurry to back up\nAre these people that are obviously living here illegally I I don't understand it but I go back and forth with it folks I mean that's to me it's a red flag right you don't speak English\nThey are what Eighteen Nineteen years old they have no passport they have no id well maybe they live in a house and they just don't speak English well didn't they learn English to school they were home schooled I mean they they had like making it up as they go along\nOur eight seven six six Thirteen eighty but I'm Glad pack quarter less is pushing this and you will find that ... I've been saying it folks this is important this is our boat who is voting ... do they recruit them\nThe ... the reason why right now it's eleven forty two\nAnd this is one of those stories the entire media should focus on and it is very simple\nThe whole reason why Gina Raimondo and David ...\nAnd ... and ... and that may or Central Falls the entire reason they want illegals to come into this country and coming to Rhode Island is for their boat plain and simple\nIf they were voting Republican if you'd all these illegals coming over the border and they were voting Republican they are you kidding me they'd they'd go down and start building the wall themselves for crying out loud\nThey wouldn't even [laughter] wait for another thing\nIt's all about the vote\nIn the ... you can give them forms of ID they're more likely to stay the more you can give them some form of id to show hey they belong here they absolutely belong here you can't say that they absolutely belong here the more that that this happens\nThe more in fact that this is who is infiltrating\nBut what what I Do not accept is they try to argue when you want to go on election day to the polls you need a photo ID I'm not saying that they would they go to the polls they don't go to the polls they use mail ballots and they do emergency voting\nThat's why ... allows emergency boating and if you go to Providence city hall watch coming up I'll go with the camera this time\nAnd you watch the people that are in line for quote emergency boating\nThey don't even showing ID none of them speak English they have been named written down exactly who they're supposed to vote for their told who to vote for or they have mail ballots\nThat's what it comes down to folks seven six six Thirteen eighty seven six six Thirteen

I don't know what it is a in this whole business I just I don't like any of it not only calling violet jumping in our link I mean how desperate itchy\nTo be relevant again like God Arlene is Seventy four\nTo be relevant again like God Arlene is Seventy five for crying out loud oh little bored with the drill care what\nYou voted for Hillary you're in favor of sanctuary cities you despise Trump\nHow desperate are you to be relevant again in the conversation and on top of that she doesn't live political analysis for another radio station I mean it's just so twisted and I like John robe Italian I voted for John ... general tight doesn't even live in Rhode Island anymore\nAnd Patricia Morgan said in this studio and said I Would never support a Democrat or an independent and then boom she endorses troll oh\nI don't like any of it\nBut let's not lose sight of the fact the person that needs to be defeated is Gina Raimondo her numbers are terrible she knows it\nAnd is this\nTrue low on unjust strapping on a suicide vest willing to take everybody down he is Seventy five is going to kill a million dollar ... got a gorgeous conduit Florida he's very well off he doesn't have to live in Rhode Island anymore he doesn't care\nAfter November he bailing a Florida though do we have to live here and I don't want to live here with Gina Raimondo was the blanket governor period\nSo in this whole attitude he was just dirty and built the beating a twelve year olds and fighting at the state house what is whoa this is an ideal it's it's upsetting to me because I Know Joel just wipe I had the bill infamy\nHim in Maryland and the village on the show is is that I feel like this isn't the guy that I Know I'll go farther he's a nice the members of my family ... I I don't know what's happened there was younger I was like a drug problem although it's it's it's not\nSo I'm trying to figure out who's the real Joe ... is it the guy that was beating up a twelve year old kid who's been punching some guy in an office at the state house or is it the guy that I had bill in I I don't even know anymore but I'll tell you what he called in yesterday I felt like I was talking to someone I didn't know\nAnd this whole business that Trump is going to come in from I I Can't even listen to it if you people that are supporting them actually believe that been like good luck what you've lost your mind\nPresident Trump would not embarrass themselves in that way ... seven six six\nThirteen eighty good afternoon Europe on the John ... show hello\nHi John I just wanted to say that I think you've seen the true Joe troll oh I mean I think that that is the true colors I mean now have\nA fish um Oregon is now on board and she's got can block with them we've already seen you know how can a field about Alan fine and I do really really want someone like Joe trailer as a governor\nI I don't I mean he's the bully he doesn't get the way he what he wants and that he he takes things that was very vengeful\nHe but he's hardly seems to be vengeful that's for sure he did but it doesn't seem fair to you he seems to be running more against Alan ...\nAbsolutely I absolutely have you see I ... on you say I'm not ... sign I have not seen what out you know oh it's all on Facebook and to you when you read it comes to post and a fish um Oregon I mean that\nThere isn't a barrier water is re she's another one I was friendly I was her biggest supporter for years I Want to tell you that\nWhen I was down to dial for ten years any time she needed to get on the radio I Would patch or right through anytime\nI pat and I had Patricia Morgan on the radio more than if you took all the other radio host combine added up I had her on more than anyone you know what this has been very difficult because I feel these two people that I used to support\nAnd I feel like I don't recognize the the one of them right now I\nI agree I agree I have met Patricia she comes here speak at the ... Republican town committee on two occasions\nVery cordial talking about how she wants to help Rhode Island this that's the other thing and\nUm you know and she had a lot of support in ... and I think she won she um several districts out only won one God out of ... and\nAnd so she had a lot of supporters that I don't know how a lot of the others feel but um you know there wasn't support there and I think it's a very disgraceful to see her turn her back on the people you know that you don't you know voted for her to really go in a band and the party and and and ask them this way and and to to join teams went with him I just\nIt it can mean these people I just it bothers me I feel like you know it really should be just thinking of the better the rest of us\nAnd we can't let this stuff you know get to you in a way that you can act like that vengeful everyone just got on board behind Alan and and I agree it should be all those can be ...\nAnd I see I ... percent were that's what it's about\nI that that is definitely what it has to come down to and I am so sick of people caring about the whole Rhode Island the problem is is that the um the um the one of those in votes at the state party meetings that they voted to endorse Allen is on the fifth GOP these are the people who are elected by our local committees that go there and vote on\nYou know our behalf yes and then the prime people smoke I mean right I mean the Republican people spoke that was who they wanted it that I don't know how you can say once against you I just\nI Know that on the East Bay I'm just glad I see a lot of times I'm hoping that there are a lot of people that just aren't saying they're going to vote for I've done some Kansas thing for Alan and everyone is not happy with ... and that goes by Democrats also night and the Democrats I don't know how they're going to vote but they definitely are not happy with with her\nPerformance doesn't know who Morgan ... I think it just feels dirty to me they just feel it already you know it's tough and his behavior yesterday was appalling to me upholding I I\nI I was it was so uncomfortable for me it really was it was appalling and Patricia Oregon putting he's the only one that can be just\nThe the the delusional or she's lost her mind because how do you keep saying that a guy with six percent of the only one that can be Raimondo when all Raimondo you cannot put on television without Gina Raimondo running bomb at the ...

has been paid for my friend Richard faggot looking back at the studios Richard faggot good afternoon Mr Jeff how are you\nAll I Am or how do you have to post on vegetables as always but you know what onto the next adventure and that is election day kicking off and on your head and say\nI don't know yeah there we go [noise] uh yes I I it was a very successful auto fast uh it's been quite a bit of time there with my wife ah Patricia and um I think it was a success once again\nOr is a lovely time but as we say a turning the page my goodness now we're just weeks away from the general election a little\nBoom I Believe a little over three week there was a month as of October ... coming quick yes I'm looking forward to it and uh that's why I'm here today to come up with my message again to the people who tuned into your show as you said this broadcast is brought you buy and paid for by friends of Richard fragment for counseling\nI change things up I was going to keep things the same and\nI Am but I wanted to do this again I Want to give my resume to the people who were listening today and the citizens in the taxpayers who is Richard factor well very simple Richard is just your average citizen that had enough with the political scene back in two thousand twelve\nAnd I decided to run for a seat on the city council I wasn't successful but I kept on keeping on in two thousand Fifteen I ran for state rep and district fifty which is my representative district because at three thirty there was nobody challenging the person who was running um\nSo I wanted to run I didn't feel that somebody should run on a post and I went in there like quarter for two to sign up and I wanted to take back that seat that belongs to the people Jeff from the special interest groups controlling that D fifty seat and by the way they still do okay\nThe people see not special interests somebody's got to step up and the next two years when it comes back up again and and run and get that feedback um\nTwo thousand sixteen fattening contingent his quest to represent the average citizen by running for a seat on one side could city council as an independent lead a crusading to put the people first I kept on saying success for the people to make a difference and give a voice to you the average citizen\nIt's above you isn't it citizens\nIt's not about Richard it's not about any of the other council members is not about the mayor or ministry patients about you does everybody I Believe has a neon sign on their forehead stating what's in it for me what are you going to do for me and that's why I ran\n\nAnd I'm not like other politicians Jeff I'm really not they get elected every two years and accomplish nothing say nothing and never take on any important issues like I've done\n\nFacing them solving these issues one at a time\n\nPeople voted for me to sixteen because they knew\nPeople voted for me to sixteen because they knew that I was not politically correct\nThey knew that I was rough around the edges\nI was one of them and I didn't make any pledges that I was going to be politically correct I said I was going to shake things up and that was going to do what I felt that the citizens of one socket wanted me to do\nBecause by the way forty four hundred eleven people came out out of twelve thousand and voted for Richard ... to be their counseling\nAnd uh I was very humbled by it I work hard I got my message out and uh I was rewarded with the seat\nUm\nLet me get back to this here again as I said I'm not always politically correct and I didn't say I was going to end to sixteen\nAnd I found out the politics Jeff and for everybody out there listening is a very nasty and click orientated format as witnessed by me for the last twenty two months in office you're either with them or you're against them\nThat's not who I Am I don't like cliques\n\nFor the last twenty two months in office a lot of these elected officials call themselves the dream team this year as they said it into sixty well I can tell you folks Richard fat is an independent councilman and not with anyone but the citizens of the tax payers of one socket\nThis is my team and I don't choose to be on any other team and don't forget the taxpayers I'm On their team because I Am a taxpayer and they pay a lot of money every year for taxes water sewage just like everybody else and I'm On a fixed income no\nFact yesterday my birthday was sixty seven years old well happy birthday and I'm thank God it at my wife is younger by five years she still works I have the health insurance because you know what if I didn't have\nI'd be in trouble right now I couldn't afford my home just like thousands of other people in this city\nAnd Jeff I'm very proud of what I've accomplished in the last twenty two months\nDone which I never could understand but it got done\nAnd then there was another one on the track record of ordinance is a very very bad situation I'm On ... avenue people coming out down the street traffic goes by real quick a lot of accidents I was able to put a no parking signs after the first Fifteen feet to live you ate that and I believe that hasn't been any more accidents ...\nThose are good ordinances that I put together and also I'm the one that spearheaded the ordinance on the cultivation grow marijuana growing socket and all of a sudden it wasn't popular I took the bull by the horns grabbed the football heading for the uh um\nEnd zone and zone you know the red red zone they call it and all of a sudden they got taken away from me committee was formed and give that to us\nBecause they realize it was not become popular and a lot of people who were mad because certain people weren't putting it forward all\nOf a sudden I got taken away from me well the uh uh planning board took to the changes and said no we're not doing that that was a thousand feet\nAnd they wanted to have a fence around that whole complex can you imagine the cost of putting a fence well it just showed me and I went to the planning board meeting and I spoke to the planning board and said hey this just shows you that the people who are trying to grab this ordinance don't really don't know what they're talking about\nYou don't need a fence so that's coming up\nThe next meeting which is the fifteenth and uh well you'll have to tune in because nobody's gonna steal that often it's from me because it's the same ordinance now that it was before when I put it through with the zoning department and the housing\nWhile\nThe enemy is they've got about another minute or so\nBut yeah we got some time I'm the only thing I'm proud of I'm a senior citizen and uh I voted on increasing\nThe city contribution and in two years or for Eighteen and Nineteen they're getting a hundred and twenty thousand dollars where they were only getting you know thirty or whatever so I voted to double is very proud of that Jeff because I don't talk a good game I Do it\nAnd I keep doing it to the job gets done\nNot always pretty\nEnergy at the end of our at the beginning of our uh a tenure as confident we face this big herculean a company that wanted to buy our water and so on and I listen we spent hours listening to everybody there\nHey listen we spent hours listening to everybody their side outside so on and so forth\nThe night at the high school when our citizens there was only our citizens can talk said no I listen to them and I voted with my conscience and my hot and I voted the way the people wanted me to vote\nIt wasn't just about the Eighteen million it was about the health our neighbors and borrow villain Harris bill and a lot of factors that I considered\n\nMost important one there obviously the voice of the people you heard in the room\nAnd I've always done that and I said from sixteen I Will never make a vote that would hurt or the citizens on socket check my track record\nCome up with something that I voted for to hurt the people versus the rest of the council how many have come out with six ordinances issue hey\nThat's probably more than the whole council combined I could be wrong and I was saying corrected if I Am I'm looking I'm doing\n\nYou know a outfielder I said I wouldn't sell it for less than seven hundred thousand and I'm going to stick with that because that's the people's field that's the people's money and I'm not going to sell it for four hundred and sixty thousand\nYou know\nIt puts a little under will say seven hundred thousand and the new buyer can prove to me that the difference between what will lower it too and what taxes will come in and will be a successful business in harmony with that corner that I Will take a look at it but until then I Will not\nEntertain any idea of selling it for less than seven hundred thousand it's being used now football teams are using up the little kids they put the lights on at night it's a nice feel to do that as long as we've got the money to maintain it and\nWe as a council and the new council should be putting money to maintain that\nField at all costs because that's how citizens feels ah what else have I done and I voted for the elected school committee or voted to have more than one or two pawn shops\nUm\nBut he he's my goals and vision for the city want socket this is my plan for\nPeople who have been asking what's what's the council people's platform what's the the mayor or and or the the the person who's going to run for mayor what's their platform okay recruit small business entrepreneurs through economic development working with the administration and the council\nThese are ... printers are the backbone of our success in the usa Jeffrey one socket Fifteen Percent of growth in the United states is by they're not big box stores\nContinue to vote yes

infrastructure by voting to pave more roads in fixing things up without using the taxpayers money remember under the a ministry and before\nMay have found came a twelve million dollars was was voted and approved to borrow okay that turned out to be with interest twenty two million\nWhich we're still paying for today and how many years is that that under this administration we've paved all these roads without borrowing any money yes the taxpayers pay for and I thank them for that and I'm thinking you were getting taxpayers\nYou provided the money with the supplemental two point five million dollars that comes in the base every year\nThat's your money but look around has your city is it better today than it was five years ago\nI I like that people say yes or no I think it is I've seen it I ride around all over I Want to continue to in that path but also be fiscal beat that watched or to make sure we're not spending a lot of money and want to\nLobby with the council administration to lobby state representatives whoever the new ones are going to be or the same ones that we need more money in the city for the schools okay just said I got three minutes there's a lot of things because

[laughter] you see the future but I just got hit by a bus and she didn't see that were coming to [laughter]\nI'm All right [laughter] well\nJokes over a couple of calls ago um that was the galley watching it yes it was\nIt was I uh she was she hit the nail on a couple of points but I'm going to be on a second point the first point I wanted to agree with her on is spending limits [noise] okay [noise] the way it should be\nIs if you ever run for public office whether it be a city council person or mayor or governor or president United States it should be some sort of level playing field right now we have Gina Raimondo spending millions of dollars and you have or upon his spending hundreds of dollars\nThere's no there's no playing field here that there is no playing field it's like um every time I turn it on my TV I'm inundated with Gina Raimondo face which I'm tired of looking at the guy\nThat isn't everywhere I have to have to agree with ... is it is a a\n... it's everywhere like herpes it's everywhere okay and I'm sick of looking at it I think what should happen is everyone should have a level or spending limit toward a thousand three hundred thousand that way it gives the average person\nThe chats how you've you know if you have you ever walked up to a child a near teach in a field and ask them what they would want to do and did they ever did any of them ever asked or say the president of the United states\nAnd you don't hear that too often these days are okay no\nWell well I'm sure it's it it must be out there and I'm pretty sure that teaches like\nI mean I Love to hear people say that but I don't know when the world of politics with the way it is these days I\nBut clearly this man should not be punished by either the individuals attending that boys and girls are the people running it or the city\nOkay it has never been a tremendous lay out on area highly congested okay when you look at plans and I am hey is the individual who designed once talked to a village or a and it was supposed to be a community\nClearly this man me and and I know is ... uh he needed some kind of satisfaction we're not talking about rocket science share\nOrder to get satisfaction that would seem to me he's gonna well he says he he does have a lawyer or a suit a file to ...\nTo me he's gonna well he says he he does have a lawyer or a suit or filed against the city but again that gets very very expensive for the average person or who who can afford to take on the city\nI just want to say this isn't the topic I call wall but the truth of the matter is you cannot take on a city especially now that went from an eighty thousand dollar yeah legal budget and excessive a half a million plus outside consultants and anybody who thinks justices swift\nIs almost as bright as Richard ...\nThat's how dumb you've got to be ...\nBecause there's nothing swift about it this mass selfish self as above vandalism suffers about not wanting to answer it's fun door\nThat's ridiculous you know nobody would have to live that way nobody should have to live that way Lowry and we are in total agreement on that ... okay one more a lot about in that school because the whole

one in the business regardless of mercy call All right [laughter] nobody I Know a line I thought I'd chime in what a nice guy you are listening\nTo um to your emailer about Al Green of\nAnd the and the airplane yeah yeah well first of all you need to if it just happened he doesn't need to listen to lease filing all this stuff is or how often they do it but I don't know how the writer wouldn't even know whether he's claimed it or not or should\nYeah I I don't know I I wouldn't even know what what would you check with the attorney general's office or something like ... the election born ...\nState was state wide elections yeah I'm a ... that's one case I mean you know that's silly and what's interesting when I'm listening to this these these people that have a candidate you know there are obviously the person broke you about that is obviously not agreeing fan mhm but states they just sounds so part is and\nIt doesn't sound there's no there's no validity to it it doesn't sound like they're making any you know general sense or\nAn observation of of profit friday you can tell they've got this thing going on against whoever it is\nWell and it goes both ways it yeah yeah oh yeah that's what I mean people don't want to even talk about the issues at hand and then that's what\nYou've been talking about the issues at hand and then that's what I find most disturbing a lot of personal attacks on each of the candidates and and I\nI wouldn't say that's anything new in this city when it comes to the local politics and probably it's the case everywhere else to\nKnow what was the deal is with a brand not being able to not being in the parade\nUm this person who came out that he should have been in the parade should have been at autumn fenced in\nBecause he wasn't there this person is hinting or he's not as healthy as he claims he is\nWell if he had been in a convertible like they usually do [laughter] you know he could have been sitting in a convertible nobody would\nKnow yeah you're right and I think that's where most are very well not most but many of your politicians that's how they have a going through the parade in years past\nYeah and and and is being and listen listen to me you know I don't I don't care for Bree in the sun so listen to me defend them but I mean if the guy who were\nHad some poor health and the sense that he couldn't walk a long way and stuff like that how does that make him not confidence of the office well enough to march during the during his tenure always got to do is make it to his desk\n[laughter] that is a very good point [laughter] you know really how was that I don't have to run a marathon to be the mayor right [laughter] I mean and that makes\nThat the caller or the or the writer seem like a petty jerk and then again I don't have a dog on a flight I don't I don't vote and win socket but it's just interesting to hear these people throw this stuff like nobody's going to do they're going to vote for the mayor next [laughter] it just so stupid\nAnd it it is quite obvious many many ways\nYeah I mean it is interesting like you said talk about the issues ... you know he voted for such and such when he was a counselor or you know he you know he beats his wife for whatever the hell it is I mean you know it makes me kind of nation you know not as ... as\nWell and then I think as a as a community there's there there there is so much room for improvement a and whoever's going to be the next mayor I I'd like to hear exactly what is your plan on doing for the next two years to move the city had I I Want to hear this\nYou know what do you think they're councils got all that you pass [laughter] you know I mean yeah things like that I mean let's think about that you know I mean nobody is going to say after a ten year I'll go there but boy you should have seen him walking in that primary he was waving on both sides he was doing a little twist [laughter] only going to do\nThat yes I can always remember there was one elected officials who never missed a good parade and that was a congressman St Jimmy and with this big smile those shiny live in ... going down ... street matter of fact I was on a sunny day it was enough to blind anybody under those out they said there wasn't a parade he missed\nNo no no no because he knew how to play the crowd yeah he did that and the question you have to have in this year is is it is that what you want you want to be you want to be you know ... ... do you want to have your taxes lowered or do you want to have safety on the streets whatever it is\nYou know again I'm not ... making a comment and there are enough issues you know it's not like there's a shortage of important issues facing our community\nNow let me ask you this one this is something I've asked on many many times and nobody has ever answered mhm 'cause I I don't think there's any answer per se I guess it will be somewhere [noise]\nWhy can't you know everybody talks about campaign funds and using campaign funds where there's another sort of an art she used to use their campaign funds to buy her wardrobe that's true I\nI remember that being said yes yeah yeah\nYeah she well she did I mean and she she spoke openly and say well it's it's part of my business which one you're thinking of it makes a lot of sense you know that that got to look good right yes but here's my question all how many times have you heard people say\nWe can't get good people and people say well I Can't afford to run ... I've got a house I've got kids so I get I'm not whoever it is it has the money to run why can't we allow people who want to run for office to be paid during the campaign\nAnd what I'm saying is somebody agrees to run for governor\nAnd they have a I don't know sixty Seventy thousand dollar job so it's a campaign takes over their salary\nThey get they get a you know I'm a release from their boss to run a ... ... what's the word I'm looking for you know\nAbsence right mhm and and the campaign is part of their campaign expense they pay the guy's salary to make up so that we can get good people in there who can afford it so they couldn't afford ...\nWell that that's an interesting idea I liked the idea of campaign funding limits or that it drives me crazy when I see some of these candidates\nPile up do to the millions of dollars for the campaigns while the opponents trying to scrape a few bucks together I mean that that it's so out of balance so I find that so on American is that what our system is all about the person who ... who has access to the most money when\nThey asked the question is yes you know ... times it is well not all the time but it but it is definitely yes that is that's how our country works as the freedom of the ability to give money to own a ... you know\nDuring entity mhm to contribute in that way to your freedoms\nAnd friendly to promote right reaching a good guy\nAnd I have a check book and I want you and I want you in office and I have money and I want to regular check I should be able and am able to do that\nBut they don't you think they should be a limit\nWell you have the limit would be a problem only because uh you could get off of good campaign for a hundred and thirty bucks a week or two\nI appreciate that thank you very much and there was a lot\nOf people looking for us to really was not on a good good good okay uh another thing is I Know we're not big on Facebook but most of our listeners are and if they get a friend request from now it's probably as spam\nNo okay I probably spend a just a joke [laughter] okay guys see I caught that okay I'm so but not that's low point I think the way it is going to help\nMe I just for a one socket Historical Society mhm and you would remember this if you ran across anything\nI started doing another book [noise] and you're probably going to be revolted when I tell you it's about but as the KKK mhm and get how fiery came up even into New England\nHome actually it came to um I think it was ... park in the city um one sock it there was a demonstration by the KKK\nThat's what I'm going to need ... who is also a street and Smith fail they had to change the name of that last year mhm still had a name was a reference to the KKK huh and I can remember old bond parties where they had sweat dances and stuff in northern Rhode Island\nRight and I remember the KKK ... people talking about it the forefathers\nYeah if if I remember right the KKK experience in one socket was directed towards the the hatred was directed towards the Catholics that was\nA no towards the Irish are All right well the I ... I guess yeah yeah well yeah they were ... name was the first Catholics in the area yup yup when it was all jobs right right\nNow you many times and I've listened to thousands of your shows some of your idols as us presidents or the Roosevelt\nOh yeah okay\nHalf the AR ... named a Supreme Court justice Hugo Black mhm which was a K. K. K. member\nYeah he ... he was elected in August Seventeen Nineteen thirty seven ... and stayed on the court until Nineteen Seventy one ... and he part of a much had a right in front of the state of the capital with sixty thousand Klan members\n[laughter] nothing to be too proud of vi point again what you know with our president just went through trying to get\nA judge that was always already on the second highest level uh-huh of being a judge in this country Italy this is so mild compared to what ... yeah\nBut nobody talks about the root of all it's because they got 'em glorified to Kennedy's\nWell you know they were those who glorify the Roosevelt but they there were those who hated him to a man I guess that goes for every are elected officials especially the president\nBut it's amazing the research I'm getting on a\nI'm curious to you know I I I the reaction to buy the general public to Hugo Black and the parade and all that went with it or how does the average American react to that oh it was all ... you know so common at the time\nI don't hate radio came onto the scene Nineteen twenty two twenty three twenty four twenty five ... every place to everything else and swept the country with the\nBig box stores and stuff like that with their own studios right right well a black used it to his advantage ... and he did a public broadcast\nFifteen million Americans tuned in to find out who this guy was\n... ... at the time while\nAnd I that's all part of the story and I I think this is going to be really good because it relates not just set up a KKK what the black population it was the Jews oh yeah it was a the all the hatred you on the Irish you that\nThey had so much hatred towards the Catholics the Jews and the blacks\nYou know anybody that took a job selling ... anybody\nHas affected their jobs that the whole candidate ... and you had such a panic in a country after the Spanish wind influence or Nineteen Eighteen that decimated so many populations\nThe city's we're in deep trouble and they were looking for some kind of savior to putting somebody that would represent them mhm and that's what I'm finding a new story\nInteresting but how the Irish were picked on us but they don't they built three quarters of ... to because that was the Irish tenets when England and ... and ... and all that essentially to bring up Bermuda to build it mhm and they died on now\nWell here in one socket the Irish were certainly not well received when they ...\nYeah you know there's another story no the ...\nBut like you said I Am much of it has to do with jobs the jobs that were available and the fact that they came in and they were used to working for nothing so again they were the lowest paid a group man they got hired them and you stumble\nAcross anything down here on your archives anything pictures or any assemblies or anything like that\nHow I Would I be sure and let you know I'll be on the lookout my friend thank you Larry All right thank you Wayne\nBy by by by email says Larry has our tax assessment resign is this do to the accusations from the re valuation I haven't heard the mayor answer this question\nHave you that comes from day uh\nI I heard the comment made at the last council meeting but I don't think there was ever in answer was there so I don't know the status of our tax assess or\nMaybe somebody knows\nGood afternoon Iran W when I ride\nHi Larry Kudlow there and I know I didn't know if you got your questions answered yet but I went back to parade yes um get anybody call you about it yeah\nYet but I went to parade yes um get anybody call you about it yet about what the whole\nFront lawn ... who was in the front of the parade [laughter]\nRight and it was a mayor dally heights okay and then all of the city council\nUm she never mind you know ... and ... and\nAlan song are ... they shot it off with all of that show but\nI think that's what they usually do right now she walking in the parade was the mayor was asking what would that precedent mean about police protection for the mayor and the parade I mean what was that\nI don't I don't I don't know if you cut 'em yeah but what she'll she'll cops on the side of her I Will I Wish to\nMaybe that's what they were referring to OK okay\nAll right and then there was like ten divisions I guess you know when I tried that was nice but I just wanted to let you know she was in the parade and she was walking\nAnd I think usually that's what happens at the parade it seems to me in years past the people ran out the front of the parade are usually your elected officials and some of the candidates are that are joining the parade as well they usually right up there right up front you\nKnow show I Am but that's what it was this year it's well\nAll right well thank you for that information I'll come right take care bye now\nHave you back\nAll right so I was right for a change the elected officials read the front\nOf the parade good afternoon Iran WN are on\nThe ... and how are you today\nI Am fine and how about yourself and\nTerrific thank you um as far as I'm obviously out of the area but I did get to watch the Jacob page of the parade ... keep in mind it's a non political event correct right now um I did not get to see any other candidates both\nFor city council or spoken many there mhm because again it was on the political events and that they're running for anything um some of them may have an answer from\nLike a a legion that they do with the boy scouts or whatever but I don't recall seeing all of us the or or a bunch of candidates I've watched it twice so I if I miss this I must have not at all ah\nIt was right at the beginning of the parade we've been told so maybe what happened was um [laughter] maybe a that was eliminated from uh uh the broadcast a telecast or whatever I don't know well\nThe one of the things they had I mean obviously jak greed was there and everybody else says\nAh one of those ones on the uh every four years or every three or ...\nOn their running um but I Do\nI say I was a quote unquote but it was about that I'm Out of the plane\nIn but uh yeah\nThey didn't get to say because obviously it wasn't telecast mhm however um do you recall the Canada\nMaybe twenty five thirty years ago that or Twenty years ago at least\nThat if you are trying to pick

I'll tell you that's not true so there is a way to take it as best as roof off a building\nWithout costing yourself thoughts you know tens of thousands of dollars I I Will present to you and he wasn't that cause about it at your kitchen table how to get it done a\nAnd in a couple of cases the the cost was\nA you know I Want to say three to four thousand dollars a above the a normal costs of roofing so basically the stuff is has to do more with way uh sending it it has to go to register as best as landfills\nBut ah what the the actual amount of as best as in a\nIn a tile is a you know like one one hundredth of a percent\nIt's not actually that but it's such a miniscule amount of as best as Senator Kyl or by the guest wanted breaks it becomes fry a bowl that means that floats in the air and you could get a little as ... I'm a big in your lungs and then\nOh by golly so my dad used to say\nI ... my dad used to work for a valley gas company back in the uh before I was born I think but they used a mix the uh they they call it as best as but they would put a mixture of his best to send to a um a mixture that they would then code on hitting pipes\nWe've all seen them in a well\nMaybe not your millennials but people my age and the like have all been in their basements or the grandmother grandfather uncle's house and the uh over the years in St pipes covered with white\nIt's not a summit per se or more of like a plaster finish but that has his best to send it as best as as a binder\nAnd helps the whole products together the same as a as an a a roof Tyler citing tile as best as as a binder hubs to hold their stuff together show but the amounts of it as best as a very minute and as long as your father's certain protocol to take 'em down it's not a big deal so\nAh Dennis I'll get to you it's a trend pride Dennis asked before a price on a removing it as best as tile roof and then also asked me for a price on covering the trim which I forgot so sorry Dennis I'm working on that and I've got another fellow

fire up the bag\nSend it on its way so they are\nThat's the story what as best as a well it's part of the story I'll explain the rest to because I Can't give all my knowledge of these guys are on my competitors that might be listening to steal all my secrets um\nI was very lucky or this week on a different note to a\nA higher feller up in the military Massachusetts area to do some sales for my company a deliberately reading a lot lately about building a salesperson the\nAnd that if you're listening we're going to shut down I'm going to get mad plugged in is a very intelligent young man a schoolteacher that wants to start doing sales I'm very flattered that they would come into the company and he said that the honestly uh the reason he'd come to work with me as he sort of process\nI he's done home improvement sales for a a\nA few other companies over the years and when he came and sat down with me he said gee nobody ever worked for did it the way you do it\nWell I'm very flattered and you should be as a consumer hearing that a guy that has been in sales for other home improvement companies\nOr has not ever seen the process the way that I Do it the way I was taught to do it so we're going to bring up the kitchen table and we're gonna make you understand that in a way that\nYou know it's going to help you to make a decision or to hire us to do your job or for the guys that are you know you're still work with me and have taken some of my trade secrets and left even though\nYou know you're still work with me and have taken some of my trade secrets and left even though they said they'd stay around and helped me run the company into my retirement years are you guys are\nA very lucky to have been able to observe God with some of the ... the stuff that took me years of a of a you know practice to uh\nTo be able to become the best that so uh no love lost their fellows [laughter]\nThe or I'm thinking about a couple of things here and you know I started clock watching there we go to a few minutes ago um and I misplaced a note here as I was stomach through my stuff I think we beat up you're pretty well a metal roofing\nThere it'd be so I'll get a lot of calls from metal roofing and I think that the folks at hobby building products are trying to push metal roofing a little bit more uh uh\nPersonally if you travel up and down ... in a couple of the hill road\nAnd you go fast pepper lumber\nHappens I grew up with a ... a a a good people over there they'll give you a good a good a deal on your materials\nThey have a metal roof on that building and uh I'd I'd like to ask them into some day I Will call them and say how old I met a roof is but I'm going to say it's not more than Thirty Years' old\nShow when you look at a metal roofing product a\nMetal roofing has a twenty five or at the finish warranty\nSo that means that setting up on a roof for medals gonna come on it's going to look real shiny has got to be a real pretty for ten years Fifteen Years the same as shingle it starts to wear out it starts to fade the color goes away\nHere's my beef above metal roofing and and roofing is expensive I'm looking at another article I Want to try to finish off on in in my experience roof metal roofing is\nAt least double the cost of asphalt shingle roving what are you getting with a metal roof that justifies two to two and a half times it costs\nNothing\n... some people like the way it looks personally you know if I needed to do a roof on my house is kind of course it's a pretty big house pretty big roof gonna cause minimum",
