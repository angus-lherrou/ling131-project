going to happen to district because here's what appeals to me about your fantasy against all this is your chance to make a difference of the week um today Michael VI\nV. E. R. I. state Senate district twenty and that is one of the problems when you have all Democrats up there that right now they they a lot of them are at the state house has\nIt and it becomes if you ever watch penguins when they go to the water one does and they all just kind of follow it becomes very difficult for someone to speak out at all due respect but\nThe Democrats than look around left or right and feel they're not going to be the one to stick out you have the opportunity to speak out you were then don't only what anything no parties going to hold you back from speaking on the commitment of what you think is most important is that fair\nI'm absolutely committed to being doing what I think is the great thing and I hope the voters agree with me and if they disagree man two years to rid of me but I don't think they'll have that problem because I genuinely wants ... not what's best for our state\nAnd the citizens in our state and I'm absolutely certain that will shine through in the legislation that I bring to the table um and the way that I conduct myself I wouldn't\nWant to just go back to this valley breeze article again a card your polling said at a hard time deciding whether to run again this year but when he saw that fellow veteran Senator Mark Cody wasn't running again and we'll soccer was losing experience large said he decided to make at least one more run now\nAll due respect that does not strike me as someone\nJust I'm getting motivated just by talking to that has the type of enthusiasm it almost seems a little more time just to play out the strength he's been up there\nFor twenty five years I think we can all agree Rhode Island is on the wrong track we need some new blood we need someone with your background and enthusiasm up there and that's why I think so many people are gravitating towards your candidacy\nWe were speaking earlier about the things that separate me from other Canada about military service animals arms um again my director at a hospital is a unique medical background that bring something to the Dutch here's something we didn't talk about\nGrowing up I went to fork to different schools because I was a state to state ... joined the army at Seventeen\nAnd I've always been invested in my community so what I've been able to to see\nIs a hundred different ways of doing things sometimes the right way and sometimes the wrong way but I learned from all of those you want to know what best practices meaning as I see all these different ways of doing things which one was the best and I want to bring that to the table the worst thing you can possibly do\nIs Rob somebody that only has one point of view I guess the best thing you can do describe somebody that has many different points of view because I can say I've seen this orange seen a version of this and it failed or it was successful and here's why Jeff negative still all about to bring a unique perspective\nPony Roger card can you name it again folks could afternoon it's ... it is the John ... show was speaking with Michael variety it's V.

I see a state rep I think yes so be it\nThe ... the person who has said that he sexually Harris direct is a state rep and she is fourteen years younger than he\nIs now the now let me qualify this I'm not saying humanities innocent what I'm saying is this is a strange new world and what I mean by that is she sent an email to\nThe ... the speaker of the house well that's not he's not a police officer he's got a law enforcement officer what would be your advice if someone came to you and they did something illegal to you\nHe should as he could have said simply you need to report it to the police say so now you have all this it's not clear cut what the speaker supposed to do at that point yet he's being blamed as if like he didn't take any action well he's not law enforcement\nAnd he's not he's not sure if the guy's guilty or not guilty and I'm not saying either or just because she claimed he did that does not mean that he's automatically if that's the case we could claim anything\nSo he's in a bad position you did you follow in I mean by this Mr Bush and we've entered this world it's the thing that I've been arguing about the bars how a guy goes to a bar with a gun shoots at people\nAnd then the bars held responsible for it they close them down like at the bars will know the people that you have in society creating these these problems the bottom line is just trying to make money now can they create certain conditions that lead to that absolutely but just because you shut the bar down doesn't mean that action doesn't take place just because you accuse\nNick mad yellow we're doing nothing or whatever you being used the oven somehow his name being dragged through the mud in this case doesn't mean he did anything wrong it's not his fault if kale did this I didn't do this or if she accused him of falsely accused him it's not his fault\nSo you need to take it to the police I think if that but you don't want to do that so now he gets it makes it looked like he has not done anything I don't know if I'm making any sense but it does but it's a new world that we've entered\nWell it is I'm more your fault closer to an election period because it's brought\nTo you but that's why the political that's what makes me think somewhat this is a political ... all\nI I Do think it's a timed to the all I didn't know cable was running for reelection and district forty seven\nAgainst a ... a member of David Plates\nAnd missed the places a Republican not to say the Mr place at anything to do with us it's completely Democrat business uh this is the second time that a councilman has challenged representative cable for the lawmakers job and whether this um scandal will have any effect on that the race in ...\nRemains to be seen and I think they've made his case quite clearly a few seconds ago about the issues involved here\nYeah well he may be a hundred percent guilty of all this but the ... the person who's not responsible for it and all responsible to even do anything until the man is proven guilty\nIs the speaker of the house how was it his fault that another human being acted in a certain way and then another human being decided not to take that action to the police that their choices now he's just managing Merle right well I mean I don't have any thing to prove any of this happened I don't have the police report on anything\nWell the bomb scares I'm against Democrat officials and the murders in Pittsburgh where the president small so because of his rhetoric right just so happens is that you can uh you can get blamed for what you say ... and in the case here of a matter of yellow you can get blamed for what you didn't do\nDay there's no it's not Texas\nThey deem do you have any other uh guesses or I'm\nA I'm now ...

I'm the watchdog [noise] I I think it's just a matter of us doing odd jobs and I\nAnd holding the executive accountable and saying hey this is something that that we can't do and I think when we have a discussion in this city about collaboration between\nThe mayor and the city council and people say well there ought to be more collaboration well yeah there ought to be more collaboration I agree with you um because\nWho doesn't want collaboration right who doesn't want to work together I mean I Know I Do I Know my colleagues do but ... using the ... example\nWe found out about that we had no idea that was happening we found out about it by happenstance a because there was a legal out on a fax machine at the one soccer call we've got a call about it\nAnd when you come right down to what what was done was and I used the word it was fraudulent and we brought that forward you can't\nMake an assertion to a judge in a complaint and the superior court that you want a judge to rule on that's false I mean I as an attorney I as a member of the\nSimply can't do that and I wouldn't do that um and that's what happened\nAnd so you know we talk about collaboration in the city and we talk about being watched dogs you know when you have to spend all your time being that watch dog and and trying to peel back the onion and trying to figure out what's\nWatch dog and and trying to peel back the onion and trying to figure out what's really going on and learning about what's happening in the city\nFrom the newspaper or from a press release um it makes the job more difficult look where where when socket city counselors this is not the United States Senate\nThis isn't complicated um I think we should be able to have a well oiled machine a functioning municipal government\nAll working towards a common goal uh obviously we all would like that but yes are there are times when we have to serve his watchdogs and say hey\nYou can't do that that's illegal that's against the charter that simply against the law yes it is unfortunately when you do that when you actually do your job you're criticized as being negative or your credit criticized as being political\nI don't look at it like that in at all I look at it as I was elected to do a job and I'm going to do it and um if I didn't have to say or do those things if I wasn't forced into that position that I wouldn't be so sometimes you know where where the uh with the victims of of our own of our own\nActions so I'm gonna take two more issues are in this category and I'm going to mention them and then you can pick up on them or you can just say yeah you're right Roger and let's go on to that I have noticed as a taxpayer was um\nCommunity development block grants I always saw a community development block grants coming out as money given to us by the federal government our own money to be used\nA locally and we would get a recommendation from the mayor of them we might have an advisory committee but the consulate in the end would determine what happened there looked like a that um that uh authority or that stripped away from the council or at least\nA tried to get stripped away and the other one is the most recent one of those those are listening I was looking for soundbites in the news and and I used one with Jim can all year round the ratification of the the police are are reopening claws but while I was listening to what I heard John brie and talking about\nWhen are we going to start purchasing houses in the city of one socket or a properties in the city one sock it won't going to have uh some uh some workshop sessions to find out what we're buying how come we're we're getting these uh purchasing sales executed agreements and was opposed a rubber stamp that\nThose are two things that pop out as just the taxpayer you with your comment or we can move on\nI think they both go down a\nUnder the category of of transparency and I have an open honest transparent government or\nThere is communication and there is collaboration so just not to stay on the boring subject of community development block grants but\nDirector ... themselves settle for the last twenty eight years the way it's been done Roger is that you have um proposed community development block grants by the administration as a public hearing their recommendations to the council ultimately the council votes on those and then we move on\nFor the first time in twenty eight years this year that didn't happen we were told that no communities were doing that anymore that's why they changed the way they did things this year\nThat's false I did some research and found out in ... they did exactly what\nWe did last year a which is the process I just described\nSo one can only surmise that\nLast year we took the community development block grants we amended them we ensured that some money went to senior services which is a very worthy cause and and a much needed cause here in the city\nThat has been a point of um of political strife\nBetween the the board of directors of senior services especially the the head of the board of directors and\nAnd the mayor and so this year the community development block grant process was completely circumvent that around the council and we were told oh that's just a matter of course no one's doing that anymore\nThose are the types of things that we have to point out and and and we have to ... vigilant about and say hey that's not right so when people\nSay they weren't collaboration yeah I agree with them we weren't collaboration too and that's no way to run a city um as for the properties I voted against the acquisition of one Seventy nine river street because that just came before us and it was at a meeting and it was\nHey we're going to purchase one Seventy nine rivers street for Seventy nine thousand nine hundred dollars because we're going to buy it and so usually we have a work session and we have\nPictures and we have maps and we have discussions as to why were purchasing this and um\nNone of that happened and I have a problem with that I have a problem with with things being foisted upon us out of city council meeting or just because and spending close to eighty thousand dollars in tax payer money because I said at that meeting and I'll say it again\nIt seems to me that the one socket real estate investment fund a\nThe agency is getting a portfolio is getting bigger and bigger the city seems to be acquiring more and more property a spending more and more taxpayer money\nAnd I'm not really sure why I'm not really sure what the endgame is I'm not really sure what the vision is all I Know as\nWe've purchased and taken title to a large number of properties and I want some clarification and some briefing and some communication as to why\nWhat do we intend to do about this because what I don't want is to be told later on\nOh you know this developers coming in and this is what we're doing now you have to vote on it no that's not how again how government works\nThere are two branches of government and ultimately the legislative will approve but we can't do that operating in the dark and so again we want collaboration we want open honest and transparent government and frankly Roger I Want to do\nPublic business or in public and I think that's really been a hallmark of the last two years\nNext topic I'd like to bring up is a gutsy topic I I'm not quite sure why you did it a big problem because you are you had constituents who are responding to it but everybody has tried to tackle\nWaste water sewage treatment plant slashed center grow or reverse it was Ninety ten maybe one fifty fifty ones forty a but it's\nOh has Roger ... got the job done over the years in the Senate\nRoger knows who to

constituents sort of carried their agenda to the general assembly for consideration as a lifelong resident Roger result they're attending functions and meeting people person and then\nHe listens

I graduated from law Rhode Island college in Nineteen Seventy two ... got a master's degree in teaching in Nineteen Seventy eight\nI started teaching in the ... school system at the old middle school which that's what they call it now in Nineteen Seventy two\nAnd I stayed there until two thousand and four so that's thirty two years I was a science teacher at the ... middle school so a lot of people kind of know my name\nMhm but I had missed too hard but I Can't remember what I had him\nFor that that's exactly correct or I remember him but the memories that kind of vague they have been mixed up with somebody else but because it's been a while I've been out of the F mhm\nBut you know what it's like to be in a classroom\nOh definitely ... and when I ended my career in the ... I got a job at another school called the Providence into school\nWhich is a school for behavior disorder in children and emotionally disturbed children and there was only one catch the getting this job I had to go back to school to be certified for special education mhm\nSo I went back to school part time and I got a certification for special ed while I was at the school I stayed here at that school for ten years\nNow I understand Donald that is the toughest teaching assignment you can get because you know when we talk about the school says I understand the me please correct me if I'm just a layman when it comes to this but this is one let's say a kid is in was August school and the behavior and the special needs that child is so much so\nThat they have to actually take the child out of the local school system and bring them somewhere else is that the kind of job you had\nThat's the kind of job I had exactly ah we had some kids from one socket not too many ... over the ten years that I was there there were a few kids from one socket who came through but for the most part it was kids from Providence Central Falls east Providence all around the Providence area mostly\nAnd they came there because uh\nThey're regular schools couldn't meet their needs for whatever reason they couldn't eat that needs so they sent them to the problem is that the school so we worked with them there while I was there when I first started I was the only teacher for the high school\nAnd was kind of unusual because two teachers that quit just before I started so I was the only teacher teaching all the subjects\nThe other part of the prominent sent the school which I had never done before is a vocational piece these kids were going out into the community working a different workplaces\nOr once a week and I would have to go out once a week with them to monitor what they were doing on the job site and you know to keep them on tasks\nDonald hum as we get close to the un here here's here's a toughie one so first of all I admire and\nThe the toughie one so first of all I admire anybody who runs for public office\nThen I look at this group of candidates the ... food because it's just so unsealed none of you need this job meaning that\nThat your retired right along retired and um and so who needs to come back into a into the obligations of being at those meetings and going to all meeting all these administrators so\nWhat made Donald ... uh come full wood and get into the elected you know running electric does you got to do radio shows and brochures and stuff like that what\nIs it while you're doing it why am I doing it well it's because I really think with all the experience that I've had in the schools as a teacher\nAt a special ed teacher I have something to offer and retirement it wasn't being offered any way I so I think this will be a give me an opportunity to offer some insight into\nSchool committee work policy work when they stop putting things together I can always say you know I remember this and this might work better so I think I have some insights into that I couldn't\nThink of anybody that or should be on the school committee you more than somebody who once was in her classroom a and B was in a classroom with a with these kids are that you were in Providence a I think you I think I Know I think you know what you're getting into and I think you want to get into it but\nI Do and you know you say that but it's very rewarding because I remember as part of my duties at the province sent the school there was another program that started maybe five years after I got there called the anchor learning academy mhm an ankle learning academy was a\nThat was a program where the causes were all given online so the kids would just sit there at the computer and\nDo their thing online and they would get credit for the costs as they would take\nAnd while I was a ... this was for kids who had addiction problems yeah\nSo I did have a student who I knew from the ... the city yes come in and I was really happy because his parents came in on the parents visiting night that I attended ... his mother recognize me from the middle school\nAnd she said oh gee I remember you and you know we reminisced a little bit about who was within what classroom and things like that\nAnd eventually I ended up helping this guy make it through his chemistry class even though it's on line you still need help ... to ... to explain this\nYou know what was going on but eventually he made it and he graduated he was the only graduate from the school that that yeah because they will only five or six kids\nBut he made he graduated he was so appreciative\nFor everything that we did for him at the school not just myself but the other teachers too it was really nice to see Donald\n... a sincere you can tell that by the tone of his voice experienced you can tell that by a listening to let a resume and I'm just wanting to to do the job to help people we wish you

district twenty four I was born and raised here in northern Rhode Island I spend a few years living across the country and I decided to move back to my home state\nTo be closer to my family after moving back I had a strong desire to serve my community and in twenty Thirteen I decided to run for city council\nI'm currently serving my second term on the council and um although I Am relatively new to politics I'm I'm not a career politician by any sense of the means but um I Am the only candidate with legislative experience\nSo others when socket city councilor I've proven record of being fiscally responsible pro business and also deeply involved in my community I supported budget that have reduced property taxes\nThat have made Ki investments that resulted in long term savings for the city and improve the quality of life of residents I also sponsored it'll supported legislation that lowered or eliminated fees and regulations on businesses and generated opportunities for local businesses artists and entrepreneur\nAnd as your state senator I Will bring these priorities from my city council experience to olive district twice for\nSome of my legislative priorities are to fight for all of Rhode Island's working families to protect and strengthen the programs that help seniors afford their medication and enable them to remain self sufficient to honor our veterans and their families by advocating for programs that address their specific needs\nUm also this is a really important to me and that is to work his strength and mental health addiction and recovery programs to help and one sockets opioid crisis and also to support small businesses by eliminating redundancy barriers and red tape so\nThat would help them to expand and in turn grow our local economy ah education equality is also very important to me and providing educational equality and opportunity for both children and adults\nI currently serve as vice chair of the downtown socket collaborative I'm a member of the board of directors of community care alliance\nI Am a member of the main street holiday stroke committee a member of the one socket Lebanon ... concert serious and I'm also a member I'm also the vice chair of the one socket democratic today committee and obviously I Am running as a Democrat I Believe that\nBeing an elected official means more than just showing up for meeting or legislative sessions it also means making the time to engage with the community so whether it's working on a nonprofit boards\nOf volunteering at community functions coordinating community events or promoting our small businesses I've always been deeply involved in our community and I respectfully ask for your vote on November sex\nAll right thank you Melissa Mari or what was going to do now is move into a few rounds of a discussion on it we will ah have all three candidates address each other in the preview nice of free flowing conversation I'll just keep in mind that will be moderating it just makes sure Titus\nOf monopolized in any direction a will will start each discussion round moving down to one two three number chain or reject garbage you'll be the first one to speak on this issue a\nThat you you you folks are will will moderate discussion a these are all things into either a ... have been dealt with could come back issues that will relate to a vote that could be taken as a state senator here in Rhode Island or\nOf the forefront topics that are in the coffee shops on the streets in people's mind as a state and as a city especially right now with what is happening or in the coming up towards the country or last night it was brought up in\nProvidence mayor all old debate we'll be talking about ... very cities are\nUndocumented immigrants are coming into the ocean state um and\nAs a state senator your views on any legislation that would either prohibit or protect a cities in the state of Rhode Island from being orders deemed sanctuary cities um era laws or last night made it clear that uh\nAny uh any of those the immigrants coming up through Mexico would be more than welcome in Providence as a state senator or you may be on the table to vote on legislation again either protecting or preventing communities from becoming sanctuary cities rich guarantee a the discussion is yours\nFirst off of the term\nImmigrants off of people that come to this country illegally\nThe folks that are here the weather and discussion of illegal aliens not illegal immigrants they've already broken the law by coming to this country illegally without going through the due process by opponent overhear Melissa she possibly a\nI say just because she's a Democrat she's following the rule of thumb with the Democratic party here in the say so\nThe mayor down in Providence is probably in the same bug ballpark to choose and as far as uh allowing each and every person who decides they want to come to this country and I have nothing against anybody want to come here most of us Wallace I should say have relatives that have come here\nIllegally they migrated to this country went through the due process where we have in this ... what we have\nCurrently the problem that we have in this country is the politically correct incorrect attitudes for Jamie too how do we describe the people that are coming to your son like the migration of these folks that are going to try to come over the border [noise]\nI mean that's that summit in an attempt to\nDisrupt our way of life I mean it takes on hold moved on demographic objectivity of as to what we're all about in this country how do we how do we solve a situation like that we have to close the borders of to not allow these folks that come in here unless they go through the due process\nAnd again you have a choice you continue voting for the Democrats in the state and you're going to have sanctuary cities and what's sanctuary cities you're going to have a number of problems that are going to prevail within because the folks that are coming here we don't know\nThey're going to prevail within because of the folks that are coming here we won't know what's it like we don't know who they are we don't know what's her background so to find them to get to find a vested this of who they are\nWe have to go through a due process and by having them come and think that they have the right to come into this country without going through the laws of the rules and regulations of due process to become an American citizen or even a legal\nImmigrant is one thing for fleas when people start telling me falls to undocumented immigrants they are not undocumented immigrants they illegal aliens\nPlus your your opponent assumption your stats are\nA lot and I think well you speak just to start off I think that it's really important to not make those kind of assumptions that you know we're all here together for the first time\nAnd also um I have noticed that um my opponent um have bench for referring to me as a my opponent but I think that it's also really important to recognize that there are for this is a far way race um and there is no incumbent so I'm just think that it's best to keep that in mind [noise]\nUm so we are very very fortunate all of us are extremely fortunate to have been born in this wonderful country um we have freedom set up ... many people I don't enjoy and we are we should be thankful for that every every single day [noise] um I think that it is very um\nYou ... ... people with a with a broad brush and\nI think you should be careful doing not I think that people who are undocumented and I have lived in many states all over the country um\nComes here seeking refuge because the temptations in their countries are so terrible that they are willing to take their children and travel through the desert for travel thousands of miles um I think that there should be a proper vetting process in place\nHow we do that how we funded how we um\n[noise] ah appoint people to do that is a question that I don't think anyone of us can answer but I think that law abiding hardworking citizens deserve a path to citizenship the current path to citizenship as long as it's um it's expensive\nAnd um and it's difficult\nUm I think that we shouldn't be separating children from their families I don't even think that's a partisan issue I think that that's something that we can all agree on on but we have to find a way to create a path to citizenship for people who are hardworking who abide by the rules and who deserve\n...\nOpinion on this issue more when you get\nTo the sanctuary cities um\nThat is a decision made by the mayor and city councils\nAnd if the people in that district they're not happy with that decision they can vote them out that's what this is about ... is voting and um I have mixed feelings about it I Know that if I Lived in a country where I had to fear for the life of my children that they would be sold as sex slaves by a\nGroup of drug dealing of gangs I Would do everything I could get my kids out of there and if it if it was a pay if it if it was a ... in fear of of life of my children and myself I Would go anyway I had\nAnd then the interim oh well I'm Sorry that former law enforcement officer is not entitled to have a weapon to go on the school campus I that's just absolutely ridiculous such we've done it I mean it's like I mean you you have banks that have guts you have all types of facilities that have protections Gillette Stadium\nThey have security there\nBut yet we can't have law enforcement officers you into schools funny campus on this in the state of Rhode\nIsland at any given time because the governor to use that\nLow because a lot full time of\nThe law enforcement officers any longer they carry a blue ... been invested in the background checks and information that\nAs I Would carry with them to try I Would carry weapons and things like that and I should have the opportunity to travel anywhere not only in this state but in this country if I so desire and carry weapons to seal the lungs are all\nOr\nAny of the other candidates are all in the room or want to make another comment on this topic before we do move on because uh yeah they want to get that opportunity um if you just do it again those folks you're listening to a\nMilitia Margaret you guarantee Glenn discipline three to four candidates running in district twenty fours and his whole race representing one socket and north Smithfield and I want to thank all of you for coming in today for us to take it out I didn't expect to do that as ... and they all\nWere less common and if I may say what you what is it which is this was all the shootings that we have seen God Forbid experienced in our country over the years [noise] just give me one example for spelling and individuals\nWell the years [noise] just give me one example for spending an individual lesson and I\nOwners time into a legitimate gun owners [noise] the guy in Vegas [noise]\nThe guy at the Vegas shooting at the uh uh the guy had a country music concert guy legal going with Joan ... yeah\nRight uh we're going to move on to another topic for some this is high on the list of marijuana legislation gets there was a pond and they are a little bit of liberty for the candidates here and there are a minority or not accused [noise]\nAnd er it is I ... I Believe in July ... officially become decriminalize they're moving into retail is very slow process very methodical here on a\nWarning the retail licenses and then individual communities are through the legislation in Massachusetts have the right to whether or not to vote to accept a retail within their community um\nThey've set their tax brackets on marijuana and it is the process is rolling out another upon by the way on the ... law on marijuana\nIsland it's been banned it around it's been put into committees never made it to a ... vote yet but now with the retail pushing Massachusetts other states getting on the criminal Asia decriminalization obviously what happens is right over the border in Canada as well\nUh it's just a matter of time as a state senator Harry in Rhode Island and I also want to point out last year or that there was a bill\nThat was passed and it was probably the largest license increase I've ever I've ever seen come out of the state of Rhode Island and what was interesting about this is when it was brought up for discussion I didn't hear one person said no which tells you the revenue\nThat is in this world uh the bill that required out\nA ... that rose to license for medical marijuana licenses from five thousand dollars to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars from five thousand and two hundred and fifty thousand dollars and everybody said okay you go on a patch unanimously uh\nJust about the game was excuse me so your thoughts are we see that type of revenue that there must be just on a medical marijuana side or we know the economics in this day Rhode Island ah we like to find new sources of revenue\nMarijuana comes in front of you as a state senator or for decriminalization and retail sales are what are your thoughts in position on that long ago star regret those blonde them down the road road Richie ... summary run the floors yours\nThe decriminalization or we can this country have people who are in jail because they had possession of marijuana I mean we had drunk drivers who were killed people in a you know and they're not in jail if you look at that that that doesn't make any reality whatsoever if you look at the free compassion in San jose having a state of Rhode Island\nI Love to know what kind of revenue generating as a curiosity I sat\nNext to the one near the ... us BS down Providence the lion outside that building was astronomical\nAnd I'm thinking wow there's a lot of people going in their buying it legally apparently and you wonder how much of that going on and there was actually used by them and not by someone who's not properly or getting it legally\nI'm ... I'd like to know who sits on the director of boards of those free compassion center that'd be curious to know the names on those and see who actually has a\nRevenue in it and who's opposing a legalizing it here in Rhode\nIsland [noise] a massive like you said Massachusetts has Colorado California all the states and the revenue generating is astronomical [noise] uh\nMassachusetts now the people who\nCurrently using these centers in Providence will just cross the border and go by in Massachusetts so there's the sales taxes and I don't [noise] I I Would think that based on the history of of a no prohibition and alcohol\nThat it generated crime to generate the the illegal a sales of alcohol throughout the country that was funded the mob is up in the morning every giant Chicago and rather than US cities in the world [noise] I I mean in the country I think that uh legalize it should be put on the ballot for the voters to make that decision\nAnd it should be the voters to make that decision is like term limits I mean I should be on the ballot for our for our voters to make the decision\nAnd and that's what I Believe I think it should be up to the voters ...\nWell [noise] scares me being a former law enforcement officer in California and having been in wars with them pretty military police department and colonel investigation and the marine corps\nAh I was a drug busts or so I have mixed feelings of\nI'm not opposed to the probability and the possibility possibility probability of marijuana becoming legalized here in the states throughout the country but I think that in the study as to the quality the quantity late advantageous there's of what marijuana\nIts purpose is medically\nAs something that I think you should be research if I'm sitting on the Senate seat in the state I Would have to do that type of research before I Would give her ... or ... with regards to to be is becoming legal short the money issue oh yeah by the way it's always a money issue I'm tied All right fine I I can go along with that [noise]\nBut before you get to that venue [noise]\nI think the seriousness has to be looked at [noise] I'm not against a\nA you know a prohibition of the government stepping in demanding and telling us how we should do what we should do it all so we should do it any given time and it's and that's part of the reason why I jumped into the mix both of his political\nOf situation is because I'm tired of the government's really telling them what to do oh we're going to legislate new laws and rules regulations and this that and the other thing is the public wants to the demand of the public is they're sending initiative on behalf of each and every person as a political\nOr ... not a candidate but above political interest was obese state or\nState federal or\nOut then it's their position to grant that to the public because the public's demand is there for that so what I'd be in favor of the the marijuana\nRatio absolutely but again only throw the background searching a\nOf what we're looking at before we make yourself\nWith your research include product testing absolutely our identity document that Melissa Marie are your thoughts on this subject much I'm not going to sound like on [laughter] [laughter] it's a full disclosure\nI'm I Am one of the sponsors of the ordinance that allows medical marijuana cultivation here in the city on socket until you can probably guess my stance on ...\nOn the cost of incarceration me that fiscal cost\nThe social cost of incarceration is a huge expense an absolutely have to be considered when you talk about this issue you know I'm as messages on state and we have people who are incarcerated for discussion of marijuana and people who\nUm who can make far greater crime who are are jailed for laugh and I that really needs to change we know that\nUm there are many many people who use marijuana for physical ailments I'm both a fist\nToo many people who use marijuana for physical ailments um both physical and mental um anxiety it can be used to help a combat P. T. S. D. um and so\nWith other states going in that direction and people generally in this state being um being in favor of that what we don't want to do is be left behind we don't want people going over into Massachusetts and and when we could create that revenue ... not just for our state\nBut also far municipalities that um that may health centers\n... union person my entire life I grew up in the union home my dad sat there and said the ... the roof over your head and the food on your plate was because of my union wages [noise]\nI've I've learned when I was young I was engaged by a man called Chuck Schwartz people may not know trucks bus was church which got me to join a round workers association and began organizing the truck load is where I work at a at a factory here in the city [noise] I\nI've been a union person my entire life I fought on Ben I'm picket lines my entire life I taught history of that uh there was no union when I went to work for the city hall here we we formed a union there [noise]\nUm contracts were important you have to sit and negotiate I've sat negotiating contracts I worked at all I've been a labor board hearings I've been at a a\nIn my entire life fighting for for family working families this administration right now who\nAs treasure governor took up pension funds put it in high risk hedge funds or the leadership here voted to cut pensions and remove ... from the from the janitors but yet gave the judges a hundred percent of the days with coal is still going on today [noise]\nUm this is what's been running the state\nYou we have a redundancy in management throughout state government it was done by the single report on the ... the uh showed there'd be done to see a management and I work on a floor we had six bosses for twenty two people make and a half a million in salary\nRight now under among those just sort of ministry of officers a hundred and twenty three people making over a hundred thousand dollars an hour over twenty four million dollars for those hundred twenty three people\nThere and and you had the Bush tax cuts that hurt the states you had could Sherry double those tax cuts that that's the made it a public school\nTeachers are not free daycare centers hardworking people they have to deal with with a language barrier to deal with violence in the classrooms and they're blamed for every problem\nContracts were important the city needs to recognize a contract that need to negotiate contracts and my my son is a teacher in Providence and and if you have been less you're where the shoes are these people and stand in that\nAnd see what they go through you should not in any way not want to work for a contract with them and one socket dishes for one uh one of the lowest paid ones on the list if you look at the list of of tape of teachers payments wrote the Seder around\nWhen soccer's among the lowest one and we have one of the hottest barriers for these teachers to work in and and the school and the school system here [noise] um yeah\nI contracts need to be negotiated and there should be anything that puts a contract on her for any period of time that needs to be negotiated and it should be respectful of the people who\nWorking families will pay the bills to pay the taxes every municipal state worker public employee they all pay taxes they all political pension system mandated at eight and three quarter percent of their salary will now is we have a governor giving away forty thousand dollars every one leaves destabilizing up pension system again\nThat will affect everybody who's in that pension system and if you want to continue with this this is the Democratic party run in the state but decades now this is what you got going on here for a swine run independent I used to be a Democrat they're not Democrats anymore\nI'm Sorry but but we need to we need to we need to honor contracts\nAnd I've I've done contract writing I when we had I sat there for all the processes and it's not an easy thing to do\nSo as a state senator you going to vote to override that veto of a of the governor EA I Would override that veto ... that was Richard ... by the way yes Melissa Marie yes\nAbsolutely going to say about absolutely you know there was one other veto and this really bothered me last year I noticed piece of legislation was banned that about two years ago and I\nI'm just outraged that hasn't done yet I'm probably not going to be as long as he has this one this was her first first veto last year on what was called The Revenge porn they'll ah and I'm sure none of you I could see the blank expression is porn is explicit material or\nIt'd be it'd be a photograph of her video or something of that nature of this bill this legislation would've criminalized posting nude pictures online with out the consent of the person in the photo\nThey've probably just get posted often times by ... spouses our partners trying to embarrass we'll get some sort of ...\nOftentimes by X spouses or partners trying to embarrass her kids some sort of revenge on that person a governor vetoed it said this bill she says is unconstitutional won't stand up under scrutiny in the courts\nWell what about the rights of that person being violated in the picture I'm uh in my goodness I I lost my order as it was the first I didn't know how to be upset on his way up but the issue is\nA great the belt letter fall out of the road maybe with the Supreme Court is unconstitutional but as a basic issue we're protecting what is called free speech\nVersus also protecting the victim that is a that is in this picture\nYeah and that and that's a very um difficult balance to achieve you always want to make sure as a legislator when you pass legislation that you get those legal opinions um because you don't want to do with as pass something that is going to be ruled ... unconstitutional um but [noise]\nI think it's just it's so unfortunate that this happens I'm In this digital age and this age of I'm a social media and you know cell phones that can take pictures and\nThings go viral very quickly and that's wrong and it's unfair and it um it a lot of times it mostly\nHappens to women and um and they become victimized and embarrassed and I I think we saw um this happened or even in our own state Senate who just recently where there was a senator that I'm floating around pictures of a of an ax and\nUm it really ah I I Can't imagine how that would impact somebody's life um and there needs to be protections put in place for people um to heal this has happened\nHow we do that legislatively um I Would have to to read that bill I I admit that I have not but um you know we always need to be very careful to balance out of people's rights to free speech um but we also need to protect people that are victimized\nWhen just when you have an opinion on this [noise]\n[noise] I'm a\nI ... yeah or you have to protect people's personal life needs to be protected people do have the right\nTo do things but when you're hurting people attacking people I think you really need to look at that perspective on it and\nThey should be people's personal lives should be protected and and that's part of a a a\nOf our country I mean it it it's hard for me to see today as a whole different world with the way things are out there public and stuff and the information that's out there people can make fake pictures you could I could you could put a\nMy head on some guy's body naked and put her out there I mean that they did is this such ability to do things today that really needs to be regulated in some respects than a person is\nPrivate life needs to be protected [noise] um but you also have to make sure someone has the right or for their uh their amendments who was able to\nSay things but not when you're attacking people and hurting people but that's been the the core things from our country right now which is creating a civil war is this battle in these attacks in this in the stuff that's out there it's just a horrendous and a lot of it has to do with the with what's out there for the public can see the ...\nWe need to protect the person's rights\nProject Arabic boy I'm just picturing myself for new picture of me on the Internet for gosh\nScary [laughter]\nOh gosh anyway yeah this is a serious issue um I have to reflect back to you know society dictates ... before we are as a person as persons as people\nAs human beings and and things like that and it also filters over into the military [noise]\nThe middle of as I read my Marine Corps times every other week in the new issues that come out they've had an ongoing problem with the uh the listen pictures that are being put on the Internet and things like that and for every person that does that\nThey're automatically discharged from the United states military forces with a dishonorable discharge\nSo playing around there's no ... administrative separation those slap on the wrist don't do it again but by and that's it and that pertains to both the photos that are on the Internet for females that are in the military as well as the meals things like that and rightly so yes we have freedoms in this country\nBut not at the expense of other people that all whatsoever your personal body your personal\nPerson itself is not to be infringed upon by anybody and so strong legislation to take these ah these sloppy people when to incarcerate them except be the case why not vote for the\nOther comment on this ... under next topic\nI I just would like to follow to say that yes this is a this is an issue and not just on a state issue about a national level you know what we're trying to find that balance between um freedom of speech and protecting\nUm people who are being impacted by the many hurtful and hateful quite frankly things that are um that are\nI think uh I think the candidates because we are over time and I appreciate your patience\nOr one the other issue and then a quick yes or no and closing comments and I thank you for your patience but it's been such great discussion ... and I appreciate your time and your thoughts are this is a horrible if candidates for the Senate district twenty four hour\nRaise if you're just tuning in represents when socket north Smithfield Glenn disciplined Richard Gere be Melissa Marie in Studio ... my name's Jeff ... and they have been a discussing issues facing the state of Rhode\nIsland for just over an hour now as a as a state senator supporting any legislation that would bring the power plant or invent energy into borrow bill uh we started going to do some damage Gabby Melissa Marie\nThere was thirty five communities who did a resolution to not\nThat power when it's thirty five the N and an advantage eat company went to the is called the environmental I\nWrote this town alleges you brought us off mic they ah they brought they had this company is called an energy facility sitting board as such some three people free people appointed by the governor's office\nThey voted to suppress the opposition rough around a resolution from thirty five cities and towns\nWhat does that tell me that tells me that we have a a corporation looking to control our state what kind of control our communities at the opposition of the people will do not want to and I think that needs to be looked at\nThey do they will you be using fracking gas shipped up from Pennsylvania they will be using diesel fuel they do need water and they're going to take it out of whether it's ... whether it's John someone soccer whatever they do take water out of our water system\nPipelines are known to leak methane gas to water districts or where the pipelines Ron have an excess of Seventy percent high of methane in the water table this is something that people do not want\nTo and this this needs to be a\nAm definitely against that because the people do not want to\nThey go and there's a lot of Richard ...\nWhere we do we do need power plants and uh so where do we build up I don't want them in my backyard and I know the folks some Bozo in that area they don't want to live back yard I may be wrong and if I Am a\nCorrect me on this ... militia you were in favor of selling water to that particular interest a very ... I'm not sure [noise]\nI yeah I I Will speak to that vote adult lifetime colored hair but\nAgain or if we're going to build coal plants to offset the ones that are becoming ancient and a dysfunctional than we should do it away from the communities in which they want to supply the or the power to the electric\nSource to or not right near downtown not right in your backyard and things like that so if there is a problem\nThen they can try to correct that problem if you go back some years ago you had that three Mile Island situations that occur and look at the ... the the the problem that they had with that and so forth so again building power plants whether there's no ... no ...\nOr generic is fine but it has to be a process in where it is conduct where they build these ... these plants of the most sensual interest to any ... any of us that live within the community where they're considering wanting to build Melissa Marie\nSo we we know that climate change access um we know that Israel and that it's a threat to coastal communities like Rhode Island\nUm and it's the responsibility of leaders on all levels government to consider legislation that encourages renewable energy whether that be um solar wind but also to give careful consideration given to wildlife angry in space particularly when you when you talk about solar panels\nUm will not vote to sell water came before the city council admitted to the things that I care very deeply about against each other one is the environment and the other was the fiscal health instability of the city that I Love um it was a very tough decision at the time I saw that the plant and I saw the plant as inevitable\nAnd I believe that we would get all of the negative aspects of the plant and have nothing to show for it um I also factored in the fact that we're building a new water treatment plant and I had concerns that the water bills would rise but he already overburdened taxpayers that get their water from this plant\n'em [noise] and that those bills would increase so\nThere was Eighteen million dollars of revenue I'm On the table for the city of one talking to consider\nUm I did vote in favor and ultimately that vote did fail and\nAgain that was a that was a really difficult position because it pitted two things that I care very deeply about 'em I both say that as a city councilor I did sponsor and support legislation that implemented infrastructure upgrades that made I mean that's build buildings including city hall and\nOur library um more environmentally friendly inefficient and that was also help to decrease our our bills here in the city I also sponsor legislation to encourage adaptive reuse\nOf old buildings because I I recognize that they the greenest buildings are the ones that are already banned belt [noise] um so you know I care very much about the environment um I as a candidate have taken a no fossil fuel pledge um along with our elected officials and the state that are running for state office\nMay follow up have you ever won the last topic to get to\nI have solar panels on my house [laughter]\nOf this uh this could be a a\nRelatively brief point your truck tolls of course are in operation here in Rhode Island that has been settled but when that legislation came up uh there were two discussions one business friendly\nNature of taxing trolls come out the ... apparently trucks are trying to rush to question the cars you guys have been so patients are totally trucks coming through the ocean state or a and the other discussion which is interesting by the constituents concern is it's only a matter of time\nBefore they start doing commercial vi I'm residential vehicles cars citizens in Rhode Island as a state senator what'd you stand up against totally\nCars and that is the question I Believe we're starting with Richard ... and it was one don't fight over it\nBut there's a lot of rich Gary Melissa Marie run you'll speak for a while I ended up and fight against cars are tall gardens\nI cannot travel and to Massachusetts Connecticut [noise]\nNew Hampshire and not pay a toll [noise] all those states have told [noise] I have to pay him when I go through their state [noise]\nShould we have tolls if is going to generate income just not going into a general fun and it's going to go back to us calls or something back to ... uh our communities\nI Would consider that to be a a good idea um unfortunately you couldn't do a system where the ... went through it wouldn't get build a forum or stay\nFrom where the ... went through it wouldn't get billed as foreign artist they played would a fortune you can't do that because if the federal highway so you're not allowed to do that I Would love to have a toll where if it round play when for what does it get charged for anyone else's point Doug you have to pay in every state you read this you mean Rhode Island you're gonna pay poll I don't care where you go\nIn Connecticut Massachusetts and New Hampshire not pay bills\nAnd a whip paying the taxpayers are paying for all these highway ... road repairs and reconstruction is all prevailing wage rates is a dollar and that's all your tax money what I Do appreciate was here locally in the city was the mayor is a paving the uh the roads are an in house\nThat saved the city tons of money as opposed to having like cottage construction with these company to the roadways\nAnd it just seems such a difference in the in the ... and the roads just here in the city\nBut when you get into the federal aspect of it we need do need to generate the toll toll money or\nDon't want I I Know everyone is opposed to it 'cause nobody likes to pay tolls nobody does but we all pay it soon as you leave the state you're gonna pay tolls British therapy\n... he's half right about that or if you don't go on the turnpike in Massachusetts polio the highways up they're afraid\nYou don't have to pay you go to Ninety five ... there's no tow tax on that um swimming if we have two Ninety five down here queen atoll Mondo would have that told also [laughter] and if you don't think that one forty six was the next thing that's going to be told\nI got news for you they'll have that ... one forty six also in the state of Rhode\nIsland is a didn't proud of that eventually somewhere down the road that you will see attacks are on those of us that are just driving up and down the road ways of ah Rhode Island absolutely and I digress back one reason other my my thought is that way [noise] when's the last time you went to a\nBeach or steak beach and everything that you get in for free you have to pay to go to the beach with the ocean steak but the residents in Rhode Island have to pay attached to go to the beaches that should be free to each and every one of us\nSo where's it going to stop every time you turn around the Democrats are doing it again they're thrown at you and therefore goes the reason why I stepped into the ring because you know what I'm tired of the same old same old with a democratic rule in the state\nAnd the excuses are\nJust ongoing all the time when you just go to do this we just do this for what your finances in order to\nGet your your your your stuff straightened out and then once we get everything straightened out then we consider going on and doing other things like we need to add a certain tax increase on us or anything we go ahead and do it but taxing the vehicles that come through the state that bring us the commerce from the products that we all purchase\nInformation and I spoke to foreign minister\nSaudi Arabia\nTwo

old [noise] um but um\nThe other things regarding the fourteenth amendment yes President Trump\nI don't know if I can do by executive order anything to affect the fourteenth amendment I think he can but I'm not sure how\nWell the fact is the problem has is the same prime problem when Obama did he can do what he's doing but when they get to the Supreme Court\nThey're going to kick it back they won't back down at a high because he didn't as standing that senior I'm trying to think of any immigration was something Obama did\nThat and then he did he by executive order DACA DACA inning toward back or they didn't even they wouldn't accept it no ...\nNo doctors bent costs doctors but except that all the way up to the circus court of appeals in San Francisco to vote yes they threw a Trump she'll be all on that out that's waiting to go to the Supreme Court John that's been approved by every caught all the way to the circus\nDoctors don't avail\nRemember most about another issue what Obama\nI don't know but I think that talking about that one because even Obama said that\nIt was unconstitutional they did it anyway but the point I Want to make is\nI don't know if President Trump go to not now [noise] I listen to ... which I listen to truly are both very liberal highly highly intelligent or legal minds\nAnd they both said the same thing he can do whatever he wants to do whether pass muster or not would it would go to the Supreme Court the best way to do it is the way that Graham wants to do it in the Senate because\nJust like the second amendment asked restrictions\nThe fourteenth amendment could have restrictions [laughter] that would be up to Congress how Congress could pass a restriction whatever restrictions they want on it they could ask restriction stipulating that you have to be\nIn the jurisdiction of citizenship or a green card or you know what I mean in America for your child to be a citizen\nThey could do that in Congress because you are the restricting the amendment you wouldn't be it wouldn't be changing it does get rid of it you'll see like gun control ... you'll have a restrictions on guns\nThat they would do it like a Congress could be able to do the exact same thing with the constitutional\nWell somebody said yesterday about on they're not they're not on if they were United States citizens or on Amazon if they're under the jurisdiction they be able to be drafted but women don't we don't draft women are dropped anybody\nKnow but uh but if we if the draft was if the draft was a I guess is the draft came back I guess women would be included yes and and that is legal lady would not be drafted\n'cause you're not under the jurisdiction of the United states that's what I that's one of the arguments professors are doing Jonathan Turley said both sides have a good argument that's right so what do you throw the ... out the window\nNow he just said it would be more much more difficult for President Trump to obtain what he's trying to do with an executive order\nWhere are you ... you're going to Congress doesn't want to do anything\nAbove ... hopefully but you're absolutely correct but look at look at what the ding dong I'll tell you the establishment Republicans the sooner they get the hell out the better off all the uh I'm a speaker\nThat is the sooner they get the hell out the better off all the uh I'm a

goodness\nThey it's a terrible situation we have the media who it is\nFor them to just sit I Would love if I owned Fox News I Would put these two clown NSMBC on this on the program on one side saying that and on the other side film footage all of these people walking up towards the country the hypocrisy is amazing to me\nOr the caravan by the way\nThe last report I ...

them want to go to Tijuana 'cause they want to get to California\n\nThat was what I heard earlier this morning and there is another hour and coming up behind them [noise]\n\nHuh that that's what I heard earlier this morning\nAnd they asked they interviewed some of the people after they had heard about President Trump putting a military on the border and I said no to it then heard anything about it oh and they do have again according to a reporter this morning six number committee\nThat is now leading the caravan\nAnd talking about the second caravan that's coming up behind [noise] about all I Want to reorganize so they can get a a pathway up to the United states border manning have the buses all lined up and have everything ready to go\nSo they're trying to become more and more organized John So God Bless President Trump put the military stop once overall because if you don't ... fifty thousand heading his way\nTo to me to me I understand is if they can prove that sorrows is funding this I don't understand why he can't lose their citizenship he's not want to yeah I don't know who did that the ...\nYeah I I Know he's well he's he's pretty phones all of these anti for black lives matter he's got his hands and all of this stuff\nI Want her in a way it works out number today one of the uh one of the Democratic Rio's a said you know you spent twelve billion dollars around the world for freedom freedom [laughter]\nOkay the first time I've ever heard socialist dictatorship to describe this freedom but\nOne of the freedom to become the ... do you do but then then they take over you know getting you know the more freedom\nGo down by the way George shows favorite person who will shop is like I said I take a look at what happened on\nVoter toilet oh my goodness\nDid you see the the clubs have been showing on ... and ... things do you call them and things like this new season of photos with them bomb a weapon\nHugging I'm hogging all they love off our God why do you think\nObama hated Benjamin Netanyahu so much as Obama's anti Semite why do you think he loved and wanted that uh agreement with Iran to go through audio like when the Muslim Brotherhood to college up and started a crucial find Christians and slaughtering everybody they could\nObama was on it will lead to wanting to sell them a tanks in a military equipment\nOr made his [laughter] just take a look at it we ... around with F. our economy is the worst anti Semite and in this country is horrible horrible individual\n\nThis man how we get away with this in America I mean that that is incredible I I ... that then his how he gets away with that is incredible\nI think there's some of the things he says you know the only goes back to one Twenty years twenty five years wow he yeah he goes all the way back you he goes on and concludes way back when I mean you haven't\nDoes he say why do you do something like\nI don't know he's just ... me with a passion oh he just oh my gosh he doesn't like white people either a ... he just really ate Jews\nWho doesn't like white people\nNo he doesn't like that in a matter of fact who was I Wish I was downstairs working on the radio on and I still so many that came on the news has said that the problem with America is the fact that white men to here\nWell you know a Jewish people have supported their own uh people in bringing in as have the Italians have at the Irish there have been a lot of charitable organizations that have helped immigrants come into this country and rightfully so subtle down get education get employment all of that sort of stuff but the idea that you know we've got\nYou know this fear mongering and that's really what it is to these people who are still a thousand miles away are coming in to invade us and that's the operative word over and over invade us yeah if you think that they're going to try to destroy our country you're probably going to take up arms against them and that's\nAh we don't we don't even have a civil tone anymore it's it's an invasion that sort of stuff and you know this last minute just before the election\nYou know we're going to take away a birthright citizenship I guess the the constitution and by I'd I I just made it up and I'm going to do executive orders\nHoly unconstitutional and just about everybody has set\nIt on on on no no no no not everybody in the Senate that's not true but the fact of the matter is that from the very beginning when Trump announced that it was running for president he brought up this issue okay in the\nLast two years and he's had two years to do anything about it was you know the thing about the Congress has ever said anything about it before that\nThe Democrats up everything when you're dealing with them to not put through no no no damage than we are the the lady said no\nTessie he has control the Republicans have control of both uh\nHey John ... and you know they had in the Senate and the news\nHas introduced one bill to say we need to take this away we need to do this you have to do a constitutional amendments you have to go to every state\nYou know and and pass it to the state houses and stuff he just kept ... you know and maybe there's ways to reform it but you just can't change the fourteenth amendment by the executive\nOrders can change the second amendment\nThat man but by the secular border\nWell the some scholars saying that the fourteenth amendment that he is justified in what he's doing because these people don't don't mean to fourteenth amendment they're not under the jurisdiction of the United states\nWhat they the ones coming up we're the ones that are already has been\nHere who wanted to coming into science is scheduled to then nine months pregnant and having a baby and becoming assuming is not a citizen I'm really saying is the fact that the fact that you're visiting this country doesn't make a U.S citizen you know if you're coming in illegally that's different\nCombinations illegally you're not here legal ... we\nWe just have different standards if a Cuban came over here we would welcome them you know because they're scraping ghetto charity but from somebody coming from a a hell hole like Honduras or something we we don't we don't like it\nBecause you're not talking about them he's talking about the\nSubject because you know we like Cubans that we have different standards for political refugee is that where you live\nAt that age that's part of the problem I just I just want people to get out in my view tone down the rhetoric a little bit tone down the\nInvaders that all of that sort of stuff that that\nYou know that are well to me they're not welcome you know in in Providence and in other areas that stuff's some guy makes up some cartoon it puts it on Facebook and everybody believes that uh you know they're all going to run up to Rhode Island or Connecticut our boss no that's\nYou know it's kind of a you know it's an enemy that's coming out and you know and for unfortunately you've got\nYou know someone like a you know the Republicans saying we shouldn't allow the\nUh the buying of our elections so they just happened to mention three Jewish people Bloomberg Soros and us Dyer then you get called on oh I Know I didn't mean that just labor to see how they just happened to be choose I'd on its\nSize in other words you're saying you're saying that the fact that I I don't like sorrows and I in in the money has been spending a against America that that that I'm doing so because the Jewish\nNo I'm not saying oh well that's what I'm saying that at all I'm saying that many people idolize linger I\nGot a diner Mike Bloomberg I don't like ... is the way he is what do you stand for like we can't learn to\nBe an absolutely\nBut you know but you know these these people you know they are finding organizations are above board there being you know checked across living but it's this kind of secret whisper whisper kind of campaign especially on TALK radio [noise]\nThat you know that some evil person you know it is is fun funnily and all that sort of stuff we've got right wing people like to coax and others who funnel or political organizations cut left wing of out all over the place but you know to say they should take away their citizenship or those that are\nEvil and all that sort of stuff it's just it's\nIt's not it's not the country of Ronald Reagan again let's let's talk about issues in a responsible matter let's talk about uh uh you know change in this country and as as quick clip the motivations that\nYou know ... that they're trying to take over our country and change it and that sort of thing that I hear a lot of\nPeople very concerned with fat so I just wanted to throw my two cents\nThanks for calling thank you Bye bye bye\nSo the fact that by the way you can leave the gentleman that for the first time and when soccer's history you're gonna be able to go to the ballot box I got an English ballot Spanish ballot that just by coincidence OK okay that that just by coincidence they're not coming to Rhode Island\nOh I Hope that gentleman is still slow\nSeveral comments which I Would definitely get a great number one I Believe ... nobody set that Obama was\nAnti white and all that if that's what the fact that went missing out but he sat next to nobody\nIf that's what he said that's not what Mr Nobody said Mr Nobody said that Mr Barrett turn\nWith whom Mr Obama did have a relationship\nThey had a picture of Obama with fabric Kahn which somehow was never brought forth until after Obama left office\nThat picture was kept out of the media\nSo Obama did not want his connection to return to being known so that's what Mr Nobody said he didn't he did not say that I'm Mr Obama was anti white or anything like that\nI'd go to all the stuff written down number two Soros has been proven to be funding groups like antifa\nBlack lives matter which black lives matter black lives do matter John I I absolutely but what did the other media say when Trump had a conference of black conservative leaders at the White House\nOh they're using them is prompts what kind of an insult to is that not because they're black but because they're conservative\nThe gentleman who spoke before me obviously is a Trump painter he can sugar coated if he wants to but that's what he is\nSo the the phrase illegal invasion\nI think I came up with it for breakfast and it is an invasion it's an invasion or like they did in ancient Rome when the people who lived outside of Rome sore wrong we want what they have let's just go in\nSo that's an oversimplification I Know but the similarities are there and I'm not a conspiracy theorist I go by facts and saw rose has been proven to be funding groups that\nUse mob rule in cheap will destroy property they intimidate people they see a Nazi Germany not Trump\nThose groups and that to me is um it's not a it's not a theory it's proven so he might want to check that as far as taking away citizenship let me just say President Trump\nIs raising an issue which I'm very glad he's raising I\nDo not believe and chain migration I Do not believe an anchor babies\nAnd there was a story an isolated incident\nAbout a place where\nUm there were people of a certain race they were all pregnant and one of the midwives went bonkers and it was our horrendous tragedy but you will never hear

my phone the lit up but I I just wanted to mention to things that really disturbed me um I don't know all of the Fox when I Do know but the other one I don't know is that there was some derogatory things about the mayor on Facebook\nAnd I'm One of them was like about the member of the ... movie purge was done when sockets where you can say anything you want and I got some very serious things were said I'm against a mayor and um\nThe I ... that's a hundred percent wrong okay then those wrong and um when I was talking to her in the lobby or I told her that um but I understand that some people have been getting policemen when soccer please up the house was wanting to not to say anything negative about the\nThe mayor I don't know if that's true or not about the negative and if you're going to say something that could be violent\nYou should be arrested by the way okay arrested you know what the rest of the means you know uh but if in fact that is true in in various people said this has happened there should be complaints by the mayor as a citizen has a PlayStation\nOr being told that this calling and sending cops you can't do that or this is this about that's just about Germany okay the other thing that's very disturbing to me and very surprised in yesterday's show\nThat you know when we have candidates we have to by law say it's a pay political announcement they're not here and guest okay um and yesterday the mayor and I should have been doing has been I'm buying time adjustable\nAnd I heard most of it and I know what you're talking about cops on the beat but all of a sudden you've got the chief of police in the studio\nDebating with her during the election cycle that is totally totally inappropriate totally inappropriate for for a police officer chief of police the being involved in politics\nActively like he has been is totally inappropriate and against the rules of regulations up at the top and he runs\nA I don't know what a director is on this one but that that is wrong now understand something\nA policeman privately as a citizen can do anything they want if they want to go to a fundraiser than go to fund raiser they want to support the mega that can support them but they're not in uniform\nThose citizen they were off duty and they go to the they accomplish really under twenty four seven but you know walk into a fundraiser and I've already comment in London\nThis is not to his wife or something but you know walk into a one room and I've already common among us who begin a fundraiser for the mayor in his uniform and not come on a show like this during the election cycle and the rules are very clear and it was a lot to lose the bombing you can't do that\nYou do not do it indoors when we're going to suck them and watch them and that's what that's what I'm doing what he called me on\nAnd I'm very disappointed with people's I Want to say that publicly what I was a problem usually publicly okay\nWell baby that's about as small as it gets you can't get any smaller than your business okay and as liberal as she is and and that's the problem with all of these people that it's not coming out of their pocket if in fact\nThere was an assessment okay if there was something that said and this happened during the war you know actually when we had in the city or supplemental tax if everybody in this country wants to do it man woman and child not to fifty you know we're not exempting the fifty five percent I'm fifty three percent of the population\nThat is currently getting entitlements and get something for nothing myself being one being on Medicare and and that would probably be true future so I'm part of that fifty three percent but I still pay and an incredible amount of taxes but ah\nIf they just said ... ... if you want to go do this we want to continue on this course this year\nWe cannot have run a deficit we have to do something I don't care if it comes out ... I don't care if it comes out of whatever it comes out of\nSomehow some way if you want something you have to work harder to get it and we don't do that ever and you're looking at these numbers and his most Yellen said today it's unsustainable and just people don't realize\nI have no idea how people could ever go to all these demonstrations in Washington DC and get on buses and do all of these things\nJohn we never had the day off from work\nMy father never had a day off they wouldn't know vacations at city dairy you know there was nobody to replace you you just can't well I Want to go I Want to go much and I want to go to the state house and I want to be part of algae B. T. Z. A. whatever it is this week you know\nTimes have changed so bad and people under the impression they don't have to pay for anything because somebody else should it's totally wrong and can I ask a question the comments made about the mayor on Facebook where they the truth\nNo well no okay I think some people on the purge was sitting there going to want to do buy me a ... term that's wrong and okay that's ridiculous [laughter] that's right you know that's a that's not even funny\nNo and and I I was just curious 'cause when I heard that comment I'm saying because clearly you know I don't like the mayor okay and uh and I don't like her\nAs a mayor and I don't have the same thing she's done I don't necessarily like her as an individual but you know the only things I say the truth and and that's why I was curious if the things on Facebook or the truth\nThen then it's all good and fair and and I listen for the first time to to the individual what's on the radio before you today you know\nAnd I miss the DeVito yes he really has a good grasp of how to get through to or the people because if he didn't say four thousand times this afternoon about a hundred thousand dollars a Gina Raimondo gave a trail oh\nIt's you know if we had a way we're giving away a candy bar everyone in the world could call in and when and uh and it was very effective and I just want to comment or by bringing that up and and trying to bring it to the forefront and even Gina Raimondo doing this and listening to the dialogue on this\nUh Gina Raimondo I put in a camp similar to lease of all do and I think that to think the Gina Raimondo actually thinks that she can run for president in this country and she wants to according to his comments\nOr have the strictest gun control in the nation in Rhode Island and have a sanctuary state and all of these other things\nWhile the state of Rhode Island Providence Rhode Island one sided Rhode Island are all still confronting serious fiscal deficiencies this is crazy John\nOkay very well said I don't think you\nKnow the big story in a call on a boat for a candidate spraying and bold only haunt in one would but only a hundred the pitcher her with the governor\nAnd of course a photo of about and uh let me an interesting race today being Wednesday by the way I'm going to ...

Somalians\nAnd a mixed in and they have fallen Muslim but a lot of people that's a CBS News now they've got their own news now they got a whole section just for new as many reporters that's a Christian a broadcast network pat Robinson seven hundred club you don't you don't have to see it just on TV it's got they got their own news channel\nAnd their reporters have found\nMixed in with this camera ban\nA Muslim soldiers and stuff not say a lot I don't I Can't say soldiers I'm Sorry they have fallen Somali people that are mixed in just like um the X ... a schoolteacher who spoke I think I think she did well she ... she goes on and I\nCan't company thing she did well today the school teacher um but um [noise] uh I gotta say and if your research that now body around the corner he lives in the ... you know me and him were both the pet ... she's I'll\nHeal research it I'm sure he'll find something um but but the see the end is where you'll get your true and that was true not not hear their opinion strictly troop and uh this guy he tries to you know when they try to talk so sophisticated\nYou know I I was ... I went up ah I I used to hang around I Will I went to hope so I knew I was leading nations I Know every nationality or I'll get friendly with everybody\nLow now that would be the complain\nOh that that they they they don't complain about everything so\nWell in may and complains when there are no complaints\nOne of the fact the ... the ... the ... the fact is that like many of the people but at the prison called ... that caused a lot of the press\nHappen to be Jewish that that prison related them to be Jewish and you know I watch a whole number today a on Fox News and out of the five people listen to people who are Jewish\nAnd identifying themselves as yours they said you know I'm a Jew and I have to be very careful it's terrible that I have to because I'm a Jew I have to be very careful because of the dangers out there that's happening in the country\nAgainst Jewish people or so so ... in most of the Jews are very ultra liberal especially on TV\nOr you know and um they're on every channel\nEvery ... every every Fox News every Fox show a and they are very strong opinions okay but I did then find themselves in the Jewish people [laughter] but that's they've always been very liberal there are a minority in this country\nBut very successful very smart about people and um but the fact of the matter is is that the um drawn sorrows and the data find himself with the Hungarian Jew\nA and um but it could you I think that the sensitivity is that they these by by Dennis ... way doesn't mean these are mimic it needs at the end of it by the way if if he was a\nCatholic and and um I Would say the same thing um but I I understand the sensitivity of it and you have a good point there or why we have even anti Semitism in two thousand Eighteen is beyond me\nBut the problem you have someone in the position that taking with open borders pro abortion partial birth abortion there in the craw of America as a base which is a Christian country\nAnd we used to be a Christian country anyway and it's starting to change a and\nIt is definitely changing for for example\nLast Callaway called ... not the last call but the one that was calling earlier that he he didn't think that uh seven thousand ten thousand Fifteen thousand people coming to the entering the country idle unwelcome does not an invasion\nWell I guess he subscribes to the same philosophy as like a governor and us secretary of state\nAnd the left and I guess even at a local level ... Melissa Marie because uh I guess Dr Carroll said I didn't ... myself but she did she say something that loss and Mari said that she would be in favor of sanctuary status for the state\nYou would vote in favor of it yeah so I mean that's exactly what these people that do and you know the little guy though\nThere is a good example of that with the person was baking now Melissa Marie I'm totally against sanctuary states but she's not Jewish\nAnd so so why would she was a Jew would we say she's a ... a Jewish girl is against century wants a century states I guess that's the point of trying to make your connecting the person with their religion is wrong\nAnd and I think that uh some people on the left we use it as a crutch to attack you if you said oh my God I'm against Melissa Marie because of these policies because they left is let's say oh you must be an anti Semite because she's Jewish you know if she was they use that to as a tool\nTo it said that on on the TV all the time yeah\nAnd then you have to correct what do you mean what do you mean I'm an anti Semite not anything to them I mean you're talking about your good\nA good follow up question for ms Laurie would have been so do you support giving them voter ideas as well and allowing them to vote because that's the position that I Believe the sec with the current secretary of state as would you be surprised to find out that\n... ah the ... quite a left so who's running for secretary of state as a Republican at a press conference to expose\nFraud taking place with regards to the issuance of voter ID cards and the verification of the information they provide he had a press conference exposing this and that one media outlet from television or\nWritten print showed up to to to hear what he had to say and to expose no interest in it whatsoever so that's probably why you won't hear too much I'm willing to bet you're not going to hit too much in the news about\nFour hundred thousand dollars that Joe trailer received from from the governor\n... let's make something clear in a state of Rhode Island you could not\nPass a law allowing non citizens to vote in Rhode Island because our state constitution says that in order to vote in Rhode Island you have to be in the United states citizen many many constitutions in other states don't have that\nBut we do have and wisely and by the way and also states in our constitution but you're not entitled to an abortion either [laughter] so we're not following anything\nBut I Know you are a very avid with the board of canvases but what would it surprise you to find out that I personally experienced somebody going to the secretary of state's office apply for a voter ID card and providing absolutely zero proof of who they were\nWhere they live how old they were if it was citizen anything they verified none of the information on the paper and gave him a voter id caught right there on the spot\nWow well I met ... somebody yesterday met somebody yesterday that voted in one socket the last election was given to balance\nI says you need to balance the the person man you need a balance I don't know if there were stuck together to balance I said did you vote for the most of them are you going to take them right yeah\nI I mean I've never heard that before when I was in a born again and the many years I was seven or eight years running on board I never heard of that how how do you give you get to people sitting at the desk a given a balance if the person next to say wait a minute you given up to balance\nIt and I think it's in the prison I that said told me is something that a person that I ... I Know it's true [laughter] that's unbelievable\nWell this yeah you'll be able to get too as well because they'll give you the first one in English and then they'll give you the second one in Spanish so you'll be able to vote twice as well again\nI saw the guy just one\nWell you know you're going to get Spanish ballots this time thanks to Nelly go be spending money\nSo I think it's just that ah I

hello how are you worked out very well in general is the other day with the girl that bought my a weird stuff or not you weren't\nPeople who you know you know because they want to have it on a weekend so they can do X Y Z that's not the whole\nPoint of it I mean as far as you know children a trick or treating I mean that goes back to the thirties when\nThey use what actually your house or something bad unless they were given something in the evolved to what it is today yeah I'll ever harder to go back to the main point that's like saying well let's move on Christmas too like the day before the fall compatible Jules well\nAll of the holy day I should say is there for a reason\nYeah but it it really is it's a a you know it's Hallows eve it's not it's not a holy day of obligation or anything like that I mean all but it is a wholly yeah I I don't think too many people see it as a holy day though ah I I\nThought it is yeah I mean you don't if you don't like I go to a Catholic Church they give out calendars ... you'll see it\nOh yeah and that way yeah they don't move it\nTo the next friday on the next weekend of the next Monday like some secular holidays so again it's like you know it's like I say it was like taking the Christmas out of course it is what it is why would they just you know well we're glad to get like a billion dollar industry\nAnd I think it's a multi billion dollar industry a Halloween as a a big holiday these days you have a lot of money involved in costumes and ... you know the treats and everything that goes with it you know\nLike I say I just don't I don't get it I mean it's like what's next and you know ... we already have in this is people's day I mean it just gets full point where it's ridiculous it's like\nWell what the only thing I I I I was going to say I'm ... my take on it was\nIf it was done on a Saturday in the last Saturday of the month it could be a safer experience the young people who were going out because we if we all did it at the same time and if we could\nProbably start a little bit earlier or whatever uh and it might might make it safer out on the streets for trick or treaters I think what happens is uh\nYeah well first of all the kids were in school today the trick or treating tonight they're going to school tomorrow\nYou can imagine they were flying high today and they ... the probably flying high or tomorrow you will be half dead from being outside tonight\nTrick or treating so I don't know how much good it is for ah education you know on on Halloween we were as on Saturday it the day you don't have school you go to the parents wouldn't have to rush home from work and get the kids dress drag them around the neighborhood trick or treating or they could do it on ...\nA better pay and and then um on Sunday you can recoup you know [laughter] my sleeping in a little later or whatever\nWell I Can't argue the safety factor for you know I saw a cartoon show catch trick or treating and there was a pumpkin turkey sitting on it and another punk pilgrim hats and there was a Christmas tree\nDecorated with Jacqueline I think you're getting a lot of what I'm saying oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm sure when we were kids I I remember\nI couldn't even see a Christmas decorations well maybe the first week of December\nOh it is now I mean it is crazy I mean some of them had their Christmas merchandise solid for almost a month already [laughter] you know crazy remember\nWhen you say now I lay me down to sleep a bag of candy at my feet\nTo remember that I'd I'd I don't remember I don't remember that no [laughter] and if I die I before I wake I probably don't have a [laughter] it's very appropriate [laughter] I'll let you go back to say\nAll right and thank you for the call alright mine up maybe you have a comment\nAbout this idea of um Halloween being celebrated on the last Saturday of October every year like a set they you know the last Saturday of October rather than moving it around or being on the thirty first can be anywhere from\nAny one of the days of the week [noise] any thoughts on that my friends seven six six Thirteen eighty I think this was Mr Halloween himself is that you\nHello\nOh wait a minute area there you are you there Mr Halloween\nIs visible man why not have around the first week of a job for that\n[laughter] now are really starting trouble [laughter]\nWish it was really happy Red Sox World Series when a plane mhm\nAnd you know funny thing about Whitey Bolger he was a Red Sox fan was any\nThat I don't know was he\nDid have a good photograph or the red Sox hat on okay let me just got voted in jail a day after the red Sox play the world series what if it was a Yankee fan who did it [laughter]\nWhat may be a Dodger fan ...\nThey might do\nWell I never thought of that uh but uh I'll tell you I don't think too many people are losing any sleep over the fact that a missed the ... maker a boy they didn't waste any time that what was it his first day at the new prison somebody was waiting for him\nHe's ... he called the red Sox World Series win but he missed the only way you can catch up with the news as a real goes ...\nWe can catch up with the news as it goes ... which is possible for him to do mhm wouldn't you say\nI Would say it is yes I Would say it is\nA I got to wait until you get older I'm ready yes oh what's the one room you'll never find in a few\n... okay she'll find plenty of rest yes oh you watch yeah what's the one room you won't find\n... I don't know\nA very good at is a good one I heard it from somebody you know maybe on the bus no living knows no living room\nBut it it was pretty good show could just great\nI Would say it is it Mary appropriate date for that joke I agree\nThat this is no joke yeah in this country it\nJust seems there's all kinds of knowledge which stocked up on guns to fight the Russians and never got a chance so now that I'm going to sit around and every you know and then they take their guns out just showed up anybody that a shame\nWell I Do agree with you we have many characters out there in our country a lot of people who have some uh problems and uh unfortunately in many cases the people with these problems also have guns and we certainly saw the result didn't really huh\nWait a minute God yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean if they do that much so don't show\nWell it's sad that there is that hatred and anti Semitism seems to be a prevalent in the ... on upon a summer\nA here we are two thousand Eighteen and we're still talking about the uh you know in this movement a hatred of Jews uh it's it's a strange world we live in a lot of hatred for sure\nYeah that's for sure like the thing is I heard is that the guy with the shooting was Julia myself\nNo I I don't think that isn't I don't I didn't hear that but I did hear something ironic though the doctor and nurse that took care of him when he arrived at the emergency room at the hospital both happened to be Jewish and they end up saving the guy's life isn't that wonderful huh [laughter]\nProfessional about it now being paid for what they save his life for a trial\nYeah well I all I Know is that uh once he's found guilty I Hope they start discussing the death penalty if anybody ever deserve that that's the guy in my opinion\nAnd I noticed that have staff around the city and I don't think it's Whitey Bolger no\nNo I Am sure it's not it's for the victims of that horrible shooting in Pittsburgh\nAnd speaking of which I'm just on the bus they wanted to building\nOh they had better not it may fall down on its own but I Would hope nobody wants to tear it down\nWell that's a story I heard on the bus just shows you know you've heard all the gossip I'm going to stay away from politics tonight it's not a night for politics\n[laughter] All right my friend listen thanks for the call oh\nI'm by no areas Mr Halloween himself this is his favorite day of the year there's no question about it yeah he loves Halloween\nLikes Groundhog Day you likes the third friday the thirteenth\nA few other special occasions to\nYou are invited to join

and I'm asking for your support on Tuesday November six\nAnd one socket related\nThis like a lot of stuff to show the whole railroad or with all the uh tracks you know oftentimes just she just trash go through this has all the ... everything right it's really a wonderful a book um and it's pretty good shape just outside of that great shape our to go about a headache for the society\nWell if it's convenient for you we are open on Wednesdays from nine o'clock in the morning till one o'clock on Saturdays matter of fact I'll be there again on Saturday I was there today I'll be there Saturday

home forever and ever and ever [laughter]\nYou know sorry I just think about you know doing it all the research I ask what happened to the military records they brought a fire\nOh you know yeah I think Seventeen I guess like fifty or something yes yes sixty Seventy yeah\nRaising so many fetch a cat get their records because how could they even someplace\nWhere they I Know I Know I Know and unfortunately what's ... something like that has gone it's gone forever\nYou know and I haven't tried to get my ah grandfather's day for fourteen mhm\nAnd I I I tried to all sorts of I got it flashed payroll which showed me as last station\nBut I Know it could get any ... that would be there all all they did in the military right and they can't get a duty to fourteen that's too bad he told me\nSaid they could in a box or something where we haven't got to them all a lot of very Bolivian and yeah I guess nobody is working on I'm\nNot surprised I'm not surprised you know and that's and that's sad itself because then when it comes to historic documents\nTo me they you really have to treasure them you have to take good care of them protect them\nIt's not everybody who sees it that way you know there's some people just don't have any interest or any respect for these items from the past but I I always have I mean I've always taken a very very personal interests saving when socket history local history\nIs very valuable to us we ... the city has a very proud history or does and I\nI'm just amazed at what they want socket Historical Society has a and and we continue to receive items all the time matter of fact just today I was looking at a couple of interesting uh\nPictures from the flood of\nNineteen thirty eight now we've heard of a hurricane of Nineteen thirty eight as I Love to it every song right well the hurricane of Nineteen thirty eight\nWas preceded by the flood of Nineteen thirty in the flood hitting July in the hurricane hit in September so we got a double whammy that yeah Nineteen thirty eight [laughter] my grandfather\nAt a place you write them a stomach cap thought that was on it but it it ... tell us the story you went there and it looked like a pretty bad strong state during the day after the whole thing and it came back or that's the worst off like remember a long time\n[laughter] yeah he said that and a lot of other people [laughter]
