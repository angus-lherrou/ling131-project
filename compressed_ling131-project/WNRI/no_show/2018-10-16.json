now but I just just look around because ah\nMaybe there's room I Know everyone talks about market basket um I have cynically sad um they'll never come to Rhode Island because the unions um I was wrong I found out from a broker and real estate that they were indeed looking at the old Wal\n[noise] uh but Wal Mart wouldn't let them go because they consider them competition and Walmart doesn't want my own the building and they never let competitors going [noise] so that's what happens to market basket they they were looking at where job ... now and I couldn't couldn't buy the building from Walmart\nFor life is corrected me I'm I'm always refer hours comparing a day's marketplace to um to market basket she she compared it and it's more like whole foods that than a market basket out but anyway next door\nAnd it's nice to that yeah and that's and that's going to get nicer that made the answer yet to answer well was it uh\nYeah Sunday and I paid for all of a sport if you go on and did you go on Sunday did you say yes Sunday afternoon about five o'clock\nOh my God oh you walked into the health storm because because it is it is the most fascinating thing to watch prayed New England patriots and and Glenn said love is the manager up there has told me the the money\nThat they make if the patriots or you know winning losing like if the patriots losing the playoffs poor Dave your old friend goes crazy because he just lost two hundred thousand dollars or something [noise] um there's there's that much money it's that busy in front of a patriots game was crazy\nSo if you want to go to games marketplace of of course as I'm going down a diamond hill road from a a from Naples highway I realize that two Ninety five and checked into sex just before you get days market place I could have ... easily taken to Ninety five but I I took up the road less traveled\nAnd it is the ... year right and and it is what do they do it on the fact that they're putting types and and that and again if one of the things we spoke about earlier about you know mayor Mari thought he had done the right thing and\nWhere he's got the if you came from diamond hill road and you went back way I'm as soon as you cross Nate Whipple highway gonna offend bumper to bumper to bumper the and that's because they're putting all new water pipes and I'm all along that stretches diamond hill road there completely ripping up and replacing the old water pipe\nThere was some talk about they were going to do one thing first and everyone agreed with minded to just get the water pipes down once and for all for the Next Fifty years and then I got to re surface solid diamond hill road\nSo that'll happen next year so right now the types of being a but then you get up to the corner of two Ninety five and then they're putting in these roundabouts because that that corner had become really\nAn impossible corner I'm at that you know between\nFrom I don't know for for forty five and six PM the traffic was just brutal\nAnd the state came in and said we'll do better with roundabouts here both and both exit ramps for two Ninety five and then all the way up to chapel four corners so all that's going to be completely re done over the next couple of years it's it's it's in the process being re down now so you do kinda bump along um if you go up diamond hell rode\nI even you know went to the city council meeting the last time and I put all of those gentlemen who went last evening I'm Sorry\nDidn't at ten but I\nTo walk continue dealing with perhaps fixing it are addressing the problem because\nI Am twenty Eighteen I Can't imagine that it can't be resolved and officially for the city and maybe you know some wonderful marketplace couldn't\nEstablishments themselves there and I think it would be a boon to having the middle school across the street and uh they couldn't use it as a a you know on hands\nOpportunity for students to get some experience channel [noise]\nWell I agree sometimes you hear what you want to hear and that's the ... we didn't say what we did say Carol is that the there is a solution going one way one way or we did say was to uh find a way to break the contract and\nHave the ... and if you break the contract and you don't have the revenue or even as long as the taxpayers of the city when socket of willing to make up around the new um then we can move on and breaking a contract with the environmental laws that are out there might be possible them another solution is a\nTechnology that we mentioned new technology is coming on board that could better a better address that land and take care of the materials and the third solution not the one you were a bizarre put her hands\nAnd just deal with the Senate rule in oh wait till the end of the contract and deal with the smell and the hope that the residents don't complain\nI think that's the one and I think there's many of them it's just that it has to be Brett to some sort of a\nPossibility of communication and exploration of solutions and I think one of the other aspects is limiting the amount of ah ah materials brought into this area that put a huge shot stress strain and perhaps I overload\nSystem that goes to my first a solution that is cutting them off altogether yeah that that can really hold on a second let me finish so he got them off altogether and you pick up all the revenue or as you just mentioned you take a percentage of what they do\nAnd a cut in and reduce it and then you pick up the revenue of Bruce up for the city when socket or that you're not letting them bring into the community\nSo in other words we're looking at a three point two million dollars from sooner grow and um let's see that you decided to cut it in the capital of the city put kicking in three point to we kick in half of that and let's send a grill a burn the the rest of it which would be fifty percent of the of the imported sludge little they're they're all\nFour five six seven and eight solutions that may be coming down the pike\nThank you very much thank you very much for your call\nAppreciate it you're on the upper program you've heard about have you ever heard of the Senate grow plants toward\nI have stumped for thirty hip I I had a long time ago in fact I've got to make this much money they had to take out the old compass I used to having the eighth grade and I don't mean to find north and west but the little thing that made circles that I have a state of put a small circle and give everyone there fifty fifty percent reduction in taxes\nA bigger circle and give them a twenty five percent reduction in taxes because it stinks it never gets that we can talk about you can put a smokestack to the moon it's going to think that because the wind blows it back down they've tried I mean I listen to these things for you it smells the same as it smelled Thirty years ago so dumb\nLaw now on the gubernatorial race who is going to win it in the Senate race between above landers and Sheldon Whitehouse who's going to win it will take the gubernatorial production for us like you\nAre my predicts gene that's going to win I ... in today's column to Mars column um because I think a couple of things seven million dollars goes a long way\nI think I'm Joe trailers a dope and and um [noise] has really mock things up he when he says he said today in today's journal is not really a spoiler just trying to take out Allen song is lying that's all he is and that's all he is trying to do\nUm and I think there has there has been some effect on the other hand you have seen a reminder who's who's doing nothing about her and her millions doing nothing but buying negative ads against balance on that as much as people tell you about stuff doesn't work that's wrong across that works um and um [noise]\nYou know the she knows she's had the money to know that the Trump is not terribly popular you know by a majority of Rhode islanders and so you know she insults them by calling I'm a fan boy and all this kind of stuff and people are rightly point I Would imagine if you called\nYou know Gina Raimondo fan girl or something like that all the feminist to go out of their minds but she can call them a fan boy she can do whatever she wants 'cause you know she is or she is and so um so yeah Jean is going to win 'em and then this is over\nBob Blendon Sheldon Whitehouse as much closer um\nThat there was a poll recently showed\nI'm twenty seven points behind I don't buy I don't believe that at all I still think by a plan to has an uphill battle I think there's a lot closer than people think I'm I Know damn signs of don't vote but I saw a ton of really large signs going up and a lot of important places across northern Rhode Island over the last seven to ten days\nI'm Sheldon Whitehouse is who he is he is a one note Sally on climate change ah [noise] but when it comes\nSo we as he isn't one note Sally on climate change ah [noise] but when it comes time to actually make a decision to be a man about it and ... and he won't um so he's going to lose babbling amber Val\nI'm White House and then of course we have a his questioning of the Judiciary Committee um I I understand that there are people\nWho said um you know he sat in this debate a lot of people came up to ... go we appreciate that go go go and I said he needs a wider circle of friends because because most people are making fun of them and it was really embarrassing for the fate um\nAnd as I pointed out um I don't normally watch South Park and the more I felt breakfast buffet and little shower at ten o'clock at night but even they made fun of a White House the other night time and has the way he took the testimony around [noise] you know flatulence and things like this and and they have the high school yearbook it's really\nIt's just it's terrible what the democratic judiciary committed to this guy Cavanaugh\nI'm I don't get me wrong if if there had been able to corroborate something fed by back before then then it's like a game on a totally different story but as I said my comment last year we figure I think Donald Trump next time\nIf he if he gets another choice should take a little bit deeper and maybe look at the high school yearbook and maybe look at the you know to have the FBI dig around my college years because I think um you don't want to ever have to go through that again I Do that again but White House is on the wrong side of that [noise]\nI'm not quite sure as the president's responsibility more than the Senate um traditionally conditional it is by spreading by staff\nWhy give them that opening the ... the president does that candidates and and if they can choose and then wait a few more days and save the FBI look I'm choosing this guy let's dig deep right now today he probably has three people on a short left\nHe could have the FBI they can really deep on those three people now so that in case of a choice for comes up again\nHe's good to go and he knows his no ... no landmines out there\nThree emails to a deal with Paul Jacobs the Jacob ... wants to let us know that um\nThe city council meeting was on last night if you listen to it on ... radio it's fine\nAnd if you watched it on Cox cable that was fine and if you watched it on the rise in cable that was not sign and so I'm Paul explains to us that the signal of the audio and video from a city hall\nTo um the PBS I'm stationed in Providence which distributes to Cox and ... and they had the signal a video and audio\nOr they distributed to Cox and Cox dot it talks a TV subscribers watched the city council meeting without any problem they distributed at two of horizon and rising customers had no audio and that is Eva rising problem please do not blame me\nPaul Jacob although I always get blamed then that is true Bob you always take the fall on it whenever something go rent\nNo good deed goes unpunished them that I\nAm so lightly alright uh have a question for you I guess they just can't bring like a stupid question up let me go one\nOne screen out here we go I have a question for your guest Mr ward I recently saw on ... campaign finance report that he paid the valley breeze nearly a thousand dollars and you know for an ad and he says in cash to take a cash and or red checked so when you uh\nDon't we we take cash checks and money order like me [laughter] yeah I mean if there's a larger I mean if I I mean we had we reported as income and pay our taxes on it or did it\nFor my concern that ended\nUm this is a real concern over my concern would be how could this properly be accounted for us did the cash belong to him what was that it in kind donations or a loan to himself or was given to us by someone else and not recorded as to who paid for it\nWhat is the valley Greece policy in accepting cash instead of checks and political goes to ensure that you are complying with campaign finance ...\nAnd my answer if not my business and not what he's doing a whereas the other side of that argument the ... the writer has a point\nAnd the other side of that argument he's saying is the candidate taking cash and reporting away of our blah blah whatever that is one of my business I don't care all I Know it's I get that cash I put it on the books and I pay taxes on it I Do my job\nI Would say Trump is probably a one term president\nTom would please come back we'll soon right around the Eucharist it tomorrow [laughter] Somalia Richard severely or you're going to do a Scott I'm ...\nHave you won't have their his ear wake you had much better man deserved to sleep for three to let out of intensive care\nIs mine a\nRadio news for you to the radio news time rounded will pay everyone's doing the best they can\nFlorida senator Republican Marco Rubio speaking with reporters about the aftermath of hurricane Michael\nThe state government as a leader response agency they're the ones in charge of the response the federal government steps that improvise on whatever help they need our job is to make sure the federal government is providing whatever the state is asking for\nAnd President Trump and first lady millennia in Florida and Georgia hard hit areas the president handing out water to those\nIn comparing it to a model of the things that you completely described perfectly in this book than\nIt happening around the world as we speak and it seems like the majority of the population and politicians are training and I and in near away from that end up passing it down the road and then it ...\nIt is as thank you thank you for that that's actually why I wrote this book um I've been wrestling with this issue for a long time I worked at the national Science Foundation for years and I left to start climate access a seven years ago\nBut the problem with this it's the problem with this issue as as a ... deaths that I'm most of the public thinks of\nClimate change but I think of climate change at all they think that it's somehow something that will happen to way off in the distance of the worst impacts what happened a long time from now\nTwenty thirty forty fifty sixty years from now the truth is there are very severe impact\nAll around the world maybe not in the United states just yet because we live in a temperate zone or we're fortunate in that regard as other parts of the world like Yemen for Saudi Arabia or northern China or the countries across Northern Africa the countries in and around the the\nThe horn of Africa near the equator they're starting to see severe impacts right down the water scarcity or food security um and they're and they're related to climate change so I just some basically I wrote this book and research it in in a way that people would understand\nExtinctions and what that means is that the entire species hasn't gone extinct but in one in some part of the world\nA version of that species has gone extinct because the environment doesn't support than it's either too hot or too rainy or too cold or a took me how they get to it goes it gets too extreme things start sooner or later and it's causing local extinctions\nAlong the eastern seaboard what you're saying it's fish that are used to a certain temperature the ocean there going north or other fish that with that used to only state you know or um you know oceans species would stay north because it was\nYou know it was it was they the temperature sort of them to the north are not coming down south so seeing a collision of species up and down the eastern seaboard I'm a you know so lobsters that you know off the coast of Maine that you know people dependent on\nFor generations they're having to decide whether they should you know stopping lobstermen\nUm that's happening all up and down the eastern seaboard\nAnd the water and the the salt water tuition that you're talking about in the Everglades and in in and around Florida is also happening I'm up all up and down the eastern seaboard in other states salt water tradition as sea level rises which is occurring right now is starting to intrude into wetlands which is a buffer and\nYou know between the the the land along the eastern seaboard and the ocean that's all changed right now\nIn parts of the country like Florida and the ... salt water treasure is a serious problem or just take South Florida that the ... why why every body of South Florida I guess that climate change is occurring right now\nAt all the police cars that patrol in South Florida in Miami and in Fort Lauderdale in other words they all have to rush for the bottom of their cars right now because for the first time ever\nA a sea water floods during the day and so the cars are driving through what is effectively ocean water on the streets and the salt water is rushing the bottom of the cars so they all had the last with the cars in order to make sure that the cars were stable you're seeing\nBasically intrusion on the ocean I'm a up and down the eastern singled out this point you\nKnow getting back to that on this part of the country I'll give you some perfect scenario that I've been watching for the last ten years and probably the last fifty years as an avid fisherman in New England freshman salt water\nUm when I first started maybe in the fifties and sixties um you know camping on the east coast down here in Jamestown New port and stuff like that\nWe were catching an awful lot of ... we had our own traps as recreational licenses and stuff like that or the lobster industry as far as I'm concerned is just about done and never again today\nAnd what happened and never again today is if you have any slight variation of a spill from any of the sewage treatment plant\nThe ph in the water will go into a green blue algae bloom almost overnight and they're starting to show up now on a lot of the fresh water ponds that do not have\nA stream coming to them this spring fat\nSo it's happening then with the ph from the acid rain\nThe other thing we notice I'm I've been in bands clubs ... clubs for years and now the last five years ... on people the lack of bull frogs while with fishing in a tournament especially just before dark when they started with this serenade\nThere's fewer and fewer fresh water up front\nSerenade there's fewer and fewer fresh water a front arms around for the feed of the bass\nAnd then another indication what's going on the other thing is we've gone to a normal supply of black see that that is now invaded the New England waters from the southern part\nOr out and father in the ocean I now I guess the meeting the baby lobsters and Narragansett Bay and that's the number one forage\nA peak want a island up on the St Johns river up in Maine I had a discussion for three hours where they Rhode Island residents to spend every weekend up there on his some of the property he's inhabited diehard stripe a fisherman\nAnd he's telling me that the sea bass out two years ago he got his first one this year he caught three in the same spot\nAnd he can see it changing as far as way as Maine at the end of that loop and he says Wayne he says it's really changing fast\nThe heroin now have a lot of the ah ah different types of tuna mixed in with them and along with the macro withdraw the same species but he says that was unheard of before and it's really changing fast and you look at the economy would main competing with Canada right now\nAnd this is going to be interesting to see how this plays out\n\nSo I'm all those those stories you just told are exactly the types of stories that people interact with this with with fish or with or without a animals all the species\nThey they they get this now because there's there's a reason why that a story about the canary in the coal mine\nMatters the reason why they wouldn't put canaries and coal mines was that when something bad was started habits at a call man can area was the first in the sense that care about it they would they said they were ... they were very sensitive to changes in their environment\nSame thing that's happening is reason why you pay attention to space if they are sensing the changes in their environment before we do\nAnd so any species in this in the same and the ocean right now they know the ocean is changing environment is changing everything is changing um and so if you're close to the sea across the ocean is and you see how they say you know all these things are\nSo that that the climate is changing um and\nThe the last thing I wanted to talk about what you pointed out the PH level the ocean the reason why that is such a critical saying that for scientists to study is\nThe ph levels and the ocean has changed dramatically since the dawn ... as as you know that the other thing is you know sort of an evil twin of climate change is ocean acidification\nIs occurring at a very rapid rate 'em on her because of ... ... ... industrial society has has created a page levels have gone up point one percent and while that may sound like a small amount for the ocean it's it's basically it's it's the ... and you're taking that\nYou're studying how the ocean is changing and you're studying the PH level with physicians look at blood and they look at the ph levels when the ph levels change or just a little bit like they are in the ocean they get quite alarmed software physicians studying the ocean and see the pace of change just a little bit we all should be\nQuite a lot because uh even that slight change in the cage levels as a an incredibly I'm an incredibly robust uh uh [noise] um [noise] effect\nOn all the species that are living in the ocean so the bomb a nation of a woman water yeah\nThe bottom line on the cob and build up what goes up is going to come down and how much can the ocean at this rate absorb all that\nAnd a a perfect scenario I took a vacation down to Bermuda a first time ever and the uh big cruise ships have a desalination plant on board like I Believe all a launch navy vessels out\nSo I think with government regulations and would they really look at this if they made it easier on more affordable to change Jeanette dissemination to come to an affordable level I think that's going to be the answer to all of this\nAnd then also Bermuda or has installed they have no water down here it's a big rock and they've installed to smaller dissemination plans down there\nBut the income level um Bermuda is one of the highest in the world\nThis a problem that we're having here on the New England coast is going to affect\nSo many different species of fish\nOr it's to a point right now where we're importing about Ninety eight percent of all the fish that are consumed in this country right now and people aren't aware of this and they think and everything is local from New England\nBut if you look around at new bed said Newport all your laundry reports it seems like they were dying species of business it looks like they're going to fall like seems are going to fall and then a rapid rate right now\nYou know it it it it's interesting that you hardly anybody knows this but the the the country that that has that has research is\nSelling a session a salt water out of out of water so that you could have freshwater or as as a country of Israel and in a in a in a weird anomaly Saudi Arabia's now talking Israel and relying on\nIsrael engineering and technology\nAs it looks at its the salad ... plants or other Middle Eastern countries I find that fascinating so maybe that who do you know that there\nYeah I find that absolutely fascinating and it's out of necessity in Saudi Arabia has no choice they they have to have freshwater drinking water for their people and so they're building the threats that the plants and they and their their you know and they're using technology that was developed in Israel I I I find that you know quite interesting\nBag closed lemons ways but Scotty I thought it authentic espresso drinks a frozen hot chocolate doc or white

[noise]\nMarathon to that again I don't want to be scared man as what prison and was really I should have been waiting in a lot of the town that\nI think they are they didn't know and they should have done that a third and you're going to end it over by a and again\nI think public safety it's wrong\n[noise] and ... and it\nWas a\nAs well or not the bomber\nCorrection ... on a cooperative and they did it I\nDon't I don't know we're going to pay their friends and they go into town and I had that that we don't like\nWhy are we moving on that was a good piece folks that I Want you to understand that that um the part about that was that this guy was being let out of the CIA and again good afternoon ... show would you hearing his last night's debate of you are right\nThat is an outright lie notice Raimondo now see that's a talking point\nWhere anytime you're going to bring up illegal immigration sanctuary cities this is now going to be her set line you're playing on the fears of public safety but it's a reality I think you would agree with me\nIllegal immigration that's playing on public beers governor your your putting the public safety at risk\nSee that as a talking point that she is using right now\nAnd the talking point that she is using right now is that if you bring up illegal immigration you're playing on people's fears that's how they're going to try to counter mayor funded a very good job about that they did not notify ice that that guy was getting out and they shut up and it's completely wrong\nNo good afternoon to everybody on Facebook Live I've no idea why it's so bright today a gym says they also please stand on nearly a legal issue that's right ... lives that's right Stacy you\nGot it was one lie after another see that is she's good morning Scott good afternoon actually in the train a everybody on if you live the um\n[noise] that the fact of the matter is is she they go along with it that is a new talking point she is completely working off talking points and one of her new talking points is if you bring up the illegal immigration\nGovernor among do her talking point is all your playing on people's fear you're playing A People's fear what do you think Sheldon Whitehouse who's doing as he makes up this business of oh if you vote for Bob Flanders you're going to lose Social Security if you voted for Bob Flanders you're not going to health care\nI mean if that is not Iran are ironic the Democrats and especially Ramin do they play on people's fears\nThey routinely lie and play on people's fears that is ridiculous to try to suggest otherwise alright seven six six Thirteen eighty now also\n[noise] uh the trailer radio station will not they don't want to highlight this but I'm going to play that I have a video of the protesters went after joke troll all last night\nAnd don't ... the reason that they went after him was because of his remarks using the N. word in the police report\nAnd so the trailer radio station in Arlene are going to say oh you know Joe cello handled himself well let me play the sound Joe Miller was completely unhinged at the end of the debate as the students went up to him and said hey you should apologize you use the N word\nTowards those young kids and uh I think I could I have a right here folks bear with me seven six six thirty maybe\nWe'll take your phone calls [noise]\n\nOh you can't see it that well [noise] but you\nCan certainly see him actually I have a posted on Facebook was shrill oh it is really going off [noise]\n\nI Would say that that was calm heater is done and you know when I checked in his statement he put out he said he didn't mention anything about apologizing for it\nBut this is without question governor among do folks that's what you have to understand\nDo you want four more years of governor among do that's what this has come down to\nAnd I don't know the rest of the debate schedule but part of the debate schedule is going to be that final Thursday night and again good afternoon to ... it is the John ... drove showing this Tuesday it's October sixteenth so ah the election is three weeks from today\nAnd this racist tightening up in a November first November first it's a Thursday night\nOne two weeks from a Thursday night channel ten is hosting the final debate at Rhode Island college and then we're all going to go and vote that Tuesday\nThat debate should feature just mayor phone and\nA governor among do I don't understand and again this whole business of whether or not someone has the right to run it it it's being lost no one stop someone but at some point\nYou just have to make a determination of that\nHas to be you know what why\nYou can't just let anybody on the stage this races coming down to two people I really believe that and let's say I'll take Joe ... what his word he tried he tried to make a valiant effort\nAnd it just has a pan out he is not connected with enough voters to put him up there on the stage and then basically sites and votes away from Allan Fung it's not fair to the process\nIt's not ... obviously wants him up there but I don't think it's fair for the process so that's where I stand seven six six Thirteen eighty [noise]\nYeah it looks good afternoon is John ... show you can call in seven six six Thirteen eighty but think about this government appointed that colonel a sub go\nTo the state police because she wanted a puppet that she could control it was about a no big contract out of Chicago to get fundraising abilities and the Chicago area you add that trooper\nWho had his crews are stolen\nOn one forty six that then resulted in the state police shooting and killing the wrong guy and no one was ever held accountable for that\nAnd the ... the police are being mismanaged this is the lowest morale the state police I've ever had that in some ... doesn't belong as the kernel of the Rhode Island state police\nBut Raimondo needs to be asked about that in in one of these debates though I Would love governor among do and make raspberry island phone to come in and debate in the studio I'm not going to hold my breath on it\nGovernor ... is very leery in as a matter of fact she will not debate Allen phone you know one on one scenario\nAnd anyone that is issuing these invitations it should just be them and folks but you you got to remember I think when this whole thing is said and done\nAnd I want to give credit to a different people on social media that have said anyone you know people are going to be held accountable\nWhether it's Patricia Morgan or Arlene Violet or some of these other ... people that that gets all a big joke and everything else that they are you are enabling ... do to get more and more years no one will ever accused me\nOf a ... do have given her four more years no way no how seven six six Thirteen\nEighty good afternoon you're next on the John ... show hello\nGood afternoon great program and very much thank you judge ... thinks up before I let you go first to but I Can't understand why troll knowing that he has no pets victory would stay in this race is just what it what it is just arrogant just like Alan ... is that what it is\nWell I ah last nightmare phone said that the die is cast and a deal has been made right so that was ... own words um I Will tell you that I've known both of them for very long time there is there is no legitimate reason\nWhy Joan shrill oh should have the animosity that he has towards mayor ... and on top of that when Joe drill on friday said\nEven if I get to present my goal is to prevent Fong from being governor that that tells you all you need to know ... won't debate fun unless ... on the stage and trailer told the Providence Journal\nThat I Am in this race because two points could decide the race and if I can prevent him from getting those two points then I'm going to help Gina Raimondo when I heard that that you see all the fate\nThat sealed there for me he's now these are not in that and you know when that ... that's the right word that you read the phrase and that's a path to victory last Wednesday I ... I asked them about the Cranston report unfortunately he lied to us he did lie\nRight his rendition of what happened was completely different from what actually did happen and he said oh no I Am a path to victory two days later\nHe said I Am in this race even if I just get to ... percent\nAs long as I prevent ... from winning and helped Gina become governor\nI I Can't support that I don't know who would support that type\nOf digestive as well as all of our ...\nMy second one shot if I may as a ... like the mayor's racist picking up steam and Whitman his pick up a lot of\nYou know she is um I was talking with some people over the weekend it is a very tough race to call right now she's coming on very very strong it's also it speaks volumes that are Allen Hassan filled wrote her a thousand dollar check yesterday plus dean Whitman steps up when you step up\nAnd you throw down five hundred thousand of your own money that that line statement she's got good ads on that that is one of those races it as much as people would love to have these races decided you know a month ahead two weeks ahead that race is going to come down to the final weekend ...\nIt's on the individual with an engine also has been settling cases for clients and obligations and mediation you are in need of a trial lawyer as opposed to an action hero haberdashery or a professional athlete than there is one salacious mark hills Smith his wife\nKate in Springfield call for on some six nine forty one twenty four hours on ... street goal for a one to seven to fourteen thirty to preserve his website ... dot com or email market L.

I'm not saying it didn't happen but please before you start to tell them that you want to take a all kinds of actions against our our ally Saudi Arabia\nBefore you want to stop a communications with them you want to take away a lot of our police punish them we're going to punish them punished for what\nThe president said that it's only have to complete investigation rolling decision being made\nIf you listen to a well maybe maybe the cat ladies saw it on Fox News that I always talk about how we're going to punish Saudi Arabia for these horrible deeds that they've done that's all they talk about and that's how they phrased that John\nI I just I heard was Rubio's saying that we should not we should hold up any sales are moms to them until it's just as the SCA this is complete investigation that's all I heard I I didn't hear punishing them anybody\nOh ... oh yeah absolutely grab says why are they going to you know the ... this is terrible is going to be punished\nWhat unless they know something we don't know\nWell again if they did what why don't you say we got the proof\nNot want to say we have the evidence it's all speculation John and it's all we have to believe turkey why I wouldn't I don't trust ... tricky hates us Dan is with a passion and they hate Saudi Arabia why why would I Want to believe maybe they're true you know maybe I'll say like I say\nAnd you can you believe the Saudi King I'm not believing anybody hotel sheet of proof well you've got proof and then I can let you in in in the embassy\nThey did the turkey a lot of people who are now they have it in there for two days with a\nYou're not going to stop at that store to pick up pack of gum you know what I mean it's it's it's just paying attention to the world around you and by paying catcher in the world\nAround you it certainly doesn't mean the dangers around it it it should mean everything around you every every bit of this grand universe\nSo paying attention to your environment is number one paying attention to the things that happen around you the people that you associate with um whatever you bring into your life\nHave you ever had to be aggressive yes and uh what was the circumstances\nReally well yeah I've I've got no problem with as a matter of fact um I started studying martial arts because I was beaten robbed\nAnd I wanted no part of it I um was given a gift certificate for three months of the lessons and I was still shivering from the experience\nAnd wanted no part of any kind of violence because it's still just like I had that after shock that right um\nSo I started studying only because I had to show my appreciation for such a generous thoughtful gift [noise]\nWell I said well I'll just do the three months and finish up and say thank you and that will be the end of it but three months came and it was time to go for a belt so we might as well get adult than they probably got my yellow belt and continued on a little bit more because I was proud of real about ten [noise]\nPurple belt came along pretty soon and um you were allowed to get a blackie and I thought oh purple and black looks so good together so I'll just go to my purple belt and then I proceeded on and said well it sounds impressive thing or a brown dumped so lovely to go to brown\nBecause now I can say that I'm Around those that sounds good [noise]\nOnce I received my black belt I realize that\nThis is just my passion that that this is where I Want to be and I want to be sharing the experience with other people so that's when I when I was on my own\nWhere did you become a Brussels um\nDo you mean prior to or after after after um there was a situation where there were two people that we're having an argument one became very aggressive to the other and I went over and tried to stop it because one was kicking the others head into the\nHub cap of their car so I went over and I I asked them to stop and I've been down to pick someone up and\nThe aggressor came at me and I hit them with one shot\nAnd I thought to kill them\nI I sincerely thought I was going to jail for murder I was petrified 'em\nAll came out okay and there were no issues but that was the only time I've used it and that was so damaging to make that felt so painful\nI think that was more painful than when I did get hit when I did not know martial arts and I I always say the students whether you win or you lose your going to feel pain from it if you decide to use violence at any time\nBecause it's a painful experience whether you're the winner or the loser of the ... it's a painful experience\nSo different we're all different judged and personalities how do you train somebody to become a a a drove through our belts and and not the Russians and and your beer and not have the discipline\nWell I have a lot of go to phrases that I use within my teachings in one of them is\nThe only way to because superhero is to be kind and I we used to that during the event with Mr ...\nUm that kindness was\nThe main stay the force that will keep your life all kinds of things [noise] uh and we talk about bullying and um I joke with them and I say I think police have little Twinkies and they get cold and they laugh\nBut I Try to instill that that sense of kind of as being your priority\nFor works it works if if I have someone in that if I have a student who I find to be excessively aggressive and utilizing those abilities in a negative fashion I simply ask them not to study I asked them to find some place else to study\nI mean you do artificial you'd have a\nTyrant say wait a minute my my uh my daughter and you're ... you're going to be around to find new school yard I'd I'd take it all becomes not happen\nYou know that has never happened I have never had that experience OK okay but I I make it a point to impress kindness to impress I'll I'll ask them what book are you reading uh\nSo I'm I'm looking to try as humbly as I can to create a whole person not just someone who knows how to punch kick\nTheir old age or if somebody is all beer or near a fifty years old and they're never environment are going to be in their lives and that she'll be measured

walking because that's someone who was not paying attention that's the kind of kid is going to get picked on the kids that's moving the kid that is not taking control of his life if you're walking around\nAnd you're working as if the world is against you the world is going to turn against you and I'm not saying you are looking for it I'm saying that's just how people react bullies are going to

available\nAnd we appreciate having you I just wonder announce real quick to the audience if I may James to let you know the teachers are in mediation today\nOff of their first session something to keep in the back of your mind and so you had a city council meeting last night or like a little bit about that but I Want to let the audience know that this evening's replay at seven o'clock\nWill have a full audio unless other problems last night on the live broadcast or will not be there on the rebroadcast tonight at seven which of course is channel Eighteen on your toxins twenty three\nOn a variety and that's been happening a little bit James and they get to call every time it happens are they doing this on purpose\n[laughter] no no no doubt about that but you know hey ... having said that Jeff\nUm [noise] or you know a couple of us were chatting as we walked out of the meeting last night and the or the next town so which gets seated in December and frankly we talk about this ... are doing it and you know we've got bogged down with lots of other things what gets in the way I guess but [noise]\nWe've got to do something with one hand it's what we have Paul Jacobs does a phenomenal job and he's been doing it for a long time in a God Bless them I don't know how he does it for what he does\nUm but I think I think we have to talk about and think about a way to enhance that um to provide something along the lines of a um\nA face Facebook feed or something and again I'm not a typical guy so I don't understand any of that stuff how it works um in a sterile bubble that was a terrific job she goes on her\nUm and she films that are for folks um but I think I think we've gotten to the point where the city itself has to have\nA modest investment in technology um\nTo enhance another place this is actually enhanced what Paul is doing so people can go on and get the replays in W. when I ride doesn't nice job of putting the the audio version\nOut on out on the air a website or the only issue with that is the next meeting comes along and then it gets bumped off so that you don't have the inventory to go back I'm learning Corey used to do a great service for the city when she\nI'm In marine Corey used to do a great service for the city when she for you know five long five plus years and you think about it's crazy um she did all those meetings and put 'em on line and you could go back historically but anyway so that's something I think the next ... will have to address or early in its term\nIn a gym could all use running for reelection he's asking you to consider making and part\nOf the next council November ... are you finishing a while you're almost there are finishing up your first term uh I've been watching the game for about twenty four years of a city councils in mayoral races school committee races and very rarely I see an individual take or\nOr the passage I thought it was a great passed\nA in a beneficial path to becoming a ... a you put in a lotta years a lot of work are paying attention to the city's happenings paying attention to city council meetings speaking on many issues are practically on a meeting by meeting basis or as a citizen of the public and now here you are\nAs a councilman saw a just a basic start up here are after all that attention and all that are at work you put into getting to the council what your thoughts on your first term\nAs it as being at the table yeah\nSure the look um and I've said this before\nUm and I recognize this um there's a difference between being on the sidelines versus on the playing field right [noise] um and when you're on the sidelines and I was on the sidelines for a long time of as you as you alluded to Jeff I'm not bashful in terms of\nSome of my thoughts and opinions um and I did on a ... you know fairly frequent basis um attend council meetings and speak a good welfare and or\nPut myself on the docket or to formally address the council on matters of interest to me\nUm I Do take my civic responsibility seriously I was born I was raised that way of the same way when when I was in awe Smithfield 'em and you know\nEver anticipated running for office I was always more than happy and comfortable I'm just kind of speaking from the sidelines and sharing my thoughts of views recognizing that um I didn't have any real authority to make things happen all that could do was suggesting recommend\nUm but as you can imagine you do you know you've got people over time it says you know ... to shut up uh put up if you don't want to run if if you're not going around and you know stay home so at some point you just say okay I'll run and [noise]\nLot of debate around that and I'm I'm just very disappointed that that was attacked we talk about it you know we didn't have the votes which in fact and it went along with that nonsense and that is what it is and then the other issue you ... you brought up was a half a million dollars\nThat was put towards the redevelopment agencies won't socket um you know we've been funding blight the last several years are the first year was four hundred and fifty thousand than it was formed Ninety thousand\nAnd then last year was three hundred thousand or something like that for several hundred thousand dollars worth of boy funding or in the budget for the last several years they're just fine uh this year\nOr rather than putting it on the blight line they put on a ... a new line for the redevelopment agencies ... they'll talking we develop an agency\nAnd that was um that was controversial we had some discussions in in a one of the one of the changes the council made the majority of the council was to re classify that funding from the redevelopment agencies line back to the blight line to make it clear that it was a blight\nYou could still be used as we develop an agency if they had a plan and they can fall we could take that money and transfer but to put it on the development agency line was a little bit\nIt's something we haven't done a long time and frankly we spoke to some of the folks in the leader of an agency and they weren't even aware\nThat this was happening um but it but it remain that way um again the mayor vetoed the action by the council to transfer back to the flight line [noise] um but you know for food over the over the next several months and hopefully off everything will kind of workout um cooler heads will prevail but\nIf you just turning in as as the voice of James can oil city councilman here in the city when socket running for re election in November six are looking for your\nVote for a second term a drunk a little bit about some of the budget issues is talking about some controversial issues the marijuana bill has been kicking around we know it came up last night some folks couldn't hear the meeting last night are given a breakdown of what took place if you could\nSure um [noise] so as you said Jeff last night the city council or took up the ordinance on marijuana cultivation\nUm and that has been kicking around for quite some time a gentleman from single ... single district one of the meals on singles in St came before the council and the administration back in September of last year so over a year ago\nOr indicated that they'd like to see the uh zoning changed to allow for marijuana cultivation or in February um after some back and forth the city council passed a formal resolution asking the administration for a recommendation um\nAnd and again the point there was that the administration had the resources in terms of the planning department the legal department attached departments et cetera um the public safety department so we said ... you know give us a recommendation one way or the other um and even if you do\nWe said make a wreck you know give us a recommendation one way or the other um and even if you don't support it give us a a draft of what you think was the rights I'm ordinance if we didn't\nWant to allow it and unfortunately I never got acted on a minute is the best ration um did not follow through on that resolution\nSo that created some further delays but ultimately we and then Richard fragment [laughter]\nPut in an ordinance you didn't put it in once but he put it in twice changing one word in the uh the existing ordinance and now that didn't flies as the planning director uh Joel Matthew said if we're going to do this we have to start from scratch otherwise it'll be a disaster and I try to my friend Richard by telling them that uh he took the lazy man the lazy Maine lobsters of\nPath they just want to change one word as opposed to starting from scratch doing the hard work to get the ordinance or the right way so also shot after all that nonsense we did have an audience last night um and it was passed by the count or the um the council unanimously there was one tweak\nUm connection with the uh the fence or gave the public safety director the discretion to provide a waiver I'm at but otherwise it passed in ... I Know I heard Richard on the radio here\nPromising a big brouhaha alright last night's meeting but that didn't happen in the end of it once we passed that he asked his name to be added to the legislation that are we prepared so all's well that ends well it'll take one more passage and I think we're in good shape\nAnd uh that calls visual gross sugar straight I mean it's going to look at another just ordinance does it exclusively or is it is oh one shop only for single industry now it open up for the city\nIs only ... only a handful of profits will go look at this point will qualify for what it does just as it allows for marijuana cultivation\nIn any existing buildings but they have to be an industrial zones than on a commercial zones and not in residential is all that has to be an industrial I Want to try to zone them next use or anything now and nice to have um the five acres\nAnd it's going to be a thousand feet from school but that's a that's a state requirement as well and it's going to be two hundred twenty five ... ... feet from a residential property um and again you know\nAgain Richard Richard fragment wrote an article an op ed or a letter to the editor or somebody wrote a farm in the one side of the call and he he said that the city would generate millions of dollars plural millions of dollars in the ... the city treasury if we do this\nNot one million but plural so at least two million if not more and in fact I was like most things from Richard completely wrong and false\nOr we're not going to get anything close to that because of the state controls all the law the or the fees and so so far that goes to the states like we're getting a sales tax no no you don't ... that will get a little bit of money from a swimming confront incremental or money from the uh\nIn our tent intangible the tangible to property tax so they'll have lights and pumps and so forth to grow this stuff will be the tax that but you know it's not millions of dollars as he indicated in his letter that's completely wrong but\nI Know there are five minutes or so here we've heard a lot er during the campaigns aging you talked a little bit about the ... the council has their votes and there's a a on those issues are ... and ... another thing we hear a lot about going to know if you had any opinions are moving forward down the road of any use of Barry\nField of this athletic complex going there next to the highest to\nA as a city councilman what are your thoughts on that\n[laughter] yeah so we have um certainly spent a lot of time or in resources on every time and resources on pox in the city and there's nothing wrong with that but there's a limit right\nUm and what we're doing overcast pop broadly speaking of you know I don't think anybody disagrees with getting are athletic fields closer to the high school\nOr as it relates to battery field I Know there's been a lot of chatter about that I'm In frankly um I don't have a strong opinion as we sit here today Jeff whether or not we should sell that property um but I Do is what I Do know number one\nThere was a covenant guy was a cover on that property\nUm that has to be dealt with and has to be respected in some fashion but more importantly if we are going to do something with Barry field nobody\nJim ... al ... and ... John Brennan polo Jay nobody in the end of themselves can make that decision\nIs going to be a decision that's made by the community specifically by the representatives of the community I e administration the counsel in the school committee and where we went wrong and they say we them being\nThe royal we but really what the the mayor went wrong and went off the rails is that she tried to make that decision to stop that decision will start that process\nIn a vacuum or there was no discussion no formal discussion with the city council and there was no formal discussion of vote with the school committee yes there were discussions on the radio yes there were discussions\nAt events throughout the city but that does not constitute formal\nDiscussions deliberations and votes of pulled up of a political body so\nIf if we do something with Barry field it's going to have to go through a process a formal process where we have hearings discussions where we've added will be deliberate it and then ultimately will make decisions\nUm that has not happened yet and what did happen was completely opposite of that and that's what created all unfortunately created all the controversy and drama all of which frankly\nCould have and should have been avoided and it's one of the mantras that this council\nHas dealt with over the last year and a half the tree isn't it and frankly I think it's starting to get better and I hope it does get better no matter who's mayor a ... to go into another month um we need to have better collaboration okay there's not just you know it's not just the mayor that was elected it's not just the council that was elected it's not just the school committee\nAll of us have a role to play and we have to work together and collaborate together and if we do that yes it can be a little bit slower yes it can be a little bit messy at times but you ultimately get to the right to a better decision and you avoid all the drama and all the delays and all the the nonsense that comes when you don't do that\nWe're going to ask a gym and make a final a message to the listeners in just a moment is the voice of Jim Jim ... Jim James singer [laughter]\nI think I've read you were both during this uh this program ah Jim ... a city councilman here to city when socket asking for your vote for a second term November sixth will let you have the last ...\nWell I think it's um you know look I have a two year record and people can decide for themselves [noise] um\nI think what you can count on from Maine for Jim can oil is that you'll get you know ... you know\nPretty straightforward honest transparent ... um I Will make decisions that are based on facts real facts not make believe stuff not you know let us that he has to say I want to get millions of dollars from a marijuana a facility um ... that's not how I roll 'em you'll get\nAgain well thought out on us a discussion from me and then we'll make citizens will move on and we won't always agree we don't always have to agree we can agree on fifty sixty Seventy percent of the stuff we can disagree on the balance\nAnd you hear it on a regular basis\nExtremely offensive\nBut nobody seems to care ... so the N. word the F. word the B word fly around like a flies on a pile of manure anyway you might have a\nComment as far as that is concerned seven six six Thirteen eighty put in your two cents on a Tuesday we are here until six\nYou might want to comment on one of the topics we tossed out then again you might want to introduce Iran topic good afternoon Iran WN are rye\nBut afternoon how are you today on wind up good I Love the street from that at that shelter okay Robin ... and that wasn't that when it was for veterans\nWell you know it's funny you ask that question because I was asking myself the same question yes I was under the impression that it was for veterans right\nFrom the awake after they had trouble there ... and these guys come down the road and you know where it is and I guess last night they were there again\nNow are the I I'm ... I'm curious as to whether or not this individual a is a veteran I don't I I Would have to sue me is uh I I mean if it's a it was I ... if you are correct and I think you are\nI think I Know I Know it or not it OK so fat\nSo unless they changed the operation this is still a shelter for veterans\nBut okay I understand what you're saying Larry I understand that but they still have to behave [laughter] right but I'm sure they fed it to everybody we at veterans that need a place to stay and went back\nUm I don't know I I I Do not know I I assume we have some who have no place to set a state uh but certainly if we are told that you can use this facility then must be some rules that you have to follow up\nNow are they enforcing the rules that's a whole other question of the police there on a regular basis and according to the story written by Russell about when the call today he says one socket police are very familiar with this building and they're they're on a regular basis so if that's the case sounds like somebody might not be doing their homework\nAnd it is that they should find in charge of it\nYeah because if you remember there was controversy when this shelter was proposed that's right\nAnd they were everybody was told don't you worry you're not even going to know they're in the neighborhood\nOr we're taking a piece of property\nAnd when they are improving in and this is going to make the neighborhood better blah blah blah blah blah blah\nWell I Know one time you could uh there was another town right okay and\nThis is what I understand I'm not I'm not betting on it but this is what I reckon they live a block away from it right right right and they said there's more and talk to people living in a\nWell it's a again when they arrived at this uh individuals' apartment I'm I assume he's supposed to be living there by himself but they found at least at they said at least two other people in the apartment\nI understand that so that tells you something right there that\nI I'm sure they've tripled in an old six guys\nUh that I don't know that I don't know but but who who's babysitting this facility who's watching over and making sure that it is not a public nuisance\nRight but I I I'm sure there are veterans and one socket that are homeless ... I'm sure they got the ... yeah [laughter]\nWell and again this gentleman who was arrested could very well be veteran a buddy to if he is a veteran these not behaving himself\nThat's right dish agree I agree but you know so if that property is handled that way on the other properties are being handled the same way and we don't know about it\nWell that's a good question as well that's a good question as well and that's why you know one sock it\nOr we shouldn't be leery whenever something is suggested you know a shelter or some ... and again\nYou know we we know that shelters and needed for legitimate purposes but we've got such a concentration of different kinds of shelters in the city plus all the subsidized housing which again is needed but often miss used but again we have the the the concentration\nOf subsidized housing in the city\nAnd it all adds up to a lot of problems let's put it that way\nI just don't think the city really investigate them so many people that goes into shelters\nWell that should be the job of community care alliance that's the organization that operates this for a\nLittle bit earlier on that's quite obvious that\nEverybody can make a mistake that's not a mistake\nWell if this was the first time that there's a problem there I'd say okay I missed that ... may be a mistake was made but again I'm quoting the police the police are very ...\nThat may be a mistake was made by again I'm quoting the police the police are very familiar with the facility they bend mad to investigate several serious crimes that that that's in print in the newspaper today\nAt this like eight thirty I bet on it this guy comes by my street about a hundred miles an hour ...\n... is done unfulfilled somebody's going to get care and I swear it where you were an accident somebody's gonna get killed running it's terrible\nI ... I see an awful lot of speeding I don't know I I again I I Know the police have a difficult job I wouldn't want their job oh no I understand that at all but\nI still would like to know how much attention is given to speeding maybe they're writing out tickets left and right and I'm just not aware of it I Wish somebody could provide us with some figures as to\nOccur over the place Larry\nNo and I understand that and ... and oftentimes they have much more important things to do than chase feeders\nBought I Would hope that on occasion they nail some of these guys because I I agree with you there is a lot of speeding that takes place in it's everywhere it's not only in your neighbor who are my neighborhood it's everywhere\nBut ... if you'd call somebody it's every night mhm don't you don't want it or we could\nWell if it's a like clockwork effects clock when if if uh you know that this is going to happen uh yeah you would think they would want to set up a trap for this individual and a nail him but good yeah yeah or\nLike I said and I understand that ... it maybe it's not right now in there they got better things to do I and I understand that right I really do I mean but\nI don't like this they you know if they live around here in Manhattan and they were listening that's all right they would stop it\nWell that's a whole other issue in itself because uh I I have set it off and this would be a very different city\nIf our police officers lived in the city most of them do not they choose not to live in the city for one reason or another\nI think the city would be a much better community to live in if in fact we had a residency law but we're not going to see that they they you know and then by the way it was years ago but the ... I don't see that coming back\nVery very well what about at the back because they're going to be running a city council a couple of years\nOh never mind I'm running for mayor\nBy God why we've got a a lot of chicken dinners\n[laughter] is it on that note I go to let's go to our body by by the good yes seven six six\nThirteen eighty that's our number and we would love to talk with you on a Tuesday\nYes that's why we're here we are here to talk with you about anything at all that just might be on your mind okay so don't hesitate for a second\nWe do have a message for you when it's from River Falls restaurant and you are invited to stop in at River Falls tonight if that's on\nSomething that you're interested in doing and if that's not something you want to do today will be as always tomorrow I mean we're open every day except Monday\n... River Falls and a reminder that the big Tuesday's special\nAt River Falls is\nThe ten bucks Tuesday you get burger in a nice big a draft beer for only ten dollars tomorrow Wednesday at River Falls it's the wacky Wednesday dinner for two twenty six dollars for two dinners or thirty five dollars for two dinners\nWith a bottle of wine or a picture of beer and of course you get your choice of soup or salad two entrees coffees in deserts\nThat's a nice special on Wednesdays at River Falls River Falls restaurant known for their great steaks there great seafood and they're great posture Seventy four cells main street at historic market square\n[noise] wow what a lot on the whole want to limit\n[laughter]\nWell something's got to be done or maybe a in certain areas it couldn't be using you know like you say with teachers I Know that sometimes there are specific teaching positions that are difficult to fill but the last time I\nWhy a lot of American like el ... del ...\n\nAnd the only\n\nOne no residency requirements\nWhen my my thoughts were more directed towards police and fire public safety\nAnd last time I checked whenever there's a position that opens there are many candidates that\nUh apply a\nI don't know maybe they might be easier positions to fill in for various reasons I think that if we had more public safety people living within our city borders it would make for a better community\nCenter which tracks\nAnd how do we do to how what what is your opinion I don't how I I mean I think the whole you know collective education is one thing I mean really\n\nFamily fun a good education ... only ... only ...\nI don't know when you think people want air\nNow you say you say the the the you see the city of one socket the the citizens of one socket do not support public education\nOh I don't know what's going on right now I'm trying to get a raise I I Do they deserve it\nWhy why why cooking in the middle and now they're\nWell there is room for improvement I don't think anybody's going to argue as far as that is concerned that does seem to be a one of the issues that's being debated as the community's ability to pay and that that's always been an issue in our community but what I Would think that getting a\nLot of what he had a lot of money they're\nMaking choices if we're not ...\nWell a lot of public\nFunding any plenty of other than your own [noise]\nWell I think every parent has the right to send their children to any school they want to send them to regardless if the the mayor of the city or the volume on a street corner\nBut you think of it\nI Believe a she has more than one child and she did have a she does have a child who has attended public school in one socket\nI Do believe that you know why wouldn't they don't like [noise]\n...\nFor that I think it's the parents' choice if I had my way we'd have a voucher system then every parent could choose wherever they want to send their children to school then I think we'd really see a big increase in the quality of education in this that\nBy the public education to everyone in the public education you have a problem so\n\nWell maybe we need to change that\nWe may\nWell maybe a ... you accept everyone but they still should be held to certain standards are all the\nOther thing I found it said that when people think that heightened yeah well the only people in their cars\nOh no no I'm far from it no I don't\nKnow about yeah\nI said rap musicians if this and I'm using the term very very lightly then known for their Boulder music on thing\nSounded like you were talking about\nI don't know I don't know I'm not talking about I'm Talking about who's performing it and those who are listening to it I don't care if they're black or white or pink\nOr when I when I Am saying is that this group that says black lives matter if they make an issue how to build shrill oh using the N. word thirty five years ago where the heck are they in two thousand Eighteen when that is being used\nTime I think a lot of commenting on what you said it now like well I mean white referee have\nAbsolutely but that that's the whole use of the N word is the issue that I was speaking about and there were two sets a standard\nIt's not about\nYes the black wrappers are known for their music and so on although white rappers who use it but I don't\nKnow I haven't counted how many times they use the N word I don't like anybody who uses the N. word whether they're\nRepresenting not rappers rather their way out of them are going to pay my I don't care that they All right I don't say and I'll\nI'll I'll watch my words more carefully I'm OK you're on the radio hiring goodbye and you're all set now\nAre you finished she's finished All right good afternoon Iran W when I write\nLaurie how ... how are you today I'm really good question\nI'm not going to I'm not going to look crazy I just kind of things I wanted to talk about that or that the other like a very a better Carla\nI don't know what our problem is All right uh [laughter] no she must be an out of town she must live out of town she must be employed by the city of ... feels that she needs more money\nWell Larry you know should cordial very narrow minded and I think some comments were narrow minded way she said well America's kids should have went to public school mhm up to I Know you're spot on when you showed\nPeople go to where they feel comfortable and I come from a family of eight siblings seven siblings eight of us altogether\nUp and went on TALK at high school on the ... one of the ship and you're in one went all pay\nOne way to sell one with the bishops and so we went where we felt comfortable and we went primarily for me I went to where my friends and I got a great education among their jobs in front of my sister's got a great educational and suck in high school\nAnd you know these people sometimes say things that\nIt's a double standard what she would say ... and you know as far as age is contact you know\nThey don't deserve a race but\nNot as your city index of sea and their offers or their ... that they were very very high and the ... ... so there is a little torn pool get somewhere in the middle and I think we're going to get there\nI'm sure we were all in the eye again as I said and I I Would\nWe're going to get there I'm sure we were all in the eye again as I said and I I Would hope the powers to be well making the final decisions keep the community's ability to pay in mind at all times I mean as a taxpayer that's what I expect my elected officials to do\n... and that's that's exactly right Larry I mean she mentioned that the police got a two and a half percent raise well it really was a one percent race because one and a half percent was already in the contract the Williams reopen up opened it up and we went to two and a half percent\nSo you know if the teachers were somewhere in that range between\nTwo and three percent I thought this deal would be done mhm but I don't know exactly what their final and basketball but I Know what something that the city couldn't go on\nAnd that's the problem because that's what got us into having a budget commission and I got on the city council says two thousand seven and I voted for the budget commission because\nUnlike some like college wanted to go into bankruptcy I didn't feel about what is the way to do ... ... and\nThe reason why a budget commission was one of the main reason why was because of the schools the bombing and I'm not going to we should all but that was the main reason why we're in such a deficit\nBecause there are grants for teachers and we needed the teachers when the grants went away it teaches state and we had no way to pay for ... that's what happened\nBut she didn't mention that the prior call so you know sometimes the facts good in a way of of good conversation\nMy husband was a teacher for for thirty two years so I Know how difficult it can be a time to be an educator but I also know that I have a responsibility as the mayor of the city to not lead us back down a path into bankruptcy\nAnd I have the information I have is information what some of this information I'm going to share with you I'm sharing because unfortunately there are there are a messages that are being\nPassed throughout the city that are not accurate and I want to share something number one I Want the teacher assistants and the city to know that their union the one socket teaches guilt did not negotiate Saddam\nMy understanding is that they were led to believe that the teacher assistants positions for their raises was also being negotiated when the ... teachers go without the table they had no interest in negotiating for them and said that they would not negotiate for them until the teacher's contract was settled\nThat was a choice that the teachers go made so I Walk a teacher assistants to know that\nI feel the teacher assistants are grossly underpaid for teaching assistance in the city of one socket make approximately between Seventeen thousand and Twenty one thousand dollars a year that is not right\nI also want to mention the fact that and I am not going to go into detail\nBut everyone knows that the negotiations came to an impasse\nAnd when it when the ... come to an impasse all negotiations have to stop the teacher's guild and I'm not talking about the teachers I'm Talking about the union representation that represent the teachers in the city called impact\nThey came to the table with their last and final offer and laughed and final means laughed and find their last a final offer I Will share this with you\nWiped out the entire surplus on the school side over for a million dollars and put the school department in over a million dollar deficit by year three\nOf the contract keeping in mind that was before they even negotiated anything for the hardworking teacher assistants in the city of ...\nSo you can understand how we could not have an agreement\nAnd settle the contract because as the mayor of this city I Am not going to put the school department and the deficit over ten million dollars three years from now and wipe out in ...\nAnd I will mention one other thing although I have the responsibility currently of signing the contracts and and I will tell you that the wage reopened some police union\nWe came to an agreement local eleven thirty eight we came to an agreement local six Seventy we came to an agreement local eleven thirty seven we came to an agreement\nAnd I'm certain we went to the table and negotiate it for the teachers but then we could come to an agreement if we had reasonable people associating for them\nAnd it's unfortunate that the teachers are led to believe that they were not offered a race that is not true in all though it was raised on June thirtieth\nAnd although it was it raised on June thirtieth\nTeachers did receive a raid Joe thirtieth of two thousand eight full of ... percent and I understand it was a negotiated rate from before but they give the impression that they didn't and I'm not talking about the teacher I'm Talking about the that is that ... of the board that represent them at the table\nSo you know the fact Larry ... and I really feel I feel badly for the teachers\nWho may not know all the facts about those stations that have taken place and I can tell you that I Know first hand there are some exceptional teachers in our in our educational department\nAnd there's nothing more that I Would like to be able to help compensate for the for the sacrifices that they've made over the years\nBut my belief is that the union representation is not an honest with them is not sharing fast with\n... and I needed to share that with everyone because I'm tired of hearing that the mayor doesn't want to give a race I didn't even though she ate it had fixed assets that showed up she Asian they came back to me with what the last the final wad\nWhat skills offered and that was what would have happened to this city we would've they backed down the path of receivership state intervention and I am not going to live my life knowing that I was in the air that put us back to where we were\nWell we thank you for that background information most interesting [noise]\nSo ... and I want I Want to share that if it's seven nine to zero five and I'm asking the woman who

N. R. I.\nThirteen eighty AM dial Ninety nine point nine FM or Ninety five point one FM and we are here every week for you the consumer want to say hello to my friend Justin Conrad he is a mortgage lender over at the new north point bank\nA good guy so thanks for tuning it on Facebook Live folks if you want to see what I look like what the shows like on the inside friend me on Facebook that Joe Luca and you can watch on Facebook Live\nWhat is this show the Jo look real estate chose a show about real estate and it's designed for you the consumer to answer any lingering questions that you may have had over the years about buying a house selling a house renting becoming a\nLandlord as opposed to being a tenant what just becoming a participating in the American dream of home ownership\nBecause even when you're renting you are paying a mortgage or just paying the landlords mortgage not your mortgage\nSo if you especially right now rents are really increasing at a much more drastic rate than the cost of homeownership even after you factor in increases in property taxes after you factor in a interest rate increases it's still\nMore cost effective to own a home than to rent because when you are when you own a home you're building up equity and that's why homeowners\nHave a network\nThat's thirty times greater\nThan tenants\nOkay the average homeowner has a network that's over thirty times greater than that of the tennis why is that so that's so because when you buy a home first of all your housing costs are going directly towards owning a home\nNot paying someone else's mortgage owning your own home so every month you make that same payment a little bit more goes towards the equity most of it in the beginning it's interest but every month you own a little bit more and more of your home in oh a little bit less in interest\nSo this is I'm a great way to build equity to increase your net worth long term also people who own their own home generally they tend to take better care of their home\nAnd when they do things to the house to their home if it's a painting walls changing the landscape and things like that that add value to the home that increases their network so let's say hypothetically you've been renting\nAnd let's say you're paying twelve hundred dollars a month rent and rent you buy a home let's say you're paying Thirteen hundred dollars a month for your mortgage interest and property taxes\nBut you own your home now let's say you go when you changed the landscaping in your yard trim the Hedges cut down branches trees that are hanging over the house and generally improve the landscape and this is all stuffed up the homework and do him or herself that will add value to the house it increases the curb appeal\nIf you'd have increased curb appeal it's going to be worth more because people are going to make the house will be more desirable to prospective buyers that's the simple stuff when you get inside and you start changing things around ripping up all carpet painting walls doing things like that you're getting your\nAround ripping up all carpet painting walls doing things like that again you're adding valued your home as opposed to when you move into an apartment and you clean the place up maybe paint the walls maybe put down some mixed scattered rugs but you bring that you buy out of pocket to put down and they increase the value when you leave that apartment\nMoney put into that even if it's buying removable things like oriental rugs\nThat doesn't add value because now you take the stuff you're taking what you would use stuff and the other things are leaving behind in in improved property that you don't own so it makes a lot of sense to try to begin the process of buying a home to become a homeowner participating in the American dream\nOkay\nThat is another fact that supports continued demand for home ownership so we we know we have sustained demand for the foreseeable future we know interest rates even though they're increasing are still below the historic average\nAnd we also know that ain't come you know wages are increasing unemployment is decreasing more people are working than ever before us these are all the fact that\nBode well for a continued to continue to strengthen the housing market\n\nSo I think people talk about or increasing interest rates yet but we can just dismiss that because they're still really low and wages are increasing\nOkay want to say hello to customer Leno she just tuned in on Facebook Live friend of mine that I grew up with it back in North Providence [noise] um\nSo these are all good things for the help of the housing market moving forward\nOn the other side you need supply right now we don't have a lot of supply you know I was on a ... talking with the ah immediate past president of the Rhode Island builders association today they've called well Caldwell and Johnson is his company their home builders\nAnd we were talking about new construction okay we have been building for the past several years\nTwo thousand fewer homes every year then we need in the state of Rhode Island okay we need every year we need about thirty five hundred new homes to be built in the state of Rhode Island just to keep pace with the population we've been building a thousand twelve hundred homes a year\nSo you do that for four or five years now all of a sudden we have a shortage of ten thousand homes\nOkay every every a marketplace needs new construction just to keep pace with shifting of the population and population growth some areas maybe you know a\nResidences have to be\nCondemned knocked down for development or whatever but with population growth and other changes in the marketplace you need to have\nNew housing construction we need about thirty five hundred new homes in Rhode Island every year we're building about a thousand so we're about after the past several years ten thousand short\n[noise] if we could build and one of the reasons we don't have enough inventory because the folks who are at the other end they own their home owns for a long time they want to downsize there is no alternative for them it's really that affordable\nWhy don't we have affordable new construction because builders are only allowed to build with the local zoning ordinance is allowing if they have minimum lot requirements of two three or four acres\nThat means you have one house before acres of land\nAnd then one other house for four acres of land they have to put if there are two houses on that aid acres stretch or if there are twenty houses on that a secret stretch they need the same amount of pavement for the streets they need the same amount of sewer line they need the same amount of water line\nGas line\nSo if it is spread amongst two houses those houses are going to have a higher costs whereas if you can put more houses per square foot or per square acre\nThat will lower the cost per home and so what happens is now if you look on MLS at any given time the new home construction that's above the median price of a home in Rhode Island compared to the new home construction below the median price of a home you're going to see a disparity of about ten or twenty times\nOkay\nWe need more homes that are book price below the median price of a home so if you could build\nA thousand square foot one bedroom\nRanch is lab on grade with a one car garage on a four thousand square foot lot those houses and price them for two hundred fifty thousand or less those houses which I like hockey and now what would happen is not only do you get that new home but the home that the those folks the empty nesters as we refer to them the homes that they're selling a coming available\nEmpty nesters as we refer to them the homes that they're selling a coming available for the people that are moving up stepping up from a condominium to a house or from\nA um a an apartment to a house okay so we\nReally need to address the new home construction construction shortage\nNationwide but especially in Rhode Island for us and that would open up a lot of things you know so it makes a lot of sense\nGetting back to my initial point to talk to a realtor because we're going to be able to give you guidance on how you need to proceed and put together a game plan map out a series of steps to help you realize your ultimate realistic goal from the goal of your transaction to sell a home or to\nBuy a home first home purchase step up home downsizing whatever it may be and every group has different needs if we're working with first time homebuyers their needs are going to be very different than let's say seniors that are downsizing okay\nBecause the first thing is maybe the ... the first time homebuyers they're going to be growing their family and the empty nesters who are downsizing it's a smaller home and then hopefully they're going to be able to age in place so there's a series of questions and observations that have to be made as to\nWhat's going to be good for a those fires as well\nAnd regardless of what you need whether your first time homebuyer step up by or a downside is that you need financing and that's why we have John Doe back\nAt a first home mortgage and we also have he has a sponsor of our show but we have other lenders to like Matt Resnick who was a great lender as well or want to say hello to ... he just tuned in on Facebook Live\nBut it's important to work with a great lender because lenders can ask questions and\nMortgages it's not one size fits all to go to one of the big national banks they're only going to talk to you about the mortgage products that they have available\nThere are many many more and mortgage products that and many of the large banks don't have\nSo you don't have if your needs don't fit into the box that they have the perfect customer\nThey're going to tell you that you don't qualify for a mortgage well you don't qualify for the mortgage that they sell but maybe it will qualify for a mortgage that John ... do back at first home mortgage has or maybe ... Resnick or just in our Conrad or whomever it may be\nTheir other products available and that's why it's important to work with inexperienced fulltime professional because we will give you the guidance again to help you save time and minimize stress because did you think it would be pretty stressful telling everyone you want to go and buy a home then you go to the bank on the big national banks and they say oh sorry we can't give you a mortgage\nOkay\nThat's why one of the first things that I Do with my clients\nIs I have them talk to a lender first we get your pre approved maybe you don't qualify today maybe a qualified if you take care of a couple of these things and over the next few weeks or a few months maybe you do qualify today but if you take care of the few things over here you will be able to get a lower rate so you can afford\nMore house and there are a lot of different things that need to be concerned and needs to be considered and you need to deal with when buying or selling a home\nAll right we're talking about buying homes because that's what you know first time homebuyers that's something people have a lot of questions about All right and that's why you\nNeed to get financing and that's the first day and it can be a little bit tricky you know after you get the pre approval from ah from John Doe because first home mortgage the next thing we're going to do is we are going to find a house for you know if you're selling a house if you're an empty nester you're gonna have to prepare that home for sale\nThan what you're going to want to do is you're going to want to have a landscaper and again I have vendors that I can refer you to who will take care of the outside of the yard maybe power wash the house trim the Hedges make sure the edges and the grass and nice and sharp\nMisha there's no\nNothing in the yard that would detract from the um value of the home and then you look at the inside of a home okay and you know the inside of the home one of the first things I Do when I Walk into a home with my buyers is I've read him\nAnd I pay attention to what I smell\nAll right [noise]\nAnd I want us to Michael embrace it just tuned in another good rematch realtor and Cumberland [noise] you know I inhaled my walk into a home and I pay attention to what I smell ideally I shouldn't smell anything\nBut you know the big no no so you don't want to smell like that moldy ... smell you don't wanna smell smoke cigarette smoke you don't want to smell any pet smells you know dirty litter box you are and things like that\nDog hair was real things you can smell so what you need to do when you're preparing your home for sales you need to clean it give it a thorough scrubbing and if you have\nIf you have\nProblems with odors you need to get green home solutions\nYou know yeah Matt resonate just pointed out jets were smell test goes a long way that tells a lot about a house as soon as you walk into what happens you walk in and ... I smelled Yoder riser really strong smell of your son out of the question is what are they trying to hide what are they covering up\nBecause I promised my by they say listen if you have any questions ask if you forget the answers ask again and every time I see them I say you have any questions on this house you have any questions on the information I send you\nBecause you don't want to get to that closing and have two or three questions kicking around in the back of your head that you're not sure what the answers are you know if it's when garbage day is if it's what schools are going to kids your kids going to go to um\nAny what do I do in the winter with this with you know for the driveway or for the pool or anything like that you don't want to have any questions like that when you're going into the closing\nSo every time I meet with my buyers before we say go our goodbyes and during the process you have any questions Mr Mrs buyer\nDid you think about this did you think about that and I will give you answers to questions you may not even know that you should be asking because again you don't know what you don't know\nI've worked with lots of buyers I bought and sold real estate so I Know the question to ask ask I've been in literally literally thousands of homes\nFrom speaking Spanish ... show five thousand square foot six thousand square foot house is to stick to filthy six thousand square foot house is to nine hundred square foot houses that are sticking spend two houses that have stuff pile to the ceiling\nWith just you know order garbage\nI've seen situations where people were obviously trying to cut down a tree to fall in their house to collect insurance I've seen houses that are so ... that have wall so covered with mould it looks like for\nYou know so there are lots of things I've seen that have all the subtle things to the little things where you get someone who's flipping a house and you see little things that don't look just write\nWell when I Walk into a house with my clients again I flipped houses I've been in thousands of housing so if I see something that doesn't look right well now that's a note to myself that's a little red flag so I'm going to look a little bit more closely at other areas you know one of the most if one of my favorite parts of a house is the basement\nBecause when you go to the basement that's where you see the mechanical and that's where you can see the quality of the work that was done especially if it's a house it's been flipped\nA flip is when someone buys a house that is outdated or has a lot of damage and then they put all new stuff in it you know paint the walls new windows new floor surfaces I'm new kitchen new bathrooms et cetera upgrade the electrical\nThat's what a flipper will do so if I see something that when I soon as I Walk into one of just casually walking around the house it's a little bit of miss\nThat is going to make me want to look a little bit more closely when I go in the basement because the basement that where you know you cannot hide all of the sins of a flip in a basement because everything is exposed now sometimes they try and get a little smart and they will finish the basement\nBut usually it is an area in the basement that's not finished usually that will be if nothing else to mechanical area but it's always want to look a little bit deeper a little bit deeper and these are things that are important when I see this I pointed out to my clients because they may say wow this house looks great\nBut then when I look in the basement and I see that you know they replaced the plumbing with tax tax is like a plastic tubing and it's either read for the hot blue for the cold sometimes there's way but when you see that that line is read over here and then it's white then it's blue and then it's red again well\nThat tells me that they were trying the guy who was doing the flipping is cheap they don't want to enter and they're not organized a red needs to be hot blue needs to be called the whole way\nI like things to be parallel and perpendicular NATO crisscrossed\nBecause again if if they're not going to take care of the things and do a good job of the things that you can see that are a parent imagined the stuff that they hid behind sheet rock under the carpet you know poor quality work\nThese are the things that the benefits of working with someone who's experienced like myself like a lot of other realtors who's full time\nBecause we can share that with you and it doesn't cost you anything as a buyer\nYou know when you are buying a home you need to get representation by a realtor doesn't cost you anything\nOr write books if you're just tuning and you're listening to the Joe look a real estate show I'm Joe I'm here every Tuesday and W. N. R. I. from six to seven o'clock pm I'm also the president of the Rhode Island association of realtors for the two thousand and Eighteen year [noise]\nIt's an honor um you know I got to represent the fifty five hundred relatives in the state of Rhode Island and hopefully communicate to them and for them to make it a better industry more professional [noise] and more ethical and I try to be a good example to everybody\n[noise] so um that's a little bit about me and\nWe talked about a lot of things that have to do with real estate you know I talked to the top of the show we're talking about the market in general excuse me I have to cough [noise]\nAnd how the market is still strong okay interest rates are still well below the historic average demand a strong inventories up a little bit so there's not as much pressure for prices to increase their going to see a little bit of a pullback on pricing\nOkay I'm a thank you for the compliment Michael embracing [noise] I'm a little bit of a pullback on the upward\nPressure for pricing but prices are going to continue to gradually increase you know it makes me laugh because people complain that prices were going up too quickly and then when they start to slow down the rate of increase they say we are going into a recession a housing recession\nOr you know you ideally you want prices to go up like that now you may see a year over year increase that's significant okay so let's say in the month of may prices went up twelve percent for single family homes ... may have Eighteen compared to may have twenty Seventeen\nBut at the end of the year at the end of two thousand Eighteen we're probably going to end up in single digits for the increases for the whole year\nOkay 'cause you can do year over year [laughter] you need to compare may have one year the mayor of the year before September of twenty Eighteen to September twenty Seventeen you can't compare September to August because they're too that the dynamics and the demand are different from one month to the next\nCould be due to weather could be due to kids going back to school and August could be due to vacations in\nJuly\nSo there are a lot of different things that come into play when you're looking at at the\nIncreases in equity but ideally what you want is she wants a slow steady\nIncreases in equity but ideally what you want is she wants a slow steady increase every year where you can even have a flat and then if there is a corruption you don't want it to be a question like this if it's managed correction it'll just come down a little bit like this which whenever we do have a correction it should be a\nModerated slight correction now why why do I say that I don't have a crystal ball but if you look at the ... the dynamics of what is causing the increase in property values\nThere all basic good economic fundamentals it's good demand healthy demand there is no unreasonable irrational reason why this demand is there because people's incomes are increasing they're making more money\nInterest rates are low they and they want to buy a house they need to buy a house they want to start a family\nThose are good reasons for prices to be pushed up that's solid basic fundamental demand is not being spurred on by artificial incentives okay in the car industry artificial incentive their rebates\nOkay and housing artificial incentives could be oh sure you have a pulse let's give you a mortgage\nNow that kind of a mortgage is when you do it it's like a state of income or no dock alone with those were called that's a very ... different than a no money down mortgage we've had no money down mortgages for a long time VA loans USDA loans\nBA loans no money down mortgages they have one of the lowest foreclosure rates\nSo the amount of your down payment if there is no inverse relationship between lower down payment higher foreclosure rate that's not true okay so when you hear about that and there was a headline the other day I don't I'm One of the [noise]\nNews channels that said ... no money down subprime mortgages are back I think it was bank of America that had the program as mortgage program well subprime means anyone who has a psycho this below seven hundred\nBanks need to offer mortgages to people that do not qualify for prime rate of mortgage primary mortgage because that's most people\nI think it's fifty percent of the people have no credit slow credit or poor credit\nSo they need to just so that they can write mortgage if they need to have something that for those who are who are below the prime customer rate I a sub prime the people that have the six sixty credit six Seventy six eighty they have a job they make enough money to pay the mortgage back", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Woonsocket", "day": "16"}
