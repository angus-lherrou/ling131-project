and I think our listeners do too and that is the uh businesses seafood and of course some\nTo talk about that you should talk to a guy who lives seafood um all the time and not so we're going to do for a few minutes here on the program today in and bring in my good friend I'm Brian ... he's in a cushion at the Massachusetts than he owns a seafood Adler\nThe um the company that you hear a advertised here on WWE and I ... in the morning here in on the Larry poetry showing let's make sure that I'm Brian can Harris okay all the way down there good morning sir\nGood morning how you doing\nI'm doing good and thanks for being with us today well first of all I'm On a stabbed issue so our listeners know that you know about um seafood and all the questions are going to be asking you\nSo when did you get into this business uh my wife and I were looking at a picture of you loaded with here looked like it was taken at the turn of the century is something a but are you um you you looked like a you've been around a fish and clams and stuff like that for a long time when did you start\nIt was many many moons ago uh basically I started out in the fish house when I was about Eighteen years old and a basically a always had a love for ah for seafood um [noise] basically a\nWorkout and officials for a few years and I decided it wasn't something I wanted to do is work for somebody so I open my fish fish market Nineteen eighty to ... um the ripe old age of twenty two years old how that go\nUh actually it went very well um back then it wasn't a lot of fish markets around so that was basically getting on the ground level and in my area here um I did that for quite a few years and then uh you know just escalated from there\nSometimes when you do these interviews because I I uh I interview a lot of politicians stuff like that you hear terms used in and then you say I Need a definition so when you said you worked in a uh um\nMarried to a brand new you're not a politician but we got an email here\nAnd um it is um is this kind of a philosophical question not just going to ... see what you do a do in this guy says because the ocean seems so vast and its resources limitless\nAh these threats are often I'm\nOut of sight and out of mind but overfishing issues are not just for future generations to hear\nTheir real problems threatening our currency food supply and help them are ... and that's a big overwhelming or a philosophical question about the oceans but\nAh you must think about it any way um you know will one day I go down to the uh the ... and new bedridden and we're going to CNN too I'm too old and is\nWell things have slowed down I mean the government has stepped in and uh you know knocked off different areas they're very they're very up on a logging in what species comes in\nHow much of it comes in\nThe time of year that it comes in a like now judges banks is closed out for any child has caught fish because caught fish was found you know to deplete\nI'm the big thing is is you know some of these government rules is a you know and then that was it wasn't this size you have to kick overboard which they were basically kicking overboard fish that\nYou know it might have been on a smaller side but it's it's not going to survive a kick out over board it's not like a catch and release when they bring these nets in with the you know a couple of thousand pound fish has to be turned around and just failed it has to be brought in you can't kick it overboard and now they allowed some of this fish to come in\nOn the on the flip side is some people going by caught an addict and the laser light so tiny so thin and basically they call it snap card or snap I had it and it might not even way for al ...\nBought it's brought in because instead of wasting it and kicking it overboard\nSo yeah there was a slight problem as far as uh you know the water is being overfished\nBut I'm back in the I'm going to say I'd have to say between the seventies and eighties um they had the two hundred mile fishing limit which means that all the boats like from Russia or other countries had to stay two hundred miles away\nBecause they will come in with these big crate is I mean are these big a deal processing boats they come in and they ... they just ... the sea they process it right on board they freeze it and then they bring it back to their countries and they turn around and sell it back to us\nAll right well uh Brian though we're a tour of the two of the anti bar a little interview here but uh the industry is certainly a an interesting one uh I Know that you're celebrating five years\nOf a business I'm In the a clean bill of Bellingham area congratulations on that tell a till folks to come on in Syria because I Know most of the time Ninety Ninety percent of the time you're right in that building immune it\nYep ah we're right there and matter of fact we're even any a process of uh\nPutting a couple of these units down into the Carolinas down in South Carolina I'm because of the fishes so horrible and is such a you know I'm a flow of and all that is in Carolina areas that they're just stopping for a fresh seafood\nBrian uh what is the the best value in in seafood these these days I mean when you look at the whole spectrum from\nUh from crabs lumps dues to clams and and fish swimming in the ocean and ... even get into shrimp today or maybe the through another program because I Know that um shrimp ... [laughter]\n... the topic do itself a witness value I'm there\nI'm Sorry I didn't get\nThat one was the best value and seafood out there are a it's\nA you know it's ... it's a matter of what you like I mean if ... if you cannot go to the seafood market because you want to buy them you know\nThe best value um sometimes you know you go to other places you know and they might run a sale on something because it's been on the shelf for four or five days um so I mean if you want the top quality stuff you've got to come so the value is in the quality as far as I'm concerned\nThanks for joining with

morning Matt yeah baseball series now both tied at one game of pace\nAnd the home team investor five and a stand and ask them will now be their here's the Astros there'll be playing at home I guess Milwaukee tonight in game three of the national league and then to mind I knew the American league with the red Sox\nAre going down down or the actually the threats that could be going down to Houston and the er and and the but anyway they they're both even at one on one of the home field\nGoes to here and the Dodgers now that's the five series and that is a football game last night you know there's a man from this age of legalized betting that\nIt goes that matters not that you won or lost but did you beat the spread ... and the patriots were in position to punch in a seven point when with the score at the end of the game [noise]\nGirl so they won by three instead of three and a half in the Kansas City really rallied back they went down by Fifteen at the half\nBut I'm the patriots right now the favorite to go to the Superbowl along with Kansas City and it's interesting that the computer power rank will show that create another AFC team joined best position to passively wouldn't no way to the Superbowl and they are the raven\nThe chargers in the Pittsburgh Steelers so that's how it stand this morning\nOne of the chargers look or made the browns looked like the the browns we ... and ... come to know over the years yesterday I made a brown Dana down day yesterday\nYeah you're right it looks like the brown but he's got an over the last decade they looked terrible they lost thirty eight the fourteen at home to the chargers charges are pretty good they're not a great team though but Baker Mayfield played like a rookie for the first time through for under fifty percent completion yesterday\nIssued two interceptions and he didn't look like he was playing injured he ran out of bounds early in the game and I for extended his name but you gotta give Mayfield credit is a tough little guy 'cause he stayed in that game and you know but don't forget the Tennessee Titans game Marcus marry oh to the former Heisman Trophy winner Oregon's\nMet he got sacked eleven times yesterday a versus the ravens the ravens beating the titans Twenty one nothing at the franchise record I don't know how that's not an NFL record eleven Saxon one game but the NFL record is twelve sec\nYeah I yeah that's that's astonishing uh he got tossed around like a rag doll um Russell Wilson look pretty good yesterday guys I Know it was in London I Know it was against the raiders but Seattle's now even its record at three and three ... jobs to one in five whatever but has Seattle maybe right at that ship\nOr Russia will always looks good let's get that straight for the last couple of years he's at the top five quarterback in the Senate fell\nAnd it's not so much about Seattle yesterday as it is about the raiders the raiders just stink they filled a one in five\nYou know they go to London and John route and their new head coach the hundred million dollar head coach he complained all week about having to go to London and the raiders played like it I mean they play like they didn't want to be there I don't think they're playing that hard for him I Wonder if he's lost that team in the locker room that\n[noise] yeah uh that's a good question ah Don do you do you think maybe they're not standing by their guy\nWell I think you know this early in the face and then knowing the contract that he has I don't think he's lost the locker room yet but I think things are a lot trickier than they were when he went there and it was great it claimed that they hear conquering hero is back\nBut he is locked in is Galen mentioned to a hundred million dollar contract so he's there for the long haul all if they want to make a big\nAnd do a hundred million dollar contract so he's there for the long haul all if they want to make a big day out\nThat they are a bad team right now and that what they haven't recovered from that was the trade of colonial Mac their best player a great linebacker they traded the bears players and everybody follows the raiders are very unhappy about that that was ... call in or maybe it wasn't a good one because a team of gone down since then\nYou mentioned the bears I don't know if you guys saw the ending to the dolphins bears that was one of the dumbest dumbest ending to a game I've ever seen in my life have to not only that I not only after the bears decided to just sit on the ball and go to overtime but then that lucky pass\nA then the ... in the end zone and in Miami ends up winning it anyway I mean that was just a\nYeah it was one of the dumbest endings to a football game I think I've ever seen\n... while ended up going for three hundred and eighty yards for the dolphins from intercession problems but they won the game with ... while they're in their ah yeah it was it wasn't a handle well managed well at the end for sure\nYeah well a dolphins are now fall to foreign to great college football action over the weekend who saw a number to Georgia losing a at LSU\nI don't shoot tiger fans now setting up what could be the biggest game of this college regular season coming up November bird\nAnd that's what number one Alabama we'll go to Baton Rouge to play that now number five LSU Tigers a huge Southeastern Conference game\nTop four in the rankings Alabama Ohio State Clemson at Notre Dame but they got some teams are rising are very interesting like Michigan moving up quickly and LSU number five overall they think they can beat everybody on the right they they can\nAnd don't forget about the University of Texas Longhorns you know they were ... you know as an adult in and on the last couple of years now they're in the top ten again this new coach Tom Herman from Houston he's a he's an urban Meyer protege actually has a long horns for the call ten no one short that was possible\nYeah Oregon looks great uh knocking off Washington on national TV I I Know you guys have been high on Oregon's quarterback\nSuper high you know the quandary in New York is what the giants playing so poorly and it being pretty apparent met at a ... and his last year was playing like he doesn't want to be there\nOr is it that you're better off losing a lot of games and getting a number one pick and getting a tremendous quarterback at Oregon guy by the name of Justin Herbert I mean he is a franchise guy and uh to me I think he's gonna be the number one pick in the draft no matter who have\nMet one other thing is where much of the Dallas Cowboys crush the Jacksonville Jaguars forty seven\nAnd Dallas who's getting all kinds of criticism during the week Stephen Smith same fire Jason Garrett Troy Aikman ripping on deck Prescott well they put a lot of a critic of them are quiet down quite a bit after yesterday's window what happened to Jacksonville Jaguars\nDangerous bigger the best team in a legal months ago and now they've lost three straight and it was forty seven to an average cowboys people I don't know what's going on down there\nYeah and more specifically that defense in Jacksonville guys got yeah they got run over

of the game with last night this guy is just so good and you're gonna miss him so much you take so much for granted and last night again you see this Patrick my home's Showtime\nAbsolutely going to be fun to watch I Hope he stays healthy this year and we can see these to go again let's get to the phone lines this morning um\nGet first line one and we'll see you know we have a special guest going to

okay we'll all alert the powers that be that are answering the phone that if we do get the special guests to just let me know\nHow how they always find no rush at all because we don't know when he's going in and we have Bob waiting on the other line so yeah if you want to just make you take a lot to talk about as you know continued lower continually our role here\nI I just think this young kid is going to be another Brady\n[noise] certainly looks like it after last night um and the ability to uh to just make things happened on the run as I I was saying last night this is a much more athletic like a breath fog you remember ... could throw the ball like unbelievable but this kid can run he can move\nI think I I think the first quarter\n... nerves can play into it hospital environments sixty thousand people primetime game he had seen that before\nOn Monday Night against animal but I think it was the look a that don't check in the defense out at the beginning where they actually had looked at the at times they had the appearance of no safety playing back and then they would drop a guy and they'd have other guys come up and looked like they were gonna blitz and I just think he ... he ...\nHe couldn't read the coverage as quickly as he needed to and when he did have guys open as we all thought he missed them badly be right I think you like you said the nerves are rushing to throw a but then you saw as he got comfortable at the game went\nOn a that was fun to watch it just you know this was going to be a night of whoever's got the ball lasted seem\nRight but at the beginning I think he was so afraid to play again I don't think he ever played against the patriots right he\nHad not played against the patriots last year it was Alex Smith and write and Kansas City beat us soundly a because we didn't have our\nAct Iraq together that was opening night but um no my home sad for the full year and at the end of the last year right before the playoffs they put him in on the last game and he let it up and they were talking about trading that starting quarterback before\nBefore the playoff game was even played where I think played into them losing and this kid had a full offseason training camp with ah with these weapons and he has a ton of them and you saw that last night or just just a great performance by him and I don't think you've seen the last of him as I said before I took the\nI just I ... injuries would be the only way I I I don't see another team that's close to these two teams now the Jacksonville is falling way off the wagon and Pittsburgh to me there in every game but I mean we we can beat him we always beat him and not in Kansas City has already beaten Pittsburgh mom's is already beating Pittsburgh this year so\nWe get the plate and again\nWe won't play Kansas City again if it's the AFC Championship or or or uh divisional round playoff game but it's hard to believe that there'll be a\nThat they won't be one of the top seeds they they they lost their first game last night for us so it it looks right now they are the two best teams in the AFC I'm at almost the halfway point ah we're six weeks and now a\nMy feeling is a total different game with this kid yeah\nOh yeah there are totally different team\nOr you're going to me I got it got to know what to expect and he's going to be very wary about going right\nNow it's I it's it's amazing the difference that he makes on that team and we have to also keep in mind\nThat they didn't have um I read bury their safety that's the guy that called the Gronkowski so well in the game last year and they don't even have him last night so they they don't they're not even at full strength 'em and they're going to have to get a lot better defensively\nKansas City I mean over the course of the year if they're going to do anything about but so we are so it's a tale of two cities Kansas City in New England and and what the story is the same as the boat both teams can score will\nStart quarterbacks weapons galore and no defense right now I'm ... if no answer for either one of them so it's going to have fun\nAnd I notice last night too well and the previous game like a Brady fumbled too if you really\nHave already had a couple of inaccurate throws and as I say in a few seconds ago my home's had guys open early in that game and just was a second off a maybe a little jumpy through it a little ah overthrown a ... you saw\nHim settle in and then Brady a\nAnd the ability of uh of this guy on the talk about and want to talk about with our guest later Sony Michel and his ability to um to make things happen now we really didn't know what we had because the guy had knee surgery a this rookie running back and really missed you know a dozen practices and\nThe first couple of weeks he was just trying to get his ground underneath them but now that he has and the patriots have a running game it opens things up quite a bit Fotouh so in my opinion\nIs that I I like the Patriot but I think it and it will go to give him a lot of credit ... ... and and I hear a lot of people last night on I was lucky you are not lucky he's a great ballplayer\nYeah there's no luck involved now I thought at the beginning of the year that this guy was I'm going to be there's been a few guys that have flash that they call it flashing yeah when the guy comes out\nThere's been a few guys than a flash that they call it slashing yeah when the guy comes out for two or three weeks and put a big thing and now I've seen him on a Monday Night um take Denver down I seen them be Pittsburgh and they they go out all over Pittsburgh that day and then I saw\nWhat he did with us last night and this is not a fluke\nOr this guy is only going to get better and he has a ton of talent around them and he's got a very good coach even though Andy Reid has ... has been unable to win the big ones he's a model of consistency they showed the statistic last night during the game you know twenty or a ten year as the head coach between Philadelphia and Kansas City\nAnd he's got almost you're going to uh I think those that are only going to buy a game and the head to head the pot and it's so this is an excellent coach and he knows what he's got\nI I I like it took because he's not afraid to run\nThey're going to be um they're going to be somebody that that is going to be needing to you're going to be hearing from them again oh yeah and like I said it's just a matter of uh\nOf whether or not the injury bug bites that team and how it does 'cause that's where the patriots are different than everyone and I think that's what often a lot of us forget not saying you or me but I think often a lot of us forget you know at the end of the year when they're in these games\nNot a lot of teams would get to the finish line like they do ... there's always injuries that they have to overcome a key positions like last year missing Edelman missing Dante high power I mean guys robo quality guys caliber guys when when you lose one of them for the year it usually means that you know currency a season\nAnd the patriots unlike most of the other teams in the NFL are still able to usually get\nWay down the road or with their back on that because there are deep team there well coach there well prepared\nAnd that's the difference in Kansas City is along the same lines that's the model that they have and that's why they were able to stay in that game last night give them credit being down what was it twenty four to nine that all the way back and have that come down to a walk off field goal or their unimpressive Teaneck so\nAnd if I think if they act like you said a couple of minutes left\nOh they want to come right back I think they were they came\nAnd went if guys go ski uh wouldn't have hit that feel go and we want to win tied I think it would have been over time I think it would have been it would have been a\nGuy who did it would have been would have been something and so on and I'm like what I see him again\nI I think that Kansas and I'm not at all I all I like them but I think it came to watch out or do\nWe won't sleep on the Kansas City chiefs sweat for an end in\nApril I like the car shop this morning we pray when they're not playing the game\nNow they they don't patriot I'm On I'm not going to say the patriots were lucky but I'm going to say the patriots I\nOn and in the end it got a lot of that obey the patriots outweigh\nThe patriots were able to walk to overcome what was a pretty impressive come back by that kid and I'm Out they will be something to watch but thank you for your call and I I agree with you that when I see them again\nAnd Bob if I I Know I put you on hold I thought it was Tom Karen calling in and we do have will bend it send but if you're able to call back and and not want to put your taking we we would definitely like to hear from you we did not mean to take that gentleman before you\nAre just the way that the calls came in we cannot keep I guess waiting and we thought it was him\nSo I Do apologize to you Bob from Smithfield as you're able to call back I Know you're\nJoke joke go for it I call you back I appreciate it my friend thank you thank you thank you sir good morning you're on the joke show in learning jar and\nTom we're doing great this morning we we wondered how we feel possibility of being real happy arm or maybe halfway happy or totally unhappy this morning and uh we got the the best case scenario going on uh\nHow quickly things can change was a tough a tough first team for the red Sox and obviously the um the crust sale a panic kind of came in and we we got some other news out late last night too and I wanted to ask you about but um [noise] what a way to respond\nOf pressure on price obviously and on the rest of the the ... to get going and I'm just they are too great games to watch as a fan and like the outcome of the first one obviously but I'm just a a a good way to arms back last night in central ... five game series now [noise]\nYeah no doubt it's been great baseball and uh using our shirts we knew where the real deal a very tough first they they they make sales work get him out of the game over what they were looking to do and take their chance that the Sox bullpen that was just ... for for the last\nThree batters um you know sometimes those games are easier to argue that a tough walk walk\nSo they you know they they put it behind them they came out yesterday or even though the trail early you know they give up those four on sale for two and you're worried about they they [noise]\nThey battled back and listen price was adequate you know you will never happy with that [noise] or true\nYou will never happy with that [noise]\nFour and two thirds pol Ron foreman spot I think you know it's a step forward for him in the playoffs\nYou left with his team leading team on the game which is never even happened in his career start so a big ovation from the crowd which I thought was a special moment because you know\nThis this crowd this city and the media and fans we've all been all over this guy you know I and even though he wasn't great we gave him innovations and we appreciate the appropriate crochet battling a an hour back in the series so it was a pretty special night at Fenway\nI couldn't agree more oh saying yesterday I don't I mean we're all gonna always one of the best for our teams and roof Rob players when I couldn't have really wanted to pay more for a guy in a in a spot or in a situation that him yesterday I I really wanted to see him succeed in that situation last night and for other reasons you just said obviously\nNot so much on my show ... all\nAnd he's he's kind of been a punching bag in in some cases he brought it on himself with things that he said but overall\nUm you know like you said it was adequate and he battled and I'm a parent there are really tough team and we knew that going in somebody was saying the other night they really don't have any weaknesses and and you really think about it in and they don't in the red Sox thrown out of major weaknesses either I guess everyone would say the bullpen\nBut we've already seen now how Al Gore has been creative and non\nIn his utilization of toss cello and not obviously sale in the in the game against the Yankees so um he's been you know aggressive and managing the ... and been loose and that's the way this team's been all year and obviously Houston's not tight down the champs and they come in to try to defend that and\nI I Wonder what we're gonna see going forward I how this this series will shift as well now we moved to Houston\nWell evolving game three now and and he was so good and ... but he's been good against the Yankees you know really since we got\nHere and so now you need to the air it goes against somebody up you know that's hurt all the clear but the bullpen was good last night you know a symbol for a little bit of an adventure here in the play offs and that's going to be a concern going forward\nA but but you gotta like a barn given a cause for out last night which gets everybody on clearing schedule after that a ... year after that first there's the Yankees has been a rock solid\nAnd and we knew this is what it was going to do with it with a guy like four cells because they did it last year and he was ... years a starter to bridge the gap or you didn't use ... using for two innings the night before you know certainly in the ... id is absolutely doing a great job managing the bullpen that were spraying leaks at the end of the seasons\nYeah I think that's been that's been the key and uh how nice was it for a DJ uh obviously um another guy that ... that if a guy needed it you know it was it was nice to see him get that big hit because you know that's been the story all year with him people growing for him to be bench treated outta here because of his own fence and ... and\nWe know what he brings defensively in center field rock solid can give you those amazing please um I think he's the best center field or in the league and then you get those those hits like last night and timely had ended up bringing in three runs\nA gym where I went to the game of the last ... said he saw ... before the game and he says it's all pre game show for the games at a book and this guy can carry a team for a month we need them to step up and carry out he sold probably you know short that swing a little bit go opposite\nFear and sure enough that's exactly what he did he slash his one ... wine bottles around on that adding which I've never seen after them with no no and that gets to the extra runs that gets to go ahead Ron but just the game which is used in the moment so a special moment you know it's a game last night\nYou know ... thousand Thirteen you lose game on and you found it out into qualities at the grass flat takes it takes a big moment ... step up and deliver it last night that guy was Bradley\nAbsolutely uh two quick things and then we'll we'll definitely in a ...\n... uh we got the news um with the stomach illness and a Mass General hospital I knew were going to keep them overnight for observation\nUh probably not anything else that's been released yet but um do you think that would plane into the start or is that something I immediately everyone said you know oh I Hope that's not contagious another people don't get sick in the clubhouse and I'm not sure if we can even determine what we're dealing with a disappointing\n[laughter] now and you can't speculate a list of flu food poisoning right it could be a number of\nThings some contagious some not I do know especially in a case like the postseason you want to get that guy out of the cost of scripture cat it is a you know some sort of contagious a flu like symptoms thing\nA ... year last night chorus that it does not affect the game on start that he started filling it after the game [noise] uh not during so that puts that they're asking\nYou know no idea what it's going to mean for for game five he will be a game five started on Thursday plenty of time you get three days yeah to get yourself back in the fall you know I I Know one thing they want to do in a case like this\nYou know not not say anything specific about what sale as or what he's going through but you know in a case like this are the pitcher you want to get to the hospital right away because you want to get the IV going you want to get the flu it's going to want to keep him yeah I I said last night on the air\nAnd and it's why is ... ... what about the ... and this guy can't move that way no you know this guy skin tones as it is right right last thing you want is something where he said you know not eating for a couple of days and lose weight so get 'em in there and get the fluids going I assume\nI'm just to to keep the strength okay they'll try to keep on track because obviously you need about there's\nAbsolutely that's something we'll have to watch and then just real quick our guy 'cause I I was so wrong at the beginning of the year when you when you told me a good this JT Martinez was going to be I don't call them our guy uh\nI'm Still I still do those big moments are coming in and I'm not saying you I mean he's obviously been he's been doing is is usual but I Know um he's probably frustrated he's come up a couple of times with a chance to knock and some big shots in um they've touched them well but I I Know J. D. and not hit I'm sure there's a big moment coming down the road for him to\nAh they they have pitched in a while and and I think Bogart spend the benefit of that ... pretty good\nUh behind in a in the wind up ah you know I said again we're pretty good pretty good show us that we call it a lot of things that happened I was going to have his breakout game last night and he he did right you know a couple of heads a\nWild ride around the bases with a walk while pitch and a couple of cats falls or thank you very much for that\nAnd uh yeah I think it's kind of market as you had had the statement with a three run home run and getting ready to get one against Yankees and and that basically one year again\nAnd I was held on for dear life that was that was you\nKnow he made his statement but you're right we haven't seen that sort of consistent a power and production from him but\nI think you're right I think it's coming I think you've got three games in Houston here and I think he's going to factor in all of a sudden\nYou could be a big moment for him but that's what it takes with this team and that's why it's nice it could be somebody different every time even Baskins ... not home run key BJ last night uh that's that's the makeup of this team and that's why it's been fun Tom thank you so much for joining us on a crazy weekend busy so much\nSo much great stuff going on and um we'll look forward to more let's keep it going and not keep the winning going\nTo be a lot and crashed at times and all that said I mean you got the two games last night\nThe time and all that said I mean you got the ... Celtics tomorrow the Bruins are red hot or what a time for all the all the great golden age of Boston sports we're talking about it might hit another level I now\nI think it is and it's just fun to be part of any of it and be able to talk and not enjoy these great moments with the fans and um and we ... we can ... World Series title but they did a took a big step yesterday and evening not by doing that was a must win obviously going back to Houston now\nAnd ... with the ... well how would shake ... a lot of things to keep our eye on we very much appreciate your time and you are I teach this morning and we'll talk to some\nWe are going to be joined now I've been I've been hyping this up for a few minutes we've had so many calls it's been such a busy morning with were very fortunate happy to be here and and have everybody excited and now we'll be joined by a missed the William ...\nWho is a football law well he's I mean guy for football and he was there last night to tell us about this game what a game it was let's get will no\nGood morning my friend you're on the show thanks for your patience\nOr what a great night a foot or less like a really fun game to watch last friday up\nOr you know on this and this game and that's again but this was just like all ... all you know one team going up to me all the other game gone up of the alleged falls the only way you wouldn't have like blast but if you like it was a much\nOne on all night who's been on at all ... really was no defense but it was really a great to watch I mean so many different things happen you almost have to really watch it to notice everything even doing great time\nAbsolutely will I was gonna say that because of the double duty with for this last night for this show uh the red Sox in Houston playing in the ... sitting at the same time\nWe've got the patriots chief in ... like you said what a wonderful game to watch patriots did not want and if I'm correct they did not committed a panel they did not have a penalty except that I'm a ... as well is that correct\nI think that is right yeah and that's all seen any federal and a lot more couple will be on the\nGene I write but I Do think about eighty three points and you think about uh not printing and no penalties\nThat saw eighty three combined blinds obviously I mean I'm forty three for the patriots very impressed with with the a lot of things might mean like you said you there's so many ways to dissect this game and and so many things to chew on I guess first like you said I'm not much defence\nOr number two Sony Michel uh I Know you've been watching carefully as I have\nA this is the guy that had the ... the knee problem to surgery and um you know I missed the Mona doesn't practices I was I think just getting is it the ground underneath them the first couple of weeks and I think now we're starting to see what they saw in ... in Sony Michel when they drafted him the ability he has\nUp on the show\nA played well it's an issue I think with a hundred and six yards yeah they're stuck in a hundred yard game and yeah I mean I think he had some big runs and even even the shortage I think was the final Dr ... ... yeah oh\nNo that's something they need those years they have an ad that that your job ... because you know they don't give us a all good their past often is\nThey you know they don't need the running game to be great but they need to be reliable and they need it and I think that Michelle was last night he had a very good night and you know that she's run defense is really a Bismarck it gives a worst than football that but uh you know give credit to Josh McCain does have a good job of explaining that\nWell when the chiefs game back they had to throw it more but owners party not for nine at half time I said there's I just thought you know keep running the ball because\nOf a chance to enjoy any ability to stop the Ron whatsoever\nAbsolutely and in doing so I Know you've watched so many games in ... in the game Super Bowl games and [noise] I go back to the super bowl I'm\nBoth believe it was thirty six when when we played the rams and\nYou know the game plan and that game obviously ... you know you have to score against the greatest show on turf\nBut that boiled control kind of style and I thought that obviously with the with she's being so susceptible to the ruin that that also played right into the patriots hands I'm not sure what the final law at the final gun what what the margin was but the time a possession uh\nObviously you know and again with that many points you wouldn't think that would be that big of a discrepancy but I Believe the patriots were officers standing along a dry and again with a guy like more homes the less opportunities he has I think you know the better off you are and that being said they did I think confuse them a little bit\nI'm at the beginning of the game with some of the different looks they were giving them they'd get them to throw those two interceptions so um I don't know if you had any thoughts on those things just the on the defensive game plan against my homes and maybe something to think about going forward in case another match up with Kansas City\nWith the defense is just to limit demo offensively by keeping your author and ...\nYeah I mean I think it was in the first quarter of a certain order high tower had a really nice and our stuffed in what you did there was um he rushed and uh he will eat raw she was one thing and then at the last minute he dropped back into\nSo he will he rushed into what thing and then at the last minute he dropped back into the um into his own so he ... stop at the crossing route over the middle will be available to the high power\nWas a nice disguise by how tower what's scene and then dropping back I had the chance to talk to them on friday and I think he was feeling a you know he had seen the Arpaio before in college are you feeling pretty comfortable with it\nAnd knew that you know he sort of had to be the rat and they are sometimes the sky sometimes jumped back because of you just sit in a way you can be victims so he made a nice play there and and that was a good disguise yeah I mean the reason for the the\nEntire possession discrepancies that she's had\nSome big ways that yeah they call coming out of the second half a mile homes that are long touchdown pass on to a caller in on so that was only a three hour drive through a there was a kickoff return 'em by I forget who it was like as a city but Ninety seven yard yes is she\n... the patriots free and then um ... through one yard touchdown there to tie retail and then and then when there was forty thirty three the she's got the ball one way yards by rebel ... breed breed touchdowns a very short amount of time that's funny one of their forty points\n... yeah I mean I think the only thing if there's any reason to be um\nI don't know optimistic because the right word but the rest of the fence was pretty good they did in the first how old the chiefs the three build goals or overall so they did shelling ability to step in and the red zone [noise] um but yeah I mean I think big place was the name of the game and\nYou know having watched it a step on Gilmore yeah cut out a pretty good game he covered semi watch and it's pretty much for most of the night Watkins had only just catches breaking guards Conley you know he didn't\nWasn't a big factor I think he had one cat for Nineteen yard on the third down with ... locked into just throw it out there and probably made a good catch ... it was really on than hell I mean ... ... he had a good game too\nUm but I don't think he you know he killed them Graham\nThey get five catches about nine ... yards they had a good game but\nUm you know one of the things I cannot for the life of me figure out I don't know why this are being talked about more but\nHe seems to have done a really good job of taking away grown cows you to hold and he had only one cat for sixteen guards in the first true owners yeah and he had to catch is in the court order to the big one to set up a game winning field goal you know um and all night the chiefs are double ... for some reason\nOn that final play yeah I'd have a safety cover him Josh saw one on one I mean it would rank a Brady just probably looked at it and said\nI Can't even believe that they got to get the Baltic wrong absolutely think it was a basketball game decision you know the by Mandy read and my game plan is is it seems pretty clear that yeah they are the two players they feared most on the patrons there's obviously ... and James White or even times they double team and then\nThey were going to pick their poison with everybody else and ah I mean I think it was overall strategy I mean I don't mean had or catches or fifty four yards a touchdown but I don't think you know I think they feared groggy and write more but I don't understand why they\nDidn't do him on that final plane you mentioned you mentioned James ... and he's not even be their third string safety I Believe because they have Andrea and are shot yeah\nSo I mean and you know as you said you know\nWithout being their strategy and really taking him out of the game I Know you remember we go back a year ago the opening night when they did on when it was it was ... very that was covering them and they didn't have him obviously so you think OK advantage patriots but no Andy Reid comes out with this double teams' strategy on ground to trying to take them out of the gain like as you said pick the employees in\nWith the lakes some Hogan in in Gordon and not\nIn like you said they they are actually a double James way that points to but I'm just Tom being Tom and finding the open guy and like you said on that last play for the life of me you know that they're trying to get down the field to set up ... ski there\nAndy Reid and and the Kansas City chiefs no the patriots donate to scored a touchdown in that situation the game is tied there at home and that and then got went under a minute to go around about a minute to go because I was I couldn't believe it either and all those things to happen for grants to get single coverage and to be open like that\nI after the way that game when it was surprising and I'm a big thing to you mentioned about all the plays the patriots able to overcome\nThings that we don't often see I think Matt's later actually might've missed somebody on that on that kick off but we don't often see them give up those kind of returns breakdowns in special teams I'm you know on a on a consistent thing here so to overcome was\nA good night for about ... it was five for five but yeah you don't normally see that on the kickoff return on\nYou know Ryan out of the night off the page it's been passed on but\nYeah I just think that Josh saw was baffling I mean well give Chris ... re hasn't done much to see you on that big party to yard catch I mean bad double ... on I saw a double wide and\nAn all going to add one on one covered against handle all over I think is their best on there and he made a great place so he came back with any that you know yeah it was nice to see how good I mean do are set didn't have any catches he seems to have a\nYou know he seems to have lost a little bit of his place in the rotation bright as bart Gordon had four or five catches so it's um the court added he and night I'm you know he drew that pass interference penalty on the line and go running really short was understanding why was faster\nI think are friends of lay their mass ... down back to being Bartels what's his own consistent has accuracy issues\nHe does have a little bit of mobility but it's not always making the best decisions effectively I'm surprised at all about that I did think there'd be a very good yeah I Wonder a little too you know they got so amped up for that we do game or some of the super bowl to get back at the ... championship game if they're really sort of\nNot selling the passions says that I mean they lost the Tennessee as a very good in the last the last two weeks so yeah I Know the defense hasn't looks good not a lot of past Ross and\nI'm not really sure why I'm lost a they played Kansas City last week so remote break there in Kansas City this week Dallas so you know but yeah you expect their defense look better\nSeventy points in the last two weeks they've given up to the chiefs into the Dallas Cowboys which I Know Dallas is I Know Dallas is kind of trending up uh since Jason guaranteed that decision to punt on foot down and get used in the ball back\nAnd we know Jones said wherever he said and then backtracked so it seems like Dallas has been kind of training up I didn't expect to be easily is easy allow ... and Michael Gallup poll or whoever likes to put on forty an Jacksonville I Know Dallas was home but just the you're just there just to to pile\nOn to your point and I agree with you a hundred percent I was worried about Jacksonville and now I've seen what they've turned into the last few weeks and as you put it um Kansas City defense I don't see not getting a little on dinner and for us we know a RINO when our weaknesses influence on so I'm next week a time to Chicago\nThey don't look the patriots being friends the last two weeks I was growing up I Believe six in ... they have a ... a lot of\nPretty uh just you know when you have Tom Brady I mean ... on on the side of this you know you\nYou feel confident or what it was forty forties and who knows what to do the using all these ... Nineteen years there's no better off the bat and all the bells out you know he could bail out bad ... so that's the difference between Jacksonville\nAlong the right now a drum brave she like all of those in the house and ah and\nAh they're both defenses are not playing well I'm\nAt all and then you know the other issue Jacksonville has is that when you're playing from behind that and then it's it's harder and you know the patrons defense because of brave usually gets the benefit of ... with the ad and bought a year to play defense were mad 'cause you know like ... and all they have to throw the ball\nIn a key and I'm rushing the passer\n... in our next week it's back to a daytime game the patriots having play during the day in a couple of weeks as you know I'm you know what's\nFunny about that and I didn't even realize this and I bought it but I Want and look at the jets balls and the dolphins [noise] um\nIf I did the numbers right a only have all of those teams each only have one on one o'clock and so that's pretty much\nEvery week on a car and the patriots under the league rules are a lot of by like ... maximum they always get by so if I ... and the cowboys always have a lot of national game shows an interesting some genes many ... are always on that one pretty much and then there's a few genes I ate drinks gal boys\nThat she's a little bit you know have a lot at night and they thought that was in\nIt is interesting and if you you wonder if it's just you know the popularity on the better teams are the teams they want to market but it's it is true and it's um I don't know it just seems like a we've been fortunate to have some great entertaining Nike those\nGames yesterday I thought all yesterday and thank goodness for the NFL Sunday night of the rest of the gang pretty bad\nReally died I was going to say that you are\nAn oddity that was a good ending but a lot of sloppy on I don't know yeah I Know the Chicago Miami game was entertaining but it wasn't right for not at all out of\nMy mistakes ... nobody wanted it for more than the one yard line by Kenya and Drake\nTerrible a middle fortunate when that so based on what we saw yesterday um we've seen the Chicago Bears team they put they put up some serious points a couple of weeks ago\nAnd then yesterday it's a I mean they ... they lose to Miami a mixture ... Robinson joined in Hollywood does anything scare you about Chicago on sensibly I Know defensively they're they're pretty good [noise]\nUm offensively I I'm not I'm not sold on for ... yet I think yes big army and he can throw the ball over the federal out a lot of advantages question his decision making some times of accuracy\nUm they have a couple of the weapons I think they could give the hatred some trouble I also think you know the patients have to show next week that they can win on the road or at least\nBy law and the struggle baton rogue losses now those two losses were for that at all and back ...\nLooks like a different um different dolphins yeah I think the back of the bears a decent chance is their defenses better it got polio not\nI think they'll find a way to get some pressure on Brady a mom you know you never know I don't think that what the defense or a thought out of the questions that are from ... to put up you know twenty four point\nOh maybe they are deep Chicago's deepens pays really well maybe they all the information off next true I don't think it's well rounded up at you clearly addictive patriots will agents are much better home team but okay yeah I I guess it's all going to as I think you know they're they're not terrible I Know it's hard to know\nBy the way it was good 'cause her up and down on yeah I heard two weeks ago Tennessee was good and\nPray and water you know as to which they've lost the buffalo and show yeah yeah that's the hard to know I mean ... or so up and down I don't know other than the rams maybe the Vikings a loan else looks really good at this\nPoint we'll do do you feel like we finally achieved parity in this league mine is obviously the teams that you mentioned like the rams the liking the patriots but I mean on a given week like you said I mean I'm looking at these games now I didn't think Washington was going to be Carolina yesterday um\nTheir cars they looked horrible against the sayings on Monday Night gospel I either\nRight in Caroline is supposed to be you know still pretty decent they were Super Bowl team went three years ago and it's just like you said it's hard to ... when we to the next you don't know I don't want to see you don't know who's going to show up but I mean look at Jacksonville they they smoked out only on\nThe line but first we look all of them a job you know fought against Francisco came back on and they beat the patriots Fernando ... backer since then\nIt's really hard to predict I mean who's got all of a week to week I mean I think there's a there's a lot of there's two or three terrible games I think of all really bad I own a [noise]\nI don't think the Arizona's a bound and his two or three really good but I think the rest of the teams are caught and there's not much separating them or you know it's a lot of mediocrity so on to the next ... or\nYou know it's it's it's it's it's really hard to predict what's gonna happen\nWhat do you think about when John ruin their only win so far at all the time you're going to put\nThem in the list of really bad too soft\nAnd they are they just cash and then you think and going for the draft pick now and one in five I mean I don't even maybe they don't have a choice\nAnd then you think and going for the draft pick now and one in five I mean I don't even maybe they don't have a choice maybe when I say gosh it in to take it but I I think that they can lose on their own I don't think they have to try to lose not saying they would but um how long before that becomes a ... a definite mistake for ruining you think if it's not our at our\nLuck I saw a store yesterday at about ... I saw that at all\nSo that's I think the best for her and uh you know so what are they going to have blood I Know that at least the last year ago thought sixty to Seventy percent\nOf their best iron back of the points Oprah or another door and best players I mean\nDark ours okay I don't think he's great [noise] but uh I don't know what he has left I mean maybe the goal right now is just to accumulate as many ... as possible and that's only one who said or I'm as that may be way you've got air he took a look at the last er he just bought\nAt all and not going to be competitive as roster so you know on the order you're doing that you know best will be a day so ... ... do you take your most trade them all assets and said that when we got to her so much from that I don't want to get a bill but not a first round and maybe your\nOverall under ... ah\nYeah I I it it's baffling but what what what he thought it\nWas called ... by just question was away from the game for about ten years on you know in the bud gospel tells you a question that or it's going to be easy to come by and you lay on to the players and everything else like a ... I think it's been tough and\nI just don't know that you know and the ... for a million dollars or ... years old so\nI don't know you really think that ... really much better at this point than jak Del

I don't know what it is some kind of gentleman's agreement but a Mickey gets elected in the park where he goes to work for him I I don't I don't know but for the life of me I don't understand people\nThat ... whatever reason they maybe they just want government Raimondo for four more years\nBut when Joe trailer that was it for me when he said I don't care if I get two percent as long as I prevent phone from winning that means he's working to get Raimondo elected there's no way to get around that there's no way to run from it\nUm I've known Joe ... for many many years that Cranston police report that I read on friday was not remotely close to the story that he told us on um\nThe story that he told us on Wednesday and I get the whole thing folks people make mistakes it can happen\nThere is no such thing as a perfect campaign but then you you have to come back to just like general behavior of what what is the intention of someone running I think the intention of someone running should be to when\nPeople that run should be people running to win not to try to settle scores or I I don't know the motivation I really don't bought on Facebook and on Twitter represented Patricia Morgan\nWho I have had her on the radio more than any other radio hosts it it is uncomfortable and sad for me to watch these two people getting just\nVisceral rated by people saying I Can't believe I voted for you you're ... and there's no way to deny it no matter what they say it is ludicrous at this point for Patricia Morgan ... to say he's going to win the election I mean that is more on it [laughter]\nFrom a no can't get above forty three percent\nThe best person that has a chance to beat her is Allan Fung turn on TV every ad is an ad by the ... campaign aimed at Cranston mayor Allen ... why does that suit can beat her she's not stupid\nAnd ... why does that suit can beat her she's not stupid\nBut bunk can win this election if ... continues to get this negative\nPublicity that he's been getting and I also I haven't seen an apology\nRegarding the language that was used which is appalling I haven't seen anything and Gina Raimondo is ignoring the whole thing you know what else I wanted to take issue with I saw this business you know it was such a I I tape it but I did watch libel experiment over the weekend\nAnd it's so biased in that Wendy Schiller who I Know and respect at Brown university this so in the tank for among do it's pathetic\nAnd humble who I liked but he sets up the whole panels like all Democrats and they say well you know gene is just sitting back and uh Fong intro are in the mud well what what is mayor phones supposed to do\nRight you're on stage and this guy is calling you a pansy at a wimp and mocking you and interrupting you and what what are you supposed to do ignore him\nYou know that so I mean anyone will tell you when you're dealing with the bully if you go off and punched the bully that gets the bully to back down\nAnd you know again shame on Arlene Violet that she is lending her name to this pillow campaign of destruction I mean that that is just so pathetic to me how desperate are people like that\nThat they are willing to jump on with ... never never in a million years years ago with our lean have condone that type of action condone that type of language Arlene Violet is is backing and endorsing a candidate\nThat beat a twelve year old kid with a caulk gun when he was thirty four year old man and was using the N word\nI mean I I don't know items I sorely in this past summer theater by the sea I didn't realize that that she had it you know had become senile or delusional\nOn board with that that's who you're supporting your supporting a guy who says I don't care if I get to ... percent as long as he ... phone loses the Gina Raimondo that is not someone running to win and they're so well what what is ... supposed to do you're being attacked by someone\nYou know is that like a country saying oh in World War two you know the United states this whole thing\nFighting or ... yeah well we will bonded Pearl Harbor these are the same people after nine eleven ... lawyer the Americans they love to go fight look at them going into Afghanistan ah yeah we were attacked\nWhen you were attacked you have to fight back Arlene\nBut this Wendy Schiller oh you know governor among do sitting back and joined us watching them fight in the mud ... what are you supposed to do if you're walking down the street and someone jumps on you and such punching you and you start to defend yourself or you engaging in a fight I look at that as your defending yourself\nThe coverage is just so pathetic and for people that won't mention the police report this something funny about the police report there's nothing charming about the police report I don't care what it was\nTo use that language and what really makes it relevant\nIs it Joe ... had a chance last week and he came out and he did not tell an accurate story of what happened it's night and day he seemed to have a very vivid memory of what happened very vivid but he left out a cooking done the language the threatening the kids the whole things seem to be left out\nSo but that comment that I Am running to defeat Allen fun that tells you all you need to know and that is what people have been wondering folks is he really running to win that's what I asked if someone really running to win I'll\nTell you Bob Flanders is running to be Sheldon Whitehouse Allan Fung is running to be Gina Raimondo Geoff Diehl is running to beat Elizabeth Warren\nBut Joe troll all by his own words is running to beat Allen phone to defeat phone from being Raimondo knocked me\nI Am a Trump supporter and I'm supporting fun period there's no other way to describe it and if you're a Trump supporter and you're voting patrol oh you're voting for among do and that you know what\nAnd I someone set it on social media that at least go in and vote for him on do have the courage and ... you know what I have more respect for someone that says I'm going to vote for Gina Raimondo good for you both for give her four more years where do you see what Rhode Island looks like and four years from now I Am more respect for that\nThan someone that says a voting patrol oh\nBecause trailer was running just to get to ... percent to stop phone from meeting room on do you know what man up and just go in and and draw the line with Gina Raimondo and waiting to see what Rhode Island looks like four years from now seven six six Thirteen eighty good\nAfternoon you're next on the John ... church show hello\nGood afternoon Johnny ... or ... hello there Frank Arnett had\nYeah I just wanted to make one point you know what bothers me most about the whole thing the thing that really gets me a vote ... is the fact that he's doing a disservice not so stay for lots of people genuinely initially supported him because he was going to run for governor\nRomney yeah for this service all off to slap in the face of that I could just support this guy now selfish\nSelf employed right itself is she's running he by his own admission he's running to help Gina Raimondo get four more years as governor I\nI have no idea how to you there's no other way to take it from that that self is so we have to put up with that and I know he lived a very comfortable lifestyle Joe is an older guy he's Seventy five is going to two million dollar yacht\nIt's got a beautiful place in Florida so right after the election hills zipped down to Florida for the winter months and then come back to Rhode Island and in the summertime and sail around and his two million dollar yeah when we after all live here\n[noise] yeah like I say that's that's what gets me the most sure he was ... hey why like I said the main thing that the\n... mind them doesn't live in the type a neighborhood that joke Joe ... Joe ... very wealthy guy make no mistake about it very wealthy guy but this is he revealed on friday his motivation is not to improve the said his motivation is not\nBecause he feels that could be the best governor by his own admission his motivation to run as he said even if I only get two percent my motivation is to help Gina Raimondo get four more years as governor\nAnd like I said that's what bothers me the most and then it sort of every other states especially the people who genuinely like we're in his corner and thought this guy's going to be great is going to actually ... by the horns and changed the state's looking to track record\nW.

Pocahontas is ... is happy\nOh you are one five hundred and twelve yeah ... percent of Native American\nAnd it could be up to one one thousand twenty fourth depending on how you look at the data or it could be one thirty second the day that was very inconclusive according to the report and the New York times of all places\nSo she could be anywhere from one thirty second to one one hundred and one thousand twenty four\nWow I Wonder what tried fumes from [laughter] I don't\nI was from [laughter] I don't have that in my DNA you'll ... you'll or Indian is she is\n[laughter] although I don't know that because I think they're trying to find a today and I couldn't find it I don't know where it is but um because my grandparents came from Canada I cannot do the ... area at the beginning of the same or whatever\nIs up they were wearing a long way up in a right turn sense or after the main way way up there and um so it could be could be very possible that we\nA Indians are in our family um I Would have been but at least they would have been Canadian Indians\nYeah well my great grandfather always said that his father was half Indian\nOh my God you go to Harvard solve\nHey I mean I I\nEvery person as Indian blood in them somewhere there's a matter of fact in New York Times report I think it was in there which stated that most almost every European has more Indian blood and them Pocahontas has\n\nYeah that's what they were saying it's well she says she's got an she'll you know whatever it is is I guess I feel like\nIf you angel ... let me understand something so ... that's going to make a difference if I vote for for president because she's one fifty thousand urban India yes oh okay yeah and that means\nThat means that Trump was wrong\n[laughter]\nAnd that's the most important thing of all done\nAnd the guy that gave the DNA test yes is one of the richest guy in the country right now [laughter] and he is a hidden you've worked for Obama or something oh don't see that\nYeah yeah I I forget what his name is that there's some kind of a connection with the bombers is supposed to be a very reputable low\nAnd when he does I I thought that was interesting [laughter]\nI don't know I'm not ready to hit sensory dot com and see how do they go into that I could is one of the Native American zero I'm sure it really oh gee I I think so I mean if there's one percent I'm going to go to Harvard\nWomen Native American maybe you should have said uh Indian I don't use the way to Native American is that that means American Indians you should have just put Indian\nIndian\nNative American is a a ... that's ... that's American ness people here\nIn the end is from India well they may come to the United states indigenous people now I beg your pardon you get paid on on my show Canadian Indian okay but the fact that you are Quebec India and yeah [laughter]\nAlthough the Quebec hate the Indians adult with that anyway [laughter]\nMy grandson got ... Indian blood in\nShow high ground quite sure I'm I'm ... I'm positive ... yeah\nI I mean most Americans have Indian blood most people do somewhere along the lines\nI I just thought it was well it was part of the news today\nLike yo something else knows a professor if you're listening this report from the sea bill ... congressional budget office yes came out over the weekend because I'm a new photo was talking about it yesterday yes and he said that\nApproximately fourteen hundred people approximately one thousand five hundred people that pay taxes\nPay more in taxes now we're talking about the the highest richest people in the country so the top one approximately one thousand five hundred people pay more in taxes\nThan the Seventy percent of\nAll the low income people was that and I remember that I'm not just they just fourteen hundred people they've won Seventy percent of the tax payers and the lower incomes\nAnd by the way them rich people don't seem to get the public schools held off okay and they have private security guards\nOf course and I live in a gated communities\nYeah absolutely yes we have them to call me see I\nDon't do that but that's amazing to think on Seventy percent of the tax payers don't pay as much in taxes as at fourteen hundred people [noise] that that's just an I I heard that night and the guy repeated and repeated and I said that's that's a just mind boggling\nWell like I said last week that thirty percent of the people in the\nUh what Coney of that in in California I Can't think of the name of it um when John Wayne airport is and there's a Cook County there and well we would isn't a but thirty percent of the people of California pay a\nWhole ... know those people pay thirty percent of all the toxins California\nSay and it's a very short number of ... yeah yeah unbelievable\nAnd the the guy is done nothing Obama did nothing for the black community there I mean let's face it they they whatever that maybe they get something but it wasn't affective\nSo things are not good in Chicago\nAnd ah that's what Kennedy said I Love her I Love Kennedy she's not a Republican she's a libertarian and she just she goes with the facts and she also has strong opinions\nBut she doesn't let anybody railroad her when she's on the fight if one Williams says something that's not true she will she'll stop him\nAnd she does the same for that democratic blonde bombshell Leno noted Adrian somebody a robot el ride or ... or I don't know what her name is her first name is Adrian\nAnd judge she's a typical Democrat avoid answering the question talk over and interrupt all the people\nAnd I'm never never never concede one point\nThat's that's the problem I have they they are not truthful and they tell half truth this thing about preexisting conditions there running on that but it is not true\nThey have not taken no pre existing conditions from what I understand and Medicare and Medicaid and that whole thing John is so confusing that I just keep the same coverage year after year because I Can't deal with it I don't understand it\nI look as long as I'm not paying three hundred dollars for my prescriptions\nAnd it only costs me five dollars a month to go to a gym\nYou know why they did a I Do have co pays now which I never did before so um but I don't pay a premium I have a zero premium\nMore you know through the roof know\nWhat the doctor will pay\nI pay Fifteen dollars when I go to the doctor forty five if I go to a specialist do you know what they consider a specialist my my optometrist\nNon gruesome reminder new wrong ... year old ... books zero\nYeah that's what mine mine was zero last year\n... good coverage or one of the brands of gross\nBut I I pay a coal I pay a payment when I go to the doctor it went from nothing to Fifteen bucks\nBut I don't pay a premium every month okay\nSo I don't know what will happen because I'm supposed to go to Boston this year and um and the other thing now you need a referral from your primary care if you need to go see a specialist whatever that is\nWhat I Am you know\nYou don't eat a referral no more well that's because you must be paying a premium know what's your premium a month\n... oh my God I wow that's a lot of money\nOn Ron good I'm good coverage\nYeah I don't I don't know what my fringes I just don't\nKnow I ... I mean on on on on recovered from a girl's Robert him and I were driving front of me but I don't have in front of me when the rover\nOh maybe one day a yeah maybe we could uh compared notes one one morning\nWe we're going to ...\n[laughter] yeah were you paid for breakfast this morning we want we will yelling don't let them pay don't let we get up there and he already paid for your breakfast ...\nI Know it's not like we don't we buy a ... it's very inexpensive God you can you can uh you can't get\nA breakfast for that amount of money any way around ... ... you know\nA so anyway but as far as the national scene is concerned it's you know let's see what happens I it's a no vote in the news media in the other channels um\nYou can't say the word mob mob St John my listen he is the difference between a rally in a mob if I can take another minute of your show\nA rally is a group of people gathered in one area usually inside but it doesn't have to be it can be outside but everyone is like minded and you're there to celebrate that is a rally\nOn my job is a group of people who are willing to break laws\nTake to the streets into the air with Pete bowl\nDestroy property that's a map you can and they and they asked that comparing Trump's rallies because they took some guy oh\nOne guy out of a rally one time you know this is what's so frustrating is that there is no balance in the news media there is no truth\nThey're not telling the truth some mobs people banging on the doors of the Supreme Court and screaming that's a mob\nOf a bunch of people got sick did you hear the other day that Trump said the one night Ninety thousand people trying to get a ticket to the rally\nAnd they only had ten thousand seats well\nThat's what he said I don't know if it's true or not so somebody can fact check that but I Do know a friend of mine up in Maine won tickets when he went to Maine and was not able to get them so apparently easy as a ... and then they show the lines of people standing outside\nWaiting to get in a big difference between a rally in a mob\nOf people in this in in the mainstream media went at any rate by\nWas used to wear a warning or more time [laughter] from the beginning you're when we're all\nGood I'm good I just wanted to tell you about a fundraiser we have coming up on Saturday\nSome that were not going to be about post eighty five on river street\nNot going to be at eighty five on every street okay and what what is going to happen now\nAdding air dynamite and then the band called running wild and we're going to have found that if Iraq it goes and Ken KEN\nThat inside or outside inside I'm On a car and our ticket\nAnd that's a new beginnings\nFrom city five this Saturday yet again yeah okay All right I'm pushing okay thank you thank you don't\n[noise] sentiment that is a great\nOrganization and um [noise]\nThe gallery and has a fundraiser this week also\nWould say to them to be the the the nineteenth [noise] like the day somewhere or die bearing dynamite at\nThe ... club a quarter by the uh here it is\nThe new CEO Dara councilwoman\nIt's friday I made five eight PM acts yells club to ten dollars ... beer dynamite and me the ball or grind is that's not that's great my new because there was a door a and we've gone of course from ... uh\nThat's got a big bang out there\nTo support al in his quest 'cause he doesn't have the money the ... the uh the outside money that they have coming in I understand that the the just on the state Senate thing but it's a margarita thousands and thousands of dollars from the unions thousands\nAgainst these other candidates okay tell me she's not going to be a puppet [laughter] well what are you going to be here the puppet there so there was what you what title shingles but um our brand is is not accepting money like that\nSo he's in any help because it's very expensive to do things at a campaign\nBreakfast is served all day seven days a week and misuse family restaurant\nAnd uh I can remember very clearly because I was chairman a personnel at the time\nAnd the school the problem was that enforcing the residents are requirement Josephine Keller despite the fact that and and I'm sure you're going to remember this when they advertise for work in the paper in the legal ad it said one sock it had a residency requirements mellow\nYes and then after that when you went to fill out an application it was very clear that want to talk it out of residency requirement yes and that after when you went to get high and it was very clear and they made it very clear to you that one sock it had a residency requirement\nAnd certain exceptions could be made for periods of time hardship and everything else it was very reasonable legislation in my opinion shock\nYeah so the only a clause in their ... and it was a particular one ah let's say you you and looking for a specialist on that that ... some some positions are tough to film and what's not posing\nYou lived in ... and your fourth generation on a farm and and that if you were forced to move to win socket ... he ... he was really\nCould screw up everything in your family or depending on what you were teaching biology or whenever a that could be an exception there were the exceptions\nIt was not meant to be so draconian that it would actually punished all schools are common in yet because of the time the council president I wasn't a council president than it was on the school committee and they used to ride around with\nThe next superintendent of schools and they said you know you're killing the city with the best and brightest and then we we ended up losing\nI don't remember who that was\nWell it was John war that was on the school committee analyst Anthony ... and that was the new superintendent\nBut they had to get it on the ballot the sort of city council had a ... vote to put down on the ballot so regardless of who is trying to get it changed went out the city council voting at that time and and and like I say when the city when socket taxpayers voted to do away with residency\nThat ... that belongs in trivial pursuit\nDown here because you're right I don't the the millions and millions of dollars but not only did the money's sandwich socket but all of the teachers and policemen and firemen and ... although of public works where 'cause we're living in neighborhoods would improve the neighborhoods ... if you're a teacher\nIn neighborhoods would improve the neighborhoods you if you're a teacher like when I brought up in the amount we mayors living in ... we had teachers living in ... family living in fear or firefighters policemen well if I'm a policeman I own a three family house you think I'm going to I'm a ... second Florida ... was\nNot going to do that they've been doing all\nIt would have been and it still could be except at some point in time we have to add leader so much stronger much more vocal and Lisa for Delhi\nTo show the state that you know without without dramatic changes that are and how to be particular to the city one socket at this point in time\nThere was no escaping this there was literally no escaping the ignorance in poverty that we have without doing something a out of the box\nWhen ... ... a role in the year that the state passed a state law ever prohibiting that from going on a ballot again in a city or town I Wonder how long ago when I was you know ...\nIt's probably in the in the early nineties because or mid nineties 'cause that's what I think I was on personnel I Can't remember\nThe whole know when when we when we vote in a way when we vote voted down a ... ... the we it was still alive or would you want to put it on the ballot in other cities and towns that it was later than that\nWay many years after that to somebody passed a law that you could not have residency in Rhode Island anymore a state law\nAnd I'm Wondering what year that was I'd like to know when general assembly people voted on that\nI I had occasion to be and how it's called the other I Know how it's public library the other day and in the old days I used to go and loves to look at the micro fish yeah look at the newspapers and see who did what and how it transpired and\nAnd not that I ever found the one socket call to be totally reliable and they're reporting but\nWhen you go back and and you were you look at it fresh is your memory and you're going like\nThe people who really care and love the city should research this and in a new city plan of whoever that may be at some point in time needs to become so educated and what's happened and what needs to happen in the city want socket plus affect any change that I just want to again with the I Do not think\nThat even after five years lease has been a total of ... she is not smart enough for the job she hasn't been able to do anything she's too insecure or she needs to many people around here all the time that have literally had no it's all set up and again after that I'm looking to some papers that I\nHave on the counter and and it was the valley please and his wallet he'll plaza and again it speaks to the fact that these people came in ... valley\nPaid multiples of what they had to sell the property for lost a ton of money millions of dollars just to escape one socket Lisa ball deli and are horrific tax rate and her lack of economic development and despite the fact she has all these people on the payroll is consultants\nWe should be calling these people and asking them what kind of communications they had with the city and obviously they sold it they sold it at a huge loss or what do you think at least say here\nAre so anyway I just wanted to bring that up it was in the usa came in over my phone and ... and it was a refrain from a Wall Street journal article and and that's pretty sad she's a little ...\nIs it about ... we got the wall Street Journal every day is it you\nKnow no no well I get I get in on this Amazon phones that they say that what you're interested in whether it's the economy of the Federal Reserve a law okay\nAnything and I'll get I'll get articles from the wall street I'll get USA Today I'll get a old articles from everywhere and that's where it came from came and\nI sent it like I said to the gym because I had is a email a message and I I think I might be able to send it to you because I think I can message you\nHave like that I Will I Hope you can okay thank you that thanks for calling my\nNeeds to say this is about the mayor okay and um had never\n\nMaybe have an opinion

uh I've always been the underdog all my life Jeff just like most people are eighty percent of the people in this country and in the city around the dogs and I've always a a\nLifted up the underdogs and are always went for them um once again here we are I'm going to give a message today to the citizens of one socket um and again this broadcast is brought to you and paid for by friends of Richard fragments complement [noise]\nUm I saw this in the newspaper today and I and I thought\nIt was relevant and er James Madison one of our founding fathers\nWas relevant and er James Madison one of our founding fathers are I Believe he was talking about me [noise] um we often said Mr Smith goes to Washington\nBut in Seventeen eighty eight is the state's considered ratification of the constitution James Madison acknowledged and federal is fifty one that does drawn to a public service we're not all angels\nCreating an inherent difficulty and establishing a government in men is administered by imperfect beings James Madison founding father what was he trying to say\nJust your average or a man and woman are running for politics are trying to make a difference um\n... no one's an angel no one's perfect we don't want people that are perfect and or if that's what they want if people want you know somebody who is perfect um you're not going to find it okay and\nUh this was one of the socket call today under a one of the uh of publications syndicated publications and you know I read the call from page to page ... I thought it was very relevant about me okay I'm a wage will never admitted I it was hard worker absolutely\nThat's the thing no matter what I've ever tried to do in my lifetime some people were pretty they were smarter they you know drove a nicer car but you know what I learned\nIf I put in a hundred and ten percent I can beat a hundred percent of the people one hundred percent of the time\nJust by working and that's what I've always done and I've always challenge Richard fragment no matter\nDid in my lifetime to be the best that I can be and what's wrong with that\nSo let's move on um I Want to do a little different today just a little bit just to get off base\nAnd I want to talk about uh what's happens in the last three years in one socket as far as taxes on residential and commercial there's a lot of people out there and that's just fresh off the press um\nI don't know spreadsheet and it says well soccer residential tax decrease since two thousand and fifty [noise] this is not made up by me this is something that was given to me today at my request and\nAn six forty and for something I said I wouldn't sell it for less than seven hundred thousand seven hundred eleven thousand so we're going to see what's gonna happen\nOr would have to look and see what kind of a um\nPeace commercial property will be put in on that field I mean I feel so being utilized the lights go on way of our little ah football players playing there and practicing and you know it's an I feel um I grew up on a outfield Providence street feel\nOne of my goals okay this is my platform how many other people come out with a five four I haven't heard any you're going to have a platform what's your goals if you don't have goals it's like playing basketball without hoops what's the sense\nI Want to recruit small businesses are proponents through economic development that's the backbone of the city and the country Fifteen Percent of these entrepreneurs are the growth of this country\nContinue to vote yes on a city parks all the improvements um I Want to tell people let 'em\nGo talk is open what all the new equipment um my family we've donated a park bench the I was in the morning the slab is in cement slab is in\nUh we're just waiting for it to cure so we can put the boat holes in there and then a tire down and I'm ... look like we're gonna have a ... possibly ceremony if I can get everybody coordinated sometime the end of this week if not beginning of next week\nThey might even be Saturday because my a small family a nice comes from dairy New Hampshire\nSo that'll be put them\nIn memory and my sister late system Adrienne Murphy who died a year ago from COPD very horrible deaths from that type of disease and she was only Seventy years old ah\nI miss her now I'm the only one left in the immediate family\nYou know we need to lobby without representatives and senators to get more money out of the state Jeff so I plan on doing that a lot um\nBecause we need a new formula for the schools we need to grow the population with good quality people that want to work so we can get these big companies to come in because right now when I talk to different companies in big companies they say there's no workforce here\nBut yet I Believe our unemployment rate is over six percent\nSo the state is like for something and we're six six six twenty four percent and when socket so we've got some people that need to be employed\nUm\nWe need to work on the single problems and doing one at a time and the council an administration all have to work together we have to throw this us against them and just click and this uh\nUh\nWe're going to keep the mayor accountable and a little bit but we all need to work together let's not forget who voters here the citizens they want us to work together we always going to agree no but the we have to discuss it like little children out in the school year I'd do we have to be like little five year olds and I've been guilty of that\nAnd I'll admit it I\nBut I think\nI've taken my Ohio the ball on what I originally wanted to do in sixteen Seventeen and Eighteen because of a lot of the in fighting a lot of the eagles throw your ego out the door when you get to the council meeting\nOkay you're out there for a reason and that reason as the taxpayers the citizens and the good welfare of the people\nThe choices clear folks\nIf you like what I've done for the last twenty two months and you like a guy I mean let's face it would you like would you want me and you foxhole okay if you had a first\nA capital offense murder one would you hire\nA lawyer like me or someone the guy that you're definitely going to jail for the rest of your life say that's what you do I became a tool of the people I speak for the people who wish they could go up and speak\nAnd those are the people who are elected being sixteen and I believe those are the same people that are going to come out rally and vote for me for reelection into Eighteen remember the last election twelve thousand people came out\nThe mayor got eight thousand votes I got forty four hundred so I mean Seventy six hundred people didn't vote for me so who voted for me was it the Trump type people\nOr was it the veterans I'm a veteran\nEight years I said the Rhode Island the Army National guard proudly honorable discharge said you long term commitment chef or the married for forty two years been with the same woman from forty five years I've run my own little business for the last twenty four years in one socket screen printing embroidery\nI don't do as much as I used to because hey I'm a little old now\nBut I set my goals\nAnd I accomplish um I'd I don't send them to high because if you send them to hide and you don't make them you lose interest\nSo if you set your goals short term goals long term goals at a nice pace\nAnd you make them you know you start feeling a little confidence a little more confident and I've been in the worst business there is in the history of life sales you know many knows that I've received since forty years now and buying from you know I ... doors slammed in my face so\nI'm so used to the nose that when I get it yes it's like I Won the lottery [laughter] [noise]\nFan about two more minutes here with a Richard faggot fastest twenty five minutes and radio and that you didn't have a meeting tonight will be ah I'm looking forward to the\nMeeting tonight you know I really really am I'm but I'm looking forward to getting this election over so we get back to work 'cause this is basically a a you know I Wish it was every four years rather than to 'em because you just get finished you get your feet wet you get some things rolling in the next thing you know is election time again you know\nUh my question than the average citizen and sixteen was if you were never invited to the popular girl boy stable then vote for me and we the average citizen will have a seat at that table I mean that\nYou do have a seat at that table you know and I said let's say I I guess I'm a pretty much a geeky guy had never wanted to admit that but I Am you know and uh I was never invited to the popular girl boy stable\nAt all and those are the people have pointed at you and they laughed at you because you are different you your head was different you address different that's still the way it is today ... called the peer pressure so\nYou know if you want your voice and you want a seat on the city council for the next two years then you got out on November six and vote for Richard fragment for reelection it's not a popularity contest\nUh so I I Would say that\nPresident Trump has a lot of detractors in in Rhode Island ah so I I Would say that's what they're trying to do you are taking advantage of the fact that there were a lot of people who don't like the president who live in Rhode Island so I'm getting they they figure you know let's\nMake sure those people don't vote for oh Alan from\nOkay so let let's let's just discard all the good stuff like you just mentioned the lowest unemployment rate to countries getting out on its feet again\nI'm looking to see this country self sufficient again ... and not have to rely on products from China and Indonesia and Vietnam and Japan all\nWe should become independent again that's what Trump's trying to do make this country the way it was ... what were you went to the moon back in the sixties okay you said that Saturn five rocket was dealt with any parts in China do you think it was built with any parts from Indonesia or Japan\nOr Vietnam or Guam or Mexico or you fill in whatever other country knows all in a house we did our own stuff back then\nAnd now right you are correct we did\nOkay and you know what that's the way we have to be again we have to be self sufficient we're not going to be able to defend all the time on Saudi Arabia for oil or China for chief televisions and in parts that break we have to make our own stuff has to be self sufficient\nWhat's wrong with that there's absolutely nothing wrong with that\nNo I I tend to agree with you and I am better then later it to be honest\nWith you I'd love to see us or be able to take care of our own needs maybe we would end up with products that are better made as well uh [laughter] I mean we've\nCome a long way technologically ah you know I mean sure I I'd met there are times and the you know in the past ... products made in usa weren't the best and China and Japan especially I think it was Japan that came out with better cars you know and and you know\nYeah we've had that but you know our techno technology has grown we can build our own cell phones are all night falls on computers or own cars their own [noise]\nUm or whatever so in the blank you know\nWe can do that but we have to get the workers and you know we have the Democrats oh you don't have to work oh no we'll give you welfare we'll give you all these handouts and all that led always Caitlin from\nFrom Mexico and all that flooded the country have no jobs and you know what did you write about one thing that the unemployment is is the lowest it's been ... since when since the sixties\nYeah they say since Nineteen sixty nine which was during the Vietnam War and a few remember we had a lot of people in the service at that time\nUh in right now I Would say we were in what we would call peace time we're not fighting or any major ones that I'm aware of so I'm In the population is a higher than it was then so you you put all that together and the fact that\nThe unemployment rate is as low as it was in sixty nine I think it's quite an accomplishment\nYeah and and there's nothing wrong with that it's it's it is a ... not just a accomplishment is the accomplish ... is something that no other president in in ... at least that I can be aware of since a Bill Clinton\nHad occurred to lay claim to I mean you and you also got a trunk going to North Korea to get them the nuclear eyes I'm African American and Hispanic unemployment is the lowest rate it's ever been mhm\nDo they and they have the brash and then they have the brass ones to cause trouble racist I mean really when you think about it\nI mean he you know African Americans and Hispanics the lowest unemployment in the history so far that I'm aware of and they have the gall to call Trump are racist not asking that he's not racist and what\nIf fungus for a President Trump than you know I Know who I Want in the Capitol building is governor for the state not Gina Raimondo wash a sling mud saying oh he's with Trump\nNow I Want Alan song wide because he's with Trump and maybe just navy phone will do the same thing for the state of Rhode Island that said that a President Trump's doing some of the nation\nYou know that's a good way of looking at it well we'll see what happens we wish you\nYet ... says if he if he has the same mindset of that I think song's could be a really great governor message my opinion but you know what\nHe's he he you know if he asked that same mindset then we got to get him in this we can't have any more this garbage that goes on in the state serious and we don't we can't can't afford it anymore\nNo I hear you loud and clear [laughter]\nLook what's going on in California just research what's going on in California socialism really works out I wouldn't

I I don't understand why we need a new I\nKnow that that to me is a ridiculous reason for not exploring the possibility of policing that land or selling it off or whatever I mean a really uh [laughter]\nBut you know Larry ... why would we need to build a new law school or high school was built not not that long ago now I mean there are buildings in New ... over a hundred years old\nNot only that but governor romano's pushing for her big big uh uh\nYou know expenditure there should fix up all the schools in Rhode Island she wants to everybody to go out and\nSupport the bond issue the multi million dollar bond issue so I'm sure a lot of that money's going to be coming to one sock it to make any repairs plus they've already invested a lot of money in necessary repairs which was the thing to do you know you build a building and I knew you keep it up by you know that it is and it's in good shape\nI mean governments Lowry are horrendous at maintaining building well we know that ah yeah they're great at building new buildings at but there are horrible at putting enough money in the budget every year to properly maintained the buildings\nTo properly modest modernize dumb as necessary and do the required repair mhm mhm we know that there were also doing that\nAnd that has to change 'em because private business doesn't a chair down their buildings every week and build new boat voting no and you know you can ... your time\nAnd you can drive through a lot of communities that are still using schools that are that were built in the early uh last century and or they're in good shape they're very usable\nUh I mean we see that all the time I mean you you look what they're going to be doing at park place they're going to be converting that and I mean the building itself is still structurally sound to the point where it's going to be converted into condos\nYou know so a mom and whatever so uh I I\nAgain it's a it's always interesting that you know that what we can do with the old buildings but then when it comes to the government they don't want any part of it you know it's got to be new to be better to be new\nSeems my other question Larry uh we had a a population explosion in Woodstock\nWe all know I bet if you go far enough in your family tree you're going to find some ah indigenous American blood in you as well uh it goes on and seemed like everybody at one time or another are probably we see some of that blood for\nMy son said you you know my son he says yeah it goes far enough back it guarantees African\nThere you go I I think if you go far enough uh you know we're all related [laughter] all on all the continents [laughter]\nSo anyway so I guess we're claim that you know in the media is running with is the way you know I guess the ... percent you know the thing that she's like one thirty seconds now what it is\nYeah that's the that's I guess that's the number they use them but anyways if you if you go into the story a little further you know they say this is a\nProfessor from Stanford University that specializes in a genome genetics and tracing ancestry isn't this that and the other thing mhm well if you if you're really in the lives of I guess you know this is just what I heard I haven't checked it out myself yet but apparently they don't have enough\nDNA from indigenous American tribes to make comparisons to so they matched are up against some are indigenous Mexican Peruvian in Colombian Indian\nType DNA and they say yeah this this is a really good chance that there's a match to that ...\nNow she claimed she was Cherokee either and I mean so if she was Cherokee that's one thing but if for one thirty second portion of DNA doesn't even relate back to the Cherokee it relates back to me the Mexican Peruvian a Colombian what does that really mean you know what I mean\nYeah well even if she was um\nI don't know even if she was fifty percent or indigenous uh what difference would it make I mean I when I look at it I just look at what she has accomplished or you know ... in the Senate and ... you know I and our politics and I I\nDon't have much use for the lady\nI Know I agree with you there but the this was all going to come down to win an argument in a I'm In\nA claim that was made and and they're you know the opposition to Elizabeth Warren is going to hammer home the fact that she claims on her applications to colleges all law schools or whatever she claims to be\nNative American in order to gain some type of affirmative action special treatment uh-huh okay now let's just say\nFor the purpose of argument you I Will say she is one thirty second ... one thirty second that's point old three to\nNot even one percent ... now if you are less than one percent of anything are you going to claim that to be your incest drill heritage and\nYour genetics you you're less than one percent of some things that the what is that the one percent you're going to claim as being the majority of your ancestry are you going to go with the other night a night\nWell that's a good point I I don't think the average person would the would consider that anything worth mentioning\nAnd so now why would you put that on an application and claim this to be a position if you weren't looking for ... to gain some type of affirmative action preferential treatment\nYou probably wouldn't [laughter]\nThere you go okay yeah and and everybody in the on the left in the media on television all of her you know over supporters they're all saying well look it's proven now it's proven mhm it's science ... you can argue with science right\n[laughter] okay but then the same people when you come out and you say hey look\nIf you have an ex X chromosome you're a female mhm and these same people that say oh now do you remember stopping backed the truck up there it'll make that assumption just because they have ... sex chromosome don't make them female if they don't want to associate with being female female\nBut these are the same people now that we got claim science has proven Elizabeth Warren's claims to be true\nInteresting isn't the times we live in interesting exactly oh [laughter] All right

William ... in the middle of the mix too\nOn that race might stand out in your mind for the whole season race number six is that correct\nOh yeah that was definitely right about out um I think for a vault free toss 'em\nRight up gang I got bonding time back then for the wall and a law firm to lead the whole fact of the power all car off so that that track arrows for effect so I had\nHer for bad and then under caution though another bank or are we polled then micro is able to make a\n... a ... out of the fact that actually helps a lot\nWhen back out there at that point I hung up by a lot so\nI was putting it all out there and all that right Ben thanks very end up the phone call and ask for a number far but\nYeah that really kept your writing contention and all the divisions in ... New England oddly guess Kay light up at the staff at two guys who are in a dead heat when one race to go and they took each other out in the championship brace and one got it because he led the last lap\nBy two points but the late model division race a race number seven you had mathematically for or even five race car drivers within twenty nine points of fifty in first and I'll tell you [laughter]\nI don't know if there was racing on gambling involved in that in a state of Connecticut but there must have been a lot of money spread across the board and I don't know if Nick Johnson was in the top on the bed he would do seasoned veterans in\nThat group and especially you have to run that carry had and race six he was so dominant you knew he was coming back with a good machine\nAnd then I noticed that um I'm Brian tango form a champion and ... and a few of the older guys did not run a fuel a full schedule this year they ended the mix to to really fat and up the field that must have had your news on that\n\nUm the whole weekend my nerves were on it and\nWe are actually it was before the he writes for the house most nervous because the heat race points I knew Oregon and be a big Saudi factor and I came out and finished second in the heat Carey was second in the heat so I Know I've maintained a\nMy position there and I ended up originally I thought it was a four point lead that are held thought it was actually a seven point lead so actually\nAt the end of the race we weren't even sure if we won the championship for now and it was a whole weekend all around\nOkay no good an email here from Bangor Maine from an Nicky and she wants to know is the rumor correct was that rape parents' old car from two thousand Seventeen that form a champion ... that you ran this year\n\nOn now not it was a race car and probably he sold it and I'd say two thousand stick team to my uncle actually and that was supposed to be my cousin Jake backup car but they never use that and I was\nThe car was running a time when I was getting older and we want to update so we ended up\nPicking it up from my own soul and the more to it and then when I write write off for al Assad science friendly happy with our um I couldn't have done it without the help or Jeff Taylor bracing chassis is a it was huge and are they going to get us wherever we were\nWas ...\nActually a lot of them had I think are only like five races on it though so we still a pretty good power through the whole year\nOkay what a fantastic yeah you know you look at it and it was only a seven re season but still [noise]\nTo do what you did with all the top cans everybody had one ... year and you stayed away from that and that's that's proved to be the championship move on that\nAnd um you know we see ... with the big boys and a ... cat\nOne an escape modified division went up there with Stan ... without a win on his here and two thousand Fifteen driving the number six\nSo consistency does pay off in a specially like you brought up that point on the heat race point very very important to accumulate them in the course of the year those seven races times four point can mean the difference between a championship and the second place\nThat it really can and uh that was one of the things that made me nervous about it was definitely the heat race points\nSo there's no chance of you coming back fulltime at times into repeat as the late model championed\nUm\nI wouldn't say there's no chance but that's a pretty good chance but I'm not going to run for the championship there again just because a\nChampionship bang early for us all are just going out the really have fun and that's what's so great about the short answer all their that I've really enjoyed and uh that place\nWell there but I really enjoyed and uh that played the ... and early and honor them very often right in there early for income for Bill that right there and say well\nOkay so there's new management and place for next year at times and uh Josh going out or is out in a whole new team is coming in\nAnd the rumor is a Saturday Night racing was Sunday that's been going to be taught at the table here to save for next year would that have the changing your plans if they went to a full Saturday Night or a Sunday program would that change your plans\nUm\nMaybe a little bit because ah we're pretty heavy rain the car with my brother and stuff and then Iraq for star they're\nAlmost weekly depends um\nI'd say they're more likely author or what I Do but not really because I'm not really planning on running full schedule there though even if it was\nEvery week I probably show up on like five times or something you\nWill tell you put on hold the shown on one of thank you for a really supply and ... and just see and to tame and at times and every time you showed up I said there's the kid again he still consistent he's still doing it\nAnd I said he's going against some heavyweights but you know I've seen them race in the past and he's got a good machine and a short season just about anything can happen in you proved that\nAnd I want to congratulate you on this great prestigious honor and one of the toughest divisions around I don't care if it's seven raises a twenty seven raises you beat the best of the bath\nThank you\nAlready knew what a I used to in school now\nRight now I'm a sophomore Roger Williams university so I got to go though\nA sophomore in school with a championship on your Mandel\nYep\nThat proves anything's possible in short track raised in the New England and we're on and to have you on the race to show\nYou how safe for the championship and we'll see you um\nSome other races coming up all you have one coming up one last big one down and ... down there and the pets and we'll see you at the icebreaker time next year and we'll see what the plans changed over the winter and um see exactly what's on your plate", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city":
