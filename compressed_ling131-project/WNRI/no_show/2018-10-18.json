been saying this is now a two person race\nAnd Gina Raimondo was asked and she said oh no no no I I I Need for low in the race I watch real on this stage Gina Raimondo will not be Alan phone you know one on one setting because she would lose and she's always known she would lose\nAnd what turned it for me I was going to remain neutral on this\nI was because I've known Joe ... a long time and I was going to remain neutral but the actions of Patricia Morgan and Joe ... over the past month or not\nThe same actions of people that I repeatedly would support and have on the radio all the time all the time so I'm I don't understand any of it there is no legitimate reason for a vendetta not this is ridiculous\nAnd even you know within the Providence Journal a joke pillow when he was asked about the

Am because there's there's no reason to disband him\nIs do element there's no reason to be ... like this and all this is going to do is help Gina Raimondo by and telling you I think\nYou need you could be proactive and caught some of these people why not they don't have an opinion of who they are going to vote for I've never ... year what part of being a talk show host\nIs you're literally paid to give your analysis and your opinion on things if you have an opinion on who you're voting for what could you see that's why these people a sub par\nThey are ... you know Joe and Joe can be a

story on this ... this thing um we never learned what the Lincoln town council did maybe I'm In the maybe um if there's another page to the story\nUm it says because uh one of the council is notion motion to continue the conversation to the November twenty seventh right I don't\nThink up pages printed so my apologies to Nicole for I'm I'm for saying that it wasn't um it wasn't finished so anyway the council and Lincoln is continuing to another date and that is um the story from Lincoln\nI'm One of the things um\nThat I find interesting is the death\nOf a news reporter and I'd like you know we'll be discussing this uh this is a kind of a heavy subject for this time of the day but I just wanted to give a little viewpoint [noise] there was this guy and he is um he's from Saudi Arabia\nAnd he's a he's a journalist for\nThe Saudi a country you know from that country that's where he originates from he goes to the Saudi embassy\nIn Turkey and uh apparently somebody murdered him in the embassy and the story is um you know of national international consequence and I was just watching but while I was at the gym last night as CNN was covering this with great interest while\nFox was covering a medal of honor presentation to a Vietnam veteran from a Nineteen sixty eight um there was a big white house ceremony absolutely\nNo interest on the part of of this journalist now to CNN [noise] this is as far as they're concerned a journalist\nKilled in an embassy in another country and I remember it has nothing to do with the United states this is of grave concern to the United states and\nAnd I was just wondering Dave whether in fact even though we do not like to see anybody die um you know needlessly is whether in fact this was a troubling you at all when you went to sleep or last night or whether this is an incident that the United states as\nUm should be concerned about and whether a President Trump should be blamed for because he certainly um is getting so much criticism from CNN a\nDo have it on the as soon as they have a a subject for a quarter or seven in ...\nUm well [noise] I heard about it right yeah but I thought I had one part different than you I thought that he was a resident of the United states I don't know he's a ... says apparent killing of us resident Jamal ...\nCash valley says lesson that does this and then it says he's also and then it says in the same story a Saudi citizen in Washington Post contributor [noise]\nSo as a U.S resident 'cause I think if he is that's a different story if he's a U.S resident you can't let foreign embassy us residents get impressed a than writer was killed by\nFrankly David the first time I've heard that he had anything to do I knew I knew he was a contributor yeah not a reporter for the Washington Post it was a contributor first time I've heard of any us connection uh I've kept hearing you as a ...\nA resident and um and this was like I said the first time I've heard that he had a U.S citizenship connection\nYeah well that's why if I think if he has no if he's just a contributed to the Washington Post and he's not a U.S citizen it's a totally different story but I was under the impression it was that he was so I was saying like well we can't let foreign countries kill our\nOur reporters because they don't like what we're reporting on him\nThat would be a totally different story now if he's not I mean I don't think it's right it's strange but I think if you're a Saudi citizen I think you are aware of the dangers of writing out against the Saudi princes it's a horrible world that we live in when they constrict the ability of people to share their own opinions on things\nAnd they have no real right ... universal right to do that they make them horrible people but it's what they do\nAs one former U.S general uh interviewed by Fox yesterday said this is a common occurrence of a journalist disappearing in South America Russia China happens ah fifty times a year\nAnd and I'm not saying it's right by the way but it's not I don't think it's the United states' role to go play throw but I Will say this if he's a U.S citizen that is unique because you just don't see that like that would be like um you know take one of the Providence Journal writers and they go and they go to a foreign embassy in Europe and they end up getting killed\nTake a look back and you there's a picture of him or doesn't look like much of a U.S citizen if I Am or ... no that's him a lot\nCitizen if I Am or ... no that's him a that I'm sure a because I've seen his picture now for the past I'm a week and ah he was almost like use like my brother I mean I see his picture is image up so much he's dressed in a\nArabic clothing and he has been portrayed all\nWeek as a citizen of Saudi Arabia and as a member of the news organization and um and like I said I'm I'm I'm having to reassess this a connection to the U.S that you just brought to my attention well I'll think about

[laughter]\nI Am no fashion statement that's for sure where you are today well thank you Mr Bush a them good morning to everybody and walk into a program one no one else that we did get a winner\nOf our trip to Orlando and the other person I talked to by telephone she hasn't come in with the actual button a yet but um she knows her digits and um I think it was a let me check here\nThey will invest I'm so and then there's what we call a special interest investors\nThey're interested in only transportation an airline transportation the only thing they they they want to do is um put their money wherever there's an airplane involved and I think that you know where they are probably some people who are believing surface transportation like a commuter rail and\nThen it might not be a good\nUm money investment a financial investment but that's where they you know and if you've got the money is where they want to spend their money so I don't know if he's got that kind of investor behind him\nWell let me rephrase and simplify the question did you leave feeling that it would happen in two thousand twenty\nI'm half and half yeah um you know it or he's still got a ways to go but um you know there are some people that um you know they're always people who are\nSuspicious or who are are shall we say uh taking uh the half empty of view of the expected him to be gone you know last year that that uh he wouldn't be around even talking about the project so the fact that he's still here\nAnd um and you know had a presentation that seems reasonable there was nobody I think the left the building that said they ain't gonna work that\nI I bet you everyone left the building hope and he's very successful yeah I I think um and I mentioned is probably a year two years ago three years ago when it first came up is that is going to have a positive impact on our\nReal estate prices if in fact we can expand the area you know if people can cost we take a train to west or you know maybe they were for the hospital or they can go to Providence and not say rep they're already you know it's I I don't\nDo a among the pass anymore and I don't know what it is but it was like two fifty five for a month or when I Walk downtown Providence south Eighteen dollars a day\nTwo fifty five for a month or when I Walk downtown Providence now it's Eighteen dollars a day is how I take it so if he can compete with that and make people comfortable and be able to work while they're on the train and come back\nIs clearly going to have a positive way back in the communities though question about it\nKnown as the successful in a situation like you're not always in Providence everyday right you know I mean and maybe in the old days you had to be there every day but maybe maybe you do have to be there every day\nOh no no I made a conscious effort a couple of years ago with my two offices won a him with socket and one in Providence that I go by the day\nOr they treat me like I I guess I was a monthly therefore um many years they treat me really good if the if the places full they still find a spot for me but no I Choose to go by the day which is Eighteen dollars a day I'm you know right

mind that keep changing my mind every thirty seconds I'm going around in circles I Wish I could vote for everyone well we'll have another batch for you a little bit later in the show [laughter]\nOh come back to the front program seven six medals six hundred of the telephone number love to hear from you in any topic whatsoever what topic would you like to talk about now that we've talked about train so\nI I think that says less about when sock it more about Rhode Island but there was an article yesterday in the valley breeze when sock initiate second crackdown on out of state legislation registration violators so basically if you're living uh in Rhode Island but yeah you have a mass amass plate that that's a problem and the\nTheir the chief is quoted here in the mayor's quoted here I guess there are fifty for motor vehicle citations and to me that's not a win socket problem instead just before that there would island problem it's like East Germany West Germany nobody ever decide they want to cross over from West Germany to East Germany or we have a terrible attack system here\nAll the contacts which has been my pet peeve which I'm hoping gets phased out I was watching the um the uh go into a debate a replay last night and I'm all for candidates\nHave a short that they want to see a continue but this is really a problem with how unfair Rhode Island is with the tax system and that's a consequence that the chief and the mayor have to deal with it\nBut if we can lower our taxes and create a more a level playing field there'll be no reason for people to try to sneak around so I I think\nIt it just lousy at the state has to deal with this and it's worth down and\nAnd I guess the city could ignore it they've chosen not to but um I like to see\nAnd I guess the city could ignore it they've chosen not to but um I like to see in the near future where people were actually doing the opposite where\nAt ... the place to be because of taxes lower so that that's just my commentary there is that our taxes are just super super high in Rhode Island\nAh and then this one here I'm not going to a dispute you in any way a kind of like a [noise] a foot print a opinion less dangerous I Hope the next topic or we can go into different directions\nAnd I always mentioned is because even\nIntelligent well positioned people maybe have a wrong view of the world so uh I think his name was Mr Watson in the Nineteen fifties he was the c._e._o. of IBM and he said\nPublicly that might be room for about five computers in the world right now and Bill Gates and Paul Allen their vision was to have a computer basically in every household and I counted the number of computers last night I was preparing if you count my iPhone\nWhich I consider a computer ... I ... you know I I really do I think most people do have a fourteen computers in my house between high pads in IMAX\nAnd and and all the rest and you know although those weren't designed a by Microsoft there are some Microsoft components in terms of worried and things like that but think about that\nIntelligent person like Watson heading up the largest computer company in the world IBM said there's room for about five computers in the world and right in my house every two thousand Eighteen I've got fourteen of them and I'm sure I'm not the only ones triple probably have twenty twenty five of them so I think I I wanted to mention a his passing\nYou know bought the Portland TrailBlazers bought the Seattle Seahawks are very very interesting guy and I'm\nYou know his passing over he'll be missed\n[noise] no the example that you used um uh just uh to try to localize it would be something like what goes on in the valley breeze the face of the valley breeze is Tom ...\nBut there is a guy in the background of who has been with him a from a day one you saw in the background I don't know if I can even remember his name but he is the deputy publisher\nOf the valley breeze he is the guy that does all the graphics work\nIn the background was the question I'm Jamie Clint yeah right Jamie ... thank you\nAnd I'm ... you know I Would think that if I asked Tom Ward ... you know how would the valley breeze be functional ah he certainly wouldn't leave him out of the equation in terms of um\nOf being an important part of why the valley breezes what the valley breezes so I just wanted to give that local example I think of who that guy yet and ...\nAre they I think it's a very Britain example also way sometimes is the people behind the scenes are just as important and interestingly enough not to put a a money spent on it but I'm Bill gates\nHung on to most of his Microsoft shares and that's why Bill Gates was worth a lot more money a Bill Gates um as I as I mentioned a little lower earlier Paul Allen upon his passes what about twenty billion dollars and incredible amount of money and Bill Gates is probably worth\nCloser to a hundred billion dollars and people probably know that\nBill Gates cells five million shares as as a five day like a year ago five years in the open market over a Microsoft to basically diversify\nBut the lion's share of his net worth is so Microsoft and here he is teaming up with a Warren Buffett basically they gave him most all of it away he and Warren Buffet probably given about forty billion dollars of their wealth to or where the charities forty\nBillion yeah as a matter of ...\nIncredible figure\nIt is and and they've made a difference you know we're both for ... uh and uh getting rid of polio around the world has been a target of Oz\nA internationally and Bill Gates has given close I think it's it's at least five hundred million dollars might be closer to a billion dollars just to the rotary international to eradicate\nPolio and it's very difficult to find so when you find something that's worthwhile like that and you make a difference I just think people should recognize that you know people who've made that money have made a decision to to get rid of it\nA ... him and his wife who signed the pledge that they're going to dispose of Ninety nine percent of their shares of Facebook\nA upon their demise to give to various charities so a lot of this I guess so you know a lot of welcomes a lot of responsibility a lot of people take it very seriously [noise]\nUm I guess I can tell your other topics treasury employee U.S Treasury employed tried for the financial information that you uh see that yes I did isn't that unbelievable I'm the president comes out with these crazy a accusations and\nMore than not they're proven to be correct so his his political allies like Paul Manafort and everything or their their financial information kept you by the U.S treasury was actually sent to reporters and linked to report is in\nIn a very very uncomfortable way just to kind of take a step back all of us are under this a standard and they've never raise it for inflation for years\nIs a standard and they've never raise it for inflation for years and years that I can remember but if you go to the bank with twenty thousand dollars in cash\n'em that's an unusual amount of cash in the bank or record it and then the U.S treasury they look at it and say well what's what's Chris Rogers doing with that kind of cash\nAnd is there a pattern and how there are a lot of people going there to the bank with nine thousand five hundred and fifty dollars and making you know forty eight deposits over given\nPeriod of time to hide money those things are reported to the U.S treasury treasury looks at those things so this could affect any one of us so the things that are supposed to be private ... fleet\n... the director president and linked to the media and uh it's done by the treasury so and the president tweaks out a tweet out these things saying you know there after me this is what they're doing and it sounds bad but you're not paranoid if people are really out to get your right\nYeah and there are there are people out there to get you know I mean I can see that sometimes when you um well I was gonna say when you look at Facebook\nBut when I'm told about what happens on Facebook or you can see that um they're individuals that um if they if they don't like you they're going to a\nThey're going to try to discredit you in some way yeah and you have to deal with it\nAnd we straighten it out with political ads and WN our eyes verdict would clear the air\nOr you much of a Facebook guy or um or if you just use it for the send pictures and happy go lucky stuff um\nIt's never it's it's never my intention nowhere to be to express allied anything really negative ... usually it's a a picture of my beautiful wife maybe it's me and Tom Brady and it's something about the patriots and not much about the red Sox four and a half hours is a little too much for me I I went to sleep and the fourth any\nEven when they win the game that might send them to the world series I die baseball game is worth that amount of time\nI feel like I'm I'm getting older and I feel like maybe I'm feeling well like you but\nWhat I like to see the red socks went absolutely what bothered me in the ways that they lost an extra games really wanted I I it's it's to me it's the patriots and then everyone else and like a day pointed out this morning you know four and a half hours ... they're they're ruining the sport they're playing in cold weather although not Houston\nOr there will be playing if they come back to Boston it it it doesn't excite me fly I just don't get excited by it\nLast friday night the red Sox play Houston I think in the first game and I did not see it but uh I was at the gym\nAnd I didn't even know the score of the game [laughter] so there I Am it's a Saturday morning and so how does the red Sox Dula while I thought one on the Internet I ... I found a ten minute summary\nOf the red Sox game with every significant pitch\nAnd hit and catch there could be it was so quick\nAnd a and one inning by inning and I didn't think you could edit down a three hour game\nTo ten minutes but I guess if you take all the balls and strikes out and uh and and everything else and you just put the it's in great plays and a strike out stuff like that that's the way to watch a baseball game it\nIt it is and it's funny a ties back to to the bill gates was actually in Microsoft I remember years ago was Bill Gates who had shown that technology um and I and I said to myself that's gonna ruin the sport\nI guess it hasn't but um I missed the Bruins game the other either the Bruins I'm definitely a fair weather fan if they're playing well as exciting hockey I'll watch them if they don't play well like I I tend not to but the whole game was in nine minutes you watch every ... every\nFight every assessed every every good play and um it's almost like why would you want to watch the game you know the the whole thing\nAll right on schedule begins on friday\nTomorrow the nineteenth right so just or tomorrow or is Julia brown have you ever heard she's a running for council yes I have heard of and I understand she's active on Facebook yes but I'm a we have I have yet to meet her anyway she's going to be in and we're going to be chatting with her tomorrow\nAs she is purchased a half hour of time for council Kennedy\nOn Monday John Ward will be here\nAnd I'm On a Tuesday um looks like a Thomas heat there will be here on\nWednesday Lynn Taylor will be here for thirty minutes and Melissa Marie for Fifteen minutes on friday Denise Sierra\nWill be with us or a week from friday October twenty six for thirty minutes Melissa Marie the last Fifteen minutes and on Monday the twenty ninth Donald Burke will be here for thirty minutes and Melissa we'll be back again for Fifteen minutes on Tuesday a cobra thirtieth Paul Boyle Jay will be here\nAnd the other fifty Fifteen minutes Jim ...\nIs and what was she be campaigning for probably US Senator or president hey thank you for being\nYes and what would you be campaigning for probably US Senate or president hey thank you for being with us you'll see you next time\nChris is has bank you have you on our eyes up front presented weekday mornings at eight am up front is a regular public affairs presentation of news talk Thirteen eighty WN our\nWant socket [noise]\n\nWhere he was Chris Barnes final\nCamo Britain by Saudi dissident journalist ... has been published in the Washington Post his show he disappeared on October second after walking into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and never walking back out to a colleague at the post Karen ... says\nYou're calling it the right and that is true and they asked and kept count of power and and I cried out walking around in Israel type ... and it was about the Arab world all\nSecretary of state Mike upon pale and President Trump ... show used as the parents at a meeting today at the White House as palm pay it was just back from having met with Saudi Arabia and officials and Turkish officials the death toll from hurricane Michael rises to thirty four\nBut there are still scores of people missing this is usa radio news this is a ...\n[noise] when he won an action hero go to marvel comics when you need protection from a downpour put\nA wrinkle I wouldn't want to see someone who'd all morning to go to the ballpark\nBut when you have been injured and I needed a trial lawyer there's only one lawyer needs to go to and that is mark ...

don't want to say a gift\nBecause he has been working incredibly hard during this whole time but think of what has happened good afternoon folks and it's down to be told is the John ... drove show\nI mean that is someone who has been nonstop and the fact that is going on right now with Elizabeth Warren what a disastrous week now I'm trying to get some more information but mayor fun had a um\nA hold on I think we're gonna talk right now\nTo Andrew Augustus me just see who's with the ... campaign because a mayor phone had a blockbuster press conference this morning Betty is really rocketing and I'm\nA\nOne of those stories that is a incredible with what is happening right now\nHappening right now as far as with Governor among do and the information that they have and I love the fact that the ... people\nHave no put this and the uh the feds are now looking into this whole thing so we want to get a little more information about it this does tie into\nThe new hip situation and a mayor phone held a press conference this morning\nAnd let me just mayor phone to whistle blowers processing food stamps aren't I think we have Andrew right now and we're going to bring 'em right on to walk us through folks are speaking joining us right now he is this a spokesperson for the ... campaign and it's our friend\nIn regard as good afternoon Andrew good afternoon John\nAndrew blockbuster press conference held by the ... campaign this morning regarding you have if you could just walk us through this sounds very serious I'm seeing ... you know the people are tweeting talking about federal investigations\nCriminal wrongdoing whistle blowers with silence take us through what what was announced the mayor ... would you guys uncovered this morning\nYeah so I think everyone knows and all your listeners understand at this you have the bottles about something that Rhode Island's been facing for years and even the marathon father getting caught up into it wears application was not lost once but twice\nAnd it just seems that the hits keep on coming uh we we found out today that on August thirtieth a department of Human Services director Courtney Hawkins was informed by the U.S da\nDa du ... with the state contract for the program\nThe cost of you have increased another ... million dollars bringing the total up to six hundred and sixty million dollars on the taxpayers and this was supposed to be something that was the costs significantly less\nThan what the taxpayers have been paying and then even um later on earlier this week at a rally for change we add a former state worker and a current state workers come in and\nWanting to talk to us obviously an enemy for their own protection bad there's we're instances\nWhere that they were told to uh that they worked at the delay and now they are we're getting a signed by ditch F\nTo go work I'm kind of fix this problem in that this ... uh Simon was assent to their state emails but rather their personal emails which is we have we have the media early today showing that it was sent out on January six\nAnd it was sent to their personal emails rather than their state issued one\nAnd it just gets even more concerning as we go through and the assignment that was sent to them or was they were told to report to the ah off site to the offices on Charles street\nAnd while they were in putting that data there would be some occasions where someone didn't have a Social Security number\nAnd vote for workers told us that they were instructed by the white staffers to just click through it and auto populated Social Security numbers are for those for any type of situation that came up without a Social Security number on it\nThose are very serious charges I'm looking at the tweet right now from mark again and again uh investigative reporter for the team NBC ten to whistle blowers processing food stamp benefits for speech you hit program came forward they were given orders on personally male and alleged potential broad claims referred to\nOrders on personal email an alleged potential broad claims referred to federal inspector general ... tell us about that\nYeah and says these are very serious allegations ridiculous to the federal health and Human Services office of inspector general a referral hotline\nAnd that way we we want to get to the bottom of this we want to know how much it's costing taxpayers we ought to know what exactly is going on in this situation this is so and that's why when they came to say it rightfully so we're asking are we are going to keep their\nIdentities are private for now because this is something that we refer them to and they have contact with the federal authorities\nAnd we're going to say we want them to come in and take a look at things and be like what what exactly is going on here why wasn't this at a stadium out why or why did this go to their personal you know what else could be possibly going on how many of these\nSocial Security numbers were generated\nFolks were speaking with the spokesperson for Cranston mayor Allen ... and again ... this is a a bombshell situation regarding to pull ... whistle blowers processing food stamp benefits for the seat you hit program\nAndrew ... this is one of those things I mean you want to talk about the ... the pattern with D.C Wyeth Nineteen children died under the seat you're Gina Raimondo just the past two years now you have to whistle blowers process and food stamps coming forward\nAnd giving orders on their personal email telling them to skip forward to that and\nAlso I Am so glad about this because his eye and ... on on Tuesday after the debate the Providence Journal fact check some of the comments made by ... in the debate on Monday Night and it's in this morning's journal by Patrick ... an ice becomes focal point and race and it shows\nOn ... and I was there you are right on Monday Night when governor among those said\nWhen this dangerous illegal alien drug dealer Ramon deal Santos when he was released from the AC I\nGovernor ... said ice ... her quote at the debate was I should have been waiting in the parking lot but they didn't that's their job they should have done that I'm Glad with the journal has uncovered\nIt was under governor cheat the that they stopped notifying ice when they were going to release a guy like this and if they had notified ice which mayor ... says he would know to buy ice they would've scooped him up immediately and not allowed him to be released in that way so ... I'm so glad\nI'm not going to say it's like a a pants on fire but I'm Glad that the journal did point out now one of the problems that is not true that ice is not a matter they they were doing their job they can't do the job if there were ... administration won't cooperate with all you see Andrew\nThat's correct I think that's one thing especially as you see in the debates going forward you've seen the dishonesty from this kind of her because she can't run on our own record she if she was so proud of her record twelve hours after the\nPolls closed on primary night show out to throw up a negative ad right off the bat it's laughable when she says she doesn't like negative ads the overwhelming majority of her as\nA negative and you see their phone out there every day trying just to set the record straight because she's been very dishonest and a lot of her as on multiple occasions\nAnd that's why we want to bring to light the such problems you see why you have these problems that you have because Rhode islanders deserve better than what we're getting now\nAnd just to reiterate so this was this morning press conference and a dad is huge these whistle blowers only to go on one thing ah Andrew or this was when I had it on my website but\nBack in September of twenty sixteen was the first time I was actually the first one they'll send you like where I had members the working there that said that the ... came in they didn't know what they were doing and they were getting calls from people\nWhere they were supposed to get two hundred dollars for the BP car they would go to stop and shop and ... would say wow you have two thousand dollars instead of two hundred two thousand they're supposed to get two hundred dollars a month instead they were getting two ... two checks for two thousand dollars a month so four thousand dollars\nSo I posted that I had all the information\n... asked\nGovernor among those people point blank at a press conference about that September twenty sixteen hour we're going to in the weeds but they completely denied I call it the ABC lottery\nW. an outright win socket [noise]\n\nPerjury secretary Steven Mnuchin\nAnnounced he was withdrawing from

had a maintenance about moral\n[laughter] charger maintenance that's scary you didn't know that they are they yeah yes\nWell I'll tell you it was highly suspect in my opinion to see a man of character just totally walk away from housing saying uh and and has and has a position on on board and just say you know this or that was the one nothing to do with that song and leave\nI'm not sure if ah his

a a nice to see him after he retired he went to work has its security for CBS for many years and um [noise] I have to I should have asked about his voice\nIs as kids um\nBut it was nice to see him going back to the river falls the night again I'm meeting a friend of mine called Pomona fires that we've made a lot of press recently uh last year or\nEarly in the air when he went to Africa and uh was arrested or and or one of the jail in the ... or the prison there and then he was released and he'd been totally clear the very thing\nAnd then he's going to go back for more training so by the time he gets back home\nHe'll probably be their six or seven months\nOf training must be very smart I don't know what but the training is that they're giving 'em but above the specialized training but when he comes home he goes ... back he goes and gets a job because they just come out of high school\nAnd and um and then he starts going to reserve meetings like anybody else but the pine that he just spent in training does that count for a VA benefits\nAnd for some reason that's what the United states government the aid the fat department established decades ago\nOkay\nAt at one time if you served in the in the military let's say a World War two\nThat I'm here we're never got you you uh what state you're in California\nWhere are you still have to wear or two veteran and if you if in

Alaska or the Philippines or you could still you're still over ... World War two veteran\nOkay ... the same thing of Vietnam but all of a sudden with that the vet and on the side of the tightened up but then now with the middle east crisis is coming up\nNow the state law Rhode Island says that you have to have be in a in the combat theater in other words you just being in the military during that time frame does not automatically make you entitled the benefits\nOkay that's when it comes down to\nSolve rather than say that you're you are\nJust serve six years that I got into the Army Reserves and the militia that's that's a that's a you served in okay then you could also at the United States Army reserves which is under the government of the United states that's different I think\nToo that I Know share the Army Reserves his out bringing

Rhode Island socket\nBut but how this started\nSo I could but but how this started ladies and gentlemen the importing contrary I read is that idea of the other day when he ran two years ago\nAll he said on it served seven years with the Rhode Island Army National guard seven years I think it's a six anyway I'm about to read that again I'm with the Rhode Island Army National guard all of a sudden\nIn the last six seven months he's now on Facebook saying that he served in Vietnam War that as well that's a sculpture and started coming up\nAnd let me make it clear that I discussed this with him a long time ago when his when he was running for public office\nOkay and I said you're not a veteran and he said yeah I Am a veteran I says I don't think so\nYou get you get your VA cod says no I don't qualify I said that's why you're not a veteran so I got on to the documents off line I gave it to him that shows but yet he's still continue to collect\nThe exemption for the city but on the body put down what is your of shift seven years that Ryan Army National guard now he probably is say he's put up a flat and even jail larger vote for him okay\n\nHe said this time he served honorably okay for some reason\nI don't know why I tried to make the gods to something secondary the gods of very very important and reserve the very important when I was in the navy I sure wouldn't many people who are active reserves\nMany many many offices reserves that are that had to go active duty\nUh\nSometimes called ... where they want as a but they did the jobs the his uh sometime delusional but that's a story on it what on Richard fact that it can put all the documents on line\nBut he didn't get a de do for what they need to for the for the United states what ... what the de do fourteen he has a has a sheet of paper that showed the time because that's the only shot or that's the only document they have that list the time served\nThat's why they use the DVD fourteen farm but I've sort of scientific get a discharge\nHis says non and that's what I should say they got his discharge what is the national guard and Jean day and it should be proud of that by the way\nAnd what did you do is apologize and let's put it to sleep because he had as an ... you know he said he's not a perfect person is out apologized anybody my wife is still waiting my grandchildren are still

most of the time one on one\nShe loves children and loves education\nThat she administrative eight to ... a general treasure Anthony Solomon for many years that tree she met I think since I'm an odd system and I do as a big shot there and um\nHe was on her she's on a zoning board for ten years\nThe school committee twelve years Seventy five Seventy nine to five to two Thirteen\n\nShe's always been a connecting with St Jude okay\n\nAnd was on the uh hospital committee for three years\nFor the directors five years the boys and Girls Club but when socket for years kind of bought a review put on talk of housing authority to bring it a lot of experience at a table for the school committee\nKind of a choice of five just choose I Would like to choose her\nUh she'll do a good job and um she's a numbers person\n\nAnd she's a good negotiator also but your backs education that's what it comes out to a\nWeb but we're turning over teachers\nBecause of the pay and other with what's happening here is we're becoming a AAA for school the ... the kids come out of school they come to work here\nThey got there they get theirs they get the experience but they don't make the money so they're waiting and waiting and waiting and then it opens up and they go on then another one comes in it doesn't like the old days you have teachers thirty five forty years with running them over\nAnd that's it has to stop okay\nAnd the the money that we're spending giving them both say we don't have the money just the money we're spending now and blight are cut the funding any kind of potential raised for them okay and make a competitive anyway they shouldn't be the highest paying our island or the wrong impression\nOkay um\nBut I had to go to mediation that's incredible seven ... seven six six

are nice and we but it makes it easier because now we can both you'll talk to each other what did this person say what does that person and say what questions do they come up with and that so we are walking the neighborhoods in fact I did at one point one miles just walking with with the senator pick our\nI did about twelve feet in the building today or [laughter] or let's talk a little bit about this job training in higher education center coming to an socket now there is something that as a as a ... plus a bonus for their community and it\nIs and and we're making sure that the money is there to to fund this\nHigher education and job training center I haven't heard where it's going to be I think they're still negotiating so I've been a inquiring a little bit I Will be in touch with the governor among do next week I told her I'd give her a call because I have a couple of issues to ... walk by or run by her and I will bring that up also\nDid we come up with a determination as to where the location is but we need to\nWhether we we know where it is or not we know what's coming here and we know we need to find it so we need to make sure that the money is there to fund this training program which is dialing needed for a lot of the people in our community they can't go to westerly they can't go to Providence a lotta times so getting that training here\nIs vital for them to get a good job even if it's a start position in a in a company\nThey've got the train to basic training and they can be trained by that company for the additional ones that they need\nA representative Bob Dole just help ensure for a million dollars included in this current state budget in order to get this job training in higher education center in one socket for the people here of northern Rhode Island um and that's something that really came up uh this year probably pass mid session I Would assume that someone in the time\nWas in the budget with the governor's budget in January but it didn't come out until probably may you know the beginning of June afterwards but it through the Finance Committee or at but she wanted to do something she wasn't sure\nIt was going to be in one sock it at that time when she put it in the budget but I Will give credit to the mayor the mayor has been hot and heavy on talking to the governor about making sure it was in when socket we ate at the three reps aided in that to new try and convince her\nWe don't need it and nor Smith we we don't need an incumbent the need is actually in when socket\nSo we need to have this educational system\nIs actually in when socket so we need to have this educational system here mhm and what should she agreed to and she came and made an announcement right next to city hall in the park right next to city hall to say that yes it will be in one socket\nCouple of others um other events or one of the laws you authored as a state representative is a new law I'm streamlining and we say streamlining of course we want to make it easier and more accessible this process to obtain and renew commercial driver's licenses\nTo him up that that is something that was brought forward to me\nAbout three and a half four years ago and I had to do some research before I put in a bill that would be able to accomplish what they wanted a few of the CDL drivers we Norma CDLs commercial driver's license CDLs\nCame to me and said their medical card part of their license they need to every two years or every year depending on their health situation needs to bring their ... medical card to the registry of motivation 'cause in Cranston it's the only division\nOr location that you can bring that to they had to bring it in person\nI talked to a friend of mine who we were out I'm Talking ... at one night and I said come and talk to me about your medical card he says he I it's a pain in the butt because I have to bring it to ... I have to take a day off work\nI said how much does across you if you take a day off of work because I'm a long distance driver I leave the plant and drive to the Canadian border\nSo it's cost me five hundred dollars a day to take a day off so can you afford to take a day off of five hundred dollars\nI don't think so no so I'll take a day out of WWNO arrives somebody's going to pay me five hundred dollars the other day when I got some driver yeah yeah so he he said you know I asked him I said this what we need to do I research a couple of different states I Know a couple of different straits you can send it electronically or fax it\nWell I went back with the division of motor vehicles we went back and forth this is like the third year I put it in and we finally came up to to an agreement that all parties can go with\nAnd it finally got past the truckers association um they had of it has given me a call and said thank you very much you are going to save us a ton of time and make the business has more efficient and and more profitable because they're not losing a driver here and there and just to go bring their medical card down there\nAnd we're going to work on another thing for the CDL drivers to to make it easier for them to obtain their license for people that want to get the CDO\nAnd um after I if if I'm lucky enough to be reelected which I'm hoping to of course\nThen we're going to start working on that aspect of it and we're going to be able to get more truckers because there were ten thousand jobs out there if a CDO drivers that they don't have driver's four\nOr five you're looking for a career path as an option is option for you\n\nAnd are under your ah time this past year one of the most controversial pieces was the truck toll legislation which through ya you have a track record\nAs a state representative I've seen it many times myself a regardless of what's popular at the state house level whatever agenda leadership is pushing you listen to your constituents I've seen you do it before\nAnd we saw you do it again this year with the truck tells you opposed to I did\nAnd as well as um a few other ones that we just felt that we were going down the wrong path by instituting truck toes because who knows where it's going to add according to the bill right now you can't truck a toll vehicles but who knows ten Fifteen Twenty years down the road\nIt may come up that you can call them or or we have to told them because\nWhat we did was illegal I don't know I'm not a lawyer I'm not a judge I'm not going to say if it's legal or not legal I just felt we were doing the bad a disservice in Ninety five percent of my constituents\nSaid they do not want truck tools so I have to listen to them what no matter how much pressure I got down at the state house and I said I just can't vote for this bill\nListening constituent says that trait that has seen a lot of reps forget when they get to that location or not the first time I've seen you end up uh against leadership respectfully\nDue to the fact you're listening constituents that's pretty admirable uh this is a state representative Bob Philips a one another topic here I just want to cover it because it is a hot button topic and do something that was looked up at the state level is ah the sea safety for kids in schools\nIt's a big topic and ah we know that you have that delivers in a new state funding for that of course\nWe were advocating to [noise] to be able to how do we make our students safer [noise]\nThey were talking about putting resource officers in every school resource officers is it as efficient as you can get it how do you\nMake sure that somebody with either a gun a knife or anything even a car trying to crash through the front doors of the building how do we make it safer so they have different barriers so we needed funding to to be able to\nThe front of the schools\nWe have some of the schools are going to have metal detectors and some of them are just going to have multiple doors you can go in you can talk to somebody in the office and say what are you here for who do you need to see et cetera et cetera that slows them down now if they know that they're going to have two or three doors to go through\nThey know what's going to take time and they ... the time is of the essence but whoever wants to perpetrate any type of damage to students so they may just say I'm not going to this school I'll go to another community another state or they may just forget it altogether if all of them are during this process\nSo we need to have the funding to be able to renovate schools and a lot of our schools are older\nWe didn't have this one I was growing up we didn't have when you were growing up Jeff no so you could still walk in the back door we could walk open any door and walk into the school or out of school out of school and so now we need to unfortunately because of the the timeframe that we live in we need to be able to\nCover this and and be able to say what's going to make our students to relax and safe so they they have a a a nice atmosphere to learn it\nWhere uh talking with say representative Bob Philips representing district fifty one asking for your support Tuesday November sex\nAnd we have are just about a minute and a half a year if you wanted to make a a less a presentation to the listeners of W Anna ... representing Cumberland in one socket state representative Bob Philips thank you Jeff I'm\nThat's what I Would say\nMaybe you have a comment put in your two cents good afternoon Iran WN alright\n... spent a long

talking about the crime in one socket yeah\nAnd I want to thank you for bringing that up because there is if they don't want to recognize it it there is a a lot of crying air in the city\nUm another thing about these children that are getting this polio like an epidemic yeah and it sure usually hitting the young children\nAre a lot of these children are not getting their shots and I would venture that even some of these immigrant children come in probably don't have any of this uh being done and I think that's\nProbably one of the one of the problems that a is a curry and it's very sad\nI haven't seen polio and since I was a little kid mhm\nI'm I'm pretty well up there [noise]\nUm so I'm I'm hoping that they could you know look into um some of these children are not getting their shots I Know of one immigrants and she doesn't want her child\nI'm having the shot and uh but they she said that the child can go to school unless unless that chap how ... how do\nHow do they show didn't get away with not having their shot that they have to go to school they actually have to give a some kind of a a notice are something that they have had the shots don't\nThey young in the years passed a child had to come in with a some kind of documentation from\nAh their pediatrician whatever indicating that all unnecessary shots had been taken care of and if you didn't have those shots are you are on notice and you had a certain period of time to get the shot and ... get the paperwork to that indicates that you have the shot\nAnd if not you were told not to report back to school but seems like the ... the process has become very very lax and now people using a multitude of excuses some it's for religious purposes of is that people just don't want any part of vaccinations\nAnd it seems to be a situation where okay if you want to get shots fine if not you don't have to do and but I think this could become very dangerous\nYes for other children and and this polio like um I've seen I've seen it in action and it's oh these children being an incubator is I mean it was unbelievable oh yeah yeah I'm I Am\nOn a personal no mhm um I don't usually put anything personal on on the radio

on residents who live here in the city and don't pay the taxes yes\nYeah I called you know maybe it was about a month ago a when you bought the topic ... supposedly were first crackdown mhm\nReason I'm calling you today is because to me it's just ludicrous it's an absolute joke and here's why I say that I live in an off and\nI have three neighbors all have out of state wage to them that we have our state fights but they're business owners right here in the community\nAnd one of them said right through my face I don't care they can find me I'll pay the fine I'm Still going to keep these types of saving a pot of money\nAnd this person also knows people in the when soccer police department so for someone to tell me that to my face their ... and not even\nIn the least bit intimidated by the court and quote crack down\nTo me is like it's absurdity it's like and I and I remember the conversation that you and I had\nAnd you said almost verbatim I quote you that well that's just the way that things are when socket change this tough and here we are again a second crackdown this person is not even worried or intimidated in the least bit so I'll hang up but I like to get your thoughts\nOn well I was just a quick\nQuestion if I may ... you said that this person is a ... a\nVet said this to you is connected with the police so that would I ... ... what I Am when I say that you have already called the police department about this individual and reported these out of state plates to them\nNo I haven't but I Know someone else that did and then and that's when this person said that to me and I know\nThat he personally knows a lot of people on the when socket police department and he's not worried about them coming for like ... or to be called them for a magistrate or a judge to explain himself always a business owner yet as out of state plates and he's been living here for quite some time\n[noise] now do you feel comfortable with anybody and I mean as if somebody you know what the police department that you could call or is there an elected official that you know that you feel you can trust that you could bring this information to\nKnow I don't but like I said again it's pointless in Fort list because he himself has said I'm not worried about it I Know people in the last ... they're not going to do anything to me and if they do I'll just pay the fine but I'm Still going to keep my vehicle registered out of state so its end the ...\nBut I'm Still going to keep my vehicle registered out of state so its end the person is a business saw that's what kills me the most I Would think that business owners would be the pillows of any community that they conduct their business it and his two of them is three people my immediate neighbors three of them\nHave our state plates and live here and two of them a business owners so it just to hear that there's a quote unquote crackdown is laughable because it's not affecting them in the least\nWell those are interesting comments both from you and from that individual as well [noise] well let's see if anybody has a comment on this thank you Ira I think you by no\nMeans All right maybe you have had a similar situation I I don't know\nBut uh that's pretty bold on the part of this neighbor of his saying um [noise] I don't care let them find me I'm saving a ton of money by registering my vehicle somewhere else in another state [noise]\nWhat do you think of that any comments seven six six Thirteen ... as we talk with you on this\nThursday open line conversation River Falls restaurant let's see what's going on a River Falls well first of all today is a Thursday and the big special on Thursday as the all you can eat ribs fast that includes prime rib and baby back ribs all you can eat for

pork chop the pumpkin ravioli the pecan encrusted Norwegian salmon and for dessert or at\nIs on the books are here in the city on one socket if you're if you're here in the studio and socket more than thirty days just supposed to register your car here in the state of Rhode Island period and that's always been the law and it's always been there but unfortunately it's never been properly and sauce\nSo I have to commend her for doing so\nWell I tend to agree with you I and I hope that there are no exceptions to the rule you know somebody is violating the law go after them\nAbsolutely you know or if you live here I I don't care or you have to pay Rhode Island state taxes that saw gee I don't like the law change it but that's on the books it's unfortunately it what is known of enforcing the patch\nAnd thank God is being enforced now and hopefully we'll get everyone a registered here in Rhode Island the way they're supposed to buy the law\nUm so that's all I have to say on that Larry so I have to commend the mayor for doing that and showing leadership or for doing that and then when soccer police department [noise] okay\nUh Larry in ... in as far as a show them out house\nI find that very coincidental that Sheldon out houses very very quiet and doesn't seem willing to answer any questions in regards to heat taken a hundred and fifty thousand dollars and money from a from a a co generation plants that burn fossil fuels\nBut yet is the guy goes running around climate change climate change climate change\nThat is interesting yes\nYes and he doesn't want to answer any questions about that but apparently he seems to be a big supporter of this fossil fuel plant that's going to burn 'em you know thousands and thousands and thousands of gallons of fossil fuels\nAnd put in greenhouse gases into the atmosphere which he claims is causing climate change\nI don't know about you'll Larry but it's pretty cold outside right now [laughter] I don't know about or maybe he's a measuring is temperature around the Capitol building in Washington where there's a lot of hot air ...\nAnd that's why he thinks maybe this global warming\nWell it is a controversial topic in there are those who say yes we're in the midst of this climate change and then and then there are others who say uh well uh you know the change is something that happens in cycles and sometimes you wonder who to believe\n[laughter] lot Larry we've had multiple ice ages have we not Oh yes we have and we've had multiple heat waves on you or have we not now we have okay\nIt's been proven by you know uh you know archaeological digs it's been proven by a ice ... ice cores\nAnd so on and so forth so what was the issue so in the U.S warmed up and those times there was no SUVs around at that time it was very few humans just there weren't any um to to like get animals on us at the time and yet we had global warming and then we had ice ages we had many ice age is\nA matter of fact we had a mini ice age in the Seventeen hundreds in the Eighteen hundreds\nSo uh you know the climate changes all the time and it's a natural process some nature it has nothing to do what we do or don't do\nWell I Know there are ...\nWe do or don't do\nWell I Know there are people who will say that\nYou know so they're not going to ... I guess I'll outline of bologna to me because that's part of the global this movement of charging richer countries a a a what they call a carbon tax and then that money is going to go into a World Bank\nWhich then is going to distribute that money to poor country it is\nIt's just a redistribution of wealth skiing that's all it is\nIn my humble opinion five anyway [noise] so anyways Larry have a wonderful evening All right and I\nThank you for the call\nYes and uh I'm I'm In like I said Larry again I appreciate the fact they are enforcing that regulation and go after all of them because I I'm

question for you because I'm hearing bits and pieces and let me hear it from the ...\nYou know the one that heard loud and clear uh-huh um\nI guess the mayor had called pretty much it I heard out grand today you know he was awarded the equal time right that is correct\nSo why why why wasn't why was the problem was the question that she asked when she called\nHer when she called she actually she was concerned because someone had called the program\nAnd um had mentioned her children and where they go to school\nAnd she pretty much said that it's nobody's business but her business as a parent\nShe and her husband can decide where they got to send their kids to school and she didn't appreciate the fact that that was being discussed on the talk show so that's why we are allowed her to go on the air to explain you know her side of that issue\nOh that's so that's where the humor up\nSo you you of the bad boy in Jeffers the bad boy and she was a bad girl because she knows the rules are All right\nWell that's not calling the show I don't know it wasn't\nIt wasn't her fault because she called and asked if she could go on and we made the decision we could have said no\nWhich is what we've been told by management is in the future we have to say no\nOr at the time both Jeff and I didn't see anything wrong with what we were doing\nBecause in my my thinking I mean all this we had to think this out rather quickly because she's on hold and I'm doing a talk show and Jeff is busy so but off the air we decided that we would allow her on the air and just keep track of how much time she spoke\nAnd then uh we had every intention of notifying L A brand that he had the same amount of time and that's exactly what we ended up doing\nOr it can get pretty hairy and and that's why management does not want us to get involved in this like for example if this had been a\nCouncil candidate a we would not let them on the air because it we would have had to allow uh what is it a twelve people are running for council I think or something like that\nWe would have had to know it ... all of them are that they had equal time coming and that can get very time consuming and uh we
