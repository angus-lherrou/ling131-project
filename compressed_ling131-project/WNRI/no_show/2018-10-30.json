ago I'm\nAlso a in a paid political setting and he's a real estate guy he's a on the younger side and uh he's got a plan to and here a few thoughts from Thomas keep the marketing\nUm I think what socket does\nA really poor job of marketing and I'm\nI think um we have so much to offer but we don't put enough emphasis on\nIt in and out of marketing so for instance is to\nLet's seventh largest company in the United states um and they call one stock of their own lives of their head more than\nYou go to any CBS across the country you pick out a package from them and you turn it over and you see one soccer Rhode Island um any other city in town a cross the country would kill to have that and their back yard um and we have a right down the road and it's almost like we take on the green room\nWith a company like CBS comes another dozen companies that either works alongside them or services CBS and those companies will have easier and less than a corporation like CBS was here I'm\nIn the same thing holds true for hospitals\nLandmark medical center I'm there's another dozen businesses that their work alongside landmark radicals and again they wouldn't be here is the hospital was within our borders we need to take that kind of stuff and just really promoted and we used to market is no each us send it out there to the world um\nSo we can get another dozen companies that ship ...\nThomas keep the same one sock it needs to market itself better and I really couldn't disagree with him\nAnd um I remember um a few years ago thinking that same thing and uh so what I did as a ... must must have been more than a few years ago because I think you'd remember this we\nApproached businesses in the area and asked them to contribute to a TV campaign what we did is we bought some time on channel six because I was about the only place we could afford it and it was and it was a promoting would socket\nAnd um we mentioned CBS because they were still here they were here back then and we mentioned a number of other companies and em you know like proud to be in one socket ran the ads\nOn channel six and uh we were trying to reach other parts of the state we're trying to ... in

closely with them and then with us and I think we're going to be able to accomplish great thanks ...\nIs with us now we're going to talk about you in particular nice they up and so on you or a campaign literature you say you're going to support education programs that will benefit\nOur students so we have programs in place could you maybe talk a little bit about uh a couple of the programs that are are maybe in place or maybe one that you would like to see you get in place\nWell we've got we're one of my I think one of the best programs that has come to light now since I've been on the committees the ... program at the career center\nWhere a number of students uh work with computers are which will give him an opportunity to actually get an associate's degree from cc alright or their mentor by CBS as well and so and I've visited these classes that's the other thing I ever going\nTo all the schools and I continue to go to all the schools to visit the teachers the students I talked to the parents to see what's working\nUm and the ... every time I go to ... I I it's incredible to see the enthusiasm\nAlso on the career center you have the ... a program that's really well done and part of that program or they want to turn into a cafe um where the students will actually get some professional experience and how to cook and distribute and take care of food\nOr we have an automotive department of construction department of nursing department um but in terms of the high school I mean ah the accelerated programs are are really well done we have reading incentive programs in the elementary schools\nUm there's quite a few things that are and some of the things that are coming up I'm are in the planning stages but boy they are they're going to be really great stuff they got to be great programs\nOr in the planning stages but boy they are they're going to be really great stuff they're going to be great programs [noise]\nBut I had a Donald Burke here yesterday I brought up a two um two issues um that are unpleasant issues I think they're related to each other graduation rates and attendance\nAnd I think we recognize that the school committee sets the policy and then the two superintendents and their staff have to carry it out\nOr so where are we in two thousand and Eighteen with attendance and how we thinking about it and what is in place to maybe get those numbers up and you know I was thinking about this overnight Sam and I'm saying why\n... why do we otherwise they blame the school committee or blame the administrators I think um I think a big big part of it as a those parents but I guess that's the challenge\nUm we have when you look at the lower grades from Kate at three okay to five the parents are very much involved in terms of governing a their children's time and when they when they attend but attendance as far as I'm concerned is our biggest challenge it within the schools and it leads directly to\nA ... a poor or a ... a lower advanced a graduation rate\nBecause if you don't attend school you're not going to do well\nUm and so now we're we've we've got to be here program that's just big big on that we're gonna we're trying to motivate parents and try to get it their kids to school\nA well looking at transportation or for people around the outlying areas are just within the the distance that you you either get a bus so you don't get a bus we're looking at that I'm going to be devising hopefully more parent teacher organizations or events to\nEncourage the parents to to bring their kids to school\nAs the kids get older and high school and a lot of that false on on on the on the students themselves\nBut they're also working on programs we got after school programs we have in in during the regular programs that are really are meant to help with attendance is the biggest problem in my opinion you know we have a truancy court that's bat\nBut unless the parents and the students buy into the into their education\nIt's got to be very difficult to improve attendance and everything that goes along with it or without without a doubt\n[noise] since attendance and graduation rates are a national\nAmerican education issues this is not just one socket correct that there may be some\nSometimes you see on TV model programs in a in a particular city aware all of a sudden somebody found the right key the right stimulus\nTo uh to motivate people to uh get their kids to school to motivate older kids to go to school right I don't know if that's that's out there and where we're looking\nFor oil will look we're looking for you know we certainly we've looked at the organization of school committees are not just here in Rhode Island but outside we've certainly looked at different incentives or different programs that help or to attendance but again it's back to the parents it's back to getting the children are involved in their education\nSo Mr Burke yesterday said or the use of think it was here yesterday was that the two are tied in together so we don't really have to talk much about Bo graduation rates if we can solve the problem of tend to\nShrink [noise] well you do still because when you look at the the urban cities but talk at Central falls Providence from socket one of things that we have that other folks don't have is transparency and that impacts and poverty levels\nThose are going to impact your attendance it's going to impact your graduation rates [noise]\nUm and maybe it's not the graduation rates per se that we need to focus on but we need to look at\nThe attendance of good students the ones that do well how did they doing visa V. attendance I think that's another important issue um the other we have some other issues that are very very important including funding\nI mean state funding city funding but especially the state funding needs to be addressed that fit found funding formula unfair because it doesn't address our protocols specially\nEnglish learning a incentives or programs that we have and the special education needs that we have in our city the other\nUh cities don't have them over twenty five percent more like twenty seven percent this year have special needs um and those costs are can be astronomical if the state or federal would provide the funding for those special\nProtocols we'd be much better shape our attendance or the uh classroom size per teacher is the highest in the state so\nOn an average the elementary so if you got too many students it's kind of odd\nTo teach the folks we have a lot of kids who are waiting to be analyzed to get an I. E. pi and that can have an impact on the classrooms um those are all issues that we're gonna that we're dealing with and we will continue to deal with um in our schools\nAre before we leave graduation rates and go to um communicating with the students and teachers and and um and others\nLived abroad island department of education rise\nThey have a formula that helps us determine what our graduation rate is and what I've heard over the years ah from school committee members and superintendents is that it really is unfair the way it's done because it has to do with where the\nWhere the people live and then they leave town and and then we still count them is there any way to get um legislation to force rise to changes standards it's just ride you mean rot ride up right now I put rice\nDo we want to talk about rise from it um yeah and I ... but ... there's no ... that's where I've said at the forum the other night that I Will myself and the other school members of school committee members are looking to our general assembly wraps and senators and say listen\nYou've got to get on the ball here uh in terms of\nHow how we deal with graduation how we deal with attendance how we deal with funding because that's that's key that's absolutely key if we can't fund and bring in the the resources that we knew\nThen everything comes to a standstill because we're not going to be expecting a city to completely fund all of this can be done or we've got all kinds of financial issues that are coming up within the city but they may be a a small element that they can provide but this woman any more funding from the state so\nAnd he's done a great job in my opinion as chairman those are the five in my opinion would make an excellent school committee you know we don't agree on everything just like the council\nWould already going but we get along and we compromise and we get there because we liked working with with one another we love going to schools we'd love to do to work with the

... of the baby at five or six days old is and so therefore because they don't have any they get some ... which one which is rather generous and I don't think the baby's about two hundred and fifty dollars all of\nUs right yes generally that lets even let's just back up for a minute just what you said about the hospital and that is when you go into women infants\nA lot of times some of the people coming in from other countries and they're here to deliver an anchor baby they're not some of the healthiest individuals to begin with ah the entire family I Know someone that basically not only did the ... the mother give birth\nBut the father stayed in the room the father's brother stayed in the room the grandmother mother the grandmother stays in the room the grandfather seeing through they basically had\nTheir entire immediate family and they would eat all the food and they would shower and they were basically saying in the room and not only that I Want people to realize\nWhen you deliver and give birth and women infants and and they do not have any insurance that is easily easily\nThirty thousand dollars at a hospital has to absorb so that's just right on the box thirty grand that they did they don't pay for look in the mirror we pay for and our insurance rates go up but guard had\nLots of social complications\nTry that is if there's no complications that's right and a lot of times because of the nation coming from uh the children are not exactly well fed or maybe there are complications and it could easily go to forty to fifty thousand dollars\nOr a ... and also some food and a lot of cost because they can apply for subsidized our [noise]\nTrying because they don't have how they vote [noise] waiting for those people\nAnd I want people to understand what you just said because that is very very important you have veterans that are pushed aside\nBecause the illegals as you correctly stated you're very knowledgeable they know housing so they actually take the place of either elderly\nVeterans listen let's just break it down they take the place and get preference over American citizens because they just delivered birth\nAt women infants and they're from Guatemala and now that child is considered an American citizen who you are one hundred percent right\nAnd also the rift transportation is free and also the trial is eligible\nThat's exactly right and they even get\nA they had a ... a program where they would get a gift certificate for JC penny of Providence Place mall when it was open now it's probably another story but they get clothing is well they get everything and here's what people need to understand this is why they come there were there were people that set this up for you you know if you want to go on a trip\nUm depending on where you live you know the old thing is people you'd well they used to be ... because of the online and everything but years ago you'd you'd go to a travel agent well the people set up like that\nSo if you're in another country they set up the whole thing they set up your flight they set up here's where you're going to stay a here's the hope the hospital where you're going to give birth they basically said the whole thing up they come on a temporary visa but then there never leaving because with that child born\nThere now in fact the child's considered an American citizen so let me ask you do you agree with President Trump we should end this whole fiasco\nAnd will they will go yes it's\nOn [noise] and also um [noise] I think Cokie Roberts strong dodged radical on your light each stage and we're talking about medical insurance will [noise]\nUm well it will come from all over the world access to medical uh\nIn the world I'm not a state as trainers say Cokie Roberts said yes but that's a problem it's not true\nThink of that yes but that is true many times you'll hear of a foreign dignitaries and when they need to have a procedure done\nThe first thing they do is they hop on a plane and you know they want to come to the United states to have the procedure done\nSo not a great great uh Germany has very good doctor certain certain pockets of the world do but we're talking about the fact that you have people in third world countries and it is all done\nA it is all done on purpose by design and this thing has to end with that child has been considered an American citizen you agree I was so glad President Trump is dealing with is it is China ... chain migration they are eager babies and I want people to understand that and a lot of people don't understand that\nThe whole reason is designed if if that was taken away they would just have birth in their own country and then they would not have a claim to come in here\n[noise] yeah that's how these circumvent the system\nIt's extraordinarily expensive and I don't think a lot of people know price things have Wi Fi Americans\nHere right now you're a hundred percent right now no let me ask you just before I let you go around Washington delegation\nA President Trump has come out he's in favor of bending and do the congressman Sicily and he will agree with him or disagree definitely the shipper disagreed using congressmen Landrieu and will agree or disagree sugary disagree do they sell the White House will agree or disagree\nShould disagree do you think Senator Reid will agree or disagree with President Trump disagreed agrees down let me ask you a very simple question\nIf you are running through the Senate the way Bob Flanders is against Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and you're trying to show the difference between the two again I'm not running the campaign but\nDon't you think it would behoove judge Flanders to show the difference that he is in favor of ending this and supports President Trump's proposal\nMost definitely and I think so\nAnd I should have a show that's great house first ran twelve years ago it was talking about the doughnut hole in Medicare benefits Medicare prescription benefits okay twelve years later\nIt was changed and that he's going to fight against it twelve years later there yeah so I guess she was talking about the ocean [laughter] thank you for the\nCall well we have a week ago and we'll go through the channel twelve poll in ... in just a moment folks good morning at ... ... what is the John ... show seven six six Thirteen eighty when I heard the president say that is about time\nFolks we can't allow the Caribbean to come here and it's time to end the Chinese ... a chain migration\nThis whole element of the anchor babies and there are some people there they get upset at that term but there's no other term for it that's exactly what it is\nRight seven six six Thirteen eighty seven six six Thirteen eight and we will go to the latest on the pole the election is a weak one week from today is the election one week from today is the election\nAnd we will talk about that and there is still a path to victory for credits to Marilyn fog but I Want to tell you again now coming up\nLast night big win for the patriots on the road or folks your chance to see the patriots take on the jets\nThis is happening November twenty fourth and twenty fifth it's Thanksgiving weekend so you see your family on the Thursday Friday Saturday boom you jump on the motor coach zipped down to New York\nSpend the afternoon and New York city and then Sunday it's the patriots against the jets in the Meadowlands\nThis incredible trip a it's a nice crowd beautiful hotel includes breakfast and then tailgate party unlimited beer and soft drinks great seats for the game and then you come right back after the game so leave Saturday morning and then come back on Sunday night\nFor governor the race for governor\nIs Raimondo forty five ... Fong thirty four troll oh nine points that that is the latest poll so what can we take away from this well let's look at this for a moment so Raimondo forty five\nSongs thirty four so he's basically in this poll you doubt eleven points joked furlough is sitting there with nine points\nFor whatever reason Joe ... who is running he's running and he's not getting out of the race I don't understand these people that still continue they don't pay attention\nGetting out of the race I don't understand these people that still continue they don't need to pay attention or get it he's never dropping out never and I still see people posting Joe drillers you do the right thing is that he's never leaving the race\nThat much we know what's a shrill oh is he going to leave the race two plus two is four two plus two will never be anything other than for\nToday's Tuesday tomorrow will be Wednesday no matter what you say tomorrow is when say he's not leaving the race\nI got an email from someone yesterday well I think we ever would should demand ... he's I don't know how to explain it he's not leaving the race whatever the motivation is he's not leaving\nHe even said even if he just gets two points\nHe wants to prevent Allen phone from being the governor\nBut this poll there is no question there's no way to argue the Joe ... has been a tremendous distraction and as Joe Fleming has pointed out to play the sound\nThe only person they joked furlough is pulling from is Cranston mayor Allen fun\nIf shrill oh we're not in this race and if you left the poll numbers the way they are which I don't even think they'd be like that\n\nBut the margin of error is around I think it's three points for points will go into it but basically would be a dead heat with Cranston mayor Allen ... do just that we took these numbers fund would be at\nA forty three Raimondo forty five\nTo point race was a week to go but I think it would be much more different than that because one of the reasons why ... does that forty five years she's been in hiding she doesn't do anything she doesn't go anywhere she just labs all these bombs\nExcuse me\nA TV against phone\nSo regardless of motivation\nIs Phil oh we're not in the race Raimondo would've had to move out there more funk could have focused on Romanoff more the media could focused on Raimondo more\nBut instead of thriller was taken a lot of oxygen he's gotten a lot of press he's gotten a lot of press a lot of other races he came out and said basically his goal is not to win the election he said that his words he said I don't care if I just get two percent I Want to make sure that song is not the governor\nIf Joe trailer we're not in this race and they were in a dead heat [noise] like I said\nRaimondo would be scrambling\nThey'd be more money coming in for bone and they would be in a dead heat and they'd probably be more debates but there's there's no other way to characterize this or look at this objectively without saying\nThey joked furlough with his just nine points he has been the difference in this race now again there was a week to go and joke trailer doesn't have for support thirty six percent of people saying the border patrol Lowe said they still could change their mind to vote for someone else\nI Want to repeat to you what I've been saying well a lot people ask me who do I support and I've been saying this consistently\nI support whoever can beat governor Gina Raimondo\nAnd if you want to vote for among do vote for ... but if you want someone else bought for ...\nJoe ... at nine points is not going to be the next governor period that poll that came out that had him at Seventeen points I think it's very very questionable\nAnd a lot of money ... the people that put out that poll he paid them a lot of money and suddenly they hadn't been Seventeen percent maybe if they paid the more money than what Adam at thirty percent I don't know by channel twelve but I think has been consistent with their polling\nIs still within reach I think\nAs we get closer and people really start to realize do they want Raimondo for four more years folks she's going to give drivers license to illegals she's going to raise taxes\nAnd this is going to be the aggressive mecca without question now let's hear this is heading ISI talking to pollster\nJoe Fleming\nRegarding fees polling numbers signed a\nThirty four percent\n... percent four percent backing other candidates eight percent said they are still undecided so the governor is a pretty good job for\nMore ...\nJoe uh what do you think it's fine that change in this latest poll\nWhile they were sort of a couple of things Patrick we see the governor now when he with males were in the last poll shows credible males so how old are your three and they knew we were females also the middle age voters forty to fifty nine just travelling by three points last time national by two points plus she's so we'll\nFind her support among Democrats\nDepended photos so well what do you think is the case for elephant losing ground here there's not doing enough to maybe you know shock the voter base to let's say you know hey I'm here and and maybe not getting enough attention\nWell I think is not getting enough attention was the governor has so much money plus you have a lot of money coming from a Democratic governors association for as she can get a message lot stronger\nAlan ... lost his Republican money that was independent expenditure we control go and here's a lot left\nHis poll numbers have been stagnant throughout the whole campaign so this is really recent news that the Republican governor ... ...\nOr national money for this and when you hear that news as a candidate for governor in a state that's got to be pretty demoralized that is\nAnd that's a sign that simply they believe the money which means they count bugs in trouble at this point if they are pulling their money so only seven days to go over here is there any can do\nTo close this without has to do is simply graphs and Joe ... vote is when we do the whole we follow\nAbove a little more fair to Joe ... is a good chance that could change the minds of those voters he has to convince them to do with Joe ... plus you have to wrap almost all the undecided voters says a very narrow\nPlans or show the White House or the huge gap there and\n... as the changes that last survey basically show the White House has almost a twenty point lead on this race again winning huge with females Democrats\nVoted over the age of sixty those are three groups to show the White House is very big in which has given him to watch and we\nAnd the negative attack by planners are sometimes that works case\nSubtle what might be too little too late or he was trying to go on a cabin\nIssue we follow the survey voters Rhode Island feel a cabinet should not have been put on the Supreme Court so maybe going for on your show\nBy let's talk finally just wondering about the results showing fifty six percent of voters support legalizing recreational marijuana in Rhode Island do you think that'll be enough support the jumpstart some legislation\nI'm not sure you have a lot of conservatives on the general assembly but also we have a lot of progress has been trying to push that we found Democrats strongly supported are independent voters support and also that could be give give them reasons of Bush's were legislation through young people were very strong supporters of this legislation\nRight show one week's ago thanks for coming in I was pretty shitty can see the full results of our latest poll or having a says Rajoy folks\nAgain now that kind of breaks it down for you and once again if you're lifting right now are on this Tuesday over the next seven days there is the final debate Thursday\nOver the next seven days there is the final debate Thursday night\nAnd Cranston mayor Allen ... who's been out spent\nAnd basically has been fighting two fronts he has\nHe has been battling Grillo who's been a distraction and Joe ... who you just heard he's pulling all his votes all of the boats that Joe Louis pulling he's pulling from Cranston mayor Allen ...\nHe is not pulling any votes from Gina Raimondo so whatever the motivation is whatever the motivation is in the same thing whatever the motivation was for Patricia Morgan\nWe had I still had the only debate which obviously a lot of people were upset that we had that debate but we're the only debate\nRight here and I asked Patricia Morgan in this studio\nIf I asked all three candidates it was August twenty night mayor fun Giovanni ... Patricia Morgan if you were unsuccessful will you endorse the winner of the primary\nGiovanni proceed without hesitation said yes mayor phone without hesitation said yes Patricia Morgan Hamdan hard set and focus on my race blah blah blah and then she said but I Would not endorse a Democrat or an independent and\nSaid she turned around she endorsed Joe ... and then came up with this explanation of well I still think of him as a Republican\nOr I'm not saying that's swing a lot but it certainly could have helped to unify the party if in fact Patricia Morgan instead had endorsed Cranston mayor Allen fun\nFeet were going to meet him and talk to them it's all I had a lot more plus the latest on the pulse and the election it's all I had to stay tuned on the John ... beach OSHA\nW. an outright win socket\n\n\nRadio news was Chris bar was president\nTrump defending themselves after being accused by some of fueling the Pittsburgh synagogues shooting last Saturday that left eleven people did\nThe president saying and an interview on Fox last night it's ridiculous to link him to the synagogue shooting in any way especially given his own Jewish ties and support for his daughter Ivanka and her husband are Jewish\nThe president looking forward he says to visiting in Pittsburgh today to me with some of the victims\nAlso in that Fox News interview he had a message for that camera ban of migrants that's heading to Mexico north towards the U.S border\nThis caravan is not wasting their time\nGoing to be on the hill ... both at the national guard\nI made this is the ...

E. R. I. U. C. his signs everywhere and she is running against Democrat Richard ... card for that Senate district twenty seat is you or someone\nWho the future is very important for you and your family\nAbsolutely my elder and will live with the consequences of anything I achieve or failed to achieve and so every child in Rhode Island to try\nUh I thought it was a very interesting article it's certainly demonstrates\nA the the two of you the differences are done by eastern shore but one thing that kind of stuck out to me in in a kind of jumps out about your opponent\nRoger card in that is he almost seemed to be and this has I don't mean it as a criticism and he is you know open about it but he almost seemed to be I think I'll run to kind of do everybody a favor just to hold on to the seat using you tell me if I'm wrong but you seem to have a completely different approach on while you're running\nSo what you're speaking to his commitment yeah and if this idea\nHow hard or you're really gonna work yes and to get to that\nI have to bring up again eighty five percent of the act of voting electorate in this district I have gone to their homes I have come to them to ask their opinion step to understand the challenges that face them and I've had to be I've had to go since June to do this it's a full time job it is\nAnd my opponents thanks well I'll just wait until the end of August to start doing that ... days are shorter and I won't have to go out quite as long as I can take it easy yeah\nAdd to that his own statement I wasn't even sure if I wanted to run one more time\nCommitment ... yes before the election so yeah I think that one more time you get any more committed in the last turn out\nHere I Am putting everything I have into this I got so many crazy works this weekend 'cause I was out walking in the north east are ever\nGoing out on that but let's say with your military background I mean I'm sure it didn't even phase you the job I had to be done you had to get out there what was the reaction of people as you within goals are ordering that whether\nI've gotten tons of emails saying thank you so much for coming from the people that I missed but from people that I met I had a few of them think I was completely insane and I said ma'am sir I've gone to a thousand doors since June I have one week left and you think I'm gonna quit fried I don't care what the weather does\nSure it doesn't impact in any way\nYour commitment now is that have been a July third and it was running that heart and maybe maybe it's\nA little bit different [noise] you know what else Michael touch on some of the people the reaction that you've gotten a the type of commitment you're going to happen to the district because here's what appeals\nTo me about your kids see again folks this is your chance to make a difference of the week from today Michael ... V. E. R. I. for state Senate district twenty and that is one of the problems\nWhen you have all Democrats up there that right now they they a lot of them are at the state houses it kind of becomes have you ever watch penguins when they jump in the water one goes and they all just kind of follow it becomes very difficult for someone to speak out at all due respect but\nThe Democrats than look around left or right and feel they're not going to be the one to stick out you have the opportunity to speak out you were then don't already with anything no party is going to hold you back from speaking on\nDon't already what anything no party is going to hold you back from speaking on the commitment of what you think is most important is that fair\nI'm absolutely committed to being doing what I think is the right thing and I hope the voters agree with me and if they disagree with me in two years get rid of me but I don't think they'll have that problem because I genuinely wants ... want what's best for our state and the citizens in our state and I'm absolutely certain that will shine through in the legislation that I bring to the table\nUm and then the way that I conduct myself\nI Want to I'm going to just go back to the valley breeze article again postcard your opponent said he had a hard time deciding whether to run again this year but when he saw the fellow veteran Senator Mark Cody wasn't running again\nAnd would soccer was losing experience legislative she decided to make at least one more run now old to respect that does not strike me as someone\nJust I'm getting motivated just by talking to that has the type of enthusiasm it almost seems\nAll go one more time just to play out the strength he's been up there for twenty five years I think we can all agree Rhode Island is on the wrong track we need some new blood we need someone with your background and enthusiasm up there and that's why I think so many people are gravitating towards your candidacy\nWe were speaking earlier about the things that separate me from other candidate Seattle about military service ... times um again lab director at a hospital that's a unique medical background that brings something to the table that does here's something we didn't talk about\nGrowing up I went to fourteen different schools because I was a state to state ... joined the army at Seventeen and I've always been invested in my community oh it's\nSo what I haven't been able to to see is a hundred different ways of doing things sometimes the right way and sometimes the wrong way but I learned from all of those\nYou don't want to know what best practices meaning if I see all these different ways of doing things which one was the best and I want to bring that to the table the worst thing you can possibly do is grabbed somebody that only has one point of view yes\nThe best thing you can do scrap somebody that has many different points of view because they can say I've seen us or I've seen a version of this and it failed or it was successful and here's why yet and they can still all of that to bring a unique perspective\nThey your opponent Roger card can you name it again folks could afternoon it's John ... it is the John ... show was speaking with Michael verify it's V. E. R.

consent and some of that is because for the first time this election season Romano is now pulling more support from male voters leading falling with men by seven percent in our poll last month\nFor a male voters leading falling with men by seven percent in our poll last month it was fun who held that seven digit lead with maps\nIn our fourth poll of two thousand Eighteen eye witness news and Roger Williams university asked for a hundred and sixteen likely voters to weigh in on the governor's race\nGovernor Gina Raimondo has opened and eleven point lead over Republican challenger Alan ... she had a seven point lead in our poll last month the explanation could lie in favorability ratings forty six percent of voters have a favorable opinion of songs forty five percent unfavorable\nAnd the other group is independent voters\nEye witness news political analyst and pollster Joe Fleming says ... unfavorable numbers have jumped\nThere's an awful lot of negative ads and Alan ... in the last

citizen of the United states because my mother was not a citizen\nRight but it's that do it the way they I ... I Hope just goes to the Supreme Court because now we have constitutional is on the court enable interpreted to mean exactly what it meant and by the way the person that wrote the amendment I'm now have to go back down my thoughts his intention was\nFor the slaves to have their children become citizens and there was something he wrote about\nOh diplomats not if they have children here that they they are not citizens or I forget exactly what was going to have to go back and ... and re read a but it did there is that this whole thing was misinterpreted by the Supreme Court\nCan remember and remember something the constitution also says in order to vote you have to be a citizen of the United states not a business and all that is correct you're going to be a citizen of the United states and that's why we have these people becoming citizens and by the way what doesn't\nHelp me in in my support a bat is that you only do sixty to pass\nI Try to take the test will be a citizen if you get sixty or you'll pass the test I Would have been an honor student in school\n[laughter] to get sixty two [laughter]\nSometimes I go to a hundred if I can see it either through those pitcher for the people the chance to show up to me all the time\n[laughter] admits he'll be class [laughter]\n[laughter] oh boy what a great country huh\nIt is quite well they'll make it a great again that's the truth we are making a great again a little bit at a time\nWell if he's even a one term president and he solve this problem you you don't you realize in order to make these kids legally have to put it on to uh the go to a two thirds of the states have to vote on it to allow it legal to become a citizen of during this country I mean that would never pass I don't think\nNo no and that and by the way President Trump if he does the executive order which I Hope\nHe does it take less time to get to the Supreme Court ruled on and if we tried to change the constitution saw you know and he can do it by executive order\nBut if we want the constitution the once the the moon and the the Supreme Court that's when it can go on a ballot know him once they rule it that that is not in the constitution that you put it on the ballot to put it in the constitution\nNo no they wouldn't rule it or because they would uphold the constitution but they would uphold it in the way that it was meant to be um interpreted\nThat's correct that's now\nAnd that would that would in all of these illegals crossing the border and having babies have getting only thing that would get no they're\nNot hazard ward until it's put on the ballot and when he told again that have happened and I don't I just said you didn't let me say that oh sorry I I you know you've been having a villain lights again\nNot yet a boy who pose a Bud Light but that's my that's been going on\nFor a drink and I have to worry you know I think I Need a whole lot of writing it off\nIs that true you can have one drink and slumped protest ... just one drink and you can actually get hit DWI\nNext drink ya ya one drink it depends on your way and your body weight on body weight I ... I was thinking I don't say it [laughter] I was going to call myself of that though\nYou can I wouldn't ... Miller Miller a a ... I'm all for the night\n[laughter] [laughter]\nI think I think President Trump is is really really hitting the mock with this I from what I understand\nIt's really really hitting the block with this I from what I understand a Jewish which I think agreed with President Trump he can do an executive order\nAnd I don't I Can't remember the reason why there is a there is a legitimate reason why I was at a truck can do this by executive order will be challenged immediately by the way which is fine because we get it to the Supreme Court and straighten it out [noise]\nYeah that's that's why we we think we're thankful that are Kavanaugh was on a put on a Supreme Court\nBut that doesn't do you think it's going to affect the people the illegals were voting you know do you feel this election by him coming out just before the midterms\nNo you don't really believe that you don't really believe there aren't people illegally voting do you believe that some do you\nOh of course are a lot of crossed a just a few\n[laughter] anybody that's ridiculous that of course you can be it's a very simple life that you can do it\nOh I Know I Know and and then don't worry the the secretary of state of Rhode Island she'd breaking every law the world to keep it secret as to how many people actually voted\nOh what a piece of work my goodness oh they're supposed to purge the roles she did especially hiding it [laughter] I think a lot of people voting in order to state or oh\n... oh my goodness\nUnbelievable\nNo ... in his right eye steroids believable [laughter] a gun but hey it it it is what it is as I say you know\nWhat else is on your mind today\nAnd that's about it going to do what I mean there's ... there's enough is enough food for thought that I mean it's just I I I don't understand that the thought process of the state of Rhode Island when you take a look at people who are deserving\nOf our assistance and you look at the miniscule amount to help that they get [noise] and you say the assault gee\nHow come so and so it's only getting up a tiny bit of help from the state there should be getting more and you look at the people say yeah you're right you know why did not get any more it's because the illegal aliens a he has soaking up all of the benefits\nAnd they look at you and they go huh especially yeah honest that's why people who deserve more on getting it 'cause there's only so much that can go around\nAnd when you distributed to ten thousand instead of a thousand it waters down to the benefits and people actually really deserve our\nGetting crumbs compared to what they should be John and that's that's that's why the state has got to change it really has [noise]\n\nThat and that's why I think everybody out there [noise] she'll look at the people like laws which stands up there with a welcome sign for ... illegal aliens come here because people have got to be defeated\nOffensive violate you ever go to Boston is\nI think so too but they do to him in a ... a male Pathak at the number three of them went down in history I mean gosh they went down to ... century because\nYeah I Know they're all getting elected re elected I Wonder sometimes [laughter]\nWell you remember the illegal illegal people spending money that we're doing a barrel or in the economy or they're driving ... they're doing a lot of things I mean you can't blame anybody Vermont and wanting to come to this great country\nOh absolutely not if I was wondering if I Want to those people I've been doing the same thing but\nWhen you read about these people have been waiting six years ads correct and and they read about this stuff going now those people becoming citizens I'll certainly not going to support them eagles no any\nUs any one that came here legally any um any one I don't care where they're from Mexico while the mall or not you're I I don't care what that problem and and they became a citizen there'll be the first one to tell you throw the bums out\nThey would because they know how they had to work to get here and that's another reason why it's so unfair it's unfair to the taxpayers and the citizens it's unfair so people have come here the right way and worked hard to become a citizen\nIt's wrong amount I look at it but we we still have\nRoom on though and I was I had all the rest of White House and all the rest of the clowns stand up there and say come on it [noise]\nWell we'll look at look at the week Trump is hated in his state\nAnyone tied to Trump and that's been doing a song is that the tying up to ... to ... to up to Trump what do you do with that I

I mean just the calls have been taken in a rescue I mean what are you at five rescues on road though\nFor you know blame but but you we\nWe have uh the one that's kind of always talk but still it it's you know we have the um [noise] in more than what you had when you and and you think about it John when you you've had experience with public safety as a counselor\nWhich way you said the budget was forty million or whatever it was back then but then you also being public safety director you saw the change then now look at where the city is today public safety it changes dramatically and you've seen it on ... you know in your own profession you've seen it in multiple aspects\nYou know I was on the council when we when we got these another rescue and that was a big decision that was a lot of money\nAnd uh and and it was because of a tragic death of that that happened and we find put another rescue on the road a but it's very expensive for the taxpayers 'em sock it but yet but the the people getting older my age\nOr you know nine one one really dead rescue yeah you know and um the city was options have delivered a and are you guys have done pretty good with your budgets with what you're dealing with without the cooperation of collaboration that should be necessary\nAnd the thing is is I Hope you know going forward I think we've we've demonstrated at least on the council side we've we've shown in most recently that was cooperation\nYou know with explanation with with a an equal as I've heard people say you know you put your hand out to shake someone's hand somebody has to be shaking his hand back and when you say that\nWe've had just most recently the mayor had reached out to us regarding a property on ... street now agree or disagree with that purchase it was well explained it was um there was a good dialogue that took place and\nYou ended up with a majority of the council buying into it including myself and I hope that demonstrates the next mayor that that is\nThe way that we would do better to work in the city and it's working collaboratively and having dialogue and having discussion because I'm On the council side we've demonstrated that when you give us that information\nWe get feedback and then we give results and I think the results are laudable when you look at what we what was accomplished\nThere and my five terms on a council\nHas called for president as a compliment I Can't even imagine\nNew reading something in the paper as a complement\nFor the first time that I was expected to vote on as a surprise yeah that would not enter the biggest mine\nAnd we're never that's why we have phones that's where I work shops the ... even an executive workshops to find out what's coming right okay uh never would we read something like that and then expect us to automatically vote for it or by that's almost like intimidation okay and they they don't do it that\nWay no and it it it doesn't because you know what even even a good idea when you find out about a good idea like that you have to end up you start second guessing why it's being presented that way why wasn't I informed from the very beginning and I am one that\nI I Want to be involved I Want to be educated I like to learn and telling me why we're doing things often gets me to buy into it if if it's something that I can agree with and it's much better than like you said I don't want to read about it in the newspaper\n... plus the fact when I was a cause we didn't have the ... the cell phones in those days in the mail like we have today but if but if if the mayor came up the man who was a project that we needed pastor that he wanted\nAnd I had a ... I communicate with seven councilman I didn't want to communicate with the ones I rent with of course I got to get with everybody absolutely I mean there's no question in my mind you listen to some of the dialogue under go to another discussion and you got some ... some that are more information than you do as\nWell I don't have to talk about two years that you were with the uh with Bree in in ... D Roger July right as for the three ... three four and a free for the three\nThat was a tough that was a very tough term I Would have been better you\nI was a tough one are you guys do a good job\nWell thank you and and it's you know what it's it's something that I enjoy doing um I the the whole campaigning part I'm not one that I don't come on the show in and say\nHow good I Am it's not something that I'm comfortable doing but people know my performance they've seen how I've acted I Hope that I've proven myself and I I really do enjoy\nBeing a city councilman and and it's for no other reason than I Believe I'm doing good for the city that I Love that I live in that I was born in and you know raised in and I think that I bring value to the city um and I certainly\nPut my energy and effort into making the city as good a place as I can with my input\nYou do that and it's a and sometimes it as a consequence got frustrated but somebody has to do it Oh absolutely and you know support of your family yes you know and that that's important too\nOh I've got a I've got a great family you know from my parents to my daughter to my wife I'm I'm lucky you know I've got a a a big family that has come out they helped me every year with the the campaigning and such and and they just support me because hey it you know this stuff takes you out of your house and you miss time\nWhen my daughter is now a senior in high school\nAnd I credit and you know you you remember you interviewed or here ... years ago when she was just a little a little tight and I'm now she's she's driving and she's she's going to be graduating going to college\nYou people have more workshops that I've ever seen and we used to always keep we we have a different philosophy that value the heritage\nThat we meet every other Monday and always keep Monday free that's what we we do that too often ... but you guys are where the winds the ... yeah I mean are you guys don't stop that's the bad never we it's because of the size of your budget and the demands today that you have\nEnd to it as as the president I said when I first became president that\nIf if the administration or or the mayor or or another counselor wants a work session they're going to get it and\nYou know so sometimes it it it's tough to get seven people\nTogether and I I I'm not one that believes we just get to a majority and have a meeting so we've got a quorum should be done when all seven can participate because\nWe are one body even though a seven people where one body and it's not fair to hold meetings when some individuals are not available so I really try being a Thursday\nMeetings when some individuals are not available so I really try to be at a Thursday or a Tuesday or Monday I'm I've asked everyone to keep every Monday open and we tend to have work sessions on this Monday but sometimes It's Tuesday Thursday's Wednesday's whatever suddenly we take calls\nYeah no it was ... yeah it's just that is that right no I don't\nSuppose you\nHow old are you there I Am a ... you want to question for Mr ... ... ... is now\nYes good afternoon council president good upstanding maybe you won't say what is a good job you're doing but I'll say it fully most I had a I have no doubt you'll be reelected um and one other thing that I heard earlier in your conversation\nI'm with Mr ... I've watched a couple of times when he has spoke editor of the council and I think he needs to kind of re read what his job description as\nAs he was definitely a speaking at an ad in the evening I'm referring ... and John stopped picking on patch she's a nice lady\nShe don't talk [laughter] she is one where we're going to do I mean if anyone at my feet on the average consumer routine all the time [laughter] but she always wins the bottles\nAnd Dan I'm\nAgain the fourth floor and it's got to be a change it's got to be a change they found that there's just too much I won't go into it you know what it is\n... ... people to find out what the what he wants to do or if he's reelected but as far as I'm concerned has been an excellent council president and I look forward to hearing um controls meetings for the next couple of years\nAnd flavor think everybody God Bless\n\nRadio news speaker of the house Paul Ryan said he does not believe President Trump could sign an executive\nOrder that

consideration here Felice ... deli hunt and she runs for re election\nHere for the city of one socket a few things if you missed yesterday's program I was very informative like there who recap just a few things are are because you know not everybody listens everyday mhm shame on you audience a blood or a couple of things over there\nShame on you audience [laughter] what a couple of things ever ever really a great news or those dark a little bit will start off with the ah the higher education center we talked about the process of bringing that here too in shock\nAnd awe how competitive that was a in the work you have to do a ... as soon as the chief of the city to bring it to shock\nYes so uh as we mentioned yesterday and it's and it's worth I'm sharing again for those who may have not heard but the higher ed facility um there is a higher ed training facility in westerly\nUm the main training a company that is attached to that is electric boat\nAnd uh they have been very successful with training of folks and getting them to work and and getting them employed and that's a really good thing and the project has been so successful that the governor decided that she thought it was important uh to budget some funds in this past budget that passed in the legislature\nOr to bring another hire a training facility into\nA another community and she was focusing on northern Rhode Island and of course northern Rhode Island has a lot of different cities and towns and most people would\nYou know obviously like to have that facility in that community ah when I learned that she was thinking of doing that\nI gave her a call and spoke with her and she had with her the importance of having that higher ed training facility in the city of one sock it what it would do to help the residents here and also how beneficial it would be because people from\nOther communities could also come to that training facility and be trained so now we're bringing folks in from outside of when socket into our city they're seeing our city they're eating they're buying coffee they're going to the gas station restaurants et cetera and so they're supporting\nThe economy in the city of one socket or so after a few conversations and some meetings and meeting with her staff\nOr she determined that one socket was the location of that the new training facility would be located and uh we had a press conference as you remember and what was really exciting was the partnerships\nOr that were developed in bringing the higher ed facility here so when you're talking about what companies are going to be in this higher ed training facility or you want to make certain that they are companies of substance\n... ... you know the mayor has been extremely receptive to any of the ideas that I that that I've had I'm In ... will bounce back and forth all I'll explain you know what I Want and why\nIt in some cases or want to go to the budgeting process it go to limit it could eliminate it and that's understandable because it's only it's only so much finance money to go around\nAnd I understand that but the the support that or the police officers or have gotten in I've gotten from the administration I'm In the purchasing overall\nUpdated vehicles or everything from or tasers to getting knock salon to getting patrol rifles to getting heavy duty bullet proof vest all of these things are expensive items but vital equipment off for the police department to have a I've been fortunate there has been forfeit your money which I've been able to use\nA very judicious on what I spend the money on what I spend the money on\nI'm very conscious of of the budget and stay within in stay within the budget but uh the support has been great I'm In that resonates through uh the morale of the police department the officers are very engaged um and things are very good at doing socket was department\nNow have seen the bikes out there myself not that great yeah yeah they are as I can imagine\nGet those motorcycles and there'll be no shortage of officers vying for the most like\nOh I've got along I read a long list [laughter]\nSo they they they have to find a Segway off of that for a second so I'm the chief I was talking about um all the things he just spoke of and the equipment that's necessary and things like that but I just want to touch on the fact that along with that\nComes relationship so we talked about this yesterday relationship building\nBeing able to work with people being able to uh work through issues or needs et cetera so when whether it's the thoughts whether it's ... they had built\nWonderful working relationship with folks from within the city and ... outside of the city so there are times that there is um some competitive grant money that make the available or some other funding sauce uh where we can actually\nUse those funds to help us purchase what we need a for the police department all the fire department and when you have 'em fast and play directed and she is in place that\nHave those relationships\nIt's important because the people who are controlling and reviewing where the funds go they know is this is this individual committed\nTo their we're committed to their department will it be beneficial do they truly needed so building relationships like we spoke about yesterday is what helps lead the city of ... that's why it's always important to maintain those relationships to respect the people that you need to work with in order to try to\nPain those relationships to the respect for the people that you need to work with in order to try to advance your community so fortunately for us as far as public safety goes\nYou know we have a wonderful public safety director and ... and we have two great teeth and they have the relationships that they have built this this has been long term 'em long term commitment to a profession\nSo that she talks about how many years he's been in law enforcement the same thing with ... shot trucks and the same thing with direct to July so over those decades of of years they have built relationships and those relationships help the city of ...\nIf I could expand on that just a small example of it is a I have a personal relationship with Peter gain or who was head of\nEmergency management or prior to that he was director of Providence emergency management management he's just been named the deputy director of FEMA national emergency management off\nAnd go during his tenure here when he was at the state just minor thing the knocks on that I was able to get for the officers I got through emergency management at no cost to the city and those doses were thirty to forty dollars a dose\nJust within the last six months I'm I was able to get gunshots a\nBlood clot kits for police officers to carry on their person God Forbid they should receive a gunshot wound or be on the scene of someone else was a gunshot wound\nThose kids were Seventy dollars apiece I've got a hundred of them that were given to me through my relationship with Peter gain a and as a matter of fact they didn't have a chance to tell them you're yet I've been invited down to visit him in Washington he just started two weeks ago a Clinton going down and visit in December eleventh and to December twelve\nAlways to maintain that relationship because now he's in a much bigger capacity that he could possibly do something and the mayor is absolutely right if they have confidence in you know you're trying to do in what goals you're trying to to get and it's going to benefit the community in which you work they're more\nApt to try and get use those resources knowing that they're not going to be squandered they're going to be used properly and that they're going to be maintained for something of that so those are the relationships and\nBeing in law enforcement six years in Smithfield thirty six and browse through my forty fifth year so there's not too many places in the state that I Can't reach out to talk to somebody when I when I Need something and that's a great benefit to have in the law enforcement circular\nGreat benefit for hearing about it and law enforcement but I'm mayor I'm assuming of the same relationship building these this network of communication\nTies to the mayor's office as well we talked about the uh higher education center and the ability to to reach out to governor Gina Raimondo and have that conversation\nAnd have gender among those trust in you in the city or to bring down here like a cheap just said it's not going to be a squandered opportunity she knows you're going to take this ball and run with it and make it a success\nOver there was the railroad whether it's the plazas whether it's legislation with our state reps are state senators those relationships that you built over the years um it has to be a huge factor in the mayor's office\nIt is it's extremely important and we've used those relationships and you know I speak of the governor's office and it's the same with the lieutenant governor's office and also the directors that work for the governor so we\nWe are our relationship with uh the director of the department of transportation director algae or director Janet quite from the yeah those are individuals that\nWhen you think about that you know D. E. M. we received a three hundred thousand dollar grant from D. E. M.\nTo build the softball field a calf pop into putting some new ... Clinton and what happens is\nWhen they see you take that money and you utilize that money and you you do so in a fashion where you are cautious as to how you spend it just because it's state grant money doesn't mean you overpay for the project it means you still look for the best price and you get the most done with the money that you have\nAnd then they see the outcome of that when they see the outcome of that when there was another grant that comes around they recognize but we know if we get some of this money to the city of when socket that we know there's going to be advances made and it's going to be recreational\nI'm a development that\nHappens from this as opposed to a community that may receive it and they really don't see any movement with that money or the end product is not up to the standard that they would light so same thing with director al ... a working through getting crumbling hill road paved when it was just a\nMile or two of potholes and being able to develop that relationship to get that done to get us through until that whole wrote a road is reconstructed so those relationships are extremely important and that is not something that you you develop\nOver a week or a month or a year or even over a couple of years that\nTakes years of showing respect to each other and understanding that you can't always accommodate\nBut you're always there to listen to try to help each other\nThey um program area but just about our last two minutes or so I'm so old\nOf segue to you don't want to be just for a a for a comment\nSo um I'll save a little bit of time for for the chief so I just would hope everyone knows the election is in a week and I want one weekend or what is it three and a half\nHours right and it'll all be over us so I Am just a which is like to share that um we have made a lot of progress over the last five years we've made vast improvements we have a lot of projects that\nAre in the works and more that are coming I so I guess my ... my messages you know let's not stop now let's continue making the progress and making the advances and continue to improve the community that we all love\nJesus any final than on your visit here are decides what a spectacular telling you that\n[laughter] you know\nA thank you and ah no I just wanted to say that ah I appreciate all the support that the police department is getting good news is a good thought\nThe recruits that are in the final stages of the training academy they should be graduating in the early part of the summer so that will be eight more officers that I'll be able to have which will that allow us\nTo Institute a school resource officer program right now we only have one school resource officer in the high school when these other officers graduate or do the grant money that we were able to get through with the with the school department funding or we're going to have a total of four as sorrows and one in the middle school\nOne of the high school and one that we can use as a Rove around to cover\nOr even do some work into the ah the grammar schools which is very important so it's a lot of good things happening at the police department\nAre given my chances programs are always open to the police department if this program or some awareness you need to get out there or just give us a call for our clocks always available\nSo thanks Geoff I'm there to talk again as because of the week or ... or we have a recipe for a good day program\nIce skating I bring my kids they're all the time when I used to ice skate with the cat\nAnd we'll talk about that last night that does seem to be some support out there for the reopening of the skating rink at river island part I don't know what that would involve how much money we're talking about cording to someone who called last night there may be\nA sponsorships available there may be area businesses would kick in some money to reopen the skating facility a river island park I don't know you know how accurate that is but that's been said\nBecause you know we keep the kids at\nThat that isn't a you might think the city to grow well the only way it's going to grow as if we keep our children active and things to do in our city not where they have to go outside the city because we make no money if they go outside the city we need to bring them here\nAnd you know I like I said I used to be down there all the time with my kids and then I had a couple of other kids\nSaying oh you know can you give me a ride down there 'cause my mom's gonna pick me up I thought well okay you have your mom right and you know all call me\nAnd I will do so much you know and and I used to do that I mean it was always packed all the time\nWe got to find things for the children to do and I I Know he said at the council meeting that we should um you know a look at everything and check everything out and see what we need for it you know if it's a couple of pieces we need or or whatever we need yeah we should go far because\nYou know and people would donate ice skates\nOn one problem that we discussed yesterday is that\nThey had vandalism problems at the park on a regular basis and they also there also was a group of kids who would go there not to have a good time skating but to create problems so that all that a mother issue issue in itself well\nYou know Larry we got to have the money to put more police officers out there and look they also did that to the you know the want to talk\nAnd we have no place for the kids to swim we have no place for the kids to go to the movies we have no can't place for the kids to do anything so you know what an order to keep the kids active and out of trouble we need to have more things for our children and the city\nOr basically you'd like to see the uh the ice skating park reopened a river island park\nOh definitely definitely\nTo and you'd like to see some money put into refurbishing the parking nearly a middle school um I call it the skateboard a spot but what you said they use it for different things but you'd like to see that improved as well\nYeah I find a better location so we can make a big one like everybody else because you know what that brings the kids and the people together\nI think that's the perfect spot for I mean there's loads of room there and it's visible where people can see it uh I I don't as far as its location I don't think there's anything wrong with that part next middle school no I\nI'm not saying that I said if you know if there is a problem then you know move it but the why do they have in all the other places\nYou look around Larry you and you would be surprised that looks like something you can put together in a back yeah the one that I'm Talking about I huge and oh my goodness Larry it makes your head spin it's what a trip to go there for the kids to have fun that's how great they are but\nI don't know how much these facilities costs to you know\nWhy we're not in our houses and we're not making any money on them I mean come on you know there's so much that we can do what went on any given teachers are raised I mean ... you know we're going backwards instead of ... but that being said let somebody else have a chance to call aren't great night Lowry\nAll right bye now she's made a point maybe you want to make yours seven six six Thirteen eighty\nAnd she has a ideas as to how we should be spending our tax dollars maybe you have some ideas of your own maybe you agree maybe you disagree feel free to give us a call we'd love to talk with you good afternoon Iran W went awry\nGrass and Larry yes how are you a I kept my promise\nThat's Laurie number one [laughter] Laurie number one on a loser you caught me off guard Laurie\nWell I told you told me to promise you remember\nYeah and and you did promise you kept your prominent I kept\nMy promise I didn't want to break my primary\nOh good [laughter] and I used to have me on a Saturday morning\nI'm always use the hearing you early on a Saturday but I Love hearing you on a Tuesday\nYeah if I told me that you had that one complaint that I don't call you in a weekday that's correct [laughter]\nLarry what I Want to mention I felt so bad about the people that were killed in that sit in a God wouldn't matter\nOf let's be honest about all I mean that's a so so I\nI Can't even put it into words counted on\nWhat kind of people do that Larry\nWell we're probably know more about this person he certainly is a hate filled individual based on everything we know about him what he was posting on line what he was saying he was I hate filled person what really bothers me is a\nLot of people knew that this guy was out there and he was hate filled a wine and somebody knock out his daughter ... is screws and the right place you know I I don't think\nWhy does somebody knock at his door to see if he had his screws and the right place you know I I don't think anyone in their right mind well I say that I I cannot imagine anybody in their right mind committing this atrocity I\nGet the full I'm praying\nYeah I mean when you think of you know you're not even safe in a church or synagogue to I mean Larry\nI gotta I didn't want him but I remember as saying that President\nKennedy on said I never forgot it he sat down and get you know mad or way you are anything in church he said that\nI don't remember him saying that but I'm going to take your word for\nIt because they are like I told you I'm old and my shoulder and I remember him saying that I never forgot it\nIsn't that a sad statement though but it is so true I mean look at what has happened unbelievable\nOh I wasn't people right or\nKill eleven people killed six injured including for police ...\nI think ... funeral is now I think President Trump was supposed to attend why not today yeah\nYeah he was supposed to be making his way there yes\nThey do what I don't have that name I'd hang on right away I won't even give them like that's all I don't care Larry I don't\nI Know they are talking about the death penalty and I know that in itself is a controversial topic but in this particular case I'd I I think that's even too good for him\nTo be honest with you know I Know what I thought of him Larry yeah\nThey said that chance with me on Bolivia can't even go to church\nI Know and and you know the ... what do we do do we do we put armed guards idolizes of worship is is that where we're at\nAs a as America I mean is that what I mean who would've ever thought whoever thought\nAnd all my time I knew that I Believe that I got violence like this you\nKnow I haven't and I think that they're you know that's a it's a topic in itself why is our society is so filled with violence chair and I think there is there were a number of reasons for that I was reading a A R or heard in the news today that\nOver half of all the movies are that are out there are rated R. and again that's filled with the violence\nViolence and sex and your ... and and this is what we expose our young people to on a regular basis I\nKnow I'm sticking come I Will always\nStand up for that it is that is safe\nAnd Larry I by the way I hadn't been mentioning you know I watched it on this day with the law at time right yes but I some episodes I liked and they can't cry that Michael Land and what an actor though\nThat was an extremely good series when you think of it or that that was good family entertainment not only was a family entertainment but it was educational to see how people out there at that time period live\n... I think we need things like that Larry\nWell we certainly need more little house on the prairie than the garbage that uh we see all around us today until I Know\nI listened to your program yesterday so dogs maybe today all they got another episode at\nSix o'clock [laughter] oh by the way my Red Sox\nWon yes they did you must be very proud of ... very ... you and a lot of other people have they deserve that no\nWell I guess they played well and yeah they certainly a had a great season\nOh Larry guess what I think can fly is left and right yes I Know one yesterday from a friend at least of all Ellie\nYes you get one um I if I keep on ... ... what did it say on it\nWas a picture of a a like a house like a ranch type house a White House with a shrubs and a front yeah\nThe same thing what are the ... of calm 'til she mentioned stuff like OK okay not that saying you know and I got to think well it won't believe that the male Madoff followed by mail sly front Joan\nBut I Would think the same people who shopped in when sock it at Walmart all the same people are shopping at Wal Mart north Smithfield so ...\nYeah a lot of times when I go there to police their nose or is this a severe problems all the time yeah well I wouldn't think so too and take a\nStore like that one have you know they only it's actually what\nI Would have to assume it's shoplifting that I mean when you take into consideration the size of the store the bigger the store the bigger the problem is with shop lifting I'm sure you know I was that\nLast one day and I was on the shop ... this guy had a full ... stuff [noise] and he walked right out of this year so it's best to you got to pay for that you're going to come to the cash it didn't even after he just walked right out they had to go after\nI'm sure that happens I'm sure that I have I mean there there are people are so very bold and I'm very creative\nI'm sure that but I mean there there are people are so very bold and I'm very creative as to how to steal other people's property\nBy the cashier would account for stuff and she says hey you're going to cash out you know it kept right on well what there was no tomorrow they had to go after him in the parking lot [laughter]\nAny and even if they believe the mother arrested probably be out doing the same thing tomorrow so\nThanks a lot of very ... you wouldn't do something like a long way you know [laughter]\nYou're right ruined in front of you know you are correct on that guy she Yellen right you've got to cash right ongoing didn't even look at them I\nCould care less that's probably with less yeah well again that's his way of handling things probably um [laughter]\nI Know ... there's a lot of people walk out with a flat screen TV yeah if I'm going to just walk right I don't\nWell you know that's you know oftentimes they do see somebody out the door checking your packages to slip and they go\nYou go to a an elderly person Dutch retired that's working part time they're not going to stop\nThem yeah I don't know how much of a deterrent that is yeah I can\nCall the police that's about all the little you know at a time they got another problem\nI don't have any problem that is for sure\nI just found that interesting this one I saw that on TV I'm thinking is this what we're going to ask well right now Harris several [laughter] ever good\nLike All right take care maybe you have a

of your continued support\nOn November sex I supported impasse responsible budget for the residential and commercial taxpayers\nHeld our elected leaders accountable and sought open honest and transparent government\nWrote the legislation to return the school committee to an elected body currently I'm working to re millions of dollars in revenue from renewable energy projects and I will continue to fight the owners and seek improvements from Senate wrote and the waste water treatment plant as I Believe this is an important quality of life issue on November sects\nI Will be honored and humbled by your continued support\nPaid for friends have John Brennan brand new ... is your independent candidate for Senate district twenty four when socket north Smithfield you're tired of Rhode Island politics your insurance is in taxes went up again\nYou know you're tired of Rhode Island politics your insurance is in taxes went up again you're pensions went into hedge funds under Raimondo and your benefits were caught\nBy politicians you're a senior citizens still with no Medicare backup like Massachusetts a working families minimum wage will be a dollar fifty an hour less than Massachusetts\nThis January they're paying taxes on your cars and trucks to get to work but luxury boats worth thousands to millions of dollars are still not paying\nAny sales or property taxes in Rhode Island this is your life under decades of this\nDemocrat leadership Clinton do some blonde was a Democrat and is now your independent candidate you want change do not put the Democrat leadership special interest funded candidate in office you on a senator fighting for change taking\nNo pac money with no special interest elect Clinton do ... your independent candidate for senator district twenty four when socket north Smithfield\nPaid for by the committee to elect Glenn discipline\nWe have a message from Missy ... family restaurant at eight o one Clinton street October is definitely pumpkin month try our delicious pumpkin pancakes waffles are stumped French toast\nDon't forget our eating breakfast special Monday through friday from six until ten thirty two eggs toast home fries and coffee for five Ninety nine ... office freshly brood ice or a hot coffee in many different flavors\nOf those things that were caught have been reinstated now that we don't have a Republican or a supplemental tax a punishment a budget a commission all predicated on the fact that the state would not step in and help us\nDo you think that that was part of a conspiracy in your opinions and get rid of a Republican as mayor of one talking\nWell it's not necessarily to get rid of them but they knew that things were failing and when that big budget fought shortfall came and you remember John Ward thing it's so eloquently all the time\nIt's nothing we did it's the fact that now bring into the state cut four or five millions of our funds that was enough to put us over the edge ... the lack of of a support\nAnd I think the same thing would happen if in fact Glen due for blind got elected as an independent he is not going to go there and change anything\nYou're not going to the general assembly as an individual against this mandate the Republicans can't do it clearly an independent can't do it and if people even think to believe this one socket is going to be in a far more detrimental position than it is now\nWe need we absolutely require a strong general assembly delegation\nWhere I don't know if you want to say fortunate\nWe have again so what we have is what we have we have several firemen and the general assembly we're losing mark Cody which to me is a big loss he was a perfect gentleman\nIt was an advocate for the city and uh and its citizens and he will be mass but we need a strong delegation and tell people that are given a\nCommittee seats given seats at the table with the leadership of the general assembly is necessary for the future of our funding because even when you see the state aid whether it be the education or to the general fund\nAny diminishing of those numbers is catastrophic to the city we just can't make up those big number [noise] so you know I just wish\nPeople would talk more about the issue and the difficulties that that uh are involved in the city versus the negativity\nAll right thank you I thank you for the call by now

... is a dull pain and pain that some work of my uncle I mean my uncle had to save\n... sort of Seoul coins and stamps at all ... come out of high school\nNo more it's somewhere in the country but I understand the ... from the mob\nUh I don't know if you'd have to do it state by state I'm not quite sure what the process would be to be honest with you\nWell I think a ... aspect I guess it was great and see how it worked out you but from a financial point of view of view\nA lot of thought what benefit more the friday before the ... uh mhm because it'd be more kids how it'd be more power to our shop at a job because their kids reading or took a treaty that at a night\nYou know I I was talking to someone today there's a community in Massachusetts I Can't remember the name of the community but they started doing this a few years ago a\nWhere the community itself has decided to they they made their own decision that\nHalloween was going to be celebrated on the last Saturday\nI'm a ... a month and that's what they've been doing for a number of years now and they even limited the a trick or treating time between certain hours and I figured if it's like between five and eight or something like that so everybody is aware you know you're gonna have\nOf kids out there on the streets from five o'clock until eight o'clock on a Saturday Night drive carefully so on and so forth and be home for the trick or treaters you know\nYeah I agree with that but I Would like to find out from that particular community ... finance how did it benefits are going to an area\nYeah that's a good question that's a good question I mean Halloween is a big business no question about it you know maybe hurricanes without ... maybe that would be more kid's trick or treating if it was done that way I Am because I Know there are some people who keep their kids home because they don't feel safe\nI Believe it ... I Believe it but we're trying to be perfect because their parents are owned by the on the other home you know the regular education ... Saturday\nRight right well it's something to think about anyway\nYeah and I pick up on a night from your boss fair yes there's a rocket booster shot mhm became an idea yesterday we were talking about are on the uh the morning show yeah I like his idea\nAnd what is that he by the ... yes a package him out I Love that idea right\nSo I got about maybe I don't know if I don't want to be a bad day in and out but I'm going to talk to my daughter she if you drink it out and I got like a hundred and twenty or what do you call ... ...\nI I Can't go type of thing I like potatoes that talk right Doritos and stuff like that and so I'm just going to give it to my daughter have badger out again to replicate driving a candy ... you're not to come up their door got what they were yeah yeah there are there are like well you're very tired idea came up with a traitor of beer\nWhile I think what you have to do is whatever you give out make sure it's something you'd like so that that way there is anything left it's yours [laughter] might think\nRated I before my wife passed away in three years ago mhm there's never any of that law [laughter] I've never I remember one uh Halloween I spent over a hundred dollars and candy\nOh my wow would oh God yeah yeah\nYeah I find I found out ... corporate was Mm my late why\nIs that right [laughter] oh yeah\nSure given like should have ... ... ... atrophy too for your dream for me to read from your one field\n[laughter] I Wonder if you had nothing left at the end of the ... the night [laughter]\nRight but I don't really regret for your address where where's your world through to wonder what perjury yeah yeah\nBut I doubt I hear even even work life may be able to come up with that either I reject you should go trick or the mayor\nWell it's a it's an interesting proposal that's for sure\nBecause they're older they don't feel like I did during the day before getting caught up to look at that if you're not a weekday or whatever we have a way of our kids that are trying to figure out of school they're ready to go shopping do what you're going to do and they took a trigger\nAn idea and I do\nI let you go out no matter how nice to have\nYou as well take you know by open line conversation continues good afternoon Iran WN outright\nAnd low\nAnybody there and loyal\nHello yes I'm waiting for Larry you are talking with Larry go right ahead\nOh I've hung up spent I listen to a little house on the prairie every night at seven o'clock\nYou like that show [laughter]\nVery much yeah Michael Landon he played on the now the every day at two o'clock\nIs that Michael my eye on bonanza\nJoe ... brown and white hot aisle amino you'll have a lot\nI Am in once bonanza are in such a long time to call it a little ...\nLittle journal I remember little job but I don't ...

I Know he's a good a loan officer you know because there are many many moving parts to buying a home and when you work with a full time experience realtor we can guide you and tell you this is a good person to use if it's a lender like our our\nAge you and tell you this is a good person to use if it's a lender like our our sponsor the John ... first home mortgage you know he takes great care of all of his clients I mean you can call him at his cell phone number\nAnd he will get back to you within a half hour I said if you were to give him call for one to six six four four one three and say hey John and want to apply for a mortgage\nWhat do I need to do to clean up my credit you leave them that message took it back to the half hour okay\nI Know that John is good for that because I work in the business I've been doing it for a long time and I know who's good I Know who is not good okay I Know it was responsive that's one thing that I always look for is communication from the books that I work for a business to\nAnd when you look at what we have just within our borders it blows your mind I mean you're talking seven eight square miles right and we have stuff that other cities and towns just can't touch ... number one is said yes yep seventh biggest company and the entire country\nAny other city or town would just kill to have that sure I mean ... Amazon announces that it has a new headquarters opening up and\nHow many you know tens of thousands of towns one day a rabbit that exactly we did to meanwhile we have a CBS right here yeah let's take advantage of that ... um I play volleyball uh gators\nYeah I played against a team that was all CBS corporate people mhm ... corporate people probably in their late twenties early thirties\nAnd I asked them I said do you guys live on socket right out of eight zero yeah\nAnd I'm like well you know why is that and then it's a lot of it's the stigma mhm okay they heard things mhm\nBut they don't really have a real good reason you know they're they're young professionals yeah this is a good market for them this is a good place for them to you know set of shopping and call their home yeah um other stuff we have in our borders we ever on um emerged a hospital\nEmergency runway with cardiac rate oncology unit ... radiation yeah fantastic and you have\nSo many other companies that operate with a hospital so many other companies that work beside CBS mhm um that wouldn't be here without those two businesses yeah\nOther things are infrastructure roads a fantastic ... um you know you drive everywhere yes some of those rows and other towns are around us um wastewater treatment plants are Waterford and plants yeah a stadium theater all these you know all the museums\nThat way I Am yeah museums are stadium theater is a great asset you know um you you mentioned the hospital I think the hospital is a fantastic asset to have\nBecause again it it\nYou know the people who work in a hospital doctors you have nurses have physicians assistants these are all folks that are making good pay and they come into the city they work and then they go home somewhere that is to Cumberland or Lincoln or Massachusetts just you know but I\nYou know talking about cache when sock it has almost in many folks mind the anti cache you know and but there are pockets that we need to you know and I think a lot of it too is us as realtors we need to talk about the eastern socket\nYou know eastern sock and has neighborhoods that it will get a hold hold a candle to any other good neighborhood in Cumberland Smithfield et cetera the right well maintained houses nice family areas and ah you know if it's just dynamite place to raise again\nThat's ... that's ... that's my comment brownies from socket and you're you know ... fantastic homes and fantastic neighborhoods and it was always something to do yeah and we we have the um you know shopping centers right down the street right around the corner right\nAnd to me that was the ideal ... you know place to grow up yeah um the communities and all the families they knew each other and it was fantastic yeah\nI'm right now I live in burning I bought a house and burning again another great neighborhood yeah everybody knows everybody else great houses yeah I'm In your right there are pockets all around the city is actually the majority of the city right\nIs like that and it's just you know we don't touted enough\nMhm even to other realtors yeah how many other real tall and weigh from socket legit leg exactly you ask them why and they don't really know now they don't oh you don't want to go to\nA second man and the thing is I you know I'm just going to turn the camera and again I'm I like when socket because you know something and other assets that I think we should leverage is Catholic schools are good Catholic school so why don't you know if you don't want to send your kid to the\nYou know the middle school which is by the way a new building all new facilities and you look at you know cities like ... at Providence\nYou look at other towns you know Kentucky at protecting us into a couple of new buildings but they can't they're all old you know sixty Seventy eighty nine year old buildings that are functionally obsolete\nYou know who knows if they're sick buildings can as a thin asbestos and all that other nonsense that they may or may not have when sock it doesn't have that\nOkay we've got a new middle school you know everything that is going on with um [noise] relocating the fields close to the high school you know this is that everything takes time you know they had like that that Harry Potter magic wand you could just wait\nYou know this is not everything takes time you know they had like that that Harry Potter magic wand you could just wage they back in time and you have to just say okay boom make sure they make to make the field here make this recognize that effort at it's not the way it is but it's I think\nIf we have a long view when of course selling real estate you know I guess the average time is what four or five or six or seven years in that range from a lot of people move some of the a lot can happen and that but then there are a lot of folks who stay for ten Twenty years\nRaise their kids in the same municipalities same town city so that's something that is\nYou need to think about that because when sock it I think in the long term it as\nUm a lot of opportunity plus if they're the MBTA that you know the train coming down and that's going to be great you know we've got great highway access to route Ninety nine for it but\nWhen people talk about they talked about you know that the poop factory and everyone is ... and ... that's what we'll get all you know the exposure but you don't hear enough about the opportunities zones\nThat rehab I mean there's one and burning as one right here on main street I mean there are some nice opportunities um those are like you know that's a beacon nationwide for somebody that wants to look at a business where they can be incentivized to hire people\nAn incentive fight to hire people and to you\nDo things and I I agree you know and and uh like you are you know I've moved lots and lots of people into the city you know as their realtor I promoted when stock and I say you know this is a great neighborhood you know at the time it was a good price let's let's dive in and make the purchase\nThat I'm looking at that as a long term play right so you you invest in one socket now and you're going to like what you're looking at ... you know a few years down the road right because there's this stuff right at a pop mhm and it's it's already in the works yeah\nJust a short term just in the last few years taxes alone residential taxes I'm Talking about\nUm have dropped dramatically yeah that is huge and every other town around those who are watching them creep up mhm okay with it and that's that's great that's you gotta realize how competitive we we are again and we have a homestead and we have the homestead for people to live in a house yeah you're right\nAt home and like like I said I'm looking at it as a\nLong play mhm okay I'm I'm not saying a year or two years from now right if you stick with us for you know let's say five years down the road you're going to start to like what you say yeah\nAnd and I just wanted to chime in because folks you know where you're you're listening to the job with the real estate show we have Tom Keith candidate for the city council and here in ... and Tom has the vision the understanding of course being in the real estate business\nHe has the understanding that you've got to have you know it's a long game and you know when you\nYou make money in real estate you make money when you buy you buy it right and then you add value so that you can leverage that increase in value over time and not going to do it in one two three or four years Thomas the guy for\nTo have on a city council because you understand the challenges of the small business person ...\nYou know and how it ... it it shouldn't be difficult when you go into city hall you know he didn't think that\nAt a city councilman he can you know effect change like that she's not going to teach you understand and you can't\nWe talked about the magic wand before he understands that the city doesn't have a magic wand to make things happen but he knows the long game you start laying the foundation the groundwork to make changes so it'll be better for\nEverybody in the city here now and down the road as well and that's why it's important to everyone who's going out to vote to think about\nThat when you go to cross the little line on the ah on your ballot because Tom understands that you know he he was born and raised here\nSo he's seen you know the cycle the business cycle if you've seen what's happened when the city hasn't been I'm\nHad good guidance and hasn't had with people at the helm and you know Tom wants to contribute you asked to give back you\nLot of relatives we do this if you get back to society and the city of when soccer's fortunate to have someone lifetime wants to do that [noise] um\nWhat are some other initiatives timed if you have any that you know\nYou'd like to share with our listeners [noise] so the the last um [noise]\nThe last forum of the uh the the Kennedys last week I'm One of the things I highlighted was the course of course we'll ... um we all know what's really high ... and we all know that it's it's kind of a deterrent factor for some businesses not all but for some businesses\nAnd one of the things that I Want to stress was was setting goals in planning and actually having a designer vision for five years ten years they won't even fifty years down the road and\nI'm a ... one of the things I I put out there was hey let's take that commercial tax rain let's just cut it in half right okay ... and let's try to do in five years and\nUm so when I look at the commercial tax rate and I look at how the city handles the budget ... it's a little disturbing um so the last budget go round we had the mayor um propose what they had come up with it is and what that ended up doing was\nActually increasing the commercial task of levee up mhm\nPut forth a bold vision\nThe leader and they're not and recruit people get you know ... people say listen\nWhy don't you can just work this out support me on this and basically do some more training to get some initiatives and acted right you know when you have a group of people who are running in different directions tied in their own horn turning their own horn fool to get you know shafted in that\nThe taxpayer salute yeah you know go back to ... you run your own business okay this is real estate's you set goals in your business now of course she had said probably yearly goal and you probably said monthly goals and even daily goals\nRight away if if I was asked anybody on socket what is the goal that you know that everybody wants to talk of his striving toward and you'll hear crickets nobody knows yeah and you would think that as a community as a city government if you ask them what the goal is they have to know what it is in order to get to it\nAnd the thing is to you know these are things that if someone on the city council had bowl like that um that they this doesn't it doesn't cost money to do this sometimes they you know what I'd like to change the way we do this so it's easier for someone to come before city council and get whatever change they need to happen simple\nLittle things like that everybody votes out of boom it's done you know so a lot of times it's just taking that initiative\nBeing a leader being bold and getting it done and who benefits the city benefits now is this something that's ... that's ... you know magic pill it's going to make things change overnight well incrementally it will\nNot going to see it and in headlines but maybe it'll stretch here hearing people talk about hey you know that was ... that I heard I heard is going to be a horror story you know like the DMV would it be nice if you've heard that about ... what is your time it gets re in Grand forks how horrible it is a whichever office or go to\nYou know Russia but you know [noise]\nWe we have to really put our heads together as a city government and and really strive for the same purpose yeah to work against each other and and if you say your goal is just to get by and just to stay above water that's not really a golden called survival right\nOn that's not so good so you know I don't have every answer I'm not going to pretend to mhm\nBut getting everybody you know some of the sharpest talent in the city of getting them altogether how can you not come up with a great design and a great vision in plan around that vision and designed yeah um it's it's so simple and it's it's but it's so difficult to it seems you know in the city lately\nYeah and you know because something to it a lot of it as just talking about vision that word keeps coming up but having ideas to make changes and hey maybe we should have\nA focus group of business people in this in the city to talk about whatever the issue is that the city council is considering\nFocus groups in past any money I'm sure I'm sure that if you called up a half a dozen business people said hey if the restaurant people if it was all different kinds of business people wanted their input and they had to meet\nOnce a month or once a week for two months or whatever it is you get a lot of yeses because in my experience people usually feel that the their voices are not be forward where they're they don't have\nA voice so I think if someone were to say hey would you like a voice\nWould you like to be heard I'd be very surprised if especially a business and if they're going to say no\nThat that's one of my things is just having conversations with Ben is with is that I'm Sorry business owners mhm and and saying how can we help you as a city how can you help us\nYou know reach out to the community a little bit more I mean and that's what effect that cooperation cooperation operation measures if we had that conversation with CBS yeah now how can you integrate more into our community how can you know select more residency for higher or or just\nYou know supporters are sports and stuff like that\nAgain that doesn't cost money right that's a conversation\nI'm and I have to um rephrase that I said before so we didn't really have a plan we do have a play and we have a comprehensive plan right it's not really a plan ... more of like a wish list of things that will never get done\n'em and we we just seems like we've scrap that we had a five year budget plan right that's been scraps probably two or three years ago\nOh we don't play off of that either mhm I'm so you're like which direction you headed yeah and how do you know you're headed in that direction mhm you know just because you show up and and you make decisions here and there\nWhere does that get you what was the end result ... where where do you want to be where you're going yeah and I I feel like that is seriously lacking\nUm and it can be very simple stuff\nFor instance what if we said today let's be a city that is is more green right on the the greenest city maybe we're more green yeah already looking into solar panels right now\nAnd wind power um current our city okay let's let's get all in on that but it's not just pick and choose a couple of things let's say hey here's one socket let's raise the flag and say look at us we're probably the green a city in Rhode Island right come here yeah okay we have all this stuff going on let's raise our recycling rates\nAre recycling rates are actually very low mhm and because they're so low it raises or taxis right and which in turn raises are um\nTaxes mhm so so getting that recycling just as a community just saying hey we're going to do a nice push to get our people to recycle more mhm\nWhich will in turn lower the trash fee which go on tour in lower everybody's taxes right and we're recycling on top of that ... yeah and it's very exact right every\nTo it you know and a lot of times things like this they start off with just people talking about and it's increasing awareness\nYou know time had mentioned something early to made me think you know if you're saying I heard I was at one of the national association of realtors training sessions that they have and you know what gets measured gets improved and you know that's what\nMunicipalities should do that's what maybe the city council should do is like okay what is our success rate once our track record with whatever the metric is that you want to talk about getting thing if what if what is the change what are we doing to make the city better\nIn two thousand Eighteen than it was in two thousand sixteen when everyone who's on the city council was first elected\nAnd that's why the city of socket it's very fortunate that you have Tom Keith running and hopefully everyone who goes out to vote is going to go to Tom and everybody you need to go you know get out and vote it's the only voice you have in government that\nComes every two years exercise your vote\nAnd you have a great candidate\nExercise your ...\nAnd you have a great candidate that same
