is blown up or face\nThey even got the numbers are on the bus the global due to corrections I was wrong\nBut that's what you have to ask yourself\nI'm going to remove Joe ... from this equation is very simple if you want Gina Raimondo than both for Gina Raimondo idol I don't want to live in a sanctuary state I don't want all these progressive agenda is you know what land justices weigh

on one hand you want equal treatment and that's what the big thing is we want to be treated as equals and then when the guy treat you as an equal\nI mean I'm sure this man's a hot tempered human being I get the impression\nI'm not saying he's right the yelling but why does it what does it have to do with how about you just keep it to the fact that he's yelling at people and it has nothing to do

some of the conversation this morning regarding um the mayor calling up and was put a lot on the air and now they have to offer angle that that's the law suits and uh\nOur brand had the other hand they can get equal time which was taken by the way he can take an anywhere if he wants doesn't have to be the same slot\nWhere you can do it any way he wants to see what was it the number of minutes

out which would be done by public safety director of public works director or the verdict put W and Ryan and opposition um his unfortunate you know but uh\nShe was on the air it happened once in

trying to get the link on one\nOn the link on one stock of being on the top twenty eight\nOh you've got to have more than I Am absolutely yeah I'm I'm Still I'm looking I printed just a page I mean I printed the major when soccer but somebody wants to hold on a porn so when I go on to bring up in the whole thing\nUp or what does that jumps out because when I was watching the news this morning the headlines were once I get is cracking down on out of state registration down the road at night uh that's accurate right\nThe rest of your local officials but campaigning to try and get\nSocket straightened out and they were looking and giving serious consideration to the bankruptcy everybody says oh it leaves a black Macron you've racket and it looks bad quite honestly as somebody who\nWorks in the credit issuing area to go through bankruptcy and more often than not caught issue is going to say oh there's somebody with a clean slate let's sell them I caught\nBecause they don't have any other stand to get so long as I get income the other thing is is the city itself would have been far better off because they were negotiating given heck cuts to all the\nPublic sector unions just like they did in Central Falls the odd thing was just as they were bearing down and coming close to success for that I can remember the day they will\nThey were bearing down and coming close to success for that I can remember the day they were going to do the vote and Lisa ball deli hide did a very hairy sorry I Can't ... you know and she voted against it\nOut of the blue suddenly against it and I really call the next morning and I said to the radio station you've got somebody who's about to run for mayor\nAnd sure enough she did and when she got into office she's run that place just like the speaker of the house runs for general assembly\nIt's my way or it's favoritism it's things this way in that way but that's as a total aside it I think you got what I thought was coming\nOr in areas may years later and taking losses on real estate if padded with employees yeah the issue with the kids and his friends said oh gee I didn't notice the difference but she came with the state house mentality and that's what she got for a local government back to the gentleman who is concerned about the other state plates\nYes [noise] I Love the issue at first of all I I feel sorry for him I feel sorry for any landlord it's a terrible terrible business because the deal is deck is stacked against him\nIf you're a tenant or courts housing caught and everybody else you got to go out of their way to cut in your favor and an ... thought he could make some do rent a flat in his house or something else takes it on the chat\nAbout one of the so to say gee these people came here for low cost of living\nAnd you say is I understand it G and they came here and they want to keep the mass plates because it's a lower cost of all the socket say gee I can understand that they say\nThere's a certain amount of time in which you get to switch your registration and you do have to change your life since but what happens you say well wait a minute you've just told me that the poor people or will socket\nHave low income and yet you want somebody coming from Massachusetts to get in on the cheap East that they can get in one socket and not shoulder their load so they can keep that Massachusetts plates and you're telling me the rest of the socket A's\nShould pick up the slack so I have no sympathy for them but I got to tell you the third reason why people don't change the registration 'cause yours truly has a car here in the state that has sold it isn't even subject to the property tax\nIt's because to go in and get my licence if registration changed over would be such a pain in the ass pardon the expression\nSo if it was for the bureaucratic nightmare that Rhode Island is I think you'd find lots of people making the changes ... oh my God I got to go to the department of motor vehicles you're kidding me\nAnd so it's that headache that it's biased a number of people say I'm just going to leave it the way it is no I'm not looking to duck taxes I'm not looking to duck anything I just don't want to have to go to the DMV\nSo with that I'll leave you be uh but I just wanted to all of it and I I can understand feeling sympathy for the people at the mass plates\nBut if you're coming into a town with people I trust and you're coming in and taking the advantages from your own home is dead and not doing your share\nA I don't think much my town I think

tell you\nPeople get off some people get bent out of shape over the whole thing\nThinking that um\nWe weren't going to um a lot of give our marine equal time which I mean when you think of it you know my goodness\n\nThis good old mad or at least I can read this email sometimes I don't want to ... his emails [noise]\nUm on Tuesday a caller called Larry a racist although she was not a perfect color she was telling the truth whenever there's a racial issue on his show whether it's Al Sharpton Colin Kaepernick Larry never never takes the side of the African Americans\nLarry always sides with the white guy every single time\nWell Matt your full of ... yes because if you were listening carefully yes that if you got the carrots Saddam ... years\nUm [noise] basically just to review what I said yesterday I was talking about this group called the black lives matter Larry things everybody's life matters black white pink\nMale female\nWhatever all lives matter in just to repeat what I said yesterday 'cause I feel strongly about this I Will repeat it\nUm basically what they did is they went to the uh to you are right where the governor is a debate was taking place I Believe in a ... there was a group they're small group of black lives matter people\nWho were upset with um the\nCandidate for governor and that's Mr ... who I don't know thirty thirty five years ago whatever it was a used the N. word supposedly although he denies it\nAnd I and as I said last night there is no excuse for any one use\nAnd as I said last night there is no excuse for anyone using the N. word whether you're black pink blue or green or whatever you color happens to be and I said\nThey should go after these entertainers these so called singers these rap people\nUh who use that word on a regular basis why aren't they complaining about that and again whether the rappers be black and I believe most of them are and there are white ones in pink ones in blue ones in green ones\nAll rappers who use the N word\nShould be um you know ... something should be done some attention should be brought to them that what they're doing is inappropriate but for some reason this group black lives matters doesn't care about that that's\nWhat I said yesterday yes yes yes yes yes\nI'm mad also says that Elizabeth Warren took a DNA test and she has one thirty second Indian all I Know is that uh\nThe Cherokee Nation said ah [laughter] I guess they're not happy with Senator Warren they said that her DNA test is useless\nTo determine tribes citizenship I don't know what I originally I thought it was one thirty second but maybe it's one in a million I I don't know any way you might have some comments as far as that's concerned\nAfternoon Iran W when I\nGot some bad so yeah what\nCould possibly be\nChosen for those says it will be freeze warning tonight\nSo yeah I did hear that yes you are I think that might affect the even the northern part of the state the northwest corner you know up in foster Gloucester or whatever we're in the ... or the ... the same place to get all the snow so yeah there is a possible a possibility of a frost\nTonight yeah hold on your sweater ... it was cold this morning all done you know\nAll the way I was in Providence right just getting on a bus yeah still provides it came over to the bus in total to try to put some old lady on the bus right without a bus pass or anything yeah I'm to find out\nWell she was in a downtown of us palace right ...\nYou know she took some stuff out of pockets put it next to her for a little bit and when she looked again in cell phone was missing\nNo kidding oh jeez\nAre just like New York city\nWell I'll tell you you got to be very careful with your possessions I don't care where you go I don't care what city where you're at you got to keep your eyes on your stuff all the time because then there always seems to be people around who want to take something that does not belong to them\nLike ... um she you know everything in the ... is out of luck on that some guy on the bus given twenty bucks to get a new bus pass anyway well that was nice that\nWas ... and like I'm saying oh near as I can tell she must have told the cops I guess ... at a lot of them to look in the film inside the building to see who it was who pose a fast one on\nIt and he wants one good thing there are security cameras just about everywhere these days and oftentimes they can at least get a nice picture of these creeps and often times or people make a connection they say hey I Know that guy what happened after that only who knows you know\nA moving right along as far as the election goes well you know that was on getting addicted mhm\nThink after it gets finally gets out of jail he could run for mayor of Providence what do you think [laughter] funny CNC would be\nProud of him talking weight of Tammany Hall\nHuh but you know in all fairness though we'll just have to give mayor career or some time to see a you know a accusations have been made but we we need to remind ourselves that you're innocent until proven guilty in this country we tend to forget that these days you know\nThey problem probably um I I don't is there a veteran in your family are you getting a veterans discount of ... okay 'cause so am I and a cat one today I did I did get that letter today as well and it was addressed to me\nSo I guess that's how they put that list together must be everybody who's you know some sort of how they found\nWas completely set for nothing because I'm an outbreak and fat and uh I uh I I hoping that to that place it doesn't make it and that ... is is the most respectful and is a gentleman according to what we have a dictator\n... I guess you're not a big fan of the mayor I Am not I am not not just one other point you made mentioned about your taxes I guess did not go why\nIs that your way he went up ... three thousand five hundred dollars but that's I don't think that's anything to really worry\nThousand five hundred dollars\nBut that's I don't think that's anything to really worry about because most of our values went up and my property went up considerably as well\nGo up as high as is um I I have a little ranch yeah and I haven't broken the back of my house that\nSpain deteriorated by whatever the gun at some point when so when I was I think they connected they that the transfer mended road and I have water cutting off and all that was made like my husband is the old man\nI have the trains going out in my yard that fell from from the land and it's it's a mess\nBut but here's the question you have to ask yourself when it comes to property values\nYou would hope that you could get that amount or maybe more if you were to sell I mean that's the way I look at it it it's good to see our property values the going up rather than going down because of the day may come when we want to sell our property and we probably won't get as much as we can for it\nYou know yeah so I had to vent well I'm Glad you did that's why that's why we're here okay All right thank you Bye bye maybe you have a\nComment seven six six Thirteen eighty that's our number I'm a male comes in and says Larry I Do not believe you are racist you are always very nice of course I Am and if you were racist your friend surely would certainly upset you straight yes she would have [laughter] for sure\nAll right but it's not the first time ah there was a kid\nI always forget her name I don't even know where she is anymore uh she was a member of the city council I think um we had a a shooter an African American lady and something was set on my show\nAnd I didn't you know the caller\nUm some she didn't like and because I didn't jump on top of the guy and try to you know clarify something that she put me in that\nRacist category and that goes back many many many years that's before I mean today you hear this word being thrown around like a bubble gum you know uh and uh\nBut back then a ... boy I'll tell you I Can't remember who she was anyway\nSeven six six Thirteen eighty is our number as we talk with you love to

sound like your mind is made up I think you know\nSeven six six Thirteen eighty that's our number as we talk with you I'll get that line [noise] good afternoon Iran WN alright are wary if this is Larry I'm answering my own phone just for a minute\nAnd what can I Do for you\nKnow World War [noise] I I don't think I don't like they're very loud or am I on the air\nOh you are on the air yes can you hear\nVery far better okay\nA favor for this war on first first yes it's it's ... percent\nNow exactly what is that I was at one thirty second or\nA report on there certainly are sort of a seven percent\nA vote but certainly as sort of a seven percent yeah yes yeah and it's very very minor yes and I think almost anybody any\nBetter and what ... French Canadian that's\nWhat I've been told because French Canadians were known to uh have a ... ... ... exactly so I I guess maybe I have as much Indian blood in me as a uh she does so\nOur our our driveway are craving right there and check I could probably have blocked black or an arrow and they're ... or you know I could you could apply for her\n[laughter] I Know that um I I I Know a few people who have had this um past taken the DNA tested you see it advertised all the time what does it ancestry dot com or whatever\nAnd I know I was talking to my cousin and she had done and she was amazed you know the breakdown and talking to someone else as well like you said it seems like uh you you you'll find out that the all sorts of surprises [laughter] you know\nWe always start with Russia Scott ... for the actors scotch Irish ... [laughter] they're ... well that came out with our Scott run from\nDuring the budget commission that wasn't up was a forty three percent shower refined behind the eight ball is fast tax reduction in my ...\nWell I think the bottom line is what we pay in taxes in if we can hold the line on what we pay for tax isn't if it goes down a little bit or goes up a little bit I think I I Believe we can consider ourselves fairly lucky\nYou know what I'm saying is layered we've got a little bit less stress you out a lot a little bit ...\nBlood on the tax commission was half your one on forty forty three percent a thirty five percent I don't remember exactly what it was that was a big monstrous and crash yeah I don't remember I granted a reduction deer getting now yeah yeah yeah so I don't think that's a total world when profits and my and my my opinion\nDo you remember what your taxes were up for the past several years I mean yes I don't care how much did they go up when we were in difficult times\nAt all and I think it was two or three hundred dollars okay and they're probably going down maybe a hundred in the last three that's\nAll right well you know he's Iran\nDoesn't offset what we ... we lost our ... from yeah far from where yeah yeah I'm from a non balance out nowhere near ...\n... I remember when I was ... and I bought a house for the house and two guys and I'm paying more for the I'm paying like seven hundred dollars more for the house and without the joke outs yeah\nWell again how long ago was that to you know Nineteen eighty six yeah I mean back back I mean you know that's a long time ago when you hear all the internal\nBut I end up the house as an increase in value that much since ... is a hundred thousand dollar house in today it's worth one Seventy six so I meant on now with this new evaluation mine drew ... ...\nNow would you be happy to get one Seventy six or ... you know would you be\n... more and more because if I go somewhere else to buy the same out somewhere else I'd have to pay three faster\nAnd you see that's what we need to keep in mind too you know that if we were to take our house and move it over to another neighboring community the values would go up considerably and I would assume a\nNeighboring communities Larry direct to shape\nWell in some cases in ... well I Would say in most cases yes the ...\nTo value is higher ...\nYeah there probably is ...\nYeah yeah I'm not going to sell my house at my age and start over again not going to happen that makes two of us [laughter]\nI was younger and you know like when we fought the coal burning plant my wife on the cell and move after rebate I'm ... I should have listened to all ... in my opinion actually got on when talking totally\nWhy didn't I didn't listen to on line jak continuous controversy ... Center for all this that that the other thinking continuous never asked\nWhether it's because you listen to the talk shows to ma and listen to the talk shows you wouldn't have any idea what was going on in\nMy nose tells me at stake [laughter] well I Can't I oils tells me that uh yeah I'm not I can't argue with you on that one I'll tell you [laughter]\nKnow I mean you know that that will ever go away my opinion that will never go away [noise]\nWell I could if we'd be willing to uh have you spend a lot of money or just\nYou know they should put that trope on dish or ... what the taxpayers decided to want to get rid of all if they want to keep\nSee when you think of it there isn't a bond issue people don't like so\nNo but I mean you know it should be left up to the taxpayers get get rid of it and it was going to cost you X amount of dollars or your gate but yeah and put up with the smell yeah\nWell maybe ... maybe some day that's the way it will be presented them going what are the ... the\nAnd that's the way it will be presented them going what are the voters the\nThreat of committing suicide you'll never get reelected yeah at least she'll do something good for us [laughter] ever good they are at you take yeah you\nGet rid of sin a girl and then the uh taxes go up that's the problem um\n\nMy friend at the green hand reminds me thank you yes memory is definitely better than mine that the council person I was looking for reaching out for the name I forgot knife we continuously forget it because\nThis person made such a great impact on the community or as an elected official was Gwendolyn Chapman\nThat's who it was yes thank you thank you very much for that information yes\nSeven six six they're teenagers is our number\nI'm\nA our friend Roger sent us an email and he says Larry I got that letter to from Richard fads you know there's no way that Mr ... Ninety three years old composed that letter\nWas put together by city employees was done on city time was it done with city funds I Wonder I Wonder\n[noise] oh okay well I Would have to say it was you know came from somebody's political war chest that that would be my take on that that would be my take on that is what else we see here I'm\nLarry they were a few marriages between French Canadians and Indians and early Canada I'm sure if you ask your friend\nButch\nHe will concur with the subject just you are correct he will\nOr he is a longtime member of the American French gene Neal logical society here and when socket and I'm sure he is quite versed on this subject matter of fact I worked with him today at the Historical Society we we work together every single Wednesday\nSo uh we've had this kind of this discussion before because he's done a lot of research on his family tree and I know he's got some Indian blood in him I don't know what tribe it is a I don't I'm not sure if he knows what tribe fittest but [laughter] as you said just about all French Canadians have\nA little bit of Indian or is it we can't call them Indians anymore though I think they want to be called in ... Americans get very complicated you know you're going to be politically correct all the time going to be so dumb capital what you say how you say\nI was talking to someone today we thought that the word negro was a bad word you weren't supposed to use that says no there's nothing wrong with that\nWhat the word negro I mean you'll find it in the dictionary and means of black person a person you know a\nAfrican American or whatever but today than they were the proper term that seems to be the most accepted term is African American it gets very confusing very very confusing but there's one word that we cannot use and it's the N. word\nYes that word that's the word that irritates me to no end\nI Want some group to lead a crusade to rid us of that fill the N. word that is used by so many rap stars yes the penguins the green ones the brown wins the black ones the white ones all of them\nNone of them should be using that n word that's a word I I don't think I've ever said that when I never heard that word around the house never\nAnd I never remember using it\n\nThen again my memory is not what it used to be but I don't ever remember using that were\nEver yeah\nJust like Joe ...
