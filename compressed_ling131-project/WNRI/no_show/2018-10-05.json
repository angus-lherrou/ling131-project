I'm always making allegations against Bill Clinton so them onto the bus and completely assassinating their character\nNot only that they they are inventing\nAlmost a a new form of justice in the country which is\nWhen anyone makes an accusation that he should automatically be believed and that's not the way our system is set up I mean the way our system is set up regardless of the allegation of the crime but as you know it is a a you know it's it's innocent until proven guilty\nSo if I you know and this is a good example this made on meet the press it by say the new stole my car that that doesn't mean that I go to the police and they automatically ... I I have to\nShow some kind of evidence of the police investigate to find out whether or not in fact you sold my car no one's automatically believe like that this business of you know ... I Believe women I Believe survivors whoever comes forward with an accusation should be believed\nThat that is absolutely insanity ... there's no dynamic like that they they are literally making this up as they go along\nWith other thing I noticed too in her testimony is this is what they say you know what do you remember most okay she remembers the stairway she remembers the layout of the room she remembers\nDon't laughing but she never said she remembers being judged cabinet to do this only when she was asked if it was any uncertainty\nAbout who did it say it was Brett Kavanaugh and try and you were saying all the things that she did she never said that he was the one that absolutely\nYes that is exactly right and you know there's also the human dynamic that sometimes people either exaggerate ally and then they're put into a box and they feel they have to continue\nWith the lie and then they just cemented into they put themselves into that and a lot of people may not be familiar with it but it was the case to put Al Sharpton on the map and it was from the eighties and it was the ... case\nWhere these allegations are so hideous initial story was that this young girl a was missing for the weekend and that these white cops are kidnapped her took her upstate and that they raped her and basically held her kidnapped it was a huge story in New York cause protest and everything else\nWell when the real story came out it turned out that trauma Brawley who is this girl she had a boyfriend and she took off from them for the weekend and she didn't want to get in trouble\nSo she told her mother that's what happened and then people like Al Sharpton got involved and then even when the whole story was proven to be false\nPeople like Al Sharpton another they they just continued this drumbeat that that was actually what happened when it didn't happen and so something to pay attention with this whole Dr Ford store and some of these other stories Dr Ford to me was set up because she was promised initially\nBy Dianne Feinstein and others don't worry we're going to keep you would not miss you'll never\nHave to come forward and testimony that is the track they set them now\nOnce they get them in it's kind of a thing of like in for a penny for penny earned per pound now Dr Ford has to continue this charade of saying that all of this stuff happened otherwise she's she's a liar so unfortunately\nUnless something changes to her grave\nShe'll continue to insist that that this story happened but this you know this happens with police\nAll the time where people they steal from work right this back to work and they pretend and they come up with a story that someone came in and robbed them and the police are going on it\nAnd their boxed in and then finally sometimes after a while when they finally break them they say are and I made it up I made it up and sometimes you may notice in the news how sometimes there's like a runaway bride you know the day before the wedding the woman disappears and then she says oh I was kidnapped\nAnd data and then it turned out that she didn't want to get married\nShe panicked and and you know the whole story falls apart and she wasn't kidnapped and she wasn't held she just didn't know what to do she got an itself in a situation that she felt boxing on the story so to\nMake on the small cage you I just recently a Cessna one eighty and I almost blew my one\nChild the lowly oh my God you know out about ... green sometimes some of these flights like they obtain beer like those they called the puddle jumpers\nHoly moly that's where they take your weight and there was only like eight people in the plane it's unbelievably loud now if you can fly on that\nYou do not have a fear of flying that's right [laughter] so but what I Believe now is the kind of character because I Do believe they told her all along don't worry you're never gonna have to\nYou know you're always going to remain anonymous but them where they tricked her is Dianne Feinstein and probably Senator Sheldon Whitehouse they leak turn named to the Washington Post\nSo now she's stuck\nNow she's in California now they start making up things she's afraid to fly or she needs more time all these delay tactics\nThan they got her you know I I Believe this woman never did want to come forward but that is the low level gutter politics that Dianne Feinstein and Sheldon Whitehouse play\nWhich is that you know and this is the last thing that people need them said they don't care about her they don't care about Brett have day that ... in their mind they're sick demented evil mind it has all collateral damage they do not\nScheuer inland lead us to find the means\nJustify the means ... percent noticed Dr poured that woman Rachel Mitchell who is a question or you know she ended up being actually excellent because when she asked her about have you have any knowledge about a polygraph and in and then you know have you ever given tips on this so people are wondering where is this going\nAnd you know have you ever given tips on this so people wondering where is this going well she and her pocket has a sworn statement from the ex boyfriend saying that he witnessed her getting tips to a friend of hers how to beat a polygraph test so she's asking her questions that she knew the answers to\nIt that's a good lawyers the cutest never ask questions I don't I don't know the answer\nTo do and Ford took the bait so she took the bell absolutely not no I don't know anything about a polygraph in that Rachel, Rachel sitting there

... radio program called the authors hour which is broadcast every Tuesday at nine o'clock\nThere will be different authors every day you're rotating I'm at the autumn best to uh\nAnd didn't let me know what should I Do the motives Eighteen hundred dollars short of police action deserve more junk Lou way to deal with this legally\nI don't know what kind of gentle way there is basically if you're trying to collect this money from your brother you need to tell him he needs to reimburse it set up a timeframe\nPorter written agreement together as to how it's going to pay it back that's going to be the gentlest way but there needs to be a confrontation if the hasn't already been one hopefully not without fists flying [noise] ah but you could reach an agreement with him as to how this amount it's gonna be repaid\nIf you can't reach an agreement with him you have two different options to go you could try to sue him similarly\nEighteen hundred dollars you would be able to sue him and the small claims court thing that he was gone did with funds that didn't belong to him and you need them reimbursed either your realty company or your house to you or wherever it gets divided up and you could explain\nThat to a judge a small claims court is just like what you see on judge Judy no real rules of evidence apply basically you tell your story he tells his story you get a judgment\nJudgment doesn't mean you're either going to collect that say that all the time it's a lovely piece of paper you can hang on your wall but it's not a cost you money to pursue him to collect\nThis is a process after you get a judgment to enforce it you may never collect and you may end up spending three or four hundred dollars to get to the point where you've never collect 'em and and I know that's frustrating for people but that's the way the system works\nThe most effective way and I know it's distasteful to send him they required certified letter saying he stole money\nIf he doesn't reimburse you you're going to go to the police department and then give them a timeframe seven days ten days whatever it might be fourteen\nIf he doesn't reimburse you for that forgery then you go to the police department of father criminal complaint because the positive side as they'll get also get a court order for what they call restitution of the funds that he wrongfully took and the thing is they have the power to\nTake 'em in arrest him if he fails to comply with the orders regarding restitution that simply really doesn't happen on the civil side 'til you expended a lot of money on your way down the road and collection process and even then it gets picked up once and\nThat's really yet it doesn't really got picked up again whereas with the police they have the ability to force a a criminal sentence on him is he doesn't make up the restitution and spend some time in the FBI\nAll right thank you less to questions or email questions I don't know where they came from but it's not relevant to socio can I keep making payments from my mom's bank called\nOn her car loan after she has passed I have my mother's will\nBut I Am not the executive job does that make sense to you\nDoes um if you have moms will and you're not the executor but I'm presuming your name is on that bank account is your name is on that bank account and it's on your with the bank account\nWith mom and the word or is between [noise] I suppose under banking law you could continue to write checks on that account and you could continue to make bombs car payment [noise]\nHowever that just because you have access to the money on their banking law doesn't mean it's your money to spend on their probate law [noise] I understand that your mother has a car loan and that Carlo needs to be paid but it makes it kind of turns on\nAs a car loan and that Carlo needs to be paid but it makes it kinda turns on what the intent is with regard to the car and we need to look to the well if they will provides where the car goes then the car goes to that person subject\nTo the car loan and they have to make arrangements or refinancing and pay the car loan to the ... car loan company or bank to keep the car if they fail to do so they surrender the car um the car will get repossessed sold and if there's a shortfall they'll pursue that against moms estate\nWhatever money is left in her bank account even the bank account with your name on it because creditors come ahead of anybody who's entitled to take anything from an estate as a beneficiary\n[noise] so it it's a there's a lot of layers to this question but when you need to remember is even if you have access to the account that's just banking law it doesn't mean that you have a right to the money that's in it that's determined by probate law if the intent is\nAnd I suspect what's going on here is it your the person driving the car\nAnd you don't want this car to get repossessed for non payment because you're the person driving and you just want to keep paying alone like mom was doing to keep you in your car it doesn't work that way on my mom's will says that that upon my death\nUse the money in this account to pay off the car and then give the Carter little Johnny if it doesn't say that\nEverybody else all the other children anybody else's uh beneficiary under that will is entitled to their share of that money in that account it doesn't all belong to you a little Johnny just 'cause you're driving a car because I suspect that's really what this question is about\nSo unless everybody else agrees that you can use that money to pay off the car then no you got to get in touch with the car company and even\nEven if they say it's okay you somebody or pay off the car the car has to be title for mom's name to yours\n'cause you have to get it ensures you can't leave it and mom's name and keep driving the car without notifying the insurance company 'cause you get in an accident they going to say you lied about who the owner of the vehicle is because the owner on the policy is dead and they cannot be an operator\nAnd that increases the arrest when the state is an opera is the owner and you are the operator that increase the insurance ... insurance companies risk and they could deny claim if you get an accident\nBecause it's a material misrepresentation as to who's owns and operates that vehicle so there's a lot of layers to this onions um but if you want to talk to me more and give me more details of exactly what's going on feel free to give me a call the office seven six nine four one to zero but there was a lot more things and play than what you're thinking about\nYou know uh when I send you the questions I share this email someone else for editing purposes and 'cause I misspell something or\nSouthern contacts persona was reading the said this is so easy you don't have to\nNobody nobody has to ask a lawyer this it's automatic she gets house but\nI'm of the opinion we got an email on this\nBut a lot of people if they think that they work more on a project or something like that they're entitled to Ninety percent in somebody's entitled to ten percent so here's the question is my wife entitled to half of my business I Am the sole owner of a franchise and currently going through a divorce\nMy wife wants half the business even though she's never been in the store ... ... it can't be that she's entitled to have\nAgain a little bit outside my field but I'll take a stab at it uh yeah I can see that she's entitled to half and that questions or some percentage\nAnd that question is going to turn on\nThe level of her contribution and the contribution doesn't just mean she's in their washing the dishes serving the customers stocking the shelves ringing up sales whatever the type of\nBusiness might be that's not necessarily the kind of contribution we're looking for if your money goes into a joint account including the money from this franchise it ever proceeds you take and she has access to that joined account and that money is being spent for household belongings as well as\nAssets or or supplies for the business she has made a contribution to that business editors arguably mock a marital property if it's a marital property in Rhode Island or in Massachusetts it's subject\nTo what we call equitable division equitable division starts at a fifty fifty split\nIt could be adjusted based on each party's\nRepresentations and testimony in evidence as to the nature of their contribution and it could be as Mr Bush art indicated as comments the percentage is higher than hers\nBut it doesn't necessarily mean that her percentages aerial zero and quite frankly a business owned as a sole proprietor by one spouse in which there is no contribution\nAt all from the other spouse are rare I guarantee you you're not thinking of the ways that she's contributed\nTo this business but her divorce lawyer is certainly thinking about the ways she has contributed to this business and it will argued arguably be marital property so be prepared to compromise\nIs if I Need legal assistance or can I call on you for some\nI Would hope you think to calling us again our office is located in North

Sean and Lars L. or that's caused quite a stir we also have game on\nWe call ... months ago we talk to you about a with brand and McGahn with Tom Karen and everybody else the ... that's been on the show Yankees Red Sox here we go again\nI'm really excited so all this stuff is on the table\nWe also have the Celtics we have major news with the Celtics Kyrie Irving with a confession yesterday\nAt a I guess I don't know what that was a ... practice a season ticket practice we got that to look into and oh yeah by the way Josh garden for all my friends out there that might be listening that were ripping me on Josh go out and saying that he was a lost cause and and all of that we'll see\nWe'll see after two weeks I think it's leaning more towards me being right let's get to the phone lines and then we'll have to get to a a few of our sponsors before we get to a gas printed the gifts so we're moving along this morning on the joke show on a friday it is October ... can you believe that\nAlready October fest taught him fest weekend heroin socket we know about that let's get to the phone lines\nOn the joke show the morning you're on a show\nOne Joe how are you this morning and I'm doing great great Joe uh when I talked about how important is to baseball yes we have and I was I Would like to compare that to for for ... and I would say that the most important thing is you're secondary\n[noise] okay uh I'll let you elaborate on that take I'm not saying I disagree but I'll let you make your point\nThe point is\nIf you give up twenty eight point four points to menial teams are just like in the ... in your scores thirty eight points for just gave up all points scored\n[noise] okay I was a secondary is so so important\nI agree and I will complement you on that with just adding last night a guy named Adrian clay born showed up for the patriots I don't know if he got confused or they're not the directions to the games the first couple of weeks but this was a big free agent signing that they made\nIn the offseason guy coming from Atlanta that had a had six acts and one game against hours he had nine for the season last year they were hoping you could get out of the quarterback he showed up last night you also had a little pressure\nFrom a couple of other guys which also helps exactly what you're talking about because we the strength of our team is probably the secondary if you look at\nThe uh the safety is on this team you saw Patrick Chung make a huge play last night again he was out with a concussion a couple of weeks ago that he suffered that really hurt us not having him also\nDevon ... played very well last night I thought and drawing harm and is a great safety as well we don't have Malcolm Butler anymore as you know from listening to me I've made it clear how I I Love Malcolm Butler when he was here but we do have Stefan Gilmore\nIn that second corner a you seem you know a couple of guys make names for themselves and make plays with Aaron Rowe being out Devon ... brother Jason has showed well in in spots last night\nYou've got um Jones you've got Jaycee Jackson you've got a couple of guys that are or have played some snaps that have made you know or maybe a case in of course ... Gilmore is shut down on the other side\nAnd your safety is are there\nThe other concern with this team was the line backers Dante high tower if he was too slow he doesn't look like himself he look better last night I and you know losing a Bentley\nFor um you know till we twelve and I are I thought that was going to hurt them ... played well last night on the whole\nI think the ... defense played better last night you look at the points they gave up to a beat up quotes team you're not so happy with a twenty four three lead that that game was that close but it is a short weak and um the patriots is still finding their rhythm we know that it's the age old\nThey it's a it's an extension of the pre season for ballot checking in September and into October they're still figuring things out last night was the first time that Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski and Brady I've been on the same field since November of two thousand Seventeen\nAnd you forget that and you just you just forget how good they can be when they're all out there clicking and they're healthy but you know I I didn't want to take the cold for granted last night\nBut at no point even when I was getting interesting was I concerns I just felt that they can score at will now if that healthy with with Edelman drunk and as I was saying white\nThey're bringing this kid garden along are you seeing the development of Pattison indoor set within the sense Chris Hogan was was it was around a little bit last night\nFor getting to your point yeah I I mean you look at the games they got beaten and your flash memory is is all these passes for all these touchdowns against them with Jacksonville and with Detroit\nAnd I would say to you that the secondary or you know didn't have the best day those days but this team needs to have a pass rush\nAnd that's what they were lacking in the super bowl as well against Philadelphia they didn't get any pressure\nOn Nick falls in that game and I think you could say that the same thing happen pretty much against Jacksonville and also against Detroit against Matt staff it and bleed bought all this year\nIf you look at the games on a whole the games that they've won and played well and they've gotten pressure on the quarterback\nJoe ... a little bit on the red Sox yes ah who's the study but today\nChris Sale and it's an interesting discussion\nI was thinking I was going down the yellow brick road to the wizard of Oz in my mind the other day thinking about a whole different scenario\nWhere you are pitched David your pitch David Price game one and my my okay well this is my thing David Price I've been to a couple of games I've been fortunate enough to see him pitch in person against the Yankees since he got here and obviously being from here\nI I saw him in Boston I saw ... way he has let me repeat that he has pitched well against the Yankees in Boston\nOkay he has not against them in New York now I Know him going in game two means he'll still be pitching in Boston\nIn them in New York now I Know him going in game two means he'll still be pitching in Boston however\nIf you picture mean game on any wins any play any pitches well I think that takes pressure off of Chris Sale tomorrow\nAnd I also think that if it goes five games you have price back here on home turf that was my one take on that my other side of that take is if Chris Sale comes out\nAnd everyone's worth the has come true any from one eighty nine miles an hour and he doesn't have that that devastating fast ball and that breaking fighter that no one can hit and he gets knocked around and they and this goes to a ... game early in the game and they use these guys that they don't have a lot of trust and\nUm they use them up both you know physically using them so that they can't be as effective the next game and they get you know they don't get the votes than we ended up getting beat decisively now you're going into the game too\nWith a beat up bullpen with your confidence shaken and now you've got David Price who everybody and their brother it wants to jump on and get against this guy in New England and wants to hate this guy some for good reason he's brought some of it on himself some not\nA now you're putting your putting him really with his back against the wall for game to a lot of pressure will beyond him if that happens\nTo my line of this is my two cents worth twice the first game a second game is up\nIn a year but the third game and lead off a lot of hail okay\nAnd the fourth game Rodriguez pictures tremendous in front of those New York\nHas pitch tremendous at Yankee Stadium yeah tremendous\nYup I write save sail for the ... that first winter is going to be very important to say oh he's the man to go\nI I'm also\nYeah also maybe in the in the second game ... maybe you could Troy around ... says those or\nYou want to start Steven Wright and as they go forward in a row okay that'll\nThat'll stifle I'm a little bit if there's not ... working\nWell I'd there's no doubt in my mind that\nAt some point we're probably going to see a Steven Wright\nI think they're probably thinking about using him to eat one of those innings I was talking about I don't know if you want them in as the bridge to to ... in the eighth inning but I think you might see him earlier than that I'm looking now my friend at the a playoff rosters um than it being announced\nAlex corps or\nAs a we have the uh Yankees Ross then that's come out an hour ago they set their division roster we're going to go all over all of this\nBecause Chris Sale was acquired the way he was in was was sent was meant to be the eighth on this team despite them already have in price and Cy Young award winning ... cello\nI mean Rick uh Chris Sale is going to pitch in one of the first two games I like your line of thinking though it's out on the box I gotta tell ya I give you credit and Chris Sale has been good at at Yankee Stadium where price has and so I see where you're thinking\nUm I think there's a legitimate case just because of how they both pits in the all star break to say that you go with David Price first ah but you know obviously that's not what they're doing but it's going to be something that we reflect back on you know I was listening to um\nReflections on the um the teams passed that of one on the thirteenth team and the o seven team and the two thousand four team and you know there were moments and all of those series and decisions that were made that affected you know uh the fact that they won so\nOh my goodness you

the men are that does the great job rating in covering sports for the puck at times and when socket call and also African Tom Brady the tough questions or\nMiss the Brandenburg yeah let's get to a good friend no\nMorning you're on the show I'm doing great I got to say I uh I like the question and ah it's great to see you when they are getting a comments from the coach and from the uh the quarterback of the of our team and a a really excited with the results last night and I'm sure you will pleased as well\nBe pleased to meet a shark week job or You're welcome back Julie that all that you don't know whether you're going to get revenge you're still really a scratching the surface of life that you know when it comes to Josh ...\nScored what thirty seven thirty eight always last night I mean that's very impressive and it couldn't even more because you have to say the hard stop the patriots cut off to win but wall they did so with the third quarter but then also they just picked it up again\nYeah with something to see um I don't know that um we could have been this this optimistic about her running game obviously the injuries to Jeremy Hilda departure a release of my ... uh and then from there rex burns had but right now a a one to combine the league I don't know of a better when the James White and Sony Michel\n... one show that can do to different things showing the show is the ground producer and James White has emerged as a true past\nCatching ... out of the backfield fertile break Kevin receptions last night I don't know if you could ever felt that the last fall because the lowest did produce\nSome top yards when he got the chance last year but if they can feed off each other talking about Michele I'm white one can get the yards once you get the receptions ... that's a dynamic want you to punch as you said\nAbsolutely is and and the fact that they do once in awhile run white so you can look at it like they're making themselves one dimensional like the defense would be able to say okay James whites in the game so this obviously is going to be a you know a swing pass or a little screen or something but once in a while they do handed off to him I\nAnd so he has he has the ability to do that and and so many as you said is going to be more of your ah your straight ahead guy but he also can catch a little bit as well as we saw in college in Georgia\nSo they both can they both have their rules to find but they both can do the other thing too if they were asked to so that their versatility\nA and the dynamic or ability both a really show something that gives this team a little different look and then of course the play action that comes out of that\nWhen you've got a guy like Rob Gronkowski the monster in the middle and then add all men who just gets open as you said you didn't know what to expect but right off the first play you could see Tom Brady is constant level with Julian and and just him being out there that opens up\nA core narrow Pattison Chris Hogan and then as you said the Josh Gordon um project as I'll call it I'd I think if we see this thing through till the end of the year I think this could be really something special [noise]\nAnd I say to Joe this this little bitty by cops had a great time like you said you get at all that back ... you get your still watching Josh court the next it also helps out a couple of weeks ago was like you know you have to put on a gold card almost whereas a God\nSon and it looks pretty you know when you talk about or set Patterson has become more involved with the last couple of caged Chris Hogan we can't forget about him right ah it's changed light coming out of the ... there's a lot more options and even a couple of weeks ago when you have that\nYou know a lot of editor pure church Sunday and I go home it's against the lions [noise]\nIt's been um it's been a roller coaster I think we as a long time why you know viewers of this team fans and his team you're covering the team I think we I think we had an edge on some of the other fans to know not to panic quite yet but um it's amazing or the turn around\nI I Can't say that I was a comfortable watching those two games it's Jacksonville in Detroit they looked like a completely different team\nAnd I think a lot of it has to do with a pass Russia's well my first call in the morning before you called us with a gentleman talking about the secondary and I really think the secondary could be the strength of the defense but you really need that past Russian he needs something out of a dream Claiborne which you've got something last night\nAnd I think just as these guys play together in jail will start to see them get more pressure\nOn downside last night as a brown yeah with an injury is that various you'd think I mean originally they announced that us off or they announced\nQuestionable so that's a an obviously isn't a good sign\nLike we said at the top is pretty by Chevy a chance for not only uh for the ... top rate it got even more costs all\nInstilling all these pieces and see how they work but also interests as well you know I'm sure a Patrick ... flowers guys ... cautions a couple of weeks ago you know that they are they get a chance to kind of catch up with a very potent Kansas City cops handcuffs that to start days from\nNow absolutely that Patrick Chung ... a return I his absence from the concussion obviously he's a he's a big part of what they do on defense all you're going to do is\nAsk the coach a ballad jak I think the comments he's made about showing the glowing remarks over the years he's\nTalked about only a few guys as as warmly as he's talked about Patrick Chung so that was really appreciates all the different things that songs able to do just quickly on Malcolm brown I'm just from what I looked out here I guess the fear is was that it could be as bad as an ACL maybe more like a sprained MTO\nA but again that's not confirmed by any sauce just throwing it out there that that could be what the injury was we don't know until later on a so yes Kansas City I'm Patrick ... thought finally met his maker\nOr against Denver or the other night I thought ah\nYou know he was humbled a little bit I thought it at times but then he comes right back with that fourth quarter I and just I don't know if he's even aware he's he's got that thing going right now where he doesn't know how good he is and he doesn't have to because he's come in after sitting out a year and watching under Alex Smith and they're ruining the spread off sense\nWhich caters to his skill set\nFrom college and he looks amazing um it's gonna be interesting to see if he can keep it going against some of the better teams\nOr do you measure one of the teams that they achieve still have Jacksonville when you look at us at old friend Patrick Ramsey has been a sharp you get I think he called the ... on a glorified up [laughter]\nAh so that's going to be a very tough for a year for cats that we've seen firsthand or how tough that jak defenses and how they can kind of like ... almost ... that's a good test for that that you know if you're the patriots are glad that they have to face a physical thing and like ... or ... Fox for oh\nAnd we get the break like you said it couldn't have come out of bed time uh they basically came in they won the first game we had some injuries and obviously they really did miss doing it\nOn the first game we had some injuries and obviously they really did miss Julian Edelman they they lost to a\nTo hungry teams in a row in the in in ... situation Detroit in Jacksonville they come back take care of business against an undefeated Miami team and make them look nothing like an undefeated team and then they come back on the show a week and take care of a cold team that\nHad a lot of purpose coming in Britain and I know it's you know you're no stranger to what happened in the off season with Josh McDaniel\nKind of leaving them at the altar and of course you know over the years the rivalry obviously they said the rivalry was back at it really wasn't not quite yet but um there's been a lot of moments between these two franchises and\nI absolutely and I and you know just listening to end the last two games he seems like he's really excited to be here and you know he understands that he has a great opportunity to do something\nSpecial I had a chance to talk to his high school coach last week for a story that ran last year last Sunday's call ad and we basically said you know if anybody can help turn\nJosh going around and get him on the straight out as five dollar check to operate if you can't work with those guys you know have the all the Superbowl pedigree that they have you know you can't you can't cut it anywhere to fight\nI agree and not play last night it looked kind of like Brady might even under thrown at ... or they go in and had to come back for that ball and\nI'm not going to compare him to Randy but it's been a while since I've seen anyone other than go wrong with two guys near him in the end zone come up with the ball on play like that and it was nice to see\nAnd he also went to him a few other times when you went to him on third down\nAgainst Miami a few times in his first games so I think uh all signs of good I'm actually holding\nA copy of today's call and I'm looking at a your article about high school football in the ... stock October undefeated and looking at this bar the football team which I Know some of the kids that play on the team and science you give us a low down on what's going on in the paper I Know we've got to let you get going so long to let us know what's happening locally\nWell like you mentioned you're looking at the paper right now we're looking at the high school you know I took a little uh\nYou know assessment of where these teams head just to me ... as I wrote the top it's getting late early\n... you'll see as their land and it's just it's amazing how okay with that was September and there's still there's only one month left to go with high school football and shorts or division one division to they're going to do that play off by the time all the all star how crazy\nThat seems quick it certainly does\nIt's a beautiful day it feels like the ... to go on forever you know but there's only a handful of chances for these tapes are really solidify their oil chances and that's why a stock in it you know we have a lot of attention right now for a playoff berth but so one thing I did notice they yeah they didn't want to bring up that article that you should you know Thanksgiving\nThere's a rule in the interest classically that you have to have four days off\nBetween games or to get down to Thanksgiving ... next year as I'm sure a lot of the listeners are aware ... this year so at some teams that are area\nThey play on Wednesday night that they that I before Thanksgiving mhm so say and what happens if you classical bought a Saturday and that you have your Thanksgiving game or you just already mapped out to play on a Wednesday night what happened because if you asked\nThat Sunday Monday Tuesday that's ...\nThat's a problem and isn't it what are you gonna do it I mean\nI'm sure it's a problem it's a you know that's a good power for a you know say if it's like us that's the old the ... which is having a great year to fish or\nYou know they play they they have a Thanksgiving in Central Falls into but they haven't years as well say a couple at the risk well if they play on a Sunday they play on a Thursday I it just is or is this will get like all five right now that's a good question I'm sure we'll get some answers maybe are based on what Iraq Today\nThat's an interesting thing you brought up and I'm sure they'll have to look at it because of a you bring it up into sonic boom and it'll certainly means something so those teams at all you know they shouldn't have to be a they shouldn't have to face that disadvantage in or are not be able to play or I don't know how to what they would ... I think\nI think I think the biggest thing is you shouldn't have to report rearrange your schedule\nYou know the schedules came out months ago right you're right a play on Thanksgiving eighth or you know you don't know if you're going to be playing the ... not a guarantee right by like we said the puck down to the regular season about to go\nYou take stock of the playoff picture you don't want us to also are on the content is are you know the Thanksgiving games are some peace plan on Wednesday night what happens that doesn't meet the criteria having four days off between gifts for Thanksgiving\nYeah it's not going to have to get to the bottom of that and um I think you you probably a\nThen everybody a favor by bringing that up now so they can look at it we always appreciate your time and a great job covering the patriots like I said great questions I don't see any on there and we appreciate your being with us on Fridays and er during the great job you do writing so we'll talk to you soon my friend and I have a great long weekend and uh keep up the good work\nThat you have a great we always\nYou sir I don't use them by now but I bring them together everybody joined us send a does a great job waiting and taken up some of these causes for the local law schools I'm covering the local kids and doing a great job and then he does the national\nWell ...

you can to if you want to call in seven six nine zero six hundred is our number that seven six nine\nZero six hundred and let's get to the phone lines good morning you're on the joke show\nHi Joe how are you today\nMr Wayne how are you my friend\nI'll tell you the Milwaukee Colorado game last night was excellent\nI got to tell you had to be honest I I couldn't give it the Karen proper attention is the first playoff game I ever watched every second of\nWith last night because of the football game and and not work but I've been enjoying every game I Wish the AIDS and in and Yankees would've been a little better but I I kind of expected the outcome that we got\nBut all those games the game one sixty three's the wild hogs it's been great I think if you're a baseball fan so far it's been exciting\nWell I look at it this way baseball is like a no other sport as far as momentum yeah\nIn Milwaukee came out of absolutely nowhere to not the cubs off out of that division and explain why they did it\nIt wasn't because no walking is such a period tape but they've got a three four five you know that's really got some ...\nYeah they do the yellow kid is incredible I really didn't know a lot about him until this year he signed\nThe stats on a Chicago Cubs ... they were tied to the average like one one and a half or runs for\nI saw that and they mentioned that five of the game\nThat's nuts it's nuts I heard that mentioned that during the game and I they said that stat at one point and I remember thinking and they're in the ... how are they in the playoffs but yeah they went for what are they wake up in first place last friday and now they're out a week later ah and you know I don't know if that's baseball for some people were complaining about that when\nI don't know how you feel I don't feel bad for them they lost back to back home games you know they had a chance like you said against Milwaukee and then they come back the following day and lose so\nJon Lester pitched it hot out\nWhy did they take him out did you agree with Matt and then that decision I thought he could have ...\nWeeks I've been disagreeing on that and and now even at six and a half million yeah they make can him and just eat the contract\nI you know some of those decisions how do you and then the other thing I Know this kid that they brought in to run is unbelievable the statistics on him he's got more stolen bases than play to parents is I think you know I'm Talking about how do you let him back twice in extra innings I understand\nYou got to get that tying run I understand and he stole the base he stole second base he ends up scoring but after you tied the game how do you let him come up in hitting I think he's heading over Seventy nine\nAnd a di do or die game you let them back twice in extra innings you don't have anybody else you can ... I mean at that point I didn't agree with that decision by mad and either and I'm again I'm an I'm Jim manager I don't know the cubs Ross the up and down like I should like I Know the red Sox but\nI was amazed you let that guy that not once or twice and he was he said look out both times\nThe same thing happened last night and my friend like we'll start as a Milwaukee at all those great is a Kansas City he did have a ball to one of my grandkids Fenway Park and will never forget it\nGreat you remember those things forever that's for sure\nIt came up to that in a tent and then the two guys are on and he announces says he's got a home run against the pitcher and all the announcers are saying but one fast balls right down the middle to this guy with the game on the line\nAnd I mean every announcer predicted that hit\nSomething when they when they do that and it happens isn't it it's amazing that\nSense just watching on TV this game is over\nDo you feel we would you mentioned momentum and I agree with you wholeheartedly should the red Sox be very worried tonight based on how the Yankees up in the brain yeah\nAnd the fact that you got to say oh that we don't know what we're going to get I don't know if you've heard the whole show and it's kind of an out on the ledge take Wayne but I was crazy saying and I'm not saying they should or shouldn't do this but to me you can make an argument that your stock price tonight and I know they're not doing that\nI Would have started priced than I you know it's an area was the same with the Dodgers they did not go with Kurdish orange game on mhm they went in with their best pitcher\nI just see the other side of it when and I don't know if you heard my whole take out some it up quickly if Chris Sale comes out tonight and is not Chris Sale or struggles or the Yankees beat him up and they grow up early and often now you're into your bullpen\nYou're not gonna come back against the Yankees if you get down big in game one with the bullpen now you're down old one at home they've beaten fail and now you've got price who nobody believes in 'cause he's never want to start in the playoffs that's an awful lot of pressure to me if you thought price tonight\nAnd you get the win that takes even that takes the pressure off you 'cause you're one game one\nAnd now you've got sale tomorrow and they don't know what they're going to get\nFrom Chris Sale and they're back somewhat of a wall just a just a a far out the take when I Know it's not going to happen but uh\nJust a just a a far out the take when I Know it's not going to happen but uh I understand they like Chris ... their race and they've managed him over the last two months so we think and we'll find out tonight but I Can't say I'm a hundred percent I\nLike the Yankees go would happen this game because he's got that critical and uh that that will slow down home runs sluggers on the red Sox you know also looked at the Yankees the other day uh-huh and they honestly looked like in New York Jets\nI I've never seen it tanks so big homerun ball game for murder Israel\nNow they ... between a Aaron Hicks between judge ...\nGets stolen from the ...\nJunior I call him and that's what he reminds you got that kind of stroke if he connects how's that\nGod Knows what this could go I don't know believable\nI was there when he first got moved\nAh I think it was early August the I just got he got moved at the deadline right or shortly before and I remember looking at him thinking the Yankees added this guy and I looked him up because obviously we have the age of smartphones and I looked him up and I saw that the cardinals and move them and I think I thought the exact same thing that day or\nAs as I think he play I don't know if he came in as a pinch hitter or ended up coming into the game I was at and the Yankees against the Yankees and I I remember thinking I Hope you know I Wonder what's going to happen with this guy we're going to see this guy down the road and here we are\nAnd they've got that guy they've got they've got back from the bench you can't not be afraid of that bullpen my goodness with ... third\nBaseman the third baseman this guy was unknown name I Know I mean and and he's got he's got a rookie a rookie recognized for home runs hit Ninety seven roommate he thought they were very dangerous element\nJapanese other guys it's almost not fair that all four of these teams are in the American league and you know I say that when and and watching National League team ended up winning this thing because I've given up north ...\nInches in Milwaukee they're going to have the momentum of every\nTeam that's in the world series right now those two teams alone\nIt's gonna be interesting and playoff baseball\nHas a way of of just sorting things out in a way of knowing and you know it's it's nice that you get a series because you cannot you get time to digest in an approach the next step and see what they're going to do but\nIt's a must see TV I think for everybody that that likes baseball this year because we've got some very intriguing match ups in series and uh some great teams and it's going to be fighting on\nThe line right now with the of God go right on the line for our listening audience all around the world ... my prediction right now for the world series ... is Cleveland Milwaukee\nWe'll give you

no it's for Republican senators Republican congressman\nPeople the fan the chance Republican governors\nI I don't know how to explain is like you know some of these people it's either they have no

I Would argue that almost certain confirmation with just a single vote\nOr from the other political parties just a single votes or I\nMight have heard it doesn't matter he's going to get on you know what's different about this whole thing though that he was mentioning that those other individuals is you didn't have people like Senator Sheldon Whitehouse in Cory Booker in Dianne Feinstein and Chuck Schumer\nAnd uh some of these liberal progressives who just set out a complete smear campaign and decided they were going to have these people come forward and make up things about judge Kavanaugh that's what you didn't have\nRight that's what you didn't have in the past as they're mentioning all of that seven six six Thirteen eighty\nUm let's see Jim says I wasn't moved by the testimony looked like a mental health issue to me doesn't know nothing kept you in a boat yes to confirm the nominee I agree right let's see some thumbs up on Facebook Live or you say vote I Want to vote yes on um\nOn judge Kavanaugh or will Chris swan do you think White House will be disciplined for his part and sending is accused of the press you know Chris I'm Glad you asked that because Bob Flanders centered a judge lenders he is the one that continues to draw attention to it I have no idea why\nUm I think it's one thing at a time right now why the local press is ignoring that story Senator Whitehouse told that man that fabricated the story about judge Kavanaugh from Tibetan he encouraged him and gave him the number reporter to leak it to the press which you're not supposed to do obviously Chris\nAnd now that's a very good question by Chris Moran on Facebook Live and the rest of the media\nContinue to just accept some of the White House says I'm not going to reveal um who the reporter was and and the local media who I'm disappointed and says oh okay and and I'm saying that that said okay he absolutely and I'm Glad judge plane is keeping it alive and and there is a debate\nComing up next Tuesday night they're going to tape it Monday Night it's going to Iran channel twelve on Tuesday night Bob Flanders again Sheldon Whitehouse and I believe that\nHas to come up in the debate heat why did he do that why did you do it in the first place but um\nHow can I wasn't ... with a semblance of decency commonsense comes to the protection of innocence\nI'm good morning Ana Marie good morning\nTo uh all as the crowd is alive on Facebook Live but I think it is great and I do believe as we've had exactly thank you Chris good morning Angela ... so and there's a ton of coal\nAnd and and I ... I I think it's very significant\nThat Bob Flanders who is challenging Senator Sheldon Whitehouse his head based on everything we've learned right now barring anything else coming out he would vote yes to to confirm capital and and I think that should be highlighted more in the press alright seven six six Thirteen eighty so if you want to talk\nAbout the cabinet confirmation if you've also heard the story what you think of Senator Sheldon Whitehouse if you want to talk about the governor's race or that's we're going to be covering we're going to be bringing you\nThe news out of Washington as the program continues first time it's first time caller friday maybe never called in before I Would love to talk to you seven six six Thirteen eighty seven six six Thirteen eighty right here on the John ... show no you can always email me\nJohn at ... at D.

nearly total vehicle here's what I Want you to understand every time you get behind the wheel\nIt obviously doesn't matter to them a big question so ... a senator Collins of Maine she is going to make her me just quickly read this Boston Globe three\nBig questions heading into cabinet was final vote US Senate fifty one forty nine procedural vote to advance the nomination of cabinet comes down to several key questions a trio of senators who make the final call\nSusan Collins could be the most important vote she's going to announce today at three o'clock\nOn friday morning all eyes run for senators Arizona Republican Jeff Flake Maine Republican Susan Collins Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski and West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin\nThree of the four have to vote against Kavanaugh's nomination order to sink it for the procedural vote flake Collins and mentioned voted yes while Murkowski voted no the woman from Alaska I don't know Alaska [laughter]\nIn weight to that vote Murkowski appears and moved from her nose stand telling reporters Kavanaugh was not the right man for the court at this time\nFlake told reporters he will be a yes vote this weekend unless something big change I don't see what that would be well maybe unless people stop him outside an elevator against [noise] flakes over a so now it comes down to ... mansion\nPolitically speaking in may or just really come to Collins and she's giving a speech at three o'clock today\nA colon spokeswoman said friday the ... will vote yes to proceed the main Republican was still undecided on the final vote make no mistake this boat could define a two decade long Senate career for Collins here's the rub\nShe supports abortion rights and while she indicated she believes cabinet would uphold roe versus Wade\nHer main colleague independent Angus King makes a different argument in his no vote she thinks capital would restrict abortion access to other ways from the bench also some viewed Kavanaugh's op ed in the wall street Wall Street journal this morning\nApologizing for his performance as a direct letter to Collins he wrote a letter in the wall Street Journal said listen I'm Sorry I Do have the proper temperament to be a judge or my emotions got the best meal with everything that's been happening with his family\nIf Collins is they yes then mathematically it doesn't matter what mansion does cabinet will be confirmed either way now if Collins is a no\nWe'll mentioned really be willing to be the fiftieth vote\nTo allow cabin or to be on the court in that situation vice president Mike Pence comes in and breaks the tie it's fair to assume mentioned won't announce his vote on Kavanaugh until after Collins makes her move which will be three o'clock today\nRemember mentioned is a Democrat up for re election in less than five weeks\nIn a state that President Trump won by forty percentage points polls show mansion has approximately an eight point lead over his Republican opponent and I'd be willing to do it and be the only Democrat to vote for the nominee\nWhat does that mean for him politically going forward will you have to switch parties\nBut those questions be set aside we wait to see what Collins will do so all eyes are really on New England and as far as Senator Susan Collins she did not like what President Trump\nA President Trump lashes out of protesters have confronted senators over the Supreme Court nominee you know it is outrageous folks what's going on up there President Trump lashed out a route elevator streamers paid professionals only made to look senators

cannot run a country and our justice system the way to\nThis is it I I Can't even though there are commentators out there\nThat they can't even believe that we're even talking like this and I'm In America that into the breakdown of this country\nBreak them in a ... what it showed the frightening thing is the young kids in school that are coming up the lawyers\nMy gosh that there are a bit like a black hole\nWell let me let me give you this fact that came out this morning on the Democrats' side in Congress\nForty\nOf the Democrats running for office for Congress in the house representatives forty of them are confirmed socialist I'm proud of it\nForty\n[laughter] I I just it's a credible I spoke to a friend of ours at one o'clock sat down and I mentioned that told me he said yeah you suggest what some of my step son's one of them\nShe gotta be kidding me he said no so I don't understand that I keep trying to point out to what we saw it on our social lives of great er everybody gets everybody gets to share\nI said oh my God this is a ... you know he's a police officer in the police officer yeah\nWell what what he's saying is that is that I could be sitting home every day watching TV and I'm going to get a part of his salary was going to be divided up into us people can't they can't work and that that do not work\nPutting off but they don't I don't know I don't know where to get the information from but it's it's incredible uh too quick items lots of state of Rhode Island and this is incredible uh a doctor state of Rhode Island\n\nI received a notification for Medicare not to attend that doctor's office not to do what\nTo attend that doctor's office and if I were to ever I had to I used them as particular docked I won't go into\nAnd if I were to ever I had a I used him as a particular doctor I won't go into some of the horrible things he did I'll just leave it at this Medicare said that if I were to ever visit the doctor's office again that they would not pay for anything related to him\nWhat kind of a doctor really\nIs a urologist\nUrologist mhm okay\nAnd some of the things I Can't say on the air 'cause I wouldn't want to be suit but so are the things that I've heard that he's done I Do not understand why the state of Rhode Island has not taken away his license to practice\nWell how'd you been found guilty of those things\nOn Medicare sent me to let him not to deal with them they won't they won't they won't be anything dealing with him as a doctor\nIt'll only be a good it could be a a false billings that could be a lot of things\nI Do it all and it was his office is closed and everybody's going everybody's going Huh Interesting\nWhen I spoke to another doctor and he says well he's still in Rhode Island but he doesn't know how he says there is another doctor telling me they should apologize license but anyway that's one is the second one\nIn Rhode Island yes [noise] excuse me again state of Rhode Island has gone overboard if you go to a doctor and get a prescription for oh\nI'm trying to think of something for say let's say half a dozen or oxycontin or or even if you go to a dentist yeah teeth pulled and they give you a Tylenol three that's a little bit of coding in it or anything like that\nThe doctor is now obligated by the state of Rhode Island with a witness standing to give you a prescription for knock on\nSome\nOf the stuff that through your for an overdose yep well\nWhether five pills or five hundred thousand that while I Can't give you a ... ...\nI Know my doctors um no my doctor said don't give anything like that anymore or they'll give you all other things to cut the pain but not not ...\nYeah that's what I'm saying that they but anybody that gives you like I used to go with that just they pull teeth they give you a Tylenol three to four or five fills out even if they give you the one that they give you also a prescription for a knock on\nWhich which means the cost of medical goes up again absolutely\n[laughter] in a company that makes that is lobbying for the law I guess of course [laughter] absolutely\nI'll just relating information I mean this is just ... just a couple of things but I don't have time I know so the voice\nWell let me put it this way I have to buy my allergies thing they have to give me a script for an apple a pen yeah which costs like two three hundred dollars that's my insurance pays that the that I I don't I've never even even come close to have an easy not when my allergies\nI mean it's a lot like a peanut allergy or something like that that did you you know something swells in some I don't know about the most is an interesting you know what I'm saying yeah unbelievable\nLike you said you wonder why the cost of a medical insurance and the country's going crazy all\nAlways gets it is great it is crazy\nThis and it's the rules and regulations that have been set up some in my opinion are overkill and it's just it's just really doing a job on the insurance insurance industry and people trying to buy Medicare I mean jeeze getting up to about a hundred\nDollars a month or so\nWhen I go to my cardiologist but my insurance is Blue Cross\nHis final payment from Blue Cross and Seventy dollars plus my co pay of thirty he makes a hundred dollars as a cardiologist one of the pasta in Rhode Island there'll be a serving may and giving me my tests and everything\nAh so um it until\nYou talk to the doctors and that's why you see I'm forming groups yeah oh yeah okay\nI Do because I think the kids you got an office with girls and everything and and and then and and other nurses and other things uh then you have to have the machines you know the X rays et cetera um\nI it it's it's the opposite of what you're saying\nYou're not ... they're going to solve some dollars that's one thing but a hundred dollars yeah I mean you you go to I don't care yeah there you go down and you have a set of plugs change in your car and of course you ought to Donald to form a of a label at least\nWell a garage just shocked at least eighty five dollars an hour that's what I'm saying the stay afloat\nAnd ... and Lamont forbid they have to provide help for people who you can't believe what the cost has studies small businesses in providing helping the employees\nWe wonder why I'll just take a look yes yes\nBut you know this woman even

there is electrical and of course insurance\nOkay may be for the for the festival and um I understand 'cause I Know somebody that has a booth there and I guess they had to come up with a customer some

apparently the insurer is different than it was last year\nAnd I guess the the the more conservative um the that's the little bit I got out of it but I was told the only reason is insurance or the

there's there are I've been to get ... general none\nNone zero ... that means not OK and she's going to vote against out one of the leading legal scholars in this country\nNot my opinion the opinion of the American bar association\nSaid he is one of the top leading style is why she's voting against some I have no idea you know she got a pipeline that she wanted the oil from the president ... uh as far as making\nA lot of money for the Alaskan yeah yeah okay so why she's voting against the guy to zero evidence against I have no idea well level mainstream is apparently going to vote for judge Kavanaugh\nYeah he's a Democrat right out of this I Am a crowd was going to vote for him so it looks like ...\nTo ... he's in trouble in this reelection uh-huh\nOkay and your state or they took a poll or this week and almost sixty percent of West Virginians why ... ... or to the Supreme Court they want 'em in the Supreme Court so you got manager right now who's tied with his opponent\nAnd he's on the ropes and I'd I Would assume the reason why you voting yes and going against the potty pressure is because he needs is supposed to be able to save his election\nRound the name of the game is getting elected a reelected right [laughter]\nYeah absolutely Larry ... chance tonight take a listen to her speech\nI yeah I did hear it actually I was listening to it on radio or Boston radio station they started carrying it\nAbout Fifteen twenty minutes into her speech they stopped and then decided they were going to run some commercials I guess it went on too long and probably wasn't going in the direction they wanted to go so they decided not to conduct a carry the rest of her speech to I I said boy if that isn't deliberate you\nKnow uh I'm sure CNN gave her five seconds so guys that well the I guess he has to see her in person do you know he said well why is because you get a C. or\nBody language and now she's delivering a speech\nYou can tell she's comfortable with it she's uh she's is ... is is just phenomenal that that that that chemical of speech and everything in your body language or I really really really enjoyed it and I was shocked by her 'cause I've never been a Susan college and I\nCheck that out and all I check that out All right well thank you for your comments is always\nWell You're welcome Larry and adjust the bill will be in the\nMail [laughter] you'd take

[noise] and it's a PC [noise]\nRight as we continue to talk with you on a friday feel free to join us good afternoon Iran W when I arrive Adler hello there been a war does that you\nAnd I am a ... pound alright ... with\nA different Collins yes hey get posted up that phone not you know get rid of that the cell phone or something they're out or an apple own ah see\nI'm I'm a uh I I'm not really um colon\n[laughter] oh All right\nUm I did listen and you know that's something that bugs me all the time whenever I\nHear the Democrat screaming about overturning roe versus Wade\nIf they want to overturn roe versus Wade what difference does it make if they overturned it on federal law and turned it over to the states if in fact the Democrats so wholeheartedly wanted to do something about it\nAs you saw in Rhode Island as soon as they managed to Brett Kavanaugh was named the next words out of the governors miles where we have to put in legislation to protect roe versus Wade basically give women the right\nTo ... now\nMhm now a lot of people and a lot of fate would let it\nBecome the states it wouldn't have to be um\nOh live on a bomb going for the state it's not going to happen\nSo if they didn't want if they didn't want to keep using this as a political football than just\nStart passing legislation now in each state like Rhode Island was asked that passes today the federal law will supersede it\nSo if the federal law gets re vote then it becomes a lower the land and then what happens in Rhode Island at the exact same situation that\nThat's a good point I hadn't thought of that to be honest with him\nSo why these Democrats in each state pushing to get it passed\nGet low who have formed ... an old willow\nAt St Louis right now ... well the reason because then they wouldn't have that argument\nThey would lose that is that it's going to destroy our country it's kind of take away the woman's right to choose well give them the right in each state right now and if there are states\nThat don't want to pass it then that could have any then lobbied those states that changed the laws well then you wouldn't have to be talking about the Korean court justices overturning roe v Wade but that part of their problem I think\nWell ... to ... to argue against someone's choice [laughter] mhm mhm\nBut that's I think the easiest solution to that problem but I it's like one of those solutions that they really don't want to pursue\nRooted in radio think we're going with the uh uh confirming a judge Kavanaugh how's it going to happen what do you think\nYeah I think I think it all happened they they have the votes to eat at this moment ...\nSo I don't think it'll disappear Murkowski it'll be an idiot that she is you know as as a norm and just said earlier they they they give them open a Anwar it's really given them who knows how much more money to state of Alaska\nNo one has collaborated any any additional head at home I feel badly that she came as she put it in a position to have and that she founded the sound of the year everything short of pain\nBut there was lonely greed will people will do want that no one's going up so long to say oh well it's possible to be feeling that way but\nThere was no one to say Oh yes he did that and then the other one the wet the really the one that was saying oh he he did this I went to tally hearty like cat\n... well what was the one thing this little town called ... homes\nAnd that's a that's a good question I Would have loved to hear the answer\nTo rural rural rural explain why awful long ago yeah quality witnesses ...\nWhy would you go back [laughter] why as a college new idea would you return to a high school party yeah yeah yeah\nAt this late today and I don't think I made type on that I was in ... hopefully\nWhether you want to say to me too movement or just this whole situation it will get people that are sexually assaulted today to report it today yeah yeah no it doesn't end up becoming something that will affect people in the future\nThat's a very good point that that'll probably be the good thing that comes out of all of this discussion all of this debate your rights people will knock them a procrastinator you know them and they'll immediately or go forward with a you know with their complaining that they complained that whenever you want to call it a rather\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to Alaska I spend my money someplace else that's what I Would\nDo your why and I know the states to spend your money right\nWell I told you I did go to South Dakota this yeah that's right and it was magnificent Larry and you can take if you want to live can take that trip\nOut to sea Mount Rushmore crazy horse or the badlands devil's tower it within a hundred mile radius Larry you can spend a

than our good friend the or vice chair of the school committee ...\nI I mean I heard John Gregory uh reading off a Paul's resume and it's unbelievable what this man as accomplished for the city of one\nFor four and a half months I've identified problem after problem the problem after problem out will continue to do that at the next meeting but who will there be to resolve the problem\nWe've identified the problem yeah now we have to develop a solution now [noise] who used there's no one left behind to develop the solution\nI I mean the whole thing is completely illogical fill it doesn't make an ounce of sense so we've got to get to the bottom of it is unfortunately and we will we will\nBecause um I I think that we will will will get\nThe bottom of who we will but it's no way to run the city because and and you know who knows the reason she's leaving the city but you know just by questioning re evaluations who was supposed to go through her now whose first superior city hall that would be the finance director\nYeah she yeah ... ...\nChris Chamberlain Israeli or a boss however I Will say this what's interesting about tax\nAssassins generally I I'm ... I'm saying statewide they are conveyed upon the office arrest access to a great deal of authority it doesn't say that\nThe assassin shall what the concurrence of the finance director or it doesn't say that the assess the show with a concurrence of the finance director and the mayor or the year ... shall\nWith a concurrence of the finance director or the mayor and the city it doesn't say any of that\nOkay it just says that the assesses shall so there's a great deal of authority that is conveyed to the assassin now if the assess a flubbed the assignments so cool you know hypothetically\nI Am not saying I ... I'm not making accusations not pointing a finger I'm really creating a hypothetical situation\nIf the assessment flubbed the assignment and she was within the purview of the ... the statutory [noise] provisions that will conveyed to\nWhat happens then you know so it's a it's a very interesting thing I fix this call listen you're driving a bus card I don't care if I Can't\nSee the one we have a fall we have a phone call please jump on it I hear anybody there\nNo I'm Glad you didn't jump on it because I very very much enjoyed listening but again under the coyotes and this assessment and particularly the disparity between ah ah the building she wanted to sell to the academy\nAnd ... and ... and and it's just when when they ... as he got so eloquently you've got to be done\nWell you know I ... when I when I'm doing this research I am stunned because if you take a look at the field guide for thirty ... role and you'll see that there were four four buildings permits taken out last year one to do\nX amount of improvements on the first the first story [noise] a a a second one to do work on a second floor third floor for school so all of the [noise] is that you were or is that us\nNo I'm just trying to wrap them all are currently I'm Sorry oh about ... ... not a problem not a problem but\nIn any event uh I don't know how when you when you process for a substantial building improvement permits how you get a decline in the total assessment it boggles the mind\nAll the funny part is is it's sort of like saying to myself we're not talking about a building that was owned by somebody that was going to go into default go bankrupt we're talking about an hour or an organization that is very well heeled\nPlenty of money oh you're able to do whatever lots and their parents they made it a shot at all in significant and shrubs that place\nThey may cut shoddy are insignificant they huge exactly so it's a joke she's a joke\nWell no it's not a joke I mean we've got to get to the bottom of this and at some point in time um what is the most effective manner for us to keep that role and and I I'm speaking with ... I'm asking the question I mean you\nYou have been around almost as long as I have you been around his building for Thirty years so I'm asking you\nKnow here's what we've done we've identified problem a B C and D now we've got to the village solutions to problems a B C and D\nNow that the assassin was gone how do you propose to develop a solution\nWell I'm not happy to say this because I was told the other day that up to boost shot is probably back again on is seven thousand five hundred and fifty five day roll okay\nSucking down and other pay from the people in my opinion and I know he worked for you for a great many years\nAnd club many great ... house okay\nAnd yet he continues to make idea Ninety thousand on top of his country and hopefully the answer is not to go back ... shot is to try to get somebody so qualified that they will not be threatened and intimidated by the fourth floor which obviously in this case has happened again because\nWhen you told me she's going to be the deputies seltzer water work isn't that the graveyard of outlast successor\nYeah yeah well it is okay so they go there to rest in peace ought to be dismissed because clearly\nShe is not so confident\nDespite the rhetoric that I read or the fact that\nShe refused to give me information because and that would include people like Stacy paws big when you ask people questions in there and capable of answering they use political bureaucratic rhetoric and don't give you responses until you submit\nThis and do this and it's not in the right format and and that's the problem with I I had with our current society so am I going to regret singer leave now are we going to find a replacement yes\nHopefully going to find a replacement under the Albert Bree in a regime\nWhere we can look for somebody that can work in the best interest of the community and not the best interest of one individual in the fourth wall that's very cranky yes\nOkay well I'm here's the thing 'cause I was thinking today I think\nDuck should take Linda place job 'cause it's very very nice person I could never do that job to have to be to an ice but I can be the assistant director of a administration for a ... a young man searching going in\nI can do stuff like cheat herself to do I can walk around and walk into the room on a friday until somebody you're fired [laughter]\nYou've never fired anybody in your life but I can do that for you [laughter] when\nWas listening intently thinking that there was a conclusion is oh my God we used to getting\nAround when I was I'm Serious [laughter] but\nYou know fill listening to you and listening to him and and trying to keep\nThe people out there and fall and that's what's going on because as you well know there are so few people well informed it's crazy and and it's it's a diminishing number it's sad\nThat is it is and [noise] well what we um we're going to\nAs ... pointed out a little while ago um ...\nThe the campaign really will begin next Tuesday in earnest um and\nWe're going to we're going to put it all out there for people to reflect upon and hopefully they will agree more will agree with us than they do with the current administration and um let's see what happens\nWell you know clearly if it's an issue based\nCampaign and set of Somalia okay and and negativity and and you bring up facts like you have is bringing up which facts are facts they don't lie you know these numbers that you're coming up with they don't lie anybody can research is do you think Walgreens this December thirty first\nAfter listening if they are anyone listening\nIn that organization or or\nBeing contacted is not going to file a notice of accounts and file attacks appeal predicated on the fact of Seventy feet away I have some ... that is being assessed on land value Seventy percent less than I Am and do you think they're going to persevere and the and the spirit record\nOf cause they they don't cause cause they are they can't lose now here's the other things that I Want to talk to the ... and\nAnd I think that's a good cop\nNo I no no I'm being serious I think I told you Wednesday night that I was going to be calling you and I didn't think that it was going to be as quickly as it has happened but uh no I I think I Need to sit down with you in the ... at least to\nOut in the league draft form what we would like to do with this uh where we're going with it and and see what you think\nThat's great because you know I think a resolution is most capable to be accomplished and as you said in previous ah a polish um commentaries that it's a collaboration that needs to go on\nOh absolute ...\nSociety or ignoring that this exists and I think it'd make the whole city a lot\nBetter for our you know for addressing this problem\nWas saying well we need to do is we need to establish some equity here when we need to have an equitable distribution of the tax celebrity and right now we don't have that I mean we obviously we don't have\nIt because if I'm standing on the proposed site of the rise may oh what's that I mean you're thirty call Mullins green my assessment\nFor an acre of land they're a little better than an acre of land is two hundred Nineteen thousand dollars now if I Walk across the street to a small piece of land the one that's owned by the people who operate\nThe Walgreens drugstore\nOr you're talking about running assessment that a million dollars plus you know amazing yeah\nNo no that discrepancy and\nRage so I I mean how how out please can convince me take your data and convince me\nI I I mean I'm willing to listen to anybody or anything at any time to convince me\nThat this is the rest equitable and you can't do it so what do you do about it ... you make your your pretend like everything will be wonderful and we can go ahead and get doesn't make sense\nWell here's the other inequities that pops into my mind as you're speaking about death\nThe inequity of the uh you know the student to teacher ratio at the mayoral Academy of I heard on the radio previously it was seven to one\nLanguage is seven students chip one T shirt\nWhereas in the public schools that we also finance I don't know what that that that that ratio is any longer because I'm not within the school district anymore as far as ah an administrator but I Know it's not seven to ...\n... and not the rule and I'm not even close\nAnd as I mentioned that at my this dialogue at the city council meeting\nI brought up the fact that I Would have been much happier if the three point two five million that was not taken out charge for the rise mayoral academy I bet that would have covered the synagogue tax very nicely\nWhere did you get the three point two five\nIt was in July Seventeen article by Russ olive oil and then when socket cough\nNo I'm not going to ... I'm not going to have a my hat on any of those I'm telling you know that the amount of expenditure for arise mayoral academy or directly or that has\nBeen diverted from the one socket education department is four and a half million dollars\nI I'm sure because I I Know how much it cost to just to renovate the building and I've seen that that were going on now for about an hour long\nSo that's a whole different thing because they they've done in grants from ride for the physical improvements I'm not talking about that well I don't know if somebody if somebody says to you Dr\n... how much money was friends how much money\nThe bride's uh enjoyed being the recipient of how much money to ... get\nOtherwise would have gone to the one side of the education department and the answer is four and a half million dollars\nSo now it's just mind boggling what it is\nIt is and it's no it's insane\nHas to stop and a\nHalf because you know as an expenditure I think it was totally useless or that the money should have been invested in the current school department and uh and as I said some diverted to fix the Senate ground situation\nI remember remember it's going to expand every year because we're up where well on our way to five a hundred and Twenty one students at some point and I\nI mean I pray that it gets stopped because I Am all for education but it's um it's got to be equal and equitable\nWell look if you if you create an entity like rise and rise gets the cream of the crop and left behind are those who need the attention\nWho need the extra help or who desperately desperately need 'em\n[laughter] the resources that you know not that you know don't have the money to impart to them when it comes up I mean it's\nAn excellent chance some as\nYoung as part of an article earlier this week\nThat showed the AT T is um and I hear there's a program a pilot program of some sort that's going to be a you know introduced to stop that\nI think that that's just like a fake band date this absenteeism has been going on for years and it's also teachers\nBeing absent all around ... it needs to be looked at like hey kids why you being apps and I think we need to talk to some of that population to do research and an advocate of asking the kids what's up you know\nI can tell you this doctor I\nAm going to see to it that\nWe bring I bring our message I'm to the public that needs to know it uh as effectively as possible and in order to achieve that I Need to be guided by people like you are who have\nTo be guided by people like you are who has the experience in the background\nOr that we desperately need to make those kinds of correct decisions and so I\nOffer it to you and bravo and my transcend good wishes because I think it'd be better for everyone the educated population that listens to you and your proposals of how we're going to move along with the brand\nMayor well less ... and let's not lose sight of the fact\nThat the the theme the agenda is very very simple and it is tax relief tax relief tax relief\nActs really so I Will be in touch a\nBank account and feel weekends okay\nHere's what are you to ... by by moving along here Albert color welcome to the phones\nHow low May of ...
