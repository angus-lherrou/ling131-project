directions and ask you about this one we Hollywood and politicos combination I've always thought is a very interesting one some people say oh it's strange bedfellows but his jak entity doing with Marilyn Monroe for example how how guarantee but\nYou know Elvis has been in the White House would that all kinds of connections between\nPresidents and the Hollywood types there are benefits and there are disadvantages I Would say we're combining Hollywood celebrities newsmakers\nPoliticians sometimes the combo\nCan be quite costly but sometimes that can be very then changes so let's just reveal that looks and had outlets to the White House Bill Clinton played the facts on Arsenio Hall\nThat I ever wanted to do the wonder party with Obama and those are just a few names and now Trump has ... and some car Daschle and in the oval so let's let me put it this way does show me up to Hollywood for ... days help or\nTell me a chow Hollywood for ... days help or hurt a politician particularly a politician who's the president\nIt but that's a hard call because it depends on how popular the celebrity is for example um somebody like a Roseanne Barr\nIs buried a popular among a very narrow group of Americans but somebody like a ... a who has a wide reach a can certainly help somebody what's what's interesting about this is this just a a coming together of power and fame\nAnd its mutually beneficial for both parties and doing something like this and I think that's why presidents over the decades have brought celebrities into the White House it gives them a photo opportunity\nIt gives the person the celebrity or a little bit more groggy toss when they go out into the culture and say they they danced with\nPresident Clinton or played sax you know that type of thing so um I think it's a mutual benefit mutually beneficial move on both parts and\nI ... don't be surprised to see that continue to happen\nWell here's my take on it [noise] Ah yes it's mutually beneficial or to both parts or they wouldn't because they piggyback off each other's celebrity but here's what I noticed over the years\nWe were in the past\nAs political as a nation or there was Washington they did their thing over there and we went about our business and it's held his Presley was a Democrat or Republican I wouldn't have known it right is Arsenio Hall Democrat or Republican but then there's been a shift and\nLet me see oh celebrities are taking sides most are on the left as we know that there are people you mentioned Roseanne Barr will mention I mentioned cognac and there's others Taylor Swift wouldn't be caught dead these days with Trump in the White House\nSo in terms of the bill and then change us\nThe backstory to that is which side are you on ... for Trump to invite Taylor Swift or even\nStricken NBA players or soccer players from Europe or something to the White House they would who shall I say taken me maybe you know they would put their just up in the air against it um it's not like the White House or the olden\nDays where it's a privilege and an honor\nTo be invited by a president today we have a ... ... president God Forbid versus eight Democrats president and I saw this happening ... a little bit with the bushes certainly with Obama\n... ... exactly and I think I'm as we become more polarized and our political\nOpinions people are are starting to identify celebrities and sports athletes I'm as to who side of the aisle are they on are they a Republican or are they a Democrat\nAnd therefore I don't like that team or I'll never watched that guy's movie and so the the polarization that happening\nIn our culture is starting to to bleed over into our celebrities and\nThat's why Taylor Swift got so much of a bad rap over the last couple of weeks because of her comments and weighing in in the election and it goes back to you know what what somebody said was just shut up and saying just shut up and performing keep your politics or your sports\nAre out of the the two and do all\nThat was a book written for the audience that was a book written by Laura\nShut up and saying I'm ... I understand it but you mentioned Taylor Swift her her fans there on her side I wouldn't be caught dead in the White House et cetera et cetera so we do have this polarization quicker down to about a minute\nAnd I want to get to with a particular shape so\nIs it important to be in the or you know you can show up at and wine and cheese lady or in a big gala but\nThe oval does that help the office itself to house a celebrity in the\nOffice to me it doesn't look good it just doesn't I I don't mind if you take a meeting outside but the old English so revered in my mind it's jarring for me to see that\nYeah I I'm ... I'm not sure I think it can hurt but it can also help depending on how highly respected a celebrity is a indicator which side though yet and it depends on who they like Charlton Heston when he was a gift of of George W. Bush\nUm you know ... that totally brought in the second amendment crap because Charlton\nToday stay out of the whole you want to go meet outside at some function that's different but the old who is everybody's\nThank you change I let\nThere's a Web cam can with regard to judge you around\nBecause attacked two justices who are on the ballot for retention for the next go around his next go around put you on the on the seat for six years isn't that correct\nThat trade we happen to be the two justices who were\nUp for retention their skier or this is the year that people are upset and services adult or a for for many in in the in the movement or we are the targets\nAll right so how are you\nAnd the other justice combating this I Know there's things you can't say you kinda have to just take it I'm ...\nAnd the voter doesn't know a lot of death and yet they vote for or against justice is what is your couch or did this because you don't just declared that the food court hasn't made a rendering and and so it appears to me and I'm sure to the naked eye that they're out to get the two justices for retention just in case [noise]\nWell I think that's right and certainly a the everyone will know before the election which justices waited which way um but you know I decided not to put together a formal campaign and the reason for that is that I don't want\nPeople um who may have business before the court\nContributing to to my campaign I think that that would create a conflict so I'm\nBasically the main thing that I have been doing I put together a website which every single one of my opinions on it um\nAnd uh you know I I I Believe in in full transparency um\nWe have a judicial review commission which asks every one who is a pure before justices or on the ballot they rank them they rate them in terms of integrity judicial ability and so forth um and I'm happy to report that I got near\nPerfect or near perfect scores even from people um\nPresumably who lost their cases before us and those you know those are those are not a sexually campaign ads they're not attack ads or anything like that up but they're they're the best we can do to defend ourselves um and maintain the integrity of the court\nTo bang it or they think I Would say we're down to thirty seconds so I'll\nOther thing is that he was the first and only independent jurists appointed to the AC Supreme Court so with that and good score and be independent I think she'll survive pretty well adjusted my ball like rude to leave it there I appreciate your\nOf weeks thanks so much Terry All right

from their parents how could millennials\nPossibly get marriage right well to your point they're serious [noise] okay I accept that\nAnd I tend to think that there are more sensitive about it as well they make those decisions and they want to make sure that they get it right and maybe it's because they look back at their parents and say no my parents kinda screwed up a little bit maybe I don't want to go down that road\nDo you think that there might be this element 'cause I read a study about this and said all under how their parents' generation\nWhich so many other things that kind of came

that but\nThey do [noise] vet said my guess is she still advantage I'm a I'm sure she's at a financial advantage and I got more signs up all those kinds of things [noise] um ... uh\nAd in and say um [noise] my paper right before the primary and and I was surprised I you know when I read the content I thought wow here's a guy who's been battling it up for five years and keep score and and he was he was very organized about keeping score but all the things that he felt\nThe mayor had not done properly um including\nYou know the first person I was there a story about your will behave and do

I think it was mentioned basically the Rhode Island kids count I'm\nFrom a two thousand Fifteen two thousand sixteen the latest the latest numbers twenty four percent of and socket students in case the three had\nPer cent of Woodstock good students in case the three\nHad climbed a capitalist system called the gaps and it's just me and they were ... more than Eighteen days for the school year\nThat's K. two three that's almost one fourth of the student body all these young kids out to the young kids\nGrade one decides hey I'm not going to go to school today\nI I think here the the parents have to play on a much more aggressive mold and making sure that their students come I'm the numbers do increase when we get the high school grades nine to twelve I'm On a number was forty two percent of the student body\nUm that's that's just terrible I'm with second highest to Providence which has forty five percent according to these just the statistics of two thousand fifty two thousand sixty now what do you do how do you solve it how do you ensure you don't make sure the or the ... the president\nI mean if we could say to them as a as I remember saying uh you know ... out the door\nRight and and you got to be president at school and at and I'm going to be approved by I show up all the time I was sixteen years without taking a sick day so I was pretty lucky lucky then and even right now the only time I ever take time off generally has been to a\nCultural event of soccer school committee but what are we going to do by the superintendent has come up with this policy called be here\nAnd working with diminished ration and working with social media especially right he's trying to encourage the ... you try to encourage 'em the students and the parents you know to you know this is what you miss and this is what you need to come come for all this is what's going to help you\nAnd and obviously or when you're president in the classroom you don't miss anything or you don't fall behind\nAnd um that's one of the problems that problems could live on the student because the far behind and that's the catch up and sometimes in the educational challenge is a very difficult for students to catch up so\nAnd so related to attendance ... would be the other um the other issue that uh the superintendent is concerned about and I guess the Rhode Island department of education and I see a graduation rate together titles together I guess so\nI think we really do um you know once again if if students on on showing up after Eighteen the apps and says I'm they they probably can't can't catch up with with the with the requirements of of course and they fail and then I'll get credit\nAnd obviously just begin to compound the problem I'm three years ago working with a high school um Cornel Henderson Bible a limited to them as they put together this success one on one program\nThat all freshmen at the high school take as a class mhm um I Believe we're in a third year now at this program or maybe even a force here and and this program was one way to address and give students\nHave students realize the importance of future goals or if you begin freshmen hearsay listen dug into graduate you're going to go to college\nOkay maybe that may be a way to get the students to see beyond you know today and to see that there is a few to follow them that they cannot future goes [noise]\nSo we're hoping to see that this program that began I think three years ago now I Will come to fruition by helping to raise the graduation rate that\nWe want when soccer you know our graduation rate is affected by many other factors and we uh uh a city where people move in and out and that sometimes does affect the numbers um because right now the graduation rate you take in ninth grade class\nAnd you follow them for four years how many of them graduated digit percentage over those four years many different things happen or to students and families are in a city like when socket [noise]\nHow do you feel about um the teachers ah work to rural right now um [noise] this is an issue that I think confuses the taxpayers you know we don't know whether it's\nThe mayor's fault or we don't know whether it's the negotiated team or maybe we just don't have enough money [laughter] or all combination\nWhether I think you raised some some good possibilities as as the to the reasons why I'm a I was really amazed that negotiations first of all began so late\nI mean if I was on the committee we would have a fact I even when I was still out of committee I even raised to the soup and to the chairman you know back in October and November we have to start the meeting to start negotiating a contract [noise] um [noise]\nAnd the fact that it's still going on and they began the school year without a contract I I just think doesn't doesn't make sense um work to roll or is difficult I think it's it's a huge response to trying to get something moving um\nI did hope that was once a mediator came into place that's that's a positive step hopeless the rights step forward to solve this contract and maybe once the mediator is doing some work maybe the unique could just step back\nWith the with the work to rule um do I do understand why they are using it in ... and why they're trying to use it as a way to um just raised erase some interesting awareness that that just contract needs to be settled [noise] um I Know it's it's difficult for the students\nAnd I know it's also difficult for the teachers\nBecause you know they get teachers are not just workers teachers are professionals and people go into the to the field of teaching people that care\nI mean they and they care about their students and and I know that when soccer teachers want to do so much more with and for their students and obviously they've and failing the pinch of a work through\n'em so\nThey seemed to be a teacher's guild blaming more the administration than uh the sitting school committee that's the sense I get um from what I've read miss departing to say\nWell if you remember in in the dynamics of the point the school committee or we all learned surprisingly that the mayor has the the uh the authority over negotiating [noise]\nUm the school committee right now the point the school committee has absolutely no authority working on a contract um ironically it was only after several months of negotiate in that the chairman of the school committee was finally invited on the go ... team [noise]\nI ...

you know right in the city experiences with this issue of urine\nYeah absolutely and I think that you know I'm first responders and public safety officials rarely\nSee these problems first hand every single day and they realize that these are problems that need to be addressed hearing one socket but in every single community because um addiction doesn't discriminate\nAnd it happens everywhere it happens to all families\nAll people and I think that's important to remember when we when we talk about addiction but the state has made some very good first strides in addressing the opioid crisis but more work can always be done and we see it not just here in Rhode Island but all across the country\nAnd I think that we need policies that address all facets of addiction including the mental health aspect and the homelessness aspect because it's such a\nA multifaceted problem um so I think we need to work towards legislative changes that don't punish and criminalize addicts but instead treat addiction in a more holistic way to actually\nHelp individuals become healthy and whole and healthy and whole again when\nWe play commercials or advertisement score community care alliance so

representing when socket and crumbling Michael very good morning to you\nJust great to see it again ah you're one of my favorite interviews from this time as I've been around I\nFollow thank you very much um [noise] we're going to start off with a little bit of background in case you don't know Michael very\n[laughter] I I miss too much but if you ever need a new career the postal service might be for you [laughter] and\nThey're red Slater snow to the Senate we will go for sure if that's not\nThe um neighborhood those are as you're walking incumbent when socket out I've been engaged now you're getting a a especially from ...\nUh so I've walked every single during Cumberland I think at this point in my district there might be a few small side roads I Know staples road I I missed that one if I ... road sorry guys I'm trying I'm trying I have a week left a a\nI'm a type of a a comments that you're getting some folks\nI'm often in Cumberland at least from the Senate side of the house I I find that they feel neglected I'm an underrepresented and I'm not surprised and what I mean by that when you look at the needs of the socket they're very different from the needs of Cumberland\nUm and I mean people tell you all the time sock it as a distressed community that's not to say that Cumberland doesn't have issues and challenges that deserve representation\nI'm coming back to those budget items that we were talking about what I'm the legislation that I Want to bring to the table\nI Want to bring line item veto access for governor something that forty four states in the country have the ability to look down the budget and say this doesn't make sense and strike it the ability to stop people from slipping small items into otherwise popular bills enforcing the governor to sign those even though they may not be in the best interests of the state [noise] um\nWant to bring an officer the inspector general to the table so that we can investigate and prosecute fraud waste and abuse in our state agencies uh this is just general basic oversight that the majority of states have embraced in Rhode Island is somehow overlooked or miss this and we know why\nThis will actually decrease the power of the general assembly um leadership doesn't want that they want to retain their power but\nThe way that our system is supposed to work is checks and balances\nAnd oversight for all to make sure that nobody gets too far out of line and you're in Rhode Island we lacks that\nCertainly not just Cumberland but also and socket sees that I'm In a way that out differently but that's the legislation that I can easily bring to the table because you don't have to reinvent it\nAgain forty four states have wind item veto access go take it the whole documents not copyrighted not protected changed the name of the top that a few things to make it fit Rhode Island a little bit better and bring it to the general assembly and pass it because it makes sense\nThere's a tremendous amount of information that I spoke to you on the four o'clock program we're talking about today ... ... your research [laughter] if it's in debt so\nJohn word comments on that as well as you know a John word is pretty much an encyclopedia when a sure statistics and five and ... and ... and I've spoke about this as well\nIt's hard for me to not get caught up in the numbers because it's the numbers that I'm going to use to represent the distress in the general assembly and you have to have strong commander those facts but when you talk to the individual voter sometimes that's not what they're interested in hearing is the exact statistics I'm\n... and it's challenging for me because I live and breathe these statistics because that's what gives me a persuasive argument with the general assembly peers [noise] um so yeah\nIt just yeah I mean the education I mean where we are versus you know the economics of it per student\nVersus you know the economics of it per student um it's it's really something to look at specially you know a attendance issues things of that nature\n[noise] um I don't know if you well actually you weren't that the school committee form hearing when socket um that they had at the library\nUm and one of the key questions I'm One that I found to be the most important they said what's the number one challenge facing when socket schools and each of the candidates that was their gave a perspective um\nThey agreed on some points I don't think they disagreed on any of the points they may have placed more importance on one versus another um it seems to me that funding was certainly one issue but even more than that was parental involvement um and the students when I had an opportunity to go to her\nOne of the charter public schools so it's a non traditional public school\nAnd one of the things that stood out to me is that they they commit their parents to being involved in the education um and I have to be clear I think that would provide any student or a benefit and an advantage the second that the the parent becomes involved of course you're going to do better [noise]\nUm and I recognize the school committee for for stating that fact that it's a lack of parental involvement that exacerbates some of the challenges facing a education here in northern Rhode Island [noise]\nAnd I want to help them and I don't really know how which is why we have a school committee I Hope that whoever's elected the school committee will be willing to meet with me and its eyes me possibly even go to the state house with me and present their arguments and I want to rely on the experts in all of these fields [noise]\nOne of the the lesser known benefits of going toward a door or the way that I have\nYou learned about people that have expertise and things that you've never considered I don't know about you or I Know a little bit about transplant medicine from the medical side uh 'cause\nI haven't I've dabbled too much and transplant medicine I get it right [laughter]\nBut how much do you know about the individuals that go through it and yet by going door to door I Know if three people that I've met that have had transplants and if ever there was any legislation that game for that had to do a transplant services the very first thing that I Would do is call these people up and say\nHey come to a meeting with me come have coffee with me all by talk to me about\nHow this would affect this community what what's going on with this because I'm not an expert from that side of the fence and that's where I'm going since June meeting the community getting this list of experts that I can drawn and rely upon I Hope it will allow me to be a much more effective legislator\nThat's the voice of Michael very running state Senate November six coming very quickly here in Rhode Island election date district twenty as the race and we spoke about the valley breeze article we encourage you to go out and pick up a copy the valley breeze to take a ride or a read yourself\nOn the campaign a written by using Sharry or just suffer through it's not too deep in\nA ... as you are as you get through the ads you'll get there uh the uh we got a roughly four minutes left Michael and I was a turn it over to you for a final appeal not a bad idea to reintroduce up briefly as people do tune in this time of day throughout the program\nThe are the highlights that I put on my palm garden I tell people I'm a Fifteen year army veteran on the laboratory director at landmark medical center I my husband I'm a father\nI'm deeply committed to this area and to investing in our community and I want to see us grow and prospering become better than we are today and I want to be a voice for this community so I'm running for state Senate or\nI have a Facebook page it's very active um my phone number is southern one nine to five to eight three six zero you can find that on line pretty easily as well but again sobbing one nine to five to eight three six zero I put that phone number out there\nBecause I Will never say no to a conversation even if you don't have to agree with me if you disagree with me you're the conversation I Want a half I Want that perspective I Want that opinion\nOr simply of course [laughter] but\nIt's those conversations\nThat make me better tomorrow than I Am today and and that's my mission to always be a little bit more involved and informed [noise] and it's my commitment to represent properly and be that voice for northern Rhode Island and the general assembly or\nAsk everybody for their consideration I never asked somebody for votes uh I find that to be disrespectful when we're asked for their consideration [noise]\nMe a Facebook page is quite active I can save all those ... those are great a pumpkin covered I saw your your [laughter]\nI'm not in my family as a ... [laughter] that it looked\nFantastic a decorated his own Halloween is coming up a lot of kids trick or treating\nThey are the true challenge is getting my two year old to sit still [laughter]\nThat's great Michael very micro very V. E. R. I. you'll find them on the ballot in November six asking for your consideration\nAnd I ask everybody to go read that article it's on the front page of the Cumberland edition it's on I think Paige ten of the one socket edition\nAnd I know your your your return to the area I got to ask you and I think the entire Blackstone Valley who you're rooting for last night\nOh oh come on [laughter]\nSo I'm just tired of staying up late at night so the fact that I kind of wanted him to one at home\nBut ah yeah let's let's get some sleep\nAll right and I think that maybe the subject of the next program I'm Michael very always willing to talk I encourage you if you haven't had a chance to speak with him and you are a voter in district twenty\nGive them a call a chat with them for a few minutes or he is looking to meet twenty seven thousand voters or in his district and you still got some time to finish that list are always interesting always engaging Michael very district twenty November ... the Republican on the ballot he's asking for your support in consideration\nA thank you Michael very\nStay tuned it's the jelly gallon show coming up next the Joe ... be talking sports entertain\nHad his arms up like the one mega millions over here without a home run I mean dramatic celebration and it was like you know I Know it was a big moment I feel but you haven't won anything yet and how ironic was it that they end up losing that game and then losing the series\nA baseball just as a way of humbling people in and bringing people up and you know David Price is all over the radio not themselves for being talked about this morning and\nWhat is what is a shift in uh the narrative for a guy like that as now uh he comes out and pitches as I said on my last show imagine if he's the one that takes the ball to win the world series and that's exactly what happened\nWas\nUnbelievable I think we have our special guest are joining us don't Henry and we're going to have a loaded show so many people want to enjoy this and celebrate and congratulations to everybody that stuck it in the air and hung in there with this team and and enjoy ah to me I don't know which one is the best but this is right up there with a championships for the for the red Sox\nFor us and said thank you so they can uh I'm In the morning you're on the show\nI guess you\nKnow we'll wait I We'll await word from the W. when I write a powers that be and I'm sure that um they will alert me a win missed the DCI calls and I'm usually he sends me attacks before any way but either way or\nIs it was excited to talk to all of my friends that they call the joke show radio program if ... if it felt extra special you know ever since I started doing this show and really putting a\nYou know my opinion out there and sharing my views and and listening to everybody and not just doing this thing called sports talk radio it it's really special to be part of a another championship\nAnd not be um you know sitting here this morning talking about why didn't in Cannes was set his feet wide at Heathrow like he was in the back yard playing Frisbee you'd you know you you can look at\nHow many moments like that and we had over the years where uh they came close but it was a just a bad luck play or something funny happened and and the rest is history and we're not the champions but this morning Steve we are the champions\nJoe any better than this or that I Want to say one lives on the show show yeah I Do like criticizing [noise] mhm that's not my style\nOr what I I Can't I Can't list or that and I used to listen mhm mhm I Can't list\nYou know I I there's another I I won't even call them out by name but there's also another station that's on a that's a big station and the guys that are on that show\nI you know they took ... billion dollar jak I Wish I could send them a humble pie or a fresh hot humble pie right out of the oven because\nThey couldn't say every time the red Sox would do another achievement it was yeah but they haven't done this yet but I Want to see him be the ANC you yeah but they haven't beating Houston yeah but they can't do it in the playoffs yeah but this and that\nThey started Seventeen into they never lost more than three games in a row this entire they went forty two series without being swept they're the only team in baseball history\nTo have a hundred and eight wins beat to one hundred and ... hundred wind teams and beat both of the teams that represented the league and the previous year's World Series\nHouston in Los Angeles last year's World Series they beat both of them and oh yeah by the way they want both games in Yankee Stadium and destroyed the Yankees and the process\nI this could be the greatest team ever had really good it's a ... it's a matter of debate for statistical opinion I guess but uh that they're right there Steven are\nJust I mean the achievements to milestones the contributions go up and down\nEverybody had a pot in this thing and really have a very special thing that we just witness\nShow at this this World Series was one short of us\nIt was one absolutely ... makes the throw in and we're out\nOf that game at ten ... ten minutes of twelve and ... with a lot more sleep or whatever it was so yeah um and he felt terrible and you know what I I don't even mean this to be mean Steve mean spirited\nBut in Kansas I never saw the field or the other plane again after that and I I think that was the right move not to punish them but once the guys got that kind of thing in his head and you know he's here in West busy seeing ghosts and that that's I mean if you think about it in that game as well he almost got picked off on first base they review the play and then later in that same inning before you got thrown out\nHome on the amazing ...\nHe he overran thirties he went right over the third base values lucky to get out by McDonalds so I was all set within Ginzler at that point I was saying bring the kid in um bring diamonds in and bring Holt in and leave it alone for the rest of the series and that's what he did so Steve we got the patriots bills tonight\nAnd we just got a loaded show it's it's gonna be nice to be able to have time to talk about the Celtics in Bruins again we'd been treated to a real special ride\nJoke get like\nYou said at Wednesday baby get the votes ready seed I have a great day

thing ... you know congratulations to everybody and I you know we're leaving for the season I'll talk in the spring yes ah go patriots and the Bruins and self there aren't you have a good\nA YouTube good luck I Know you've got a lot of work to do with everything I was thinking of but you know what I we don't have to worry about staying up to three thirty in the morning jak true they did it and the Yankees will be a will be heard from again with that young team and a Red Sox fans we're not going to even start you know getting into all the negative about anything today but\nUm you know obviously with any championship team that there will be some departures and some new additions and you had something real special this year um to have everybody contribute like they did you can really go down the list and see how everybody kind of rewrote their own\nTheir own profile Jill Kelley was another guy you know they finish the game with six straight strike out last night between say when Joe Kelly a joke Kelly was the guy we talked about not even making the postseason roster\nAnd you had a low and behold he ends up being a big big time guy Raphael Deborah's another guy they didn't know if you even get a sniff from the playoffs he ends up with some huge heads and the huge play in the field\nChat there's so much to go over it ... it's a crazy but um you know we're ah we're fortunate to be a to B fans of of a team that rose to the occasion and all in all senses of the war in in the playoffs they met all\nAfter Boston Florida to victory over the Los Angeles angels down Brodsky said the red Sox are getting peers and cash consideration from Toronto in exchange for drum roll please minor league infielder Santiago as spin all\nSaid and I go I Love your Santiago when I got to tell you we will take it pass at\nThirty five had hit two Ninety One with foreign runs in sixteen rabies in twenty six games for Toronto a career average of two fifty five with age ... home runs into hundred sixty eight on the ice\nAge the Boston manager said the Sox are adding a strong bad or they can use against left handed pitching it's one more weapon that we have we got better tonight chorus and it's good to have him and you know what\nAlex you're Alex I'm Talking to not out ... although we're kind of talking to him too even though he's not here they they use them against left these in writing is because the opportunity presented itself Marlon got hurt\nAnd and and I mean I just can't say enough about how much this guy was I was I was thinking it when he came up the other night in the eighth and I thought how big would this be any delivered with the home run\nAnd then last night I mean it was like I was like you kidding me are you kidding me in the first in a two run shot and then you hit the number one and then not I mean it was just it was the was it was locked in locked in and Jackie ... only because he hasn't played in the last couple ...\nWe're not talked about are you you're not even here you're not even not even had today without Jackie Bradley junior on so many levels\nGo there and everybody everybody everybody was unbelievable it one for the ages of listening to morning and\nThey didn't do this all year they never\nYeah they never even one day where they said you know what I Am a I'm privileged to have a job that I can come on and talk about sports and no matter what we have one of the best teams no matter what going and they never could highlight the positive they never could say you know what\nYou know the ... it was always you know they expecting people to fail and even though all the\nYou know ... it was like oh he's had to Tommy John this and that\nHe remember how he started Alex and then he had a little you had a little hiccup there and it was I don't see it as I told you see an end looking right in of all the you know what a warrior that guy was the other night and and I don't say that to walk\nAt all you know ... to put it in perspective as a sport I'm not comparing them to one of our service members or anything but as far as a as a as a baseball player to be unselfish and come into that situation and not be able to start\nNot make his world series start because the night before he's got to throw you know eighty pitches and go seven innings and and just and and the guy at a\nI'm drawing a hundred and two miles an hour I mean Alex ... it was special and I got to ask you as a fan you know this two thousand Thirteen was great and I and I'll never forget that and I'm not saying we were lucky but I kind of feeling that was like a lightning in a bottle ...\nLightning in a bottle of this year we were dominant from the beginning of the season and the people that I believed in this team\nCan enjoy this today and soak in the people that do to them but you you knew or yeah they were good enough it was just a matter of like everyone side how are they going to perform when the stakes are at the highest and and they all dead and it's it\nYou know the one thing when you got a really good and the manager is you know the old I was going into the play offs but what it was called starters every including like you said of the sale coming out yet on them you know everybody was all that\nOil and every game plus cello plus a little bit too early in that Yankees there and you know what a number they kept saying all in all in and you even the even in the Los Alex even in that in that Eighteen any loss you know you love your manager of the way that he went after it I didn't like it on to win the game and\nI didn't like him taking J. D. out to pinch run there but you're trying to win the game and you know obviously that comes back to haunt you and not one but aggressive taking it copy DM seize the moment step on ya ya you know ... step on approach that said when they brought in\nSale last night I was I went up I was like\nOh yeah that was that I knew there were no no way on loan mono way I don't care if I Would have no way of life I I Know and I thought that too and I thought sale control sale could roll right handed descending and he's not giving up a foreign leader is no way and and you know I'm\nI don't want to ... you know I don't want to sound like the typical Boston quote unquote\nBut but you know what ... and it it shouldn't make me enjoy it any more than I Would anyway but the way that you are self we acted when they when he had that whole run after they were did you know they tweeted after they won that that game the Dodgers tweeted damage done hashtags damage done\nAre you kidding me you're down to ... to one and by the literally by the skin of your piece by a max Muncie\nA wall climbing holy run any any Eighteenth ending you win a ball game and you're going to tweet damage done\nYeah damage done damage is done now\nAnd and this and this and and you also helped lead a guy that spent part of the season in the minor leagues a guy that was almost off the team that that made his way back that you want to you want to root for because he's a fun loving guy you can see you know he's he's always whenever with like crazy antics\nBut I mean you want to talk about a bat slip Alex that was ... it was that wasn't a game winning home run I was the fourth inning obviously 'cause we can't act\nSo just ... I hate maternal I don't mind seeing it on the air or anything I I really you know I haven't\nI've only seen somebody get stepped on at first base twice in thirty something years of watching baseball and it happened in the last couple of weeks and by the same guy\nBy the same guy and he took office he's a he's a jerk and I said it was like\nWhen I'm much out it was up in the game is asking you know there's nobody on base and I'm like\nThis guy room with her I'm like a strike it out he doesn't want me to his face was he was swing and miss and even though I say what's on\nI Want to Kelly Adam unlawful thinking Joe ... threat but one of his but one right off his behind you know not not not throwing his hat or anything but\nAnd it and I I Will take everybody back and you'll remember this after ... thing and when they threw around him his tirade on an F bombs about he has no respect for the red Sox any of the any of our fans\nI I'm telling you I don't know if you heard the news over the weekend\nA duty ... is having Tommy John surgery so he will probably miss half of a next year for the Yankees while you're looking at the at the Yankees are next big free agent signing many Machado he doesn't want to play soccer and uh he wants to play shot but I think uh\nYou know the seven to seven digits salary will ah\nWill sweeteners his uh his feelings and I bet yeah he's playing ... New York next year so we can have\nEven more exactly out back and look they are it makes it way more fun and it's going to come down to steal again next year so\nThat if they're going to be right back and even better\nAnd um you know they\nPush us for the better they didn't like\nHow does John ... today too\nI mean I I mean there was a couple of differences in this year's team but Alex Cora took your\nYour team and made them a hundred and eight wins and then they do this and I mean again sometimes it's a different voice is all it takes and John Farrell obviously knows baseball or he wouldn't be where he is and uh he went to where he wants the world he didn't win a World Series by phone or World Series here to somebody\nCame in Alaska so I mean you know so [laughter] you know the one big difference I noticed between feral or got cases still able to relate to it I think also\nPerfectly\nWilling you know going into what John Barrow a nail all excellent land third Morrow bill that way you get used\nTo be mentally and physically theloop if you're going to be the next day to make things all\nDo you you you said it perfectly ... how are you imagine how the narrative on him changed where where you have to a situation where you want rock I'm like I wanted him in these games are one of them in these games then double gods had a career year\nHe was a different guy on to Alex Cora I'm Sandy way own obviously nobody even thought he would be what Sandy lay on as become but he had an excellent yeah I don't care that he didn't ... he had an excellent year calling these games a\nChorus Eddie's probably the best catcher he's ever seen mental assassin or some of the plays I remember one play where I I think they they dropped the button down and scooped it up in time the guy a third\nI don't just some amazing style and Vasquez Vasquez or in his role even though we got her he comes back and has a contribution hits a big home run against the Yankees and the playoffs butterfly hot\nPlace why out another guy that you know the guy on him to be traded didn't feel like you fit in\nWhy on another guy that you know the guy on him to be traded didn't feel like you fit in he ends up playing the Shia having some big hits it was just one guy after another Alex and they have to keep common and Steve when you're going to worry about Jackie Bradley junior Steve passing Eduardo noon you as you got big problems when you play on the red or\nThe other guy the other guys\nAnd just don't stop and and and and then and then this boat and that nobody thought could do it with lights out out to have a great day I Love your call and thanks for listening and enjoy my friend\nKnow if anybody beats that throw but I like to weigh wins speed better than ... thirty five years old I've seen the way when run he can run it\nWas up to ... he was not in the box\nHe didn't even try to slide you didn't try to go around them Iranian right into him\nAnd he could have been allowed to collusion rule because the catchall wasn't in the vice right that's a good ... a third or a third way up that's a good point why he did get them because they cut off thirty or thirty three percent of the running and well\nKen who never saw the field again and I think everybody was happy to see ... and ... luckily that's over with and uh I'm sure you won't be I'm sure there'll be changes obviously as there are with any World Series team\nWhen I when I came in third out I Would have been all brushed that much\nI wanted them to release Jerome some music but I don't hit him I wanted I shut down on the ... I said that too and then I go to Joe don't be like that but you know what when he brought that on himself he keeps stepping on people kicking people ... says I'm not going to hustle\nHe's not a very likeable guy not run ... no he didn't even run in this series World Series guaranteed double ... I don't want to say anything bad about the Roberts but if I were the Robin I Would have them on the game yeah and then you say how can you do that he's one of the best I Know in\nIt and really a serious show that I was watching it and then there'll be dot com bubble was the second time I see\nA new ... he's a big time mom\nHit the catch is in the head with the over swing you know five times and then kept with his hand the catcher on top of that\nWhen I think he's going to be a Yankee next year and uh I just I Know he's not going to be\nGet the minor league contracts I Know he's not going to be here next year Mr um McDonalds so that ...\nI Am thirty million you know I Would give him a minor league contract and until you do not disgraced the game you're not coming back\nI Love you I mean I Love your opinion on that I agree with you and uh we're gonna enjoy this one for a long time my friend\n... as you can analyze this series forever and I've seen a lot of baseball I seen a lot of great teams this is one of them that something about this one I'm telling you well we're ... the the single lasting\nI don't know why I ...

had to everybody we can't forget about a patriot they're playing in Buffalo Monday Night football time to shift our focus and get to our friend William bandits in from patriot maven does such a great job by this guy covering the team and writing and tweeting and I know\nGreat job on this guy covering the team and writing and tweeting and I know he's waiting patiently we've kept them on hold here with all these goals let's get to will right away good morning when you're on the joke show\nAbout Joe good to be on with you and um you know congratulations to the red Sox it was a really a great to say I'm a\nI think even if you're not a big baseball fan and it was a hard not to really like this team for their mental toughness after losing in Eighteen any game friday night and Saturday morning I stayed up to watch all Eighteen is\nOr it might take me a while to recover me too [laughter] than a game or you know being down or nothing and being able to come back I just never gave up and you know it's ISIS eat to live on her all the guys like the fierce Jackie Bradley junior and it's\nNice to a sort of see David Price get that playoff albatross office that puts so well and that's why I don't get into and they're clenching game in game five and he came in and get ready so that was great to save\nAbsolutely um you know it's not to say it like that but it's almost a channel but it was almost the Patriot type team this year was almost a patriot type mentality and of course a couple of times when I was sitting at Fenway Park the season and\nI happened to gaze up to under the owners box where Don ... was sitting and lo and behold it's billed ... jak Tony La Russa and ... and I know the friendship between Tony La Russa and build dollar check and balance ... being a fan of the game that he is and you know Alex ...\nTo a large um degree in ... it's a different sport and he's a different guy but he ... he reminded me a lot of how the patriots do business you saw\nA manager that Tom was able to\nReally get the most out of every one of his players and made 'em decisions that he thought with for the betterment of the team and one of the biggest ones out that was controversial at the time being\nLetting him leave Ramirez go wait a waiting him basically and um you know I just how we manage job over the last couple of months when they had such a sizable lead and everyone was doubting or their ability to do it on the biggest stage\nIt just goes to show you um the strong leadership or that he put for us and not like you said doing it with an unheralded guys congratulations to them and I know a a lot of the patriots some players are you know in coaches were were excited as well as these guys all support each other\nAnd they've got a task or in front of them tonight against buffalo we know why the NFL was wild yesterday a lot a lot of close games a lot of exciting moments in here we are tonight with the patriots\nAgainst the team that's usually a cast plane of stuff you know it's historically will and and they come in tonight I'm you know being on the dog so I Know you're there what are your thoughts on at this point in time going into tonight\nYeah I I mean I think it will be a ball or just because a buffalo is often says historically bad and they're playing their Anderson a quarterback so ill Anderson was out of football until about a month ago you know they only scored ... points last week last thirty seven five so\nI yeah I don't see I mean look buffalo the fences respectable and I think uh you know but a brave he's always had success against them also they liked it so I think Brady will find the holes in the in the ... um you know to complete a lot it passes I mean not having Sony Michel he's out at her ...\nUm you know no ... or so but I Do expect Gronkowski to play and so I think on Gronkowski is from that area is always out of big game up there [noise] so you know those two factors I don't think the patriots are going to have too much trouble scoring on the buffalo defense\nI mean we know up front but I think it's a Williams are very physical\nAnd uh so you know I didn't know you know they'll put up a fight but I just don't see them being able to stop the patriots consistently\nEspecially with the way this office is played last for weeks or they scored at least thirty eight points and all there in in each of those four weeks three times thirty eight exactly and then or the one against the chief so\nI think ah yeah I I wouldn't be surprised if it's a distant margin at half time but\nYou know you never know I mean this is Buffalo's only primetime game the sheer and so the fans will be amped up ands or excited and I think it buffalo or somehow all this upset even if they went for a while to finish the season that somehow look at it as fast so\nIf I was going to really try to give their best game I just think the talent department and they're very limited right they'll\nHave slowly and we'll just looking at um some of the great stuff that you're right I'm On football made in which I encourage everybody a patriot may even just a little ...\nAnd ... slash\nSlash patriots I'm reading about you a preview when I'm reading a bone um you're you're right you're writing about ... and the defense of struggles I wanted to ask you because I got into a discussion about this over the weekend 'cause somebody was ripping the patriots the fence\nOr we had a point now where anybody's playing defense I mean you see these games are obviously you know homes and the Kansas City show that putting all points in bunches are we seeing what the rams can do obviously yesterday against Green Bay I and an hour in Rogers and and you know we have some of these teams that can put up ... points\nSuddenly matter when they did a Dodgers it never blow to for run lead this year could be four times bad for the lead and and they want all fifty four and\nA for Alice quarter to pull the rights strings to have much more than on the bench and shit and then that three ... peers\nAll of a sudden wakes up uh after having a pretty quiet world series it's the home run to tie it next time up to three runs out of the gap or next time up a home run in the first inning of ...\nAnd then for good measure he slams one more\nAnd and still be it'd be worth the price yeah so at that point we're going to get it uh and then on and on you can go you know Joe Kelly ... all five games of the world series the pier six scoreless innings a guy who was almost wiped off the playoff roster for the first round ... struggled so badly in\nIn the second half of the year uh at just true and and Chris Sale a river we ran a quote an interview with us earlier in the ... and they said you know my dream is to be on the mound with two outs in the ninth inning of a of a World Series clincher and and you know if you win the battle you win the world series and\nWho's he facing many Machado public enemy number one and I am saying he should hit him I anti just because of the spike on peers but the only thing better than hitting on strike and having them swim ... at the last page of the world series the look like a fool it was so I mean it's incredible every story line of this thing was almost\nIf it was a Hollywood script you say never months too it's too fantastic it's too ridiculous\nYeah exactly yeah everything you said and I couldn't is echoed more right Jackie Bradley junior turns into Reggie Jackson a you've got Ben intending making\nI mean it drop the playoffs great catches but the one the other night was fantastic ... everybody ... you know J. D. was heard from again last night to with that months the home runs the center field and\nYou know I was talking yesterday that they were able to do all this without needing J. D. to completely carry them and we got as much as we could on ... but\nUh again just like you said I mean\n... that's ... to get Machado a that laser and and making that play um I don't know of pneumonia is with the way his health has been is able to make that play and just to having the right guys in in the right spot at the right time and on the other side of it I Would never say a bad word about Dave Rob it's because of that steel in two thousand four but\nSome of the moves that he made I don't know maybe too much trust and somebody has guys\nEasy to second guess now uh but you know I think that maybe they really felt that they had it after you said like the teen endgame leading obviously also we thought he had it with his reaction with the home run\nYeah not only a little guy early\nNo little early for that kind of a um a celebration I thought um\nAnd and you know Machado not hustling anything out and again uh but but Robert you're right I mean he's I and I ... a year and and will always remember him for two thousand four but he got badly managed uh there's no doubt about that and I thought even\nGame games for he completely messed up the use of the pitching um\nLittle he said he said yesterday with retail are saying uh you know I I wasn't coming out to get him in primitive All right away enemies of all came up to mount hill said I don't know why it's coming out to get me a it just struck out there is a after\nThe walk and so I don't really know why I go to the bullpen there and then\nThey use of the bullpen it was all analytics they go straight with the analytics in Los Angeles and and I think it costs more World Series last two years\nOr at least a chance to win the world series or because you know you've got guys like like Alexander and and and Fabio whatever his name is these guys are in the game with the world series in Japan the balance and and so by as isn't available\nJust overpowering and\nAnd you've got you know you're talking about who's ... who's on the red Sox had three guys up in the bullpen at one point last I'd never seen that my like three hours warming up at the same time after they play an Eighteen inning Chris Sale David Price and and report fellow who started game three came in and said we can take the ball game for\nA ... and that's the difference I think between these two teams are the Dodgers are you had guys saying you know I pitched three nights in a row I Can't pitch tonight [noise] uh I I've gone through the wind up twice I Can't put the third time through ... are you at guys using analytics\nAs a reason why they couldn't continue ah where's the red Sox had a bunch of guys who said numbers be damned give it up all like to get this done absolutely and that's the thing that's going to win nine out of ten times his team that won the world series\nAbsolutely Tom you've been around for all of them and obviously it's like trying to pick a favorite child but where would you rank this in terms of I mean I Know what the number say then they were the greatest\nRegular season Red Sox team to beat both teams that were in the world series last year as part of just run and go through Yankee Stadium late they did go through the Yankees at Yankee Stadium ... around the lake they did where where do you put this or can we even rank them I Know oh for for ... but we're really asking\nFor was was mythical obviously a and and that was was you know after eighty six\nYears [noise] uh but but you know he said is on the air last night with the rice says it's hard to say what the greatest team is the greatest team and then comparing player\nAnd a different era gets ... yeah but ... let's say season\nIs the greatest season a Red Sox history I mean to win a hundreds Nineteen games to in the playoffs or the regular season to beat to one hundred women teams in the post is one of the few teams to ever do that to to be\nYou know as you said the two finalists to pennant winners from last year to win every series on the road to go seven and one on the road in the play offs and the only will\nGive you lost it took the home team ATV things to get rid of you [noise] ah it it's remarkable what this team did I I always used to say that oh that's that that for you know like I said was a mystical ... you know the stuff of legend\nA third team was was kind of a flu what special because it resonated with the city after the Boston Marathon\nRight right um but I used to say seven was the best baseball the ... you know start to finish it I think now I think Eighteen replaces seven ... in that conversation because\nUh there were there was there was no drama a first year manager who came in with essentially the same group a GM president baseball operations who took a lot of heat for not adding a reliever and live on a ... and said we've got arms here that can get this done him and he did you know if all became an\nA and it was a starter but my God Ninety seven pitches in relief unbelievable and they lose that game but tell you what much like Tim Wakefield in game three of two thousand for taking the ball when they were getting abolished by the Yankees\nYes giving up his start so that the bullpen could be in some kind of semblance of order for the rest of the series if he does that last night it they didn't get that out of him in game three that bullpen is in tatters yep uh for games four and five but instead they could patch it together and when that ...\nUnbelievable and just you know we we don't want to look ahead but it is that a guy that you think the red Sox should should try to nail down I mean after this performance um after two Tommy John it these pitching right now obviously the best he's ever pitched in August\nAnd after two Tommy John it these pitching right now obviously the best he's ever pitched in uh it's gonna be interesting to see if they if they tried to gloating and get this guy back\nYeah it is starting to look ahead and it's still a little bit early to do that like you know I still got close at like champagne here\nYou know we don't want to do that fine but no I mean that's all part of it you know it begins with\nA back into the bullpen Kimble and Kelly a free agents ah I don't know that the red Sox spend the money to keep either here if either wants to come back I I don't think Kelly has a lot of interest now that he pitched that while I'm guessing you'd rather go back to the west\nCoast where he's from ... about we'll see about that carries up a special bond with the city because the hospitals and then the medical staff that other people who worked with his daughter last year\nUm that says listen he was shaking the playoff yeah and if he's going to get me here closing money I'm not sure it's going to come from Boston so you you got some questions um I like\nYour appraiser I like more and more yeah or could you bring him back with the idea of potentially being a low budget star closer and then maybe you go get a guy like that Britain ... uh or somebody who might be a little less give you a little bit insurance some\nThat's on the back on the back in on this starting\nRotation hum you bring up if all the I'd love to get him back how much money he going to get\nA free agent mark now yeah now\nAnd and this is the whole conversation for another day but that was one of the strangest David Price press conferences I've ever seen it already buddy after winning the world\nSeries or you know he had wonderful thing to say and he got emotional when talking about his teammates you know this whole I Hope the cards yeah uh and and watch the end of the media after winning the world series or tells me there's still some real issues there absolutely and and if he didn't see it in the middle of the night he\nTweets out I hold the cards with a political\nYeah ... yeah with the yeah I Know you've got five\nDays to opt out of that contract is why I Would have said when he threw that last pitch I Would have said there is zero chance he's opting out of the contract with watching that press conference at the looking at this\nWeek uh there's a tear the house side of that for a contract there is a contract then the next call you got to make the hall absolutely that was ... I don't know you can't afford to keep them all ... up but if you're losing somebody if you lose the price you get pneumonia you got to make it out of luck because all the deck and then here\nIt's no knowledge ready and not have a big game tonight\nI Hope so well thank you for being such a great sport today and call and you're holding on and uh we'll look forward to the game tonight and we'll talk to you soon amount of time for today but I appreciate your joining me\nStill brings to move on with your good stuff good stuff my friend talk to you so I Know\nThat said\nToday we went over time you got to pay for the ... coming up next\nWe can go over by a second where world champions talked on friday\nEverybody\nPatriot\nIvan people were killed and six others were wounded as some blame politicians including President Trump for fueling recent violence and hate crimes Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway says in the attacks in the White House that aren't helping to unify the nation as President Trump has been calling for\nA kind of rhetoric at a time of day in and day out about this White House people who work here at the time as I pass on their Family Guy stop\nPolice in ... he was North Carolina say a student who was shot by a fellow student at a high school this morning's in critical condition and the shooters now in custody and you're listening to USA radio news\nWhether you need flowers for joy for sad occasion\nPark square and forest is a full service flour and gift shop we are beautiful and creative fresh floral arrangements for any occasion for more than Thirty years ... square forest has been serving one soccer and the surrounding communities with our creative and unique floral arrangements that really stand out in any setting\nWe pride ourselves on our good name and reputation in the business ... wherever forest knows when you're looking for because we listen to your place your order\nThat moral one seven six six twenty to thirty two for a visit our website ... dot\nCom or something by Thirteen hundred market eminent went on soccer and while you're at Tahrir Square Boris visit on Asia home of the famous breed and herbal infused money to open sinuses in minutes see all of our\nProducts to keep you healthy\nAt ... dot com rapper Kanye West is encouraging black voters to leave the Democratic party designing his own line of had insurance supporting ... short for black exit it's a campaign that urges African Americans to break away from the political party to\nAs he says find freedom over tyranny\nUnless items launched the turning point USA's young black leadership summit in Washington over the weekend\nThat first year major league baseball manager Alex ... after his Boston Red Sox become the twenty Eighteen World Series champions defeat in ...\nCertain Red Sox become the twenty Eighteen World Series champions defeating the LA Dodgers by one last night in game five the Dodgers ... de Roberts spoke about his team I Can't say I'm\nOur book club despite our guys start together stay the course and believed to one another\nPut ourselves in a church where a championship\nAnd this is usa radio news\nAfter sold off concert last year to Rhode Island I'm an artist or return the same thing I think ...

the just as an example now Nelly go here\nI'm just going to ... an example born January first Nineteen Seventy a boom boom boom and then you see the same name and birthday in Massachusetts in Connecticut or in Providence in Cranston in protected but if you just see the name\nNelly go a beer and you don't have the birth date it's tough to match up that that's the same person\nGoing on courses that's according to the Providence Journal go be a quietly change what is the nation is available to the public in the states central voter registration system without public notice or public hearing\nOr be deleted the month and day from the date of birth supply to the public in response to request for the voting laws on this quarter less ... asserted it is clear\nNelly go be a exceeded her authority and violated the public trust Nelly needs to reveal immediately what other changes made by her or her office in secret\nWithout public notice or public hearing he said furthermore this is there to do with acting as a deterrent to a dentist by two identity theft is is about making it harder to crushed crushed check the voter rolls\nQuarter lesser concludes the secretary said I Will ensure full transparency and disclosure regarding a sacred voting process folks that he is exactly right\nThere was no question about it and can block was speaking about this again what should make you uncomfortable\nAnd again this is I Believe this is a nonpartisan issue and what do I mean by that I don't care if you're a Republican Democrat\nReform party moderate party independent whatever front page of the Providence Journal birth dates cut from public voter base secretary state change was to deter identity theft I don't believe that\nAs they write two summers ago secretary state Nellie go be a quietly changed one information is available to the public in the states central voter registration system how is that possible if she was doing everything above board why did she secretly changing\nThe Providence Journal now this is not opinion they write Paul ed wood Parker without public notice or public hearing\nWill be deleted the month and day from the date of birth supplied to the public in response to request for the voting list it's right there folks again I Want a repeat you may not be aware of it\nI eat their folks again I Want to repeat\nYou may not be aware of it but she sends out press releases all the time they have a fence and press conferences all the time if this was if she was not trying to hide this why when she sent out a press release secretary's day good beer in an effort to deter identity theft\nDeletes if this was such a great thing she was doing why was she silent on that question what we do we know the answer to that she didn't think she was going to get caught question to if she made this change and it's very significant\nWithout public notice a public hearing it's certainly begs the question\nWhat other changes has she or her office made without public notice a public hearing I Want to repeat folks think of this Nelly gonna be the secretary state controls the voting\nShe is against voter id she has completely circumvented the law as far as emergency boating it's really early voting but she calls that emergency voting\nSo in the course of a month\nShe sends out all these BS press releases and stuff that don't matter to anything she's always putting out information everything are up as does we did this we did that we made this easy we did that she does something very very significant\nWhich is the cut the the the date of birth from the public voted database and his silent about why why do you think that is there's only one explanation she didn't want anyone to know now the question is what else has she done\nWhat else is she done that we don't know about and pack quarter less is exactly right she completely absolutely completely went above and beyond\nWhat she is allowed to do with her office she completely exceeded her authority and violated the public trust now\nJust for a moment I Want you to think of whenever and these are sad but many times you'll hear about a city or town sometimes the church whatever what have you that someone has in fact been embezzling right that they'd been embezzling\nAnd it always starts off\nOr maybe it's the church secretary or some of the city or town or whatever it may be it always starts off that they did it once and they didn't get caught\nAnd then it led to inspire allowed in the next thing you know is you know a soldier so and she's been found that they did an investigation she embezzled whatever it may be two hundred thousand three hundred thousand whatever the number as\nWell my question and the question that needs to be raised and more importantly the question the secretary of state Nellie go be a\nNeeds to answer is what other changes and things has she done through her office\nWithout notifying anyone other I highly doubt this was the only thing the question is what else has she done that is very significant it is beyond comprehension this was not done in an effort to try to protect voter identity because if that was truly the case number one\nThere were so many other platforms where you can get that information number two if she was truly doing something as a public service\nShe would have released a press release saying that she would have called a press conference to announce it she would be touting it as one of the things that she has done in why she should be reelected why didn't she noted any ... fire in a while but because she didn't want anyone to know about it\nThat is a huge part that is the equation but this the question remains what else has she done\nSo packed caught a lesser wisely has raise that question and he is exactly right she does need to come forward what other things she doesn't know we don't know about and folks completely she does not have the power of her office to\nPull off something like that on top of that\nAlright seven six six Thirteen eighty seven six six Thirteen aid you can email me John at ... at the beach are dot com hey I Want to remind you when your appliances dying just call Brian\nI Believe will be represented Patricia Morgan that jumped on board with the folks I studied this I interviewed the possible candidates there was a Republican primary Cranston mayor Allen Fong won the primary there were some people just saying I don't like either choice of ... listen\nI Am telling you\nWe cannot afford you cannot afford four more years of governor among do if you think things are bad now wait to see what is going to happen\nAfter four more years of Raimondo if we get for more\nOr more years of Raimondo if we get four more years of Raimondo wait to see the things that she is going to be put in motion\nSo that ... the fact that they are pushing this type of thing shows the Raimondo people's strategy their strategy is very clear they want to boost up and don't be foolish enough to fall for it if you are a Trump supporter\nThey want to trick you into thinking all Trump supporters should vote for Joe ... do not fall for that folks do not fall for it\nThis race and we're going to find out tonight at five o'clock\nThis race by any stretch of the imagination has come down to two candidates Cranston mayor Allen phone and governor Gina Raimondo turn on the news you see those Caribbean people you see them in Mexico yes who wants to welcome them endured island mayor phone\nSays I Will not allow a sanctuary state governor ... want to bring them in\nGovernment wants to raise taxes governor among do does it even plan on being here once she is reelected she's going to hit the campaign trail she's got a free shot to go to president of the United states\nGovernor him under under governor ... it has been one disaster after another\nYou want to talk about the reign of error that I call it under governor among do\nOver twenty children dead under state here in D.C YIF\nNow she cares more about those Caribbean people those illegals\nTrying a bum rush their way into our country and I want to be very clear I Am against those Caribbean people I don't care Mexico has offered them asylum and they are refusing asylum\nTo stay in Mexico what did they say I Want to come to the United states a huge portion\nOf the Caribbean people are from Guatemala\nThe largest Guatemalan population in the United states is in Providence Rhode Island because the mayor ... so you're going to go to the ballot box\nIt is between Gina Raimondo and it is between ... I Am telling you right now I Am supporting Cranston mayor Allen fun they you'll hip disaster which is still not fixed six hundred million dollar mistake\nD.C why uh over twenty children dead in her care Gina Raimondo with her Chris chorus or a crossing the country\nCrisscrossing the country fundraising she's more concerned about raising money for herself in raising her profile\nThan those twenty children that died under here here in D.C Wyeth how about the one Ninety five fiasco we're going to re route every body right right in late August and September and we're going to build one Ninety five\nAnd instead what they do they and suddenly had to pull the plug on the whole thing that was another disaster who's a reason for that tolls on the road the city of Providence is a mess\nUnder construction nordstroms leaving paw socks leaving Benny closed we don't even have to go back to the cooler in warmer she is about one product and it's not you she wants to raise taxes she wants to go forward with her progressive agenda\nAnd she wants to welcome the Caribbean people\nAnd on top of that\nShe wants to give drivers licenses to illegals that are in our state in order for them to stay here governor ... wants to continue to run a sanctuary state\nSo the choice is yours but I can tell you that President Trump this this election is down to two viable candidates Joe ... I had Joe ... many times I had Joe ... for the at one point\nJoe ... has decided to run an independent ... a campaign and regardless of reasons it has failed to catch on this race is now down to two candidates the polls show that a poll tonight I think well confirmed that once again\nSo if this was thirty thirty thirty right or somewhere in there well then it's a different argument I've known Joe trailer for Fifteen Years there was no stretch of imagination that he has a path to victory\nThis race has come down to two candidates I Am telling you I Am not voting for governor Gina Raimondo I Believe she will go down and you can disagree with me at seven six six Thirteen eighty I think she will go down as one of the worst governors we've ever had\nI Am supporting Cranston mayor Allen fun if you think Rhode Island is bad no wait to see what she does when she she's not even going to be here she's going to be in Iowa in New Hampshire campaigning she's going to be signing legislation executive orders\nIn order to boost her run for president and more fundraising and more travel she doesn't care she's term limited out things that things are bad now we do see what it's like four years from now seven six six Thirteen eighty let's go to the phones\nGr morning Europe on the John ... show hello\nHi John County Community\nYeah Hi there ...\nRunning through the ... of um tennis dream team I Would call them I think a lot of people aren't aware of us attorney Rona turning our own among forty other U.S attorneys fired from his job so that natural progression in Rhode Island as he will be I Know attorney general he's running virtually uncontested\nHe'll be supporting marijuana and the investments on the tax revenue from it also made it that was on Dallas entail beyond the podium and I think he clearly stated that he will be taking no action regarding illegal immigrants and he has made a clear statement\nTo go local frog and the alliance that he will not investigating the guy's a sexual abuse allegations [noise]\nDo you want to keep going he he I don't even think heroin he he's running unopposed running unemployed I ...

the Providence Journal today what does it have to do with the secretary of state's race\nSaturday's paper huge headline and it's about time in the media needs to jump on this story because there are a lot of unanswered questions what else is gonna be a hiding\nChanges from the secretary of state's office to quote Paul ed wood Parker two summers ago secretary state Nellie go be a quietly changed quietly one information is available to the public in the states central voter registration system without public notice a public hearing\nWill be deleted the month and day from the date of birth applied to the public in response to requests for the voting lists\nFull dates of birth can be key to independent investigations how accurately or beer is maintaining the state's voting lists\nFull dates of birth facilitate computerized searches for voters who may be registered in more than one municipality may be registered him more than one state or may have died\nThe accuracy of Rhode Island's voting list has been called into question into recent election years wondering ... term and one before she was elected\nIn twenty sixteen the state bless was found bin bloated one hundred eighty thousand more registered voters than the U.S census record suggests the state should have had\nHow 'bout that folks one hundred eighty thousand over\nSo the person who is calling her out on it in the part about this that I think is so key\nIs going to be it did this not thinking she was going to get caught without public notice a public hearing\nTo protect\nA voters from identity theft if she was doing something that was truly in the best interests of the public why didn't she release a statement saying just that instead\nWith all the different press releases in all the announcements that come out of her office um she never made mention of this and the fact of the matter is because she did this\nAnd seemingly did absorb the the power for office without public notice without public hearing she did something very significant\nThis could have a drug dramatic impact\nOn this election it's going to take place next Tuesday and it's going to be very difficult to crush should voter rolls in order to determine that this is an election that's being you know done with integrity other than that\nAgain I think you're right to point out she needs the answer what other things or moves or changes have she made with her office there weren't aware of because it seems that the journal kind of stumbled into this and then they contacted her and contacted you\nBut my question is I I I Would tend to doubt this is the only thing that she has done\nAnd so now it's it's like uncovering Iraq is this the tip of the iceberg uh what other things as secretary of state Nellie go be a done that is going to make it very difficult to check voter rolls do I while I even up on the phone and folks again I'm going to let them go just a moment but it's pack quarter less up Republican candidate\nFor secretary of state and um he's on the line with us and pat ah everyone sees on the news and it's only going to get closer as we get closer to election day next Tuesday your opponent secretary's day ...\nNot only does she want to give drivers licenses to people who are in the country illegally not only does she want to uh allow illegal to vote\nShe will often point to the fact she'll say oh it's right here that anyone that signs up to vote who is it legal to do it faces penalty of perjury\nOr in it's against the law and so forth she's never answered the question how many people I've ever been prosecuted for that because the truth is we don't have the resources and no one has ever been prosecuted for falsely um [noise]\nYou know a signing up to vote illegally but here's my question few Nelly go be a feels Rhode Island should welcome those people in the Caribbean with open arms and she is more than a open to the idea of them resettling Fifteen thousand strong\nAs we were watching the march up towards the American ...\nStrong as we were watching the march up towards the American border that she feels Rhode Island should have them settle in Rhode Island we're just pack Cornel West to stand on this\n... or less chance he will be standing right at the border line with the state police troopers and ensure that it would not allow it allowed in Rhode Island number one number two\nNo financial aid from Rhode Island taxpayers will get a legal and that's the bottom line ... ... we're going to draw the line I understand financially we've had\nA ... worth of too hot for through horrible I'm hearing your shoes I quote a lesser believes in local knock off your shoes which helped Rhode islanders not people who don't live in the country\nAll right well John Barry is secretary said nice a good job pack quarter lesser calling for some answers\nAgainst secretary of state ... folks seven six six Thirteen eighty seven six six Thirteen eighty good afternoon you're next on the job to be true show hello\nJohn advice from the past\nTheory as our friend Terry Gorman how you do with Terry I'm doing Okay John I just want to hear your voice you believe what she's pulling on this whole thing\nGod I I don't understand it at all that one of the other things that I don't understand and I was on for like an hour today looking at the U.S CIS website\nUh she added bilingual ballots in one socket now why do they have bilingual ballots and when socket and if the truth be known why do they have bilingual ballots period because what it says on that website and I put it on Facebook\nIs that you have to be able to read write understand basic English in order to become a citizen\nOf cheese to think of how she is ... the whole thing Terry\nYeah yeah I mean why is what's going on with us I don't how do they just do these things John and we know we know there's so many things going on that are against the law\nAnd we just ... years continue to let them happen no you you speak up I speak up the\nYou know several other people speak up but not enough and and they just laugh at us they just laugh at us it's it's just it's a crime it's a definite crime I don't understand ... we're we're going I think I told you a while ago probably three years ago\nThat I think Rhode Island's going to be come the first bilingual state in the country\nAll I can tell you then Harry if governor ... is elected she wants to enact\nSome of the most progressive policies that you've ever seen or that the country will ever see she would like to point see Rhode Island is the most progressive but again Terry I just let me just read this too I mean this is directly onto the Providence Journal this is not\nYou know someone running a press release this is the word the journal reporter Paul Edward partner this is his depiction of what happened\nTwo summers ago twenty sixty secretary ... quietly changed what information is available to the public in the central voter registration system without public notice what public hearing\nWill be no legally be deleted the month indeed from the dino brew supply to the public\nIn response to request for the voting was\nFull dates of birth can be key\nTo investigations on how accurate the league would be is maintaining\nThe seats voting list fooling dates of birth facility computerized searches for voters who may be registered in more than one municipality maybe rich to him more than once the war may have died the accuracy of the voting lists has been called into question\nBecause in twenty sixteen we found out that the voting was was bloated my one hundred and eighty thousand more registered voters the ... census suggested the state should have\nWhat is incredible about history again\nShe has a full time press office she's always holding a press conferences she's always sending out press releases if she was doing something they she truly felt was in the benefit of the public what why did she hide this information\nYeah I Know I Know I don't know what else did she hiding John you know when you said about the voter fraud it just because it hasn't been prosecuted that Robin can do he swept everything under the rug for how many years was he the head of the board of elections\nI mean it's it they you know they deny that to do and they they did either the fellow showed up\nWith eleven hundred remember the eleven hundred of mail in ballot yes yes [laughter] what what did they think or does he think we're all just stupid yes they do and what was what am I Do become a progressive you know something that scary\nI I watched newsmakers over the weekend yep\nPainted and Rona with faith was on they're basically saying he's not going to do anything about illegal aliens the law enforcement it's not their job is the federal government's job to enforce immigration laws and I mean I was so disappointed in that I mean I I still\nHave to watch that I did not see that but I that is very disappointing to hear\nOh yeah yeah it is it's terrible you know I I don't it just ... everything's becoming mind boggling to me John I don't know where to turn anymore at every place you could look that abusing us\nAnd nothing's happening you know this this thing down on the border now what are they going to do with it I just read that this the Senate five thousand additional troops that eight hundred\nFive thousand additional troops to the border and the wall Street Journal [noise] no no that that's like one person for every person in a caravan of ... thousand to eclipse\nVia caravan and the top of that Terry how about the fact\nMexico is offering them asylum to stay in Mexico and they say no we want to go to America\nExactly exactly they left they are that are just asylum John they off of asylum medical care and jobs in Mexico and the and that that I think they said\nA hundred and ten people took the offer and the rest of them said no we're going to where we can tell you what a trip to the United states yep I I think what what they said one of the articles in the in the wall Street Journal said that the uh the troops are going to be used to build tents down there to how these people and stuff\nOr what I think they should do is they should when they arrive they should be a marine or of a U.S soldier handing them a tent and say and go put your tent up on the other side\nYeah you should know you should not be allowed in the country period that's where they make the mystique should not be allowed in period then I think women seeking asylum it's in a manner of asylum we we can't take them in they don't belong here the mistake is when you let them in and then you can never find them\nTreating Republican voters like idiots if you're a Republican voter and you're going to vote patrol she thinks you're an idiot\nShe thinks we're going to confuse them them more on ...\nAnd we're going to make them think that Trump is with troll oh so that's why we're going to mail it out Gina Raimondo is in no way threatened by Joe ... she's doing that\nTo help joke trauma and try to boost up his numbers\nBecause they have to figure it out and the ... eats out that way if Joe trailer we're not in this race it'd be a completely different race if Joe ... not in this race that I Want you to stay on this people on Facebook Live or other people that are undecided and everything else it's true Douglas hotel are not going to work while we'll say go get a thank you\nUm it is true unbelievable all told the instrument story later there was someone impersonating Instagram\nSo it just happens I mean there's nothing to do but then you have to contact Instagram the problem with Instagram Google Facebook Twitter you can never get anybody on the phone taken anybody in the phone everything has to be three now so I contact Instagram\nThat there was somebody impersonating the on Instagram and what did they do they deleted and disabled my account no you idiots if the other one it's the you delete it the wrong account so we'll see how that handles but anyhow\n[noise] if if Joe Miller would not in this race this would have been a completely different race and you just can't ignore that\nBecause we would've seen polls that would have shown mayor ... neck and neck and ... would have had to go out more and on top of that we could have seen a poll that showed mayor Fong in the lead what does that mean it means fundraising money ... rolls and\nAnd beans Romano asked to scramble to try to adapt to that it means she may have she probably would have had to debate him more because she's afraid to debate him one on one if it was just the two of them if it was just following against Raimondo hurt people knew she was not going to get reelected\nSo because this would've been a different race would have gotten probably got more national attention in a big thing is if they would've been a poll that would've showed mayor ... in the lead then you really start to see fund raising money come flying in there is no way to ignore so far\nThe true low factor that is played into this race which is since the primary\nAnd we'll talk about this with Justin cats coming up a one but it it is true it has been a distraction and mayor ... has been fighting to friends you can't ignore I'm not saying uh you you can't ignore when someone is attacking you every day and taking from your base now\nThat said they had been other instances where something like this as I've mentioned in the past have happened in in Nineteen Ninety eight\nJim Bennett was running for general treasure against pulse of ours and this guy Victor Moffett\nWho was a you know it's interesting who is he backed by Arlene violent the reform party I think they called themselves he ran and he basically pulled away from Bennett and Paul ... became the general treasure\nSo and then look at how Arlene violent now for whatever reason has been backing Troeh in this race\nThere is no way to get away from the fact that ... has played a factor now I don't know if a week from Tuesday how much of a factor he's going to be channel twelve has a poll coming out tonight and we'll get an idea of just where he is if he is at five percent\nHe's not going to play the factor that maybe they thought he was going to play 'em this whole thing with Bob Healy Bob Healy yes God rest clues he did get twenty two percent he had run before he runs statewide for governor twice he had run for lieutenant governor Bob\nHe captured he won\nBristol in war and in twenty fourteen he became the protest vote against the field and so this time around\nIf you if this were governor among do against Cranston mayor Allen Fung there's no other way to describe it would've been\nA far different race in twenty ten can block was on the ticket he was trying to establish the moderate party and he did that\nHe got more than six percent of the boat and then the party became established but can block then left the moderate party and he ran in a Republican primary against my earphones Patricia Morgan reentered Republican primary against ... she lost\nShe should have done the right thing and just endorsed mayor ... and then she just couldn't laid low Matt Brown Matt Brown announced initially he was running as an independent will someone got to map around\nAnd said you want to run front but you have to run in the Democratic primary you have to he would have taken votes away from governor Mondale they'd dodged the bullet with that\nBut you have not heard from ... since then the next day he endorsed Gina Raimondo and that was the last year in the background and that does happen sometimes but you can't pull away from the fact that ... if anything has been a distraction but I'm\nThe fact each one thing you know I'm running to win okay he ... a path to victory I've known Joe you take him at his word okay he sees a path to victory wants to run he's going to run but when he told the Providence Journal I don't care if I just get two percent as long as I stopped\nWhen he told the Providence Journal I don't care if I just get two percent as long as I stopped falling from becoming governor that was eye opening and the other thing that was I opening was these expensive mailers that gene or a Monday when the Democrat Party or sending out on behalf to support and help Joe ...\nSo I I mean that is over the top and you know what's really insulting folks is there's no other way to to get away from it I mean they think they do they think you're stupid they think I'm stupid for them to think that we're all just going to fall for that\nI Would hope that any Republican voter out there is that gonna fall for that and it says right on the mail or if you support President Trump vote for Joe ... I mean but it was sent by the Democrat Party it's all done to try to help him during the primary governor I'm under was trying to help Patricia Morgan\nShe even ah Patricia Morgan was having some trouble getting their message out\nAnd governor ... got into a fake Twitter war saying but just from Oregon we all know you got an a plus from the n._r._a. I mean that was a\nThat was all done to then just try to help Patricia Morgan\nIn in in what does it tell you if you are a trailer supporter and there are people out there whatever reason I voted for George Will will just just know that Gina Raimondo ... there's no other way to describe it she's trying to help jokes are low\nThere's no other evidence if he was ahead of her a closer that'd be totally different but there's no way that is a beautiful mailer they set out not only one to those are expensive she is sending out mailers to help Joe ... what does that tell you tell you she still afraid of mayor ...\nAnd now they're attacking me because I've been to try to help and promote mayor ... that I've said from day one this is all about who ever since the best chance of defeating governor among do period seven six six Thirteen\nEighty good afternoon you're next on the agenda future show hello\nEither can you please take us on speaker phone All right we are speaker phone okay go right ahead\nSo\nWhile I uh the the way to when you need to turn on your radio a little bit or maybe it's an echo but it all depends here's my question for you do you want flew more years of Gina Raimondo\nYou do not so that's a no than the answer is devoted ... just simple as that\nJust simple as that so listen and even at that some people right let's just say some people for whatever reason don't might create Marilyn fun well it's kind of like when you ask used to have to take medicine that didn't taste good but it was going to get rid of the germ or the illness [laughter]\nI mean that's what it comes down to so right now and we will see the pulse ... five o'clock\nIf someone can prove to me this is not a two person race I'm open to that but I see no evidence of that so folks that is the question but I Believe in the next week they do have a debate coming up on Thursday night\nAnd I don't know about governor among do it or get out the vote effort which I Know is massive and very strong but the the real fact of the matter is and that is\nThat right now you have to decide voters have to decide if you want to reward governor Gina Raimondo with four more years\nThen you can either vote for her or vote for Joe ... period those are the options I see no other option that guy from the moderate party is a wasted vote there are people saying they're not going to vote you know what ... doesn't want you to vote that don't vote\nBut then just adapt to what it's gonna be like\nFour years under governor among do and I'll go back to twenty ten I think that was a fluke election\nAnd no one knew just how bad shape he was going to be governor Gump he just wasn't bad he was the worst governor but if you feel right now at twelve forty nine on this Monday if you feel

he's got the\n... you know the numbers are also things could change our lecture that and but sometimes it's good to move things around people I can say they get a ... they they don't want to leave this position and you're only allowed to leave as if they get voted out that they will leave on their own telling a politician tell me that\nI'm leaving on my own yeah there may be one or two but basically they they either have to be voted out of all a saver leave on their own especially if you become a mayor or governor you go from one pushed jobs and the other I Want to deal with China governor now I Want to do this now and that they can't live without it\nYou know so a guy like Allison good breath of fresh air you know we just business minded person has a lot of experience\nIn the area real estate and obviously that's one of the big issues in this in a depressed city there's a lot of real estate to move up days or whatever to you know\nAnd uh so you know but the reality is that people vote for who they like I mean it doesn't ... it just you like him or not you like her or not that's how they voted in the city that's it I Love you may\nThat's it it does nothing to do he couldn't he could have a [noise] that he could have done something that wasn't good but the fact is it it won't matter because they like our they're going to vote for the ... that's ... I never I you know that's that's the law and voting I mean that's how people won't emotionally yelling at you know\nIf it gets to ... ...\nRight [laughter] you're not running for free choice [laughter] but you know so yeah good luck out because they say I spent a lot of its own time evolved and all this craziness to help a city that is not to do with the world's going down the two so I mean you're just living in an inner city like yeah you know\nIt's almost not control of all I mean the Caribbean it's coming right I mean they just come and it's like an invading army is it's so ridiculous I Can't believe it it's almost it's like surreal\nYou know she sent me to call them hung up all oh he's lucky if she's lucky to run an ad calling her having her lemon tree\n[laughter] even\nIf he is but it's one of the worst grandfather's in the world are just you\nJust me okay so you know the words right okay now you don't want to\nSay that but I was thinking that so I figured\nYou know where to go to the central\nI got no idea because I don't read the papers\n[laughter] I'm ... I'm a ... [laughter] yeah well I I Try to do is\nNot pay attention to all the noise\nFrom Richard found consummate Simon my friend I Know how to build a movement young [laughter] I Know\nI Know how to build a movement you know\nI Know I I don't know my God I don't I meant humor just something of this and it's so bizarre that I that's why I have nothing to do with Facebook or whatever I have two or three friends in my family and that's it because the rest of it could be up or down I'm like a bit wild I Hope we can see what happens\nYou know I ... and so you're right you yes or no I couldn't believe kind them what you were in ... when you discuss this with one time I was like no it was what I was completely off God\nOh you're in the ... the bigger ones beyond you're going to die and she'll be\nA horrible that oh\nI'm On my own for [laughter] for more CEO the sport and offered [laughter] he was on my show it's only been on a hundred times [laughter]\nOh good [laughter] oh boy moment I mean\nThat you know it but like I say area as I could I don't know yeah you're right it just it doesn't even make sense that you know he always told them something happened and I are ruining about it so\nI don't know what happened because let me tell you something a demand for corn and he's also\nYou know like I say I didn't I encourage you to tell me everything because there's a you know way but I'm sure that it's very serious and some of them making some kind of accusations\nOf you know to me is not something serious like that I I you know ... ... I'd have to you know really just think like what am I doing calm just shut down for a minute you know because that could be something that would make me very angry [laughter]\nOh ... ... ... ... ... am I going to\nMake up a story and saying oh this person did this or that if I did okay no problem but if they just get sent some kind of saw a over the radio\nOr something you know that's that's not good that's not good and I don't know that situation you referred to a one time and I was like what\nYou're talking about because I remember I call them that they are the good guy and then oh yeah that guy is Jim and so I tried to slip away from that conversation because I didn't know anything about it\nWas known you for a long time John ... says on so as well so why don't let's play politicians who knows your I gave them all and end to airtime right L U\nL could you know the number one number comfortable to show them no no no\nBut I don't know because it was a member of the member there was an alleged issue we for what he uh what do they call it the secret service\nYou don't want to present a shade or something so I Want to be careful because they were concerned that you had a\nBand of a mind that might be more concerned about angry violent might happen right I mean you ... you know the president or something right but the bottom line is that so you don't know those are the guys who lives in these guys are doing all these things now they just go walk one day gone\nWell here's my advice if there were a hundred of us thirty of us in a room and some of ... go after them ten of us like a dog on the other ten or Fifteen that they will ...\nWill believe from limb to lead is really the Vietnam War veteran or why you served six years up above ... mainstream\nBox [laughter] ...

I Would always reach for the frozen in the frozen food department\nBut the mushy I don't\nCare what you want to be literal through through ...\nNo well once you open the can you ... and it's not very pike showing the actual blueberry\nOkay and um it must be friends with them\nAre pretty expensive ... can they are they're quite expensive but I only it was a few on the waffles but at any rate and\nListen I had a short hair cut probably from most of my life with the exception of a few years and when my hair with long uh most of the time I worked in a ponytail and\nWith my nose ... not the best look for me um and it got to the point where I was tired of blow drying and teasing and all of that I I've got pictures of myself with long hair and\nUm I mean I I looked pretty good I thought well of course I was I was fifty is hunger [laughter] I Hope I looked a little better than I Do now but I wear my hair short but\nHe's got Republicans working against him so when you have that it's very difficult to overcome that [noise]\nBut I'm not a big Gina Raimondo fan I don't think she should have put the truck than [noise] um I haven't forgotten about that and we had a few people\nThe when the socket delegation who took a big hit because they opposed um they oppose that\nAnd I think Bob Phillips was one and I think the Senate to pick I might have been another I I don't remember exactly but a rep Philips I Know it took a hit on that [noise]\nSo I Hope he makes it again I'm he will be a Democrat that I'm voting for\nAnd send it to God [noise]\nSo anyway that's my steel

talk with a swimming pool or some ...\nBut nevertheless two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is what this thing is estimated some maintenance after the the uh the rent and we got to maintain it for five years it's gone it's kind of tax cuts and tax payers two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year\nI think now that John I think this is the year the last year\n[noise] let's talk about the volt school all we had to take that that was a must we had to have we had to obtain the whole school well fight mayors before her refused because it was too costly\nLet the state maintained a stay at all to now this thing is in disrepair who's paying the bills to repair way out the taxpayer\nEight hundred thousand just for mold that just the beginning [laughter]\nJust the beginning of that problems that that's a tipping the ice for just a bowl you you don't think that those costs you more money as time goes on us it well\nI mean this is all taxpayer money gone right down to ... she hadn't taken social box social Fox is not going to disappear and taking the vote school that wasn't going to the ... we took on some hefty payments that's going to cost the taxpayers ... they've all the way forward them\nYou're going to take over the social part to where it was not take the three million take less money to improve some of the things needed telling them you know and also make the deal that they didn't they they would pay some of the main thing that's going to survive is going to put the same deal together she did that the sticking up we'll pump things you know one\nYeah I remember when we talk over the volt skull and judging stood out there and said wow this ... point one and repay us\nAnd then said they shouldn't repaired before we take issue do all the repairs have in good condition otherwise we shouldn't take it and nobody ever ate or do they put a throw it away they didn't do the repairs when we all ... that's right it should have listened to off and let them let that the state repair it before we talk\nTo him was running the money right on the money and nobody less right on the money\nYou know you've got to think ahead you got to think about your your distress town city is just got a receivership\nYou can't spend money like drunk and say oh there's this thing about taxes the up there was in the paper she suddenly ... way way up\nAnd the last three years with chocolate thirty or thirty four percent and tax cut our taxes that much in the last three years or five years right when the when they get that much of a tax reduction\nWell let me ask you a question every ... the council kept cutting the taxes also\nRight on I ... I don't\nI don't think she gave us that much of a tax stuff one year we had twelve percent but we lost five percent of single families lost five percent of all set so now you're take five percent from twelve you've got seven\nAnd that was the heavy if I remember right near the years I was told three percent something like that maybe four percent and five years I don't think we've taken the thirty four percent tax them\nIf we have to solve the log in my tax bill said but it had the same hasn't gone down hasn't gone up\nFirst of all if you want to be coming out of his discuss city you're going to lower to put the the basement of the attacks on living on businesses\nAnd when I finally not oh and I'm doing okay now when we paid off the last uh two point five million dollars for the supplemental bon was lumped into budget exactly that money should have been transferred into the pension bond\nSort of gone some way to help the people that say oh\nThat's right it it it would have not changed that freight but we will be putting by now that's a fine ... how many years of that ... that we would have to point five for five years that'd be a I'm On a ... million dollars it'd be in the pension bond that could be invested\nBecause when I think blows up we're going to get killed in a city\nThat just like this budget we had this year\nDe Vito ... the council's bunch you know for the council of the budget included three flash girls she did her budget then she went into the general fund and bought three police gross drove fact\nThanks for that seven hundred thousand dollars

for the kids\nFifty eight degrees clear skies sunny skies a little bit of a breeze with ten mile an hour winds but we're only going to get an overnight law around fifty two degrees\nThat's great for trick or treat time figure will take a look at six o'clock it's going to be in the mid fifties right around fifty five not too shabby a slight chance for where they were keeping an eye around nine o'clock to see what's gonna happen there right now we're only seeing like maybe twenty percent chance of a light showers but not much accumulation just some sprinkles\nWe're going to make that go away so we give these kids are nice Halloween\nAnd the weather forecast following times when paid for by mayor ... friends of a mail is ... and we do have the mayor in Studio\n... and just talking about Halloween mayor reminds me of when you were first elected to office and I remember we had this conversation a show where you were going with that\nI don't know I remember having a conversation because it shortly after you took office you wanted to do this the first things you got moving out is turning the lights back on in the city and uh the all the lights were back on in the city\nJust before Halloween much I knew the whole thing was unlimited up it was perfect timing especially for some of these neighborhoods I was always concerned about sweet out and so forth and there's so many children right uh and that just had that little flashback of a conversation we had just a few years ago or getting the lights back on and they were on inside for Halloween\nYes sometimes we forget where we were [laughter] because you know time goes on life goes on and you have to stop and think of the past ah because sometimes the past is what makes you encouraged for the future\nAnd now we're going to be talking a little bit about the future and vision for the city when socket or Tuesday November six is election day asking your consideration is maybe ... ah it's been a little bit of exciting news ear though of the past week or so with some endorsements coming your way\nAnd ah one of them are very notable is a is a ruined do seem to be in shock at police department would have very very well written a letter to a stating that they've ... they they noticed some progress and no leadership by the city hall and the progress of the city is making and that led them to endorse\nYou initially mayoral race\nYes and and I thank them for that and it's always encouraging a when you have folks um\nWho recognize the advances that have happened within the community I\nAs we know a lot of people were hit hard uh years ago and I'm a lot of those folks up people who work for the community from the you know all the different police fire teachers um\nLocal six Seventy local eleven thirty eight so they all have to sacrifice Batman so as things improve within the community I you can actually stopped to\nReinforce some of the things that were depleted so to speak or or at least minimize so it's encouraging on that they actually recognize where they were several years back\nHow far they've come and the fact that they're um you know feeling that they've made great advances there and I want to thank them for recognizing that because it's the work of many people and including in direct ... as the public safety director or a ... as the you know I I Would say\nIt's been a couple of years so I don't call it you know new anymore he can't be new uh and all of their work and the hard work and their commitment and sticking it out so I think you think it to them\n... received endorsement from the Rhode Island ...\nOh thank you thank you to them\n... ... from the Rhode Island builders and traits\nYes I did and uh well as we know we've had significant construction in the city and uh they recognize that and that's good for the trades because if you're building a new housing development you are putting people to work plumbers carpenters sheet rockers\nPie players when they're building roads to put in a development and also the fact that we've taken a blighted properties and through the enforcement through the inspection department and their uh their um more aggressive ah\nActions taking these blighted properties and either one eliminating the property through them demolition or to\nUh getting it rehab complete rehab and when you're doing a complete rehab again\nYou know you're putting all those people to work roofers et cetera so a lot of a lot of people are gainfully employed and when that happens um you know if it's good for the economy it's it's good for them it's good for their families it's good to be working so uh I appreciate that endorsement also\nAnd uh if I missed about politics for or just a moment ... ... another surge exciting thing she's ... deli family are just curious and weekend is Rocco bowl belly being named manager of the Minnesota Twins yes ...\nYeah it it I mean it's great we're also very very proud of him or he is a wonderful person and he had several offers a from other teams also I must say he was pretty comfortable in Tampa a\nThat became his home as you know he not only played there but then a live there and work for the Tampa Bay rays and then ultimately he decided that um he would accept one of the offers and as you said it was with Minnesota\nSo uh with that said we are really proud of him and um and excited for him\nInto the family exciting for all of us here in northern robot as\nIt is and I think it's great for for the city Rocco was born in when socket he played little league in one socket and you know as parents talk to their children or you know youngsters who are involved in little league they're able to tell a story and talk about him and point him out and say you know he played in the very same league that you're playing and right now\nIt's exciting times we're really excited about what the future holds um the stadium theater\nOr once the election is over and eight days or so uh we have beautiful plans\nOf and we're going to be reviewing the rendering of the plans for a bit of a calming area in front of the stadium theater so what will happen is it will create almost like a drop off area so for safety purposes um\nFor public safety purposes we're looking at a new way to a ...\nI have a the patrons of the stadium the children a beacon charter school create a little bit of a safer environment there and it's really a project that I'm really looking forward to and it will also in corporate world street so\nWorld street practically think brings you back to the bike way so see how we kinda circles right back\nSo to me that's the gateway into the arts and entertainment coming off that by passing up moral streets you want to have\nAn entrance there that makes people recognize when they see the entrance\nThat the light goes off and the the fly goes up so to speak that oh I must be in the right spot\nBecause of this looks like it's the arts and entertainment area and so those plans are really exciting and will be meeting with Kathy ... or whoever else is on their team that will be coming to the meeting so all of this\nUm is taking place in addition\nWe've had a couple of increase from some breweries\nAnd you know that's also a great addition to our downtown main street area so you know we'd love for both of them are to come to fruition uh but if we can be successful was bringing one again\nBefore you go to the theater or before you go to the museum you may want to stop in 'em and try some some you know Bruce that's made right here\nIs is one of the most detailed the presentations of this upcoming uh excitement of the downtown and so I could do that I heard or just for three thirty patient and you said something about the long above then and the real company that's got a phone\nOutage in the mayor's office in city hall\nMeeting a you know you you may not see this out but it's happening or to get to this point a ridge Asian for revitalization of downtown or much took years to to even concept is well\nYou know when I first became mayor a and you know we're concentrating on trying to fill you know we had significant vacancies on diamond hill road and we're working ...\nWell you know we had significant vacancies on diamond hill road and we're working to try to fill those retail stores and we've been you know successful\nI Love I was just going to advertise to say\nOh I Love Ali's then it's oh chapter supplies my new favorite and then it's oh no I like ocean state job lot because when I Walk and I don't even feel like I'm In ocean state job lot anymore so everybody's got their own thing happening I'm\nOf course and then you've always got the people who say I just love McDonalds 'cause I like their dollar couch and now they got a double drive through right so ah but the fact of the matter is it's just\nThe realization that those places are filled now\nAnd mores coming and there's still construction happening\nAnd uh so we've got the retail strip but what I was getting out was\nPeople were saying you know when I became air there were like you know concentrate on you know a B C D but don't concentrate on downtown 'cause you're never going to do anything with it and I thought you know that's kind of a sad statement because our downtown is really beautiful and\nIt's not going to bring back grandson Jupiter's and\nYou know a coin signs in barrels courting and you know all those things that I remember\nI remember some of our younger than me\nUm but that doesn't mean that you can't reinvent your main street and bringing things that are different than those stores and that's what we're doing and we're really excited about it and um I really look forward to\nJust seeing that bustle on main street and and you know our downtown being alive\nTo my best memories are of walking ... grew up on hope street right behind ... ... Franco jolly yes and no use always so gracious and I as a kid I Would always go down and does it may may\nSay Hi to label deli maybe Mitch ... and then across the street to Jupiter's\nAnd I it doesn't stop I Will where it's play with the hamsters back home [laughter]\nThat is such a nice house and bustle inside on main street I was just\nThrilled to hear about this presentation today about where it's moving advertising with ... and you're hearing about this division and she will continue working in the upcoming terms\nAnd lifted on November six asking for your support and where do you agree with you about five minutes which means we can talk a little bit about some other things uh I'm looking at something here that has me also exciting if I may read it off of this\nAnd I think this is a trivia what folks will see tomorrow roughly\nContinuing recreation if it's a cash park in addition to working with closet owners to bring a movie theater into a city to further proof of life religious\nRight so it's pretty exciting it is okay so the new owners of woman he'll plaza a we have been talking on a fairly regular basis\nAnd they want input like what are people looking for in the community and um and they called last week and\nThey said that um you know there's a couple of of things that I had mentioned before to them and I talked about how we used to have a movie theater there and I think it's important and uh it give the children\nAnd all of the people in the community a place to go uh where I get it Lincoln is not far but if someone is willing to open a movie theater why wouldn't we want a movie theater in in our city so uh they began I'm researching that\nAnd so we are actually in talks pertaining to a movie theater um a supermarket as you know a supermarket is something that I feel very strongly about uh and I think that we really truly need 'em to bring in another supermarket the challenge we have is that\nWe have to supermarkets that are very on our border so it leave a question in the mind but I Will tell you that I I have been speaking with an owner\nOf a supermarket chain a chain that you would recognize the name [noise] and uh they have interest in coming into the city\nAre you in are coming back\n[laughter] it's a little slick a radio news guy ... know out al max is not that [laughter] I Want as an aide to dream staff member I Love ...\nUm so anyway Oh yes so\nThey have some preference as to where they would like to be located and so those are the talks that we're having right now I'm so as you know\nBuilding a new supermarket uh selling new space developing you know all of that brings in additional tax revenue\nAnd it's been extremely important to me\nUm and you know my entire staff or that we recognize several years ago that the city of one size fits residents and homeowners aware really hit hard ah from the you know terrible economic times that took place\nAnd I can say that through a lot of hard work by a lot of people and the fact that the residents like stuck it out because this was their community a we have been able to reduce the residential tax rate by thirty four percent thirty four percent is a\nVery large number when you're talking about reductions in tax rates and that money in their pocket and when they have money in their pocket they can do more for their family or their home or you know or whatever it is is there right so the more we can leave in their pocket or\nThe more our community thrives so uh thirty four percent with a\nReally big number and of course giving the commercial\nA rate a reduction also which acquainted to eleven percent reduction or you you would be hard pressed to find that big of a reduction\nAre interested in residential tax rates in other communities um so right now we need to continue this growth and the improvements in order to be able to keep and and you know stick continue to stabilize the taxes\nAre at that point in the program and we'll be talking with my responsibility to do is we lead up to election day today and they were in our final two minutes I always just turn it over to you if you'd like to make a an address\nSure so at full first of all just it's always a pleasure speaking with you and it's exciting to be able to come on the radio because I feel like you know for so long with this election uh you know since the uh certifying the candidates you can't just call or what have you so\nUm it's great to be here it's great to be able to talk about the things that are that the things that are happening or that will be happening on what we're working on and um I just closed with saying next Tuesday or we will be at the Italian working men's club or getting the results of the election and everyone and anyone\n\nThat's bad enough in my opinion do we want them in our churches and an hour synagogues\nReally I don't think so\nWhat kind of a country that we live in when you have to have an armed guard at your church services I mean we live in a very sick violent hate filled country don't we\n\nThat's the way I see it\nAnd of course now we're having our prayer vigils and the flags lowered and uh we have makeshift memorials and guess what you have it a few days it'll pass and there'll be all over and I will be on our merry way waiting for the next\nEpisode\nSeems to never end it never ends I mean last week we had that not was sending bombs in the mail\nAnd\nScaring the living daylights out of everybody inconvenience in hundreds of people\nIn their daily work\nWell you might have a comment

fight whatever you on the council the school committee the autumn festering committee senior services you name it she creates drama and controversy\nWith everything she touches spending money is easy but leading and working productively and constructively with others requires a willingness and ability to compromise and get along\nThat simply is not in the current mayor is the and a and the city

to go for bingo right St Joe's this parish hall is the place to go and who knows you could be the lucky person you could go home with a by winning a prize yes by playing bingo every single Tuesday\nAnd I know my three years of experience down there was that good I mean I was chasing vandals I tackled kids who were being bad spray painting and\nStuff I I don't want an average day we've lost and they were free skates we didn't charge for rentals\nI Know an average right I'd probably lost three to five is the skates every night no kidding yeah so I mean and I said is the all the time and you would I vote notice because I've worked with you for a long time there are a lot of ... ... I mean and there are a lot of\nKids and I use ... as an example graffiti we do every week removed weekly weekly across the part\nUnbelievable isn't I'd say it's unbelievable it is believable because it's happening\nThat's unbelievable isn't I'd say it's unbelievable it is believable because it's happening but you know to be so disrespectful on a regular basis\nWe have a great ... billion of beautiful but me and if anybody want to have cook outs and stuff down there ... we actually have to pay that gray cement now black because\nThere's so many vulgar words on it and I mean we couldn't do it today 'cause the climate weather will be gone to this week I'm sure painting\nThat all black so if they're going to these kids are gonna want to steal the gonna have to go see a white paint now which most of them don't steal white paint they just do what they can so we're gonna have to make the cameras black because that's the only way we can get rid of all these bad whereas if we painted gray were actually given him an an artist campus\nThat's giving them what a sad commentary huh not a sad commentary\nAnd you know so that you know the ice rink and last year the last two years if you follow the progress of the great Mooney Brown's pictures that have been in the paper we always had a great job of clearing that ice rink mhm always up at burning pock\nLet me know maybe what we need to do this season is remind people maybe there are people who went out of where you know that the ... ice skating available because to be honest with you when you know that you just reminded me but I forgot that there was ice skating at that number and in part\nAnd you know when I heard them talking about river island park is a gene is true you know people didn't enjoy skating those hardware and behaving themselves and enjoy the the rink at a river island park\nBut if something's being offered that a is a being treated properly and uh you know so it's not all that far I mean I don't care where you are and when I get to a close to the next part no big deal to go to burn and if it's being offered right\nWhen it when when the weather was good and I I I don't like to bring this up when the weather was good last year for in a park you know that his myself and mark and do we all talk to different people come to talk of you that use ... facilities uh-huh probably\nNinety five percent of the people from outside\nNow isn't that interesting [laughter] I Know the whole ...\nBoston the hockey team came to opt to use a ring because you rent costs are expensive so they came on their own is already facility because guess what nobody else wants taco was using you know\nWell maybe maybe we need to do a better job of letting people know that this is available on a regular basis maybe that can be our little project for the fall and winter right and remind people\nWe didn't do that I I Know the correct the record that you know a lot of advertising of that on their Facebook page and whatever else does face time face chat whatever I Know you and I I'm not into that kind of\nMedia by Marine I think of Dan gender and I'm not sure what the\nOther person was mentioned this morning and the song soundbite was if they work down there for one week of that ice rink river island they would run as fast they could back to their homes wherever they are we talking ... sometimes these kids Larry adjust\nAnd I deal with the with all the time I Know how to control them but\nThey just come down there the parents don't know where they are and they said you know what\nLet's go down there and be as bad as we can because that's that's unfortunate for the kids want to come down but there was from a legal ... you know your school while she got who want to just come down and family enjoy yeah they have to deal obviously we're not there to patrol swearing and all that stuff we there's only so much as I as a public service employee we can\nDo yeah you were in high it as a policeman where ya [laughter] so\nYou know ... there's only so much we can do it on and then like I said three to five business case I Know a night was stolen when I was there I don't know what they do it and maybe they take them down and saw solemn somewhere but I think just the mist mischief that they brought upon themselves ruined it for a lot of is that is why it's still a great opportunity up at burning park right off\nYou know William street and feel the street that they can go and still enjoy a great lighted facility ... that we do maintain when the weather is cold enough\nAnd getting back to um ... and the ongoing problems there I'm ... and they haven't caught anybody doing this just a responsible for this destruction\nThey haven't you know I Know when I we were there friday doing or the painting of the other cars evil because it was so many swear words on that one is the only thing I could think of as you know\nIs getting some kind of cameras whether it be inside the trees or something they could be right on them is is that the technology is so good now mhm but I Know just from the beginning of April 'til now just me alone in the other guys that I work when we probably did that because even over seven times Larry\nMy goodness seven times\nSeven times when you've got all the other parts of the take care of as well as so much that needs to be done in our pox and here you are continuously trying to get rid of vandalism\nAnd you know ... the former pop boxer wrecked the rec center right Jimmy can and he was there for Thirty years you said graffiti goes up it's going to come down right\nOh yeah 'cause it's like a cancer yeah it is if you if you ignore it and only gets worse nearly ... ... you remember the um the that a tag or who went around the city or a in a defaced many many buildings all around the city and then nothing about it yeah that's that's what I was going to ask you you know\nHe got caught at least we were told he was caught and it stopped so I assume they caught this Bozo but we never heard wealth cause ... or a juvenile you'll never get to name\nThe sentiment I think it was twenty seven year old\nOkay so here was this guy was twenty seven whatever happened to them I mean you know I I didn't see him around town with a paint brush in being forced to do some cleanup work around the city or give them give him a broom and you know sweep the sidewalks or on a hot summer day or whatever\nI Know we do you know we said we as when soccer's city when talking I Know the police department does have certain individuals that they\nGo about doing community service in the city of community service is being done by those individuals and whether they're picking literate a park or read pain in the dugout started a Ellsworth\nHot now these are people who are caught up in court yeah okay well that you know maybe the\nPolice department should do a better job letting people know that this is happening maybe it would um you know get make other uh graffiti artists in vandals think twice you know they knew that they were going to be punished and they have to work it out and sweat\nYou know being Superman or say something about fast people in the city I experienced on Saturday we had a gentleman coming down prospect street beautiful Mercedes I'm your brand new Mercedes no license tag in front of a life of taken aback probably going eighty
