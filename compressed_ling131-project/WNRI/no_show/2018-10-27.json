the back is member FDIC member SIMS\nAdded an equal housing lender than analysts number for one to zero nine five\n\n\nYou know there's a lot happening around Rhode Island let you might not be aware of it is time for friends in Jackson as she goes around the roads introducing you to double the exciting but perhaps not very well known goings on in this area is the host of the programs Bradley [noise]\nMoney everybody listening\nThe roads\nThe world because I don't want to talk about today is something that a lot of people kind of fun brush off and there are tons of skeptics about it in fact I was myself for the longest time and that is the process of climate change and I mention is 'cause I actually did a ... a couple of weeks ago\nAnd it wasn't a scientific talk that's not what I was looking for but it was just a matter of why we all need to care because that is a slight problem you know which is funny because it doesn't seem as if\nA lot a lot of people do I know when most people that you talk about I think of it of climate change all you can see the polar bears that\nI just kind of moving around\nAnd little Ireland icebergs having broken off from the Arctic Circle in fact you might even remember a Super Bowl ad I Believe it was last year by Coca Cola had um polar bears like that\nWith little ... son kind of just looking for salvation and instead they got bottles of soda oh well I'm Glad you know in reality the Arctic term a farce has want about eleven degrees over the last several decades\nAnd now if you look at a graph of climate change what you see is that for hundreds of thousands of years\nThe amount of carbon dioxide which is what gives us a lot of climate change here has gone from about what to do the parts per million to about two hundred and eighty and that number has wavered for the longest time however in the past couple of centuries\nThat number has zoomed up to over four hundred and some climate scientists say by the end of this century\nWe may end up having probably about eight hundred parts per million of carbon dioxide now where does this come from and we hate to mention it but most it comes from a\nI Know a lot of people say well we have all these volcanoes that happens and they view out all this horrible stuff and and\nMarsh gas or even ... animals animals we say elimination of get that flash but that's not really it it's actually mostly done by us humans here because for millions of years nature has very often\nWe humans have been digging it up and by doing so we have reversed millions of years of deposits in just a few decades taking them out of nature storage and are are is really can absorb ball to excess\nThat occurred around Los Angeles\nThat actually almost caused almost came up to the to the mountain which houses one of the more historic observatories mount Wilson in fact the ... the firemen had to build\nAnother fire to attracted away from it they're actually Youtube videos is a fire barely getting to just smelt Wilson observatory but fortunately that was saved unfortunately when it comes to home so\nThat's not usually the case that was a major examples\nWas in the ... in California in twenty sixteen ... that was the most expensive fire that had ever cost to try to stop over fifty seven houses were burned\nAnd with the amount of land about two hundred and sixty million dollars\nWas destroyed which at the time is the most expensive fire in us history and\nWhat caused it an illegal campfire people just not realizing what was around them a dry the conditions that were around them and of course if you got to have a lot of storms if you're going to have a lot of\nIt all a lot of this horrible weather what will you have lightning for every two degrees of ... of warming lightning strikes to increase ten to twelve percent\nAnd that also creates forest fires and also this weather can cause and increase not only of hurricanes\nWhich you know the ... the hurricanes that we've had him just just in Cairo in twenty ... twelve and we had Hurricane Sandy just slightly slightly south of us and the destruction that caused\nUm throughout ... lower Manhattan Coney Island was destroyed the there was so much water it actually went into the subway something that has never happened I'm even looking at something that just happened within the past few days\nWhen I was the last time we saw um tornadoes coming through north Providence\nAnd Lincoln and that was in such a small area residents just a couple of miles away from where this happened\nWhen even when even having rain knew nothing there was no\nUm no wind anywhere else just in that little tiny area the destruction that was caused by that by that tornado was incredible for the for Rhode Island here [noise] and what happens when we have all of this happening\nPeople have throughout\nThe drought of course causes food supplies to go down all of a sudden people living especially in the fertile crescent in Asia suddenly they're beautiful land is now desert\nSo millions of people now cannot farm on their own profit ... they have to go elsewhere and gee I don't have a son so horrible here but it's something that we do have to take care of by the Zika virus you know I didn't even know what that was until I was looking into it it is\nOf course most of you know it is caused by the by the mosquito was of a specific species of mosquito I'm and basically for most people\nIt causes flu like symptoms lasting for several days but the number of mosquitoes that are caused by the ... the increased numbers of floods all around the world\nCan I can increase\nTo the point where in twenty sixteen Puerto Rico is considered a disaster area because the amount of of a secret cases\nThat occurred and allergies and all of us have some kind of allergy especially ragweed if you will it's it's noted that probably probably by the end of our century\nRagweed production will increase by over three hundred percent and also of all things poison ivy an episode of poison ivy except something to be away from the way from poison ivy is actually the aggressiveness of poison ivy is actually increasing and that also\nWill increase almost three times by the end of the decade guess put an IV likes warm climates but now it's all this horrible stuff you know is there something that we can do and you know you don't do things you know in a little too a little extent\nBut basically to up to a larger for all we can try to get away from fossil fuels\nMore people are buying um electrical or hybrid cars more people using Ellie ... all the full full lighting although those actually causes slight\nProblem and the fact that people feel that the lighting itself is so inexpensive Ellis just crank it up and what happens you end up having more light than you ever did and that blue lights to bluish light of the\nHaving more light than you ever did that blue light to bluish light of the LAPD is now causing a lot of people in cities that have them in the street lights to have sleeping problems resulting in of course other problems resulting from people's insomnia\nFor them not being able to sleep [noise]\nThan in 'em over the lodge expanse of course we have wins and many of you know that in fact the ... the state Rhode Island's deepwater wind was picked up by a ... a company or the dead\nFrom Denmark that will in fact the making many more wind turbines here which for some people it all sounds good when it's cheap it's free but there are some problems with that first of all just on the natural side you have to make sure that those aren't being placed\nIn regions of birds and insects migration\nAlso fishermen are finding that some of the turbines in in the water in the ocean or actually causing\nA fish to migrate very differently and\nOf course the boats themselves have to make sure that they're not kind of traveling in the line in the direction of where some of the some of these turbines are also\nBy I'm a recent article in Providence business news notes that remember you know in the science of physics everything\n... ... there's always an exchange every action creates a reaction those turbines which are causing creating wins are actually taking some of the atmosphere\nOut resulting in slight temperature differences below in other words like flight warm so that actually to a small extent or actually increasing the cost of the the temperature of the atmosphere below it also\nThough besides wins a lot of people are in fact looking at solar energy which does have many less\nUh problems to it the main one of course I'm is where to place all these very large solar farms in the west and southwest they have a lot of desert area where fortunately a lot of animals don't exist and there's um [noise]\nA lot of basically free land with nothing ever could happen to it um around here though it seems as if\nA lot of times people lie to put solar farms are they don't realize that they're put where they put solar farms alleged trees have to be cut so now you have the tree versus solar panel\nDiscussion which is more important which is actually the better um yeah the the better way to go\nOne way would be to put solar panels on houses do you have facing\nHomes so facing roof those panels can work marvels\nAlong with other you know there are many other things that wind and solar seem to be what many people are looking for now but again you do have to be there are consequences\nOn either one now as I mentioned before I actually have a talk on this kind of showing some of the extremes\nOf what can happen if anybody who's interested that'd be will more than willing to do so to come to your place and talk about it because we have to remember that even though I'm an astronomer I'm always looking up one of the reasons why I have trouble looking up is because\nOf our atmosphere the increased light in our atmosphere causing us to see fewer\nAnd fewer celestial objects\nAnd one of the things that we do have to worry about here on earth is that this is it we only have one or if we're not going anywhere where not capable of going anywhere right now what we have to do is\nAlways do our best to try to keep it here well I thank you for listening to me to date is Francine Jackson's going basically around the globe to get today thank you so much for having listened and hopefully I'll be with you again very soon I no\nYes she is I think she's I think I'm going to vote for her\n... well she certainly a a ... is one who's been involved in school activities you know she as she is very much concerned about the quality of education she knows her way around in the school department\nUh she's been an advocate for a her children yeah years and um yes I ... I I Would say the interest there's been they're right along for her you know she has always been interested in in education\nI like it well it won't be long now Larry\nA week from Tuesday it's all over like I said the fat lady's gonna thing or a week from Tuesday and that that's going to be all over\nMe 'cause I'm not fat [laughter]\nIt's not going to pay me 'cause I'm not fat\n[laughter] oh good\nLaurie I'm that's in the form as intense you know they I mean that shows right\nThat's right it's official now I mean I there was a bad announced that maybe a couple of months ago I was going to be sold it finally happened you know those things take forever yeah but it did happen this week it was officially sold yet but they're\nNot open till\nSometime in the middle of next year yes oh so ah I I don't know if the sit you know the fact that the sale only took place this week probably delete everything\nAh or initially I I Believe when they first announced this uh they were planning on opening some time in November but that's not going to happen so but um it looks like they have a lot of work to do they want to change things around a bit\nTo the good thing is uh the people who are doing this and know what they're doing because uh I have two people who I Am\nHave some successful restaurants already\nI think in Boston right\nNow um I forget exactly where they're located uh but they do have ah restaurants are under their belt and a good business people so that makes me feel comfortable and\nI I never went to the old vintage you ever go to\nThat you went there are a number of times to be honest with you\nI liked it a it was a different atmosphere or they had good food I mean the times I went there I had some very good meals\nUm pie and sometimes they had entertainment on the weekends and I went there a couple of times my wife to listen to various groups that performed there\nBut um they they did a nice job they did a nice job and it's a you know what I like about that building it's a new building but it looks like an old building it's fish right into main street\nAs well as all by the way I always look at it when we go by you know\nPercent of the nicest guy the occupied\nAnd yeah and it's going to bring more life to the downtown area and it only need ... hopefully this'll catch on and we can fill some additional empty storefronts in downtown area ...\nVirginia ...\nAbsolutely you know you're a business of that type again we have the restaurant tax that the city can cash in on and plus I'm sure that building's going to generate more taxes now that it's occupied so that's all good news\nIs timeless and cake and all that that's a beautiful order not nice that START I timeless and take all\nIt is a very nice store and you know as I've said so often they do very very well you talked to um the um the husband and wife team who run timeless there'll be the first ones to tell you they do very well\nThey love their location if anything uh uh ... they have any complaints or they could use a bigger store because they do so well and they don't understand why other people have not open similar shops in the downtown area they would love to have some neighbors\nDon't Larry ... much much older than you are but yeah I remember the name St Louis ... oh yeah oh I remember that\nWell I Do to to be honest with you I remember going downtown\nA specially like in the early sixties the mid seventies when I was a teenager and that was the place to go and there was a tremendous amount of activity downtown again\nWe we won't see that but oh no no but I when we were talking about this last night there were there are so many examples of some real\nVibrant downtown areas all around us I mean you don't have to go to find a sea\nDowntowns that have more life the main street one sock it I mean we do have some\nSome businesses that are doing very well but we have many too many empty a storefront so yeah exactly\nYeah in all areas for I hang up what happened uh you don't accept bone that's not going to the pizza place I\nKnow it looks like it's going to be your market varieties store of some sort of price me because I thought that was the last I had heard it was going to be a teacher a pizza place of some kind of in a town pizza place yeah my\nWell my brother told me I says why they asked I think I signed up that tried to be alive kid and\nA ... a little bit of everything I guess a full fledged the grocery store and they want to sell ice cream there as well I Believe so\nMaybe they want to be in competition with the other one day site throw to assign cast Seventy like saying yeah well competition is ... well\nIt is it is and then you get that other little place there on the corner of ward avenue a out that that that place I don't know what they sell but boy I'll tell you they do one heck of a business\nI jumped in Larry [laughter] I've never been in there so I don't know I Would never on places like that Larry I'm not like that and that's\nThe guy with a shotgun in the toilet has something to remember when they were ... I think there was something that had happened and they found a loaded gun in the toilet or some\nGolf guy maybe somebody can refresh my memory I don't go in places like that you know selling something

I guess uh the mental health issue is going to be part of a on\nHis way of finding the final outcome of how he's punished but\nTo me the disruption that he created when you think of the evacuation of buildings putting people on a in a situation where they're extremely nervous or feel threatened in all listen that they've got to be a big big price to pay for that I'll tell you\nWell he's got to do something you probably are so far\nHave if he finds a good lawyer you might be out on bail next week\nYou won't find a good word because you've got to have a public defender\nWell messing up on one or not the\nGreatest Perry Mason when we need him right\nYeah well it's already done and the part of this is a serious\nThere's this concept you know when I go back and forth about the president but his rhetoric a fund the podium president above ... body slammed people and ah you know if I were just they have got a lot\nHas no concept of a meter\nNo concept of proper presidents ...\nYeah I can use that I cannot excuse that either as a you know there there are certain things that he says and does that uh I cringe but um\nYeah I [laughter]\nBut you need to do you need to worry you know if somebody does that\nIf somebody is that your\nThanksgiving table\nAnd wants butter and he takes his bare hand just\nRips a piece of butter butter and throws a play I used to be worried about a lot of

I could not even imagine that as a kid\nAnd of course we have the bike path now to that makes its way through the city and uh goes right by cold spring park at at the park a piece of the bike path or as pretty much a ... been completed\nSo anyway that was an interesting story and the Providence Journal this week maybe use or maybe you have in common um\nThere is a poll that has been conducted for whatever it's worth a lot of polls you liked reading poll numbers\nThe poll that has been conducted for whatever it's worth a lot of polls you like reading poll numbers\nThis one indicates that eight and ten Americans think that the United states has greatly divided about important issues\nAnd thirty nine percent say it's going to get worse before it gets better ... alright division yes we are we haven't division we've always had division in our country yeah always had division\nMaybe we have more than we usually have what do you say\nOr do you own a Ford Focus Ford Motor company is recalling one point five million focus compact cars is a problem or could be a problem with the fuel system can cause engine ... without warning so uh\nIf you own a Ford Focus years two thousand twelve to two thousand Eighteen beyond the lookout you might be receiving a recall notice\nReminds me we have our two thousand six four and um what is it a\nFusion that's it that's what we have of two thousand six that had a recall years ago for the exploding or a airbags was still waiting [laughter] care so much for recalls\nSupposed to protect you but ah I guess uh you got to be patient in the meantime you say your prayers\nI'm\nTalking about the bike path in the valley breeze Lauren clam had an article this week about the bike path construction and it does say that it's actually ahead of schedule\nAnd I was very happy to read that they were going to eliminate one lane of traffic on the bypass I've been calling for that for years you know the bypasses that four lane highway that goes from nowhere to nowhere for some strange reason so he can bypass main street [laughter]\nI'll tell you the clowns that thought that one up\nOr they're probably they will probably met their maker by now but uh\nAnyway uh what a dumb move that was the main street bypass that help with the coffin nails into the main street when you think of it huh bypass main street yeah why go down now mainstream do any business bypass it yes we'll help you do it will build a four lane highway for you so you can fly down there\nBut anyway we're eliminating one of the lanes of traffic that's the good news to make way for the bike path\nAnd then eventually that bike path there's going to cut through\nMarkets square actually that the you know that little passed between um the vintage restaurant and the um ... apartment building there there's a little walk away and the bike paths going to go right up that walk away they were working on the other day\nAnd then it's going to go through or somehow cross\nThe markets square parking lot and make its way to reverse street and then from rivers street they'll make its way towards cold spring park and before you know what you will be and Blackstone and you can hook up over there and the day will come when it's all going to be\nConnected yes and it took a while but it's at least it's getting done\nOn another topic I'm male Lisa bowl deli hunt sent out a a released this week saying that a cast pock renovations that going to be a priority for her next term\nShe pointed to work that's already been completed the renovations at Reno field\nNew basketball courts next to the high school the creation of a girls' softball field and a new playground along with the reconstruction of the tennis courts on Ellsworth Avenue so uh they will be more work I cast pot\nAnd her next term mayor Lee ... deli\nHunt says that said she was reelected not talking about parks um anybody know what the latest is on a field that they sold it yet or is that\nStill up and he I think that's still up in the year anybody you know maybe one of our ah counsel people does listen they can send us an email what's the latest on\nLike those those British came I really\nOnly beautiful yeah those for this stream bridges\nYeah yeah so I mean it's I mean it was a big effort um you know what that's going to be worth it in the long run and then you know federal finally through um to to the oil far from\nDavid sandwiches which is which is really nice complex though yeah so uh so I think it's working out as far as that\nAnd I I have to ... certainly urged people you know if if you're not a bike rider I can certainly walk the bike path because I don't ride a bike but I Do try to do some walking and I have walked many segment of the bike path and every one of them is a leisure to walk\nIn the surroundings is just terrific you know they they they definitely are chose some nice box to put that bike path\nYou know they they they definitely are chose some nice spots to put that bike path\nYeah especially especially going through you know once you um you know once you cross the river you know going over go quacks socket I mean because that's really nice heavily wooded area ... like I say I walk the walk bike ride them either by any means but one of the things I was wondering was\nI was wondering if um if that is I tried looking at at one line um but it's not really clear I'm a second of all to people that have some of these electric wheelchair and some of these electric multiply seems to me\nIs to me I Am you know I Want to say that I have seen someone\nIn one of those vehicles on the bike path I I Would say yes or you know I'm I'm just ... based on my memory and and I can't see why they they wouldn't be to be honest with you\nYeah I Know it and and not only that but I was also last year because there's you know what the you know with the development of technology of new battery technology and things like that one thing you're saying now is you're saying you're really saying uh you know a good market for what they called e bikes\nMhm what's your what's your electric bikes um\nYou know for people maybe people would have been older you know we've you know once they once they hit a hill or something like that um you know these ... carrying the back of a battery pack on them\nAnd there's a you know there's an electric motor that's actually going right after the bicycle a broad range so um and I was wondering if those would be ... to to those but like I said I haven't\nYou know some of these some of the laws on the bike path and things like that I mean you can't have motorized vehicles like that\nUm you know but again I was wondering about that too so but like I said those that bike path I mean just basically looking at it it's a really it's really really nice looking you know so people like I said if people want to get a better look at it\nUm that area right stable screen 'em if you just take a look you know towards Blackstone which before you come to the rich mhm you'll be able to get a really nice to go but not only that but there's a there's also a couple of little parks have black so\nYou can actually you know you can actually do an exit off of it and there's a nice little park right before you kept it don't work for us a main street cars a little connected broad right if you had to reverse street mhm\nAnd there's a nice nice little park about what ifs idea that um you know this nice parking and things like that it's really nice it's nice little part is that you know just to say that look a lot of things like that so yeah\nI have no say ...\n... one of my favorites are sections of the bike path or begins rain and I'm\nOn the veterans park at a you know write notes down I'm off Davidson street\nAnd I you park your car there and you start walking and you can go I sometimes we go as far as the wound water treatment plant sometimes we go beyond that we do make our way to men will and that whole stretches absolutely beautiful there're\nSegments where you can actually see ah the Blackstone canal the their in their bits and pieces of it that is still left sections that is still them that ... that was built back in the Eighteen twenty his mind do\nAnd uh you know your ... your ... walking parallel to the railroad tracks every once in a while you'll see a train going by so it's a fun it's a beautiful play in the wild life is incredible I mean I've seen\nI deer out on the uh you know ... ... alongside the where the canal and used to be in a it's a great great are you forget that you're in the city I mean it is it's it really is mind boggling to think that you're in the middle of the city walking this beautiful bike path\n... yeah exactly exactly and that's why I think that's why a lot of people used to like taking trainers because because I think a lot of the flight path in Massachusetts has going along I think it's going along one of the old retired train track a location is about I could be mistaken but ... um\nLeno herring won socket what they did a ... road is back in the old days on the Providence in Worcester railroad used to be a double track\nReal line ... ... you might think back in the forties or ... I figured if it was the forties or fifties being eliminated one of the tracks do to you know the business was what it used to be\nIn the bike path runs alongside what used to be the second tract of the Providence in Worcester railroad so\nOkay yep yep yep very nice I saw like I said just a just a a a controversial comment on a rainy Saturday morning\nAll right we like that [laughter]\nDo you get a ten on intend for that\nThey will keep everything late I mean Chris Dodd and we've been bombarded with everything from political ads to attack ads to all the more attack\nAds is uh Larry just can not only that but I'm Still tired from watching this morning gang oh by God what a marathon gain that why did you stay up for the game Larry I think I made it through the seventeenth anything and I fell asleep [laughter] we don't\nKnow it ended after two o'clock this morning I understand right\nOh my God I I think it went if I'm not mistaken I think I think it went to the bottom of the Eighteenth any need for a you know before I think it was much are you from the Dodgers game without getting wedding override but I'll tell you what a marathon game that was so [laughter]\nWe'll take a nap this afternoon [laughter] facts Larry might have a great sign you take ... by now but yeah but\nI mean maybe you have a comment on a Saturday morning or good morning you're on WWE and I'll write all aren't given it is it ... the milkman\nA game or a site that that finished around three thirty\n... thirty our time and my goodness yeah because\nOf pressure on twelve thirty on the west coast okay or your finger on a three hour difference I I was around three thirty oh my God what time are ... mother how many how many fans have left watching watching the game at that time\nI don't know I Can't I don't imagine staying up late to watch a ballgame but then again we do have those game lovers out there I guess\nThey said all sorts of records they were saying this morning a Eighteen earnings for the longest game ever for World Series longest time and ah yeah I don't forget that I started at eight o'clock hour time over here\nYeah I I cannot imagine sitting at a ball field watching a game that long a oh my God I was amazed\nAt how they showed her a little a little puck is running a TV earlier\nA quarter of your friends or stay until the ... you want to finish over there in Los Angeles at all wow wow uh I I don't want to put too much politics are smart we've\nGot enough of that going on like a sphere of just said yeah I just want to make a comment about a a friend Doris they'll St Clair lady lives and he was on Fox and yes yes uh she mentioned about a scene out driving this big\nA limousine [laughter] as receive around town where I mean a very noticeable\nYeah when it drives is nice and shiny these days you know I noticed when I got out of here yesterday he was shocked at the door and I'm looking at that thing goes on the docket so shiny\nI might I might have gone to a car wash huh I don't know but I think you've got somebody polishing it [laughter]\nBut anyway should measures and she never she or he looks old driving this guy you know give me a break I mean a ship forgot to mention maybe his German Shepherd it was in the back of the car also and that's as seeing eye dog\n[laughter] at all I mean come\nCall yesterday in the ...\n[laughter] at all I become\nA call yesterday and the clarify this yeah so\nBut anyway let's say you ought to call this week God I Believe uh I don't think I'm telling the secrecy about uh the gentleman call do from a dollar and it was just talking to you about being on the Cape and a fall but I Believe that was your brother calling you that's\nRight I was yeah it is\nTo identify himself to march but also if I ever know who he is\n[laughter] you don't do well\nYou know he mentioned that I guess I was a helmet he was ...\nYeah yeah downtown yes but you know when you cross\nThat bridge or the bond bridge or or the other one is\n...

good to know again if you have a motorized wheelchair and you're looking for a nice place to go up for a ride\nCheck out the bike path absolutely yeah another nice place to walk\nAnd for the life of me I don't know why we don't have more people walking there may be in the future we will I still think the seniors there the high rises I Know they have some organizations they've got to get their act together and organizer walking club or something\nAh and I'm Talking about World War two Veterans Memorial park there's that walkway that goes around the park to me that's the perfect place to walk\nAnd especially if you let's say you live around ... ... if you need to take ... to get to the uh the park to walk because what you do is you park there and then you you decide how many times you want to go around the park you can go around once that's all you want\nTo go around ten times if you wish that is what my wife and I do yeah we we go there quite regularly to walk\nAnd uh sometimes with good for three four laps and depending on how much energy we have that day [laughter] so that's another place to walk and\nIt's I'm handicapped accessible so um I don't see any reason why you

good point I ... I think that that's something that uh that should be looked into I liked the idea of this dining outside on the sidewalks I Know our unfortunately our main street sidewalks on narrow\nYeah as opposed to some communities at a nice big wide sidewalks what I'm you know if you eliminate the traffic but I don't know I've got mixed feelings about\nThat because I think the trap which I I don't know and that\nDoes bring some people into the downtown area who might decide to stop I don't know but I Do like the idea of outside dining\nAnd eating and yes the businesses on main street should be open late specially all the eateries and we need more either using the downtown area in my opinion\nEspecially on the weekends with the all the activities going on at the stadium theater good morning you're on

know I I was brought up in a very frugal a home as well and I was watching my parents struggle you know to\nPay their mortgage and all the bills that they had and what they did without I I noticed that as a kid and I I think a lot of that isn't me today you know where I you know if it if I have anything today is because I worked hard for it and I didn't you know spend like a drunken sailor you

were purchasing ... go for quality and when he was speaking about it he has one of the things that popped in my head I wonder if they measure his feet [noise]\nWell actually they will if you ask them to they do measure feet at waltz ah I I you know at this stage in my life I'm pretty you know I I Know where what my size then yeah and so it's not an issue but are they will measure your feet if you want them to\n... well I've reason I was thinking of it was I attributed that to the rap\nAnd oh yeah yeah that that was standard procedure Robin we always liked to measure your feet\nAnd I know you know and it's funny 'cause that led me on to the next thought that I think some people don't measure what size they need to fit in [laughter] oh I see many pants hanging down a below the waist

lots of issues we don't always agree but he's a great person and he's going to make a great a city councilman um so I Am a Democrat\nI've always been a Democrat ideologically\nBut I Do understand what Rodney saying about vote independent so sometimes the Democrats in Rhode Island are pretending to be Democrats and their ideas are not\nIn line with the ideology of the Democratic party at the national level so there's some\nConfusion there I think and I understand what Rodney saying even though I Am a Democrat and he's an independent we get along and we're going to work together we've been working together I'm On this campaign and reaching out to the community\nAnd like Rodney I'm also a a veteran Rodney was a marine and I was a a an army soldier um so I think that's important for people to know that we are ready to do the job and take the the leadership role from from day one\nBecause of our military service\nI'm so a couple of the other things that I'd like to mention is that a Rodney and I are also looking forward to working together on school issues and as you know in the city of ...\nUh our schools are not the best and it's very disappointing a for a lot of parents and it's so\nPointing a for a lot of parents and it's so\nFrustrating for them sometimes that they even move away to a different city\nTo avoid the school system this is something that Rodney recognizes and this is something that I recognize and this is something that we need to address very very desperately and another issue that Rodney and I agree on is Memorial Hospital and the problems that we have in our community now\nUh because of the closure of Memorial Hospital in particular the emergency room\nIn Memorial Hospital now all of the patients from ... are being transported to Miriam Hospital or Rhode Island hospital or another hospital and what voters are telling me is that\nMiriam ... emergency room is overflowing with people that the older sicker people that go and use the emergency room\nHas to wait six seven eight hours just to see somebody uh this is a big problem that we need to address right now whether or not we're able to reopen memorial\nIs unknown but we still have a problem in our community where people have to wait much much longer for emergency\nMedical care and a lot of these folks are vulnerable they have health issues that they need emergency care for a\nLot of these folks are older folks and I feel that\nWe need to respect our\nSeniors we need to respect our elders and this is something that we didn't do because we allow Memorial Hospital to close\nSo the hospital the issue is very important to me of course because my main campaign slogan is hospitals before stadiums and I feel so\nSeriously about this issue that I managed to put the words hospitals before stadiums on the voter ballot right under my name so that people know\nWhat my priority as mayor will be and that will be to put things like hospitals before things like stadiums and you can say that for schools will come before stadiums fire stations will come before stadiums police stations will come before stadiums\nAll of the things that the government should provide to the citizens will come before the interests\nOf very wealthy a ownership groups like we had in the case with the socks so I'd like to thank you very much for having me on a radio show and I'd like to say a big\n... for all of the people out there in the Cape Verde community I loved the Cape Verde in community I Can't get enough of the Cape Verde and community there is so much value in terms of language and culture in the Cape Verde and community that\nI feel the city in our community really needs to him brace the Cape Verde and community and get at is much value as we can and recognized that thank you\nIs very good you know I said you know like you say you know you love will get the people or I can tell you love who you know but ... also because you want to run for but that get you to do much better\nOr for the ... you know everybody knows you know about the Memorial Hospital\nYou know we live in a toxic at\nThis Memorial Hospital so wrong\n... didn't know speech a key nest said
