certification from the American board or the other just suddenly American Speech and hearing association and as a fellow of the American Academy of cardiology Hello Dr boy in and welcome back to a microphones\nHello nice to see you again Roger\n... nice to have you in the studio to talk about um about hearing aids today [noise] um I was doing a little research on the topic and I'm here's a quote that someone in your field said above them there's no one best hearing aid\nIs the best hearing aid for a specific person the choices individualize let a good place to stop the whether a discussion\nAbsolutely a that's a that's a perfect statement to make because there are multiple types of hearing aids available and today's technology in today's world and certainly we've come leaps and bounds forward and technology and sound quality and also customer satisfaction ah\nBut the hearing aid itself first and foremost must be appropriate for the hearing loss for the patient physical needs and they're also some financial restrictions for some people so we consider the whole person more and more choosing the hearing aid that's best suited for them\nIf we were um I Know that it doesn't work this way I'm ah in going into a Wal Mart or a target and and you see a whole bunch of of of different microwave ovens and they're all display different prices and so forth but\nCan you similarly say that when you go into your office of there is an array of uh of hearing devices out that today or or is it really just only a few out there\nNow there's an array a and a you know start from a very simple or basic digital hearing aid and ah\nWhich does a really great job reducing background noise and increasing speech on they don't do as well in difficult listening environments like restaurants and groups are meetings because the hearing it doesn't have the\nTechnology available to distinguish speech that we don't want to hear and speech that we do want to hear so it takes all speech in a speech so for example that restaurant environment if you're sitting in a restaurant and there are people talking all the way around all around you that technology doesn't have the ability to say\nI I ... I don't need to really listen to that speech that's\nTen feet away from a are twenty feet away from me I really would rather focus on the speech at the table in front of me as you go up in technology the a\nProcessor becomes a little bit more advanced are a lot more advanced in some cases and the teachers also improving the sound quality or the fidelity improved and so I always\nTell my patients there are about three or four basic categories for hearing aids today or in terms of technology and we always want to make sure that we're not over fitting are undercutting the patients we want to choose a hearing in most appropriate for them\nOr you're going to ... for um for area's\nForests sure your so once you leave that basic category and you go next to a a what we call a mid level category hearing it becomes a\nThere are more frequencies that we can fine tune and uh the hearing that ship itself is a little bit more advanced and so the ability for the hearing aid to process found improved so you start to do a little bit better and those speech environments and frankly speaking\nNine out of ten people come into my office and that's their biggest complaint I'm having trouble hearing and groups are restaurants I Do okay one on one but I have trouble hearing in restaurants [noise]\nSo uh that next next level up does a better job the again the the processing ship is a little more advanced so the hearing aid collects the data analyzes ed and decides okay that is speech but that speech is Fifteen feet away we need to know that it's present in the room\nBut we don't need to amplify it to an equal level of the speech at the table okay\nI'll just the closer speech is going to get amplified more [noise] um the next level up as a med high level and uh up until recently this product line was really the high definition there are more channels or frequencies that we can fine tune\nAnd I'll talk about that and just a minute and the speech processing ship again more advanced and so that's really the appropriate chip on that level and the next level up or the more appropriate chips\nFor people who are still working who are in those difficult listening environments more frequently so I'm a it is got a better fidelity better sound quality better ... processing of speech one speech if the background noise also does a better job with music I can distinguish the music and give it a little bit more base a\nAnd so it thinks better for us that's a nice way to say that thanks better for us\nAnd um those first three levels all have Bluetooth a capacity so they can connect to your Bluetooth devices like your telephone and there are doctors that you can add to your home telephone or your TV set or your eye powder um tablet devices but they require a [noise]\nI call it a gadget they require a transducers so the hearing it is connected to the trans do sir and the transducers connected to your product and so the sound from those products travel directly to your hearing aid so for example if your cell phone rings you can press the button on this trans do sir and it connects you're hearing aids to\nA hundred percent of my patients who've lost their hearing aids have done so because they didn't they didn't put them back in the case they stuck them in their pocket they left him on the coffee table and the dog ate 'em and you know I've heard it all\n[laughter] so what about America's economical where it's three Ninety five ... hearing device to tell us a little bit about maybe a similarly um the voices of build up people shouldn't even be looking at um because I Know they're out\nThere so they're very careful not to call those hearing aids because they're not their personal um sound amplifiers so they are not programs for your hearing lost their program for a usually a flat forty dust bowl which is borderline moderate hearing loss um [noise]\nThey're disposable they have a battery that that's not changeable for the most part I think there are some out there that you can change the batteries these personal um sound protection our personal sound devices are really wonderful\nIn areas that don't have access to medical care because something is better than nothing [noise]\nUm and yes there there are less expensive than the digital hearing aids and I hate to say get what you pay for but they're not programs for your hearing loss in there and they're very careful to only program for that flat moderate lost because if they try to set a severe hearing loss they'll damage your hearing\nWell I thought it was a it was a good question because I I think a lot of people see them out there and they don't realize that there is a place not much of a place but there is a place for them out there but um\nBut on the other hand the the really sort of a very small percentage of the hearing loss audience so clear\nThey do and as I said as I said you know fortunately we have access to medical care in this country and they're not they're not not every country has that same access to those devices are going to be better than nothing uh and uh\n[noise]\nInterests or the I say stay away you know we uh we talked about the prices of all of these devices are like ... we just mentioned do stay away from [noise] uh you said stops around the ... and uh how sophisticated a blood or can can you go\nIn a in ... in the pricing area\nThe it's so as you go up each step a\nYou're going to get a more advanced processing ship so the easiest way I can think of to help people to understand the differences to talk about ah when I was a young girl I had a\nPlastic record player and I played forty fives and I can tell you that my favorite was paper roses ah [laughter]\nMiss ... I Love that song um but I had this record player and I used to play my forty five in my room and I thought that was fantastic uh when I got a little bit older I got a stereo and I had an album instead of the forty five and I had speakers and an amplifier and I was able to control the base and the trouble and it sounded better\nAnd then I thought you know I'm the baby is nice here I haven't really going on right now we have stereos with both speakers and CDs and we just there the found it it's like being there it's it's so clear and\nReally um the fidelity is amazing so that's what I'm Talking about when I when I talk about the differences in hearing aids so you can get that record player and\nIt's going to help you it's going to sound great it's going to do what it needs to do for you but it's going to sound better if you listen to the stereo\nAnd that was a great example at least I related to the river and it's like All right so um we're we're talking about price to know where to look at a very important topic um and that is highly look and how they're perceived by other people are looking at you\nTold me how important is to Europe to your patients so\nIt's very important I mean my youngest patient ah that I've ever sit with hearing aids was two years old and my oldest patients can is gonna be a hundred and five on Monday and um they all care about what it looks like all of them\nAre including myself you know I've worn them for five years now and I have friends that I see all the time and they have no idea that I wear hearing aids and my hair's long right now so people say well you have long hair but anybody who knows me\nI'm not much of her ... and so ah usually five seconds into my day I have my hair at my hair pulled back into a ponytail I don't like it in my face um and so and still\nI actually have to take them off my ears for people to see them in my office when I say uh\nUm so today's hearing aids are\nMuch nicer than they ever were on the visibility from men probably up because the hearing aids for the most part talk up behind the air so they hook up behind the air for disability for men a little bit more so because your hair tends to be a little shorter\nBut certainly nearly invisible so let me show you Roger and I know your your your listeners can't see but so during it is the older this object hovering wire that comes down there so they're very small they talked very nicely behind the air [noise]\nAll right so the appearance is very very important ... I Love the side questions of men more concerned about their appearance or when it comes through hearing aids and women\nMore concerned about their appearance so when it comes to hearing aids and women this is one of those are questions that is non medical\nI you know it's a good question and I I find it to be equal I there are some people who come into my office and say look I don't care what it looks like I just want to be able to hear\nSo those people certainly have a lot more cells are better self image I think on other people are worried that people will look at them as their oils are handicapped with hearing aids but\nMost of the people are very pleased with the way they look very pleased\nTo know are going to talk about um about the need for a hearing device and and and I I think that there are people out there that are go every year for a for a dental don't deliver them and uh you know an eye exam\nBut um we've we've got to get people to make sure that they they check their their hearing is there a\nDo you need an appointment to to um to go in and have a hearing test I'm an ... hearing test sometimes done like ... you know like at a um a healthy or something like that\nYes I so I participate in health fairs a locally and I do hearing screenings or not a full hearing test because of the acoustics of the environment you can't do a thorough hearing test you can do a screening and get an idea of either it's normal or it's not\nWhat's the difference between a screening and I and our whole test\nFor a screening I we can't too low frequency testing in an open environment because we're not going to get accurate results we also don't do very high frequency testing so it's a limited typically for frequencies that we test [noise] um [noise]\nA thousand to four thousand hurts sometimes we can do five hundred hearts depending on the road so again it's really just to determine is it normal or not normal if it's not normal then you need to come in for a full hearing test [noise] um\n[noise] I think the first place to start this every year you see your doctor for a physical and every year\nAnd you know the doctors should be asking how's your hearing and they just have so many things to be concerned about in terms of your house especially if you're taking medication and you have other things going on hearing is going to be very ... on the bottom of their list so if you're noticing that you're having trouble I'm\nHaving to get people to repeat themselves maybe not hearing so well on the phone or watching TV those are all early signs of hearing loss tell your doctor and your doctor will give you a a\nA recommendation in terms of where where you can go to get your hearing tested uh in my office you do need an appointment I'm I'm a single provider ah and\nI'm looking for somebody to work in my office part time ah but so I Need you to make an appointment I don't have walking appointments um other places will offer walking appointments and\nAlready and uh so ... to uh end up our a discussion on hearing aids um once but screening or I actually not the screening but once the um examination has made and and let's say there is a determination for\nUh for some kind of a a hearing aid then you have to decide which are the levels of hearing aids you're going to recommend to your patient and\nYes and we go over it's actually the patient who makes the decision we my job is to educate\nThe patient their job is to decide what's right for them I don't live their life I don't know yet there are budgetary concerns are really not my business um my job is to help them give them the opportunities that they need to make a decision is right for them [noise]\nAs far as money is concerned low\nIf I Need an operation or because there is a a problem with me I I really can't say well I'm not going to have that operation because I don't want to spend the money gets to me it's to me if somebody needs to this to improve the quality of their life\nThan uh I I'm not quite sure how much money would enter into the equation and when that doesn't to into the equation is there something you can do in terms of like helping people finance list that they can't afford it\nAbsolutely so there are quite a few people in my practice that use it a payment plan I offer an interest tree twelve month payment plan um\nAnd many people take advantage of that it makes it a little bit easier for them to afford rather than coming up with a big chunk of money they can pay it over the course of the year ...\nAnd if you'd like to talk to Dr ... it's a pretty easy thing to do you have to do is call her office at four O. one four seven five six one one six and set up an appointment\nWhether it be to enhance your current income four oh one

Beauchamp who's a pot of the board of directors from what I understand of course you've got the mayor who\nUh well we can't ask her to call show but uh you know there are some who can ah certainly shined a light on what is going on there and um I I don't know it's it's really a really really strange I forgot to check the Providence Journal this money I always check the realty transactions\nAh but I haven't seen anything yet\nAnd I always thought that all rent or real estate transactions were public and they were all published in the Providence Journal but I've yet to see anything in the journal are reflecting a change of hands of that property I'm On social corner\nOf the other thing we haven't heard of it there is a couple of months ago they said that they will go to a some kind of secondary education center and once I got\nYes I'm the mayor or the governor who happened to be in town this week um I I was reading the G A you know some of what she had to say while she was here she pretty much hinted that that's still moving ahead they have not selected\nAny site as of yet\nUm but they do plan to offer some kind of post high school education program here in the city\nBut there was no specifics\nSaying there was supposed to stand up to four million dollars on this postsecondary center\nI I don't remember what the dollar figure is but I Know they said they were going to try to uh I guess I'm a use the one in western ally as an example of what they could do here in one socket and I know that's a pretty big operation down in westerly\nSome thing if we'd all be screaming about the rise male academy and that would actually be that post secondary schools that's going that uh\nWell it's interesting you mentioned that somebody sent me an email this week and said that would be the perfect place and it's actually zoned for that type\nOf education a center you know that that building are in that area is zone uh from what I from what this person said for a post high school education setting\nSo that that would be interesting\nYeah boy would we all have mud on a faces\n[laughter] well from what I understand it's the mayoral charter school folks who are doing the work at social corners so but then again there's much that we don't know as I said I've never seen a project of this size\nUm with so little information no information at all I mean usually at the opening of an envelope\nOr we have a a story on the front page and pictures of the progress as et cetera et cetera comments from every politician on this side of the Mississippi um but this particular project is taking place in right under our noses and we don't even know what's going on [laughter]\nAnd that's pretty sad\n[laughter] well it's rather interesting that's for sure\nAnd file comment\nCentral grow this week yes how has it been a ... was ...\nIt's been a smelly this week on in the ...\nOh ... really it's been a smelly this week on in the ... area yeah ...\nWhen I say one by it wasn't chemicals was or anything but ... ...\nSo I don't know if that a malfunction or ... whatever they take ... take the ah the stuff out of the tankers us do is just a malfunction with the uh [noise] so it should have a play it but it was a puppy ...\nWho piecemeal on crumbling who wrote this week\nAnd investigation that I've been trying to push along I still haven't heard anything so I Believe and were called Monday to see if I can get an answer\nWell whatever you find out you let us know\n[noise] I well and hopefully he'll he'll put put on somebody's faces\n[laughter] well said [laughter] and on that\nHave a good weekend to you too thank you thanks so called by now open line conversation\nContinues on this Saturday morning we certainly would love to talk with you any topic at all\nThe new Sierra is proud of her record on one second city council she guided the approval of the largest private investment project in the last decade the middle school legislation to protect small businesses by limiting outside flow of vendors legislation to add\nMore relating on main street at a busy crossword she helped get needed equipment and our animal shelter Denise quirks cooperatively with her counsel colleagues to pass a tax payer friendly budget she loves her city and her work on the city council do move us forward please support the knee Sierra November ... protecting the interests of the people\nAnd talk about going down memory lane Larry a grassroots\nCampaign big time [laughter]\nHandling it really was like what we used to have fun\nWell we don't you know I have to say that ah and I've always said it I ...

I think ... is is I was I'm running against seventeenth capable of sixteen people and he he really went for the trope in in his attack\nWell he's the president now and I believe in his agenda which is ...\nFixing immigration and Larry immigrant illegal illegal immigration as has been an issue for a long long time and both parties get will do anything about that\nAnd that's what makes him a little different he's one of the few if not the only major candidate that has made this a major issue and it's not only this issue other issues that nobody wanted to touch with a ten foot pole so you've got to give them credit for that [laughter]\nWell you know that's what finally got me to\nSay okay you know I'm In with this guy I never watched his TV show not once Larry ever I didn't all I Know oh Donald Trump was I thought she ... which he does\nAnd [laughter] you know maybe he got hit plugs I don't know what do you know I'm surprised if somebody doesn't know that that they haven't come up with that [laughter] and and what\nThey've done to his wife is absolutely disgraceful but look at I started out by saying politics is a tough game it's a tough game he's got a thick skin but he does it you know\nThe Republicans were always oh they were very civil and ... and and they got their rear ends handed to them time after time now if I don't like um somebody for whom I voted\nI vote against them next time mhm and I go I go on TALK shows and blah blah blah and that's what I Do but at any rate\nRunning as an independent is not easy running we ran we run\nWe we're all a civic party but when we an independent group we\nWill then when we were we we had non partisan elections in this after rising costs so some of them even though everybody said they were Democrat [laughter] and appear that way on the ballot [laughter]\nAnd then about how about um alphabetical listing remember\nThem Oh yes yes yes at least they'll do that um that's a good question I I don't remember how that's done if it's done alphabetically but I remember when everybody would try to get to the top of the ... you know have that advantage of a last name that started with\nA day all your [laughter] some people even changed their name all I remember that too I remember and you know what I Love that woman she was\nAt the end she was she was gutsy out Kelly\nI agree with you them idea All right [laughter]\nI'm having a mass sense for her and the whole family this week so nice I well I\nYou know what is a saying in the Arabic church navy and memory and be internal ... it's a beautiful saying it\nSure is the main memory be a turtle by Larry\nBy by you take care of a good day thank you Bye bye open line conversation on a Saturday morning you may have a comment a trick the weather\nWN All right when the socket\nThis weather report is brought to you by sharing tree services we offer commercial and residential tree services including tree removal ruining\nStumped writing ran glaring and storm debris removal by focusing on a fish and sea and timeliness we strive for customer satisfaction call the experts call Sharon tree services eighty three eighty eight twenty three that five oh wait a day three eighty eight twenty three\nInto Saturday once again into the low sixties with a high around sixty three the winds will be around throughout the weekend bombing that tend to fifty mile an hour range and it will turn colder as Sunday approaches forty overnight Saturday into Sunday back to the mid forties on Sunday with a high only around forty six degrees and then below the freezing Martin Lawrence\nThirty degrees returned to the work week on Monday we'll top out around fifty degrees clear skies and sunny this is Jeff Camacho WBAI whether\nAll right right now we have fifty six degrees on the outside as we talk with you on a Saturday morning our phone number as usual\nSeven six six Thirteen eighty seven six six Thirteen eighty [noise]\nUm a couple of emails first one says whatever happened to signage regulations in the city\nTen years ago the city gave me a hassle for a sign on Park Avenue for my business because they said it was too big yet a huge sign has been approved for a new store on caster avenue\nSome maybe somebody who knows about scientists regulations can give us a call on that one\nUm another email my question today is ... L Brands supporters I have heard from several people that the plan is a four hour to get elected and then stepped down after a few months so that the council president can take his place\nI've also heard that John Brennan will be running for council president through the people that are voting for al ... know that this could be\nAnd so president to the people that are voting for al ... know that this could be the plan\nI Know al has said he is in good health but I've seen him at council meetings not standing up straight not even able to climb a flight of stairs\nThe mayor's office is on the fourth floor with no elevator access which should be interesting wondering what your thoughts are on this plan\nWell I have heard that as I said as well and um\nI I don't know I I probably would say that the people who are voting for al ... probably don't care if in fact John Brennan's up a mayor ... sooner or later\nBut then again al brand you know I I see him occasionally I mean almost every week he's in here at the radio station and um I mean he seems to make his way around okay and certainly a is a clear thinker and he's got a good mind um\nWell I guess it's a choice people are going to happen to me one way or the other is going back to the phones and the good morning Iran WN alright\nMorning Larry David from a cover like yes David how are you today good I have a trivia question for you okay\nI'm very much into reading history American history or during the ah we had and and I think a Seventeen sixties we were fighting the ah French and Indians and we called it the French in Indian War\nAt the same time the English and French were fighting in Europe and actually all the other colonies that were involved in those two countries were doing it you know the a name of the war in Europe\nAnd that's a good question [noise] ooh [noise] not off the top\nOf my head it's called the seven years or on the seven years or yes okay\nThat's where people get confused when I Try to associate the two wars\nThat's right the uptake actually different name yeah and but taking place at the same time yes mhm\nThen another correction I have to make I told you Gen John Hancock was the first I'm president of the continental Congress ... it was this ... of the second Continental Congress or first one was a a a Peyton Randall\nThat's coming up soon yes that is coming up soon Sunday November the fourth and you can tell them that are both monsignor gathering good shepherd that Larry send to I've spent the day yesterday\nAt monsignor gathering in the first grade yes boy did I sleep

up program has big gun and it continues until December seventh put your stuff out on the same day that your regular trash is picked up and it'll disappear\nThis week we found out that um the commuter rail service between one socket in Providence is about Eighteen months a way that's according to a Vin bono ahead of the Boston surface rail company\nThere are a number of interested in the people who attended a meeting this week at the train station at depot square also we heard from city hall that the outer state registered vehicle crackdown continues and um they've nail ... so far\nAnd the face to the crackdown has begun according to the mayor and the police chief we've had a call from a a one of our listeners who claims that\nWe found a call from a a one of our listeners who claims that uh some of his neighbors have I Would have stayed registered plates and they saw the most about the fact that they know the right people and they could care less if they get fined\nRather strange remark but uh we heard it a couple of times this week from somebody who lives in the north end of the quiet city of one socket nationally the big time you a topic rather is that migrants caravan with over four thousand at a\nI guess is moving towards Mexico I Know the Mexican officials from what I saw on the news this morning read in the news they're trying to stop this caravan from\nGoing through Mexico and the caravan members are determined to make their way and enter into the United states illegally very interesting situation yes very interesting where else in the world we're just seeing invasion force people to try and went through the country illegally [noise]\nAnd um then you have those who are saying well that's that's okay you open the doors and let them in\nI Will take my position again in my position is I have no problem with illegal immigration yes legal immigration that's what it should all be about\nMaybe you have a comment\nFacts matter Mr brand in two thousand and sixty ... rejected al ... and now he wants to be your mayor\nWho is he kidding just look at his record member of the city council it almost drove our city into bankruptcy chairman of the city investment board that lost millions of dollars in the pension fund opposed full day kindergarten oppose new investment opportunities that would lower your taxes\nPersonally involved in more than twenty law suits oh\nAnd let us not forget he opposed the revitalization of World War two Veterans Memorial\nPark facts matter and it's clear el breathing is not to to be mayor paid for our friends

president is telling\nThe federal government they pop and you want them to cut their budgets by five fat and I've been saying that the is now the state or to do the thing is we already know overloaded with fake ... twice as many as New Hampshire and that\nI read something and it was just recently in the paper\nWhen governor Lincoln alum and oh I'm proud to say it's a graduate of Central Falls high school I think class at Nineteen fifty five when he left office\nIt was over a billion with a B sample is in the state budget\nReally that was in the newspaper I Wish I cut it out now where it all that money go and I believe when millions if not close to ... trillion in debt a ... with the state of Rhode Island\nSo from a surplus to indebtedness a big changes huh and or what happened to that big surpluses the question\nYeah over ... billion dollar wild\nSo keep keep but what that saying people drive at the center of both and the state health and then the federal government ... when other people of Rhode Island on a wake up\nAnd that shows and other people but\nYou know it's not I would say the route Rhode Island voters quite predictable law you know you we don't have to really give it much thought as to how they're going to vote to look at the polls\nUm you know for whatever they're worth but I I think it's a clear indication that the it's the same old process here in Rhode Island and even with all those wonderful um [noise]\nA bond issues are the ones who writes bags you can rest assured every one of them will be approved because that's that's the way we operate in Rhode Island\nI I Know and we get more and more intact the interest yeah yeah they don't finish paying off the first on that and they put all\nBonds to lead borrowing money constantly borrowing money\nI mean can you imagine if you ... like that\nYeah you'd be living under a bridge somewhere absolutely that's\nRight yeah but you know I I don't understand why people it's not a bad to pay more attention to who they're voting for just because you see the names and the paper you know and they get a few little things\nFor our with well some of the a very hefty Rhode Island but I'm sure there's a lot more that could come here we had the right people in office\nNo don't hold your breath you know I Know they find a recognized and if it's\nAll those immigrants coming in I don't I wouldn't be too concerned about that 'cause it's a ... bad tells us you know they're not going to be um\nIllegal aliens they're going to be documented immigrant\nWhat's the difference at one of [laughter] just give it a different term right [laughter]\nI mean they both quite don't they they they not offense down they left right to the check point you know so you don't know what came and in that\nIn a yelling they're yelling and screaming that a vegan they're on their way to America and they're going to enter America and no one's going to stop them\nAnd Mexico was treating them pretty bad they were feeding them and everything but they had to keep going so I mean I'm Glad they're gonna set a\nVote for him when he was running for ...\nAgo not vote for him and not much less if he's running for mayor\nHave you ever voted for him because he's been around for quite a while I mean ever voted for him in the past\nUm yeah I think it was five years ago ... six years ago so vague that want to\nWhen I got to

and a woman says oh that's right on the British I said oh no I got to go all the way back in the beginning to get you know [laughter] but yeah I don't think you got things set up a little different exactly\nWhen Tim Bellingham last night and um\nI went and market basket oh okay\nI liked that store you knock it basket for expensive you know men do specialty store I go you know 'cause they go to them and they got market basket but not as good as a nice big store but chicken some of the prices\nSome other places are the same you can get at a place right or ... or stop and shop some of the things that were placed about the same\nYou know you know I Would say that price right it's very competitive and they watched their prices very very closely they have some good deals and the only bad thing about having a larger selection and they definitely have a more to choose from than they do or die\nLike a market basket sells the cook chickens like stop and shop and why not ... but I'm\nI'm a place like don't so cooked food the chickens and that so few things I don't have you know yeah but there are places are still good on other stuff right\nYou know I'm surprised when they had the opportunity to expand that they didn't know that they could in my opinion they could use a bigger store because they do have bigger store is a this I've seen what I Do I have I've seen some price rape story is that a larger\nThan the one in one socket and I for the life of me I don't know why they haven't expanded because they do very very well\nWhat do they have the room to expand\nWell one time they did if you remember when um when was the staples moved out next door to them that's empty for a while that's where Ali's is now a they could have taken that space if they wanted to know what I'm surprised that they didn't do that to be honest with\nYou know even I notice in Bellingham there's that many restaurants there is a um a McDonald's there and those two prizes yeah and I don't know why they should have made it all ... as a prize or on one side of the ... and one on the other you know while my daughter and uh\nYeah you know they're on both sides of the highway\nBack and forth to each side the shows are on one side the wall much on the other side a there's\nA there's a\nUm a McDonald's and there is another restaurant oh I forgot the name of it but it's like sort of show and that's the only two cases you have to if you want to eat them before going to the show or anything you know\nOne thing I find in that area is the traffic is very congested but that's a good problem to have I Wish we'd have some traffic congestion here in eastern socket you know with a more stores to choose from they've got a lot of stores a lot of people shopping in that area and there's a lot of the\nNavy there they got the Walmart they got the but they need another restaurant I say hey and lab I ... I went to Halloween movie oh my God the show was where when at ten o'clock at night after shopping yeah\nAnd they said it was going on all day it started in the afternoon Halloween with\nLike Myers and Jamie Lee Curtis huh one go my goodness forty nine of killing at it but I guess one casino with them mhm\nSame thing that I mean they you know they do the same stuff I guess it entertaining the story but\nYou know you know the final oh God it's scary to me you know\nYou know people like that especially at this time of the year\nTo me what that ... thing or are they making money on that movie and Jamie slow 'cause that that movie is what made her unpopular Larry yeah yeah and then\nWe uh go to Korea going nobody was before that because it is and Janet ... mother and father were mixed eyes start but they never played in a movie they played and I love movies and everything you know you you know\nBut parents were very very popular 'cause I I grew up knowing that a parent and\nThen when she came out I says oh that's just their daughter but then when she made that movie [noise] she got really popular and should that movie she made the best one forty years ago so this is forty years later and she's in this movie\nInterest you know you go to the movies often no\nNo just one hour wait yeah yeah\nI don't I don't go up and but I guess the young people do I guess the young but when you're dating you know you're not going to bring in a house or you want to go out with them or something they go to they go to a movie [noise] I haven't I went to the telling him but I haven't been to that\nTheater right and I'm now am old model on a you\nKnow with him on law what chat theater over there they have quite a ...\n... oh yeah right now the thing I never check that out yet you know they say they\nHave any kind that you can sit and watch them only you know the thing to do is they are very\nYou know there are some theaters too I've never been to one but there was some theaters where I guess you can sit down\nAt a table or whatever and actually a feature snacks ... lighten meal or whatever and watch a film at the same time that seems to be interesting\nLike instead of going out to eat before you go to the show I'm ... ... yeah [laughter]\nYeah some people go out to eat after the movies of the couples or something you know\nAnd now they're actually theaters where they have\nVariety of foods available at the theater in the sand isn't it interesting\nThat this was just a regular and they had the popcorn was seven dollars while trying it was eight something almost nine\nSomething but I don't get anything because we we eat is better to go out to eat\nBecause we have to go to that's what\nWe do you know not a bad idea [laughter]\nYeah yeah and then when I read but I guess they don't make that much money on them and make money on that than say a lot of picking up on the big big one is eight something on people buy it\nIs true that in movie theaters that's where they make their money they make their money at the concession stand because they pay the movie companies so much money to show the movies and that's not what you may\nWalk in the snow on\nYeah particularly on active and then and then I haven't I haven't I don't know about you but boy if I smell fresh popping ... popcorn being popularized the moon I Can't I cannot resist that meant\nThat literally\nThey make it makes you a Thursday\nIt's good that they're making money on that you know like you say you don't have to buy it you know right like the land um [laughter]\nI don't get caught

all I'm I'm Sorry that a lot of people didn't because they probably have anticipated a feeling of being at the a fundraiser for what it did very eloquently as he ripped busted the latest that from from Lisa\nThat a ... for his pension or a position um have you heard the yes okay\nA position um have you heard the ad\nYes okay so he went on and he went from one thing to another was either that or

him and his pension board or in the loss of revenue mhm and the loss of income\nI was not on the board I was not on any board I Would just attended meetings back then\nAnd Albert ... was there and

St ... on that little variety store on the corner where well a sign saying don't stop and no stopping and no parking right now they're all the time of evil violate\nThe law yeah I'm about to know what it boils down to yet to see anybody get ticketed\nThere right so one of those accidents or what have you because their own destroying the arrows somebody's in no way ... it'll be because of that mode takes the beat the drivers and get some of the action takes to be usually that's the case Laura's begun cost ...\nSo you know it's it's not right Larry but that's what happens if you're driving and somebody at your cousin orders to now you're going to take the bait and ... not not the best us another one talk bullies\nThat's usually the way it goes you know I see in a place such good valet parking and I see the valleys pocket and Akash ... first of all the traffic industry you can't get by taking away their parking cars on corners and under no parking signs and they get away with it voice look the other way why why is that ...\nThat was me or you can we talk to you get tagged you'd probably get tone and a business can do it and get away with it that's not right\nWell the other thing too is you got to be capital you'd want to clamp down too hot on the businesses we want to keep the businesses we have to get out\nIs that supposed to talk on the street going and that's supposed to talk or no parking signs on the sidewalk\nJust because it's a valet parking in the business as some clout with the when talking police such on may ... ...\nYou're you're you're creating a safety hazard to encourage a business that's not right\nYou know follow the rules I guess I'm going to follow the rules you no matter what you know businesses\nNice to have you got a business you've got to be easy on business but your cat later let them a threat to public safety well that's a good point oh and I walk a switch gas station that's coming along nice\nYeah I was looking at that the other day yeah and a lot of money into that bill yes yes yes they\nPut a nice stone work at the bottom putting Styrofoam laptop with a cycle looks real nice\nMhm yeah they they moving along slowly but yeah you can see the changes taking place every week\nAnd we did the roofing deck yellow rubber Rove air conditioning and heating system they come and go to that there wasn't much left to it was a bad bad shape mhm I Wish him well because they got a lot of competition in that area\nOur number is Bible eight eighty three one two one one man boy do we\nHave die or is it can be sure that the U.S we have tires tires and more tires that Charlie's be a good rigid Dunlop una royal Goodyear Michelin and Kelly dire as we have them at\nCharlie's back to the phones and they good morning Iran W went on a ride on in our hello there\nAre ... ... ... it's just getting worse and worse all the time they're having parties over here at night and um I couldn't even get up my street last night getting home\nAnd then um then I Do get home and there's kids running around in the parking lot with a ... a gas ... screaming at the top of their lungs they had some kind of a um Halloween thing going on over there\nI don't know how they are allowed to do this trick or treaters I out past eight nine o'clock at night ... yet they're allowed to disturb the peace and allow ... allow these degenerates\nTo like run around all over the place I don't know um yeah the last time I talk to you or the police were at my door\nWhich nothing good about my window at all I mean I gave him videos of of the kids\nAnd you've heard nothing at all huh\nNo they said that they caught the kids which I don't believe because I told him I Want it to press charges and I haven't heard of worried about it I think it's they just say and that's just to get the heat off\nThey they said they said that they caught the kids who broke your window\nThey said that they might have caught ... might have okay you know solve leading me to believe that they did catch from you you know maybe they didn't I'm I'm pretty sure they didn't because um after looking at these videos they said that\nIt wasn't clear enough to make out who the kids were I mean the cops note with the kids in the neighborhood I you know it it\nWhat time was this problem last night\nAnd they get ... O L weapon thirty was when they when they broke it all up and I call the police later they came by about thirty five of the hell no I mean unless it's another thing\nIs it's gotten the traffic's getting faster and faster on my street also ... the last night I couldn't even get up my street 'cause there was so many vehicles solved trying to get in the parking lot and everything and there's kids all over the place and nobody's supervisor and everything\nThey shut the lights off in the parking lot in that place yeah\nAh no no this they still have the lights on I mean there ain't down at the ground more but they're still you know they still slide my property so I it's not dark at my house ever\nHappened they chained off the parking lot so people can get in there\nNo no I had people pack their overnight to\nWhy I I don't understand why they don't they're not do why don't they just secure that stupid pocket in line I mean put up a chain so peaceful can't get into the hands of\nDuality at all administration over there it's really lame me they think that they they are above the law and they can do anything they want and nobody in the city council or the mayor is going to do anything about it because it's a nonprofit organization against one homeowner my rights do not matter\nNow the director where where is it still the same guy that it's been there forever\nNope nope they have a new director and I went to him when he first took it over and I said you know this is ridiculous about the kids playing basketball back there at two o'clock in the morning all that shouldn't be that shouldn't happen and I said well maybe it could turn the lights off are on a timer or something so they can come on if they say some\nAt at first it was like oh okay All right and then not that\nNothing was fighting me on it saying well also security lights no they're not security lights it's all a bunch of bologna nothing's been done where does he live oh Gary I have no idea I think he lives in Cumberland or something\nMaybe if I get his phone number and give them a call every time you can't get out of ...\nMe he he'd like makes it out like I'm I'm complaining about not because he he'd\nBe what else might cause now running rushed to cycle really odd to something about it now he's he's never really done anything\nSo you know I mean it keeps getting worse and worse over here I'm I'm not putting my window back in hundred and fifty dollars later which they should pay for because it was of vengeance I don't care what they say they said\nThey said it seems to be a part of the kids who just wanted to go around the neighborhood and create you know problems but they didn't break anybody else's where no they didn't break ins windows they didn't break anybody else's windows ... bunch of bologna\nAnd I think it's pretty obvious you are tired of it you know you've ... you've been targeted because of your complaining that's what it is\nYeah so if I put my window back and they're just going to smash it again I don't have a hundred and fifty dollars to throw at the window you know even even this window I being put me in\nPut me in a bad situation I think the city should pay for that window and I think they should monitor the neighborhood more because there's too much crime going on in the neighborhood went down but showing crime in Rhode Island says it say anything to anybody in this in the city you know I mean I'll bring it seems to be the only one that came as\nWell you know you bring up an interesting topic because I I Try to make a big issue out of this a few weeks ago the crime rate because the Providence Journal had a multi page story about crime in Rhode Island they had a full page chart\nBack on September sixteenth in the Sunday Providence Journal and it's certainly clearly indicated that one sock it has a very serious crime problem but you know what have you heard anybody talking about uh\nNope nope nobody wants to talk about it nobody help\nI'll tell you what happened the last time as I came home I came home with my trailer and everything and it was almost dusk and there was about\nTen twelve kids hanging around in front of the club which they do and ah by the way the last party they were all pie and in front of a club and I got pictures of the pie two different guys went out came out of the club and they paid on the building outside nice and I call the police and they never came ...\nThat was the last potty that they had that was like a week ago and it's becoming like every week so I come home with my trailer and I usually call across the street and then I back straight it\nSo the kids see me see me with a trailer one of 'em climbs on the back of my trailer right wow I'm backing up eight times on the back of my trailer and then\nLays down on the sidewalk where I'm going rate in front of my driveway and he won't vote so I just kept going real ... real slow you know finally moved and he gets up and he yells at me he says you're almost ... red mail but he didn't say for Geneva ...\nSo I said get the thought of away and so now there's ten kids all kids would be a high time out there\nThis is what I got to live with on a daily basis\nI don't know how you put up with it I really do not know how you put up\nAnd then they're going to smash my windows because I said something to them you know ... and nobody's doing anything\nThey're going to smash windows because I said something to them you know ... and nobody's doing anything about nothing here\n[laughter] I don't know what the answer is I mean you you have had this problem for how long now would you say the\nType of city that we live in this is the administration that's running the city this is how much they care about their their residence other hit Thirty years paying taxes and this is what I get I get annoyed with my place\nYou've limited way you've lived in your home for Thirty years\nYeah the last the last time a I got off the phone with you and I told you that that I blame and we support you know Chris Beauchamp called me and he's screaming at me how do you get up blame and blame and Lisa for this\nAnd I said you know I blame Leo too because I Want to Leo and asked him for his help and he did not that and I went to was from an odd way she did this to me\nShe did not that I look at it she said nothing that aren't so you know it's a no ignore the people when you have\nWhen you have like a nonprofit organization you know they count and nothing else they came into the neighborhood took the neighborhood over and screw everybody you know let them do whatever they want that's what it is\nSad commentary will listen to my friend I Hope you feel a little better that you've been to this morning if nothing else\nI had to come home from New Hampshire last night because I saw my cameras I shouldn't have cameras now at their\nLife's a motion activated lights on my on my property to\nCome all the whole from New Hampshire but my daughter's new apartment just so I could babysit my house and then I don't get any sleep all night because I have to worry about the kids call her back\nI was screaming obscenity in my driveway because they were screaming and yelling over there or without gas we'd walk around and around New Hampshire screaming out fuel after you know finally finally they brought it over the other side of the building or inside to solve them and then you know I call the police and they never came so\nIt's ridiculous I came to this day and night or whatever but anyway I Hope you have a better weekend\nWell thank you for sharing with us and I hope things get better but I'm not holding my breath thank you All right thank you well\nThat's that's unbelievable isn't it I mean something's gonna happen there and I and I I don't even want to venture a guess\nBut um I I I think this is would you agree that this is an explosive situation\nI mean this is the makings of something\nThat could really turn out bad in my opinion\nIs coming up next eight is a repeat of last week's show we want to make you aware of that so there are any references to autumn best or anything it is a repeated\nHave yourself a good Saturday and a good weekend I'll be back on Monday at four thirty you take care and God Bless\n\nBe able to hold on what you know from refund ...

[noise] I mean I thought that's Ron tax\nDollars just for [noise]\nYeah you're right and I mean if if as a homeowner I'm going to ask the city ... to pay for fifty percent of my home repairs if I Want to fix the roof and make it look good that really doesn't make any sense crash so I think that that is really unfortunate this fifty fifty plan that the city has\nAnd you said you know the weather's good we've got so much going for us in photography one of the things that the city doesn't recognize and this is why Ninety four percent of the full time employees in the city of Pataki at our white\nIt's that we don't recognize the language in the culture that we have in the top gets as\nValuable and special so we have stores in Kentucky where you sell goods their specialty ...

[noise] it's residents [noise]\nAnd taxpayers said\nThis is my wife died it was six years ago\nI was amazed that we had no security for our kids in our schools which way the world is a day and I am not sure if I'd been screaming about security or from\n\nAnd a ship that rate and things are happening because they'll they'll tell you the administration is because they are\nThey get down but I've been they lack the very first time I went to them and talked about security and national idea of just\nYou know you can go to Providence you know you're always you're acting white cannot me has shots socket where we don't have to travel so\nAfter one o'clock when the drinks stop now you have any of the day what Adam will still stay relax and talk and enjoy your friend okay we were all young ones I Know what it's like a joke is absolutely right\nReally ... our own city and stop the shot and shown okay you're going to say this administration I think if you get that money to put in their pocket you could ever anything [noise]\nYeah and I really like to cause idea okay with you on an idea that\nIs part of my philosophy will be part of my philosophy\nWhich is the harm in addition to this is one of the things I learned when I studied abroad and I lived abroad is you have to harmonize things with the people in the places around you so I've heard this from many business owners there's the sound ordinance and the city for talk it I think it's for nine o'clock\nBut right over the border in Massachusetts it's ten o'clock\nSo these um owners of this business it's a Portuguese restaurant and I think on Columbus avenue I think it's on Columbus um it's like a ... a big hall and sometimes in the summer they want to go outside\nAnd they want to have a good time and they want to play music and it's also a cultural thing if the woman was telling me the Portuguese people don't want to\nStop at nine o'clock and they ... they don't even show up 'til nine o'clock so it it's always a little later and they wonder well if it's in Massachusetts why is it ten o'clock and then it's nine o'clock and ... and I think you hit on it ... it's just because somebody's being selfish\nIn city hall they just say oh I Want this regulation to be my way\nNot the way the market wants it so it's a theme in Providence right if it's open till two\nIf the time of it is until two AM in Providence why is it one day I'm In ... that's not in harmony what I'd like to do is harmonize a lot of our city ordinances and a lot of our ah economic endeavors\nSo that we're not out of step with Massachusetts we're not out of step with Central Falls we're not out of step with Providence so Providence has a trash collection um\nSystem now that it's automated\nRight they don't have the garbage guys following behind the truck and throwing the bags and stuff like that\nThey've got an automated where the garbage a truck picks up the trash can itself in the dumps that you're just like the recycling so we've got to do that in ... why are we not doing that in photography because we're behind the times and we're not looking to learn\nFrom the other cities for harmonize our own policies so I think harmonizing\nBut talk its policies with the surrounding cities because there is a good idea and\nYou're absolutely right this way to change their own and I hope\nUs because you all know we need change I don't think ... or the state unless we change our politicians in our own citizens are half aside our own citizens that's where we can ever ended up changing more\nThan a sister city how about a sister city with ... why doesn't protect you have a sister city [noise] ah it it really\nDavid that way to change\nThings as we go like this has got to use a city ordinance and [noise] have\nAsk to change things in our own\nActually change things in our ordinance is [noise]\nIs um [noise] uh [noise] I Try\nAnd a better relationship with a couple of beer in the country a couple of years so I I Want to see some by some communication I Want to see some cooperation economically and socially and and culturally that Judah was already doing right that's right you're already doing that one
