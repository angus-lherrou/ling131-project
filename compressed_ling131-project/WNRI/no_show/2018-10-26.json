CNN got the biggest news 'cause then they cleared out the whole newsroom um I'd like it if you could address\nSome of the legal implications the FBI's investigating right now now this morning also apparently one was mailed to Robert Deniro actor Robert nearest restaurant down in Tribeca but what are what type of consequences legal consequences fall into play on something like this\nIs many many very serious consequences I'm Serious person out there whereas orchestrating this entire\nEpisode um fortunately all of these bombs exploded or cause any injury to anyone at this point in time I'm I'm sure your reports that bomb to all of stable and could have\nGone off of sharing the bombs were all very want a battery and design and um [noise] work very sophisticated\nBomb maker who are just not a lot of sophistication that at least they were willing to show more sophistication about all the legal side um\nLike the show maybe they have more sophistication about on the legal side\nUm [noise] this would be seen as terrorism so you're at a federal charges for terrorism I'm clearly it's a threat to us in some cases um [noise] well ... is a private set us up to the uh two former presidents have specific statutory federal protections\nUm none of that is correct me if I'm wrong I don't think any up and said just sitting correctional or set ups personnel to know I don't believe so so that would be a different crime or start showing up [noise] um and ... and the officers of sitting federal officials that was the most serious\nThe blessing of the Work City council um as you just said how can the tax payers end up there and the city council be kept in the dark about how money is being spent [noise] it's it's sort of ... to ... ...\nIt's really a secret agreement on this one is sort of not side and it was secret there was kept from the publisher was kept from the mayor was kept from the city council\nUm [noise] that's the only reason for it because they could have never got something like fast through one word prism through the normal collective bargaining process if they thought they could get it through under the normal methodology so but I think\nIn this case of so preposterous\nI I don't think they would have possibly throw up is um to the table for negotiation essentially it allows the as firemen to our crew on your sick time and to drawdown against a monthly as opposed to a yearly so if\nYou have enough time that you're building up but I think you can build up a hundred and forty hours\nInfamy out of work for let's say two weeks using your sick time get paid normally am jet upon his for previously and you're sick time so it's\nIt's it's kind of a double dip it it's counterintuitive that you can be collecting I'm sick pay\nAnd then getting a double ... pay on top of her for unused sick pay\nI'm normally you'd wait till the end of year to see how much ... times you would actually expanded and you wouldn't be able to do it every month federal laws for the firefighter to acquire far more and sick time but he might jet just he had to wait the whole year she had to wait for a whole year it's it's preposterous\nNow if the city uh chooses to go after the union and the individual firefighters I'm there could be a significant lawsuit filed for these firefighters to\nGorge or give back yeah money wrongfully\nObtained and that will be hundreds of thousands of dollars you know to some air and the city council have an appetite to go after what's typically one of the strongest unions at any ... right that remains to be a shame but this clearly 'em away here for the city to get that money back\nWell ... they were tossing around the\nIdea that it was I Love this idea of the high degree even though it's as you said it's actually secret agreement and it and then suddenly does make sense because none of the numbers are adding up and they try to do it on and on and I get up and then they realize like bullets because things were being practiced with not approved to ratify\nBut each going into the I think that these these individuals should have to pay the money back\nOh absolutely yeah no brainer that\nThat's a completely if it's not contractual there's no legal basis for if there's no agreement from the city or the town to make these payments um I'm not sure why it never showed up any audits or how it could have remains um invisible\nTo council members or other you know the financial officers of Warwick or you scratch or were they looking the other way or is it just buried in so much paper that say never quite saw it in for Ken Block and Mr Cody for figuring this all out\nCould this end up resulting in some kind of a criminal charges against those those individuals it\nIt's not criminal it's just that they had no legal authority to do it I mean it's neither have the ability to bind to the other and neither have the ability to bind up especially the polish skills were fired shift in heavy um authority independently\nTo bind to the city without getting approval from the city council right or at least of harming because all of a bare it's crazy it's it's not possible to do that\n[laughter] are you I'm just ... it is remarkable that the um if if they had not filed a grievance against ... interim mayor Solomon\nThen this whole thing kind of could have gone under the radar no one would have known but they don't know whenever you want to thank confident about it or did they actually found agreements when he stopped the program\n[noise] Oh yes a mare Solomon did the right thing have you stopped that\n[noise] well yes a mare Solomon did the right thing and he stopped\nThat and I'm not specifically familiar with the war firefighters you're near but typically is firefighters areas have\nUm a lot of hubris and I'm sure that they thought they were entitled to it right or maybe maybe check with their legal counsel as to the galaxy or an force ability of this but I think that\nThere becomes almost to an institutional a feeling of entitlement to these benefits whether they're legitimate or not and filing grievances sort of shows up a fish that's just a feeling we're entitled to this give it to us um I think they're going to lose\nA postcard afternoon ... Rhode Island ... he came up again that's just come over the wire right now Reuters is reporting Reuters news service\nInvestigators believe or suspicious packages to prominent Democrats went through U.S Postal service investigation is focusing on Florida so it certainly helps\nPainting read that it it they all went through the U.S postal service and the fact that they're focusing on Florida that would lead me to believe that you know just again through surveillance or\nThey start to go in if they can narrowed down in the area I I don't know when exactly but I Would I'd be very surprised if they don't have someone in custody I'm\nAt some point when the next couple of days I think by the end of the week I you'll have\nYou'll have your your person um that helps a lot for the ones who are the normal males and it helps if they've already identified a Florida is just kind of interesting but it's a flow ready am quite guess mailers packages from ... Florida\nThey all have the return a mailing address of Debbie Wasserman\nSchultz in Florida yeah [laughter] that could lead me to believe this to me who I we have no idea who it is\nBut I think it's it's some kind of not who's doing this at the brink not e demented Taylor thank God like a Unabomber Ted Kaczynski or Tim McVeigh\nI think when they find this person uh you know each probably beat him the usual nine\nYou know it was quiet kind of keep to themselves pay the rent on time either that or if someone's going to turn his life around but one of those he just like a basement dwell or not it somehow came up with this and thought it would be some kind of a budding print that again we don't know but I mean the fact that none of them get made him anything it seemed a lot of them\nWere never going to be able to detonate seemed to be more someone and I you know it'd be a twisted mind and they're going to be a heavy penalty for even pulling this kind of bring money seems to be more in line of that\nAs opposed to someone who is truly theories about trying to have a situation where someone opens a package and then it detonated a mailroom\nJob but if you look at last year when we had the um baseball's a congressional baseball attempted assassination\nShooter in that case was a volunteer I'm Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign that's right he was he was\nA well known leftist she fit the profile\nAnd your hair virtually nothing about that Association He was painted in the mainstream media is just sort of I'm not with a gun nothing about shows affiliation I'm a I'm a left whereas when this is packages came out it's like the left have talking points pre packaged typed up and ready to go on strike\nBecause they're trying to save his type of activity is all caused by the\nRally but Trump rallies\nAnd the themes ... she was giving off of the country which has caused and conflicts and\nIt's just interesting how one report when the ... the leftist saving this is all Trump's falls tips widely disseminated and when somebody on the left is during the ... D it's it's not reportage you've got to go looking for it\nYeah they can before we let you go finally I said you will have email a secretary ...\nExcuse me tentative secretary the Packer less Republican running it's going to go and he had a press conference the other day and he had someone come forward and basically present evidence\nThat his son went to where the secretary has this if you need a free voter ID card and its individual able to go when they asked for no proof preventing identity so he could have gone and said\nMy name is John ... put such ages where I live known or anything and just filled it out in a seemingly ... I had a press conference talking about that did a seemingly completely violate the letter of the law of how someone is supposed to be able to obtain\nThe voter id so I had to be printed material from last night and then also a statute that has to do with it and I am curious to hear your your legal opinion on that\nWell I think ... is certainly on to something or the statute regarding\nUm absentee ballots and voter identification as specific and I think had does cited and has a press release that I heard a little of his discussion with your last hour but we're islands since two thousand twelve has had a voter identification law\nDeal that they have right now at ... wine bar in Tuscan grill at all and you're going to absolutely\nLove it because the food is delicious gets so affordable I'm trying to pull ups more information on this credits that arrest but that shows that it's a complete they're right\nThere and I will get back into it but that shows the difference between the situation in\n... and the fact that under governor phone\nHe would not allow any legal like that but I'll get back to that a story in just a moment but I Want to remind you make sure you stop it and see our friends at temple a T.

John how are you\nVery well guarded ahead\nGo ahead or I or I happened to be listening today can always listen to you but when I Do I find it to be most interesting and I heard the other woman call I forget her name but I just heard or make a reference to history\nAnd she referred back to ancient Rome and the parallels of modern America yeah\nAnd you know I said you an email um that would capitalize they record ears or go down on a TV net or colder than smoke report and it was the uh writing a Nineteen fifty nine of one on one of the great alters Taylor cold well I'm sure you're familiar with her very much so [noise]\nNow the captains on the kings TV miniseries\nAnd so forth well she wrote this story and as a capsized audio version as well as visual which are detailed incredible saga of the beginnings and the fall of Rome it wasn't the empire that held it was a republic that changed to a democracy and then that became um a bunker a C\nAnd then that changed to an empire once in a nation becomes an empire as we did and torture wars then it must declined from within it must Adel itself or the burdens of the whole world and this is what is happening to America\nToday our borders do not exist anymore only had ...\nListen do you want to have a country and I we cannot allow that Caribbean to come into the United states\nI agree with you I'm just saying that they do not exist today and whether it's the Democrats primarily and many Republicans\nWho have gone along to get along you know they've just ah they obviously want free labor and they want they want their votes this is what it's all about registering illegals to vote and calling them legal and I don't trust the voting machines in Rhode Island under Nelly gourmet or do you\nAbsolutely not no no no way\nSo anyway my my point is you know not to believe or a bus and these issues transcend politics in my opinion they just go beyond just a you know political kingdom and America\nIs going to be restored again they'd a moral issue these are socially moral morally reprehensible issues where we have thrown God out of this country\nRight now by my outlet me the story that Governor among does husband permanent she's gotten sixty thousand a donations\nThen did work for Saudi Arabia they fingered poke dissidents in the country as a result of the work of governor among does has been any

somebody else so it was February of two thousand and sixteen and snow blanketed the ground here in Rhode Island making a\nMaking the deep black color\nOf oil all the more visible back in two thousand and sixteen where does the oil come from environmental police received a tip that oil was being illegally dumped at Seventy two Baker Street and wall property records show the multi family home was owned by then state Representative Joe trail oh\nAt the time Grillo told media that he never dumped oil that Gary Gallagher a former employee Grillo set in a statement that is technically true he never pull the oil into the ground he just ordered people to do it\nSo what happens here is that we get closer to the election trailer was on the ballot for governor if people are trying to say that he deliberately spilled oil on the ground in wall wiccan so therefore that should disqualify him as somebody to ...\nI don't even know why they're attacking them I mean these already done all the damage you can do ... and he is the way he is\nHe's not going to win he has completely made it impossible for Republican to win which fine so be it I guess\nUm the lies you getting any attack why is it him my people even bothering with him at this point as far as giving him attention so he jumped I saw him giving somebody the middle finger mhm that was a picture on like whatever wherever the new sources of that's\nWhy you harassing this man he's already done this damage he he did his job well he prevented Allen song from getting elected in what's her name Patricia morgue and she has her hand

campaign in Rhode Island you'd think they'd fall into place but no they they did not\nWell you know into that so they did their job they should be proud of themselves they turn their back and every conservative in the state and that is supported them by the way I mean Patricia Morgan is not my favorite by any means but there's plenty of Republicans in the state that supported her ... and you wonder why it's a dysfunctional party in the state of Rhode I can you imagine\nA somebody that was trying to unseat the governor Gina Raimondo right and she beat them in a primary that person then goes out and tries to do everything they can to make sure she doesn't get elected that's just unheard of so and and the Democrat Party in Rhode Island\n[noise] everybody [noise]\nWhen the socket Roger

price as it was two ... two years ago or three years ago when this endeavor was started by misty up so now the cost of this building has probably increased two to three million dollars just because of the delay which is really really sad because\nMr hip is the type of man that would have taken that two to three million dollars invested it somewhere else in our community he's not one to stop\nOnce he starts he keeps going\nSo I'm kind of a little broken hearted that it took as long as it did because I Know we could certainly use that three million dollars somewhere else in our community\nShow or maybe you don't want to get into this but um my impression is that didn't have to take\nThis long did it or not we're not so I don't know how how far you want to get into it because I you know if you get too far it would you could er ... the whole program again you know because of people um my water or unplug something\nViable I won't get into it but it is what it is and government most low no matter what it on a national level to level in a local level\nOrange so we could say without there being too critical that or could move faster yes right All right so but middle school project is I'm so to speak on rails yes okay\nAnd and uh I think one of the reasons you'd like to be ... to ... to make sure that it and other things um stay on track to\nWell and we're very like minded people where business people and once once you have an idea you it it just doesn't stop you just keep going\nAnd so now we're going to talk about a business well actually we were talking about business was of middle school so business ... business yeah but I'm knowing\nThe news for a long time as a business owner over a burrito company are\nYou a paid very close attention to detail over there I remember but clearly was talking about uh the commercial climate here in one socket uh we see all the ... be reopening there's a Greek restaurant that's trying to open on ...\n... new and and there is a commercial activity but the problems with commercial activity as our commercial tax rate and um and I don't think you think is low enough yet I don't know I Know I don't think this low enough\nIt's not even close to low enough to stimulate more activity I Believe me I'm very mindful and appreciative of of what is going on I I Do believe that as a result of what's going on nationally a Trump has been great and and obviously passing stimulus packages for small business\nTrump has been great and and obviously passing stimulus packages for small businesses are in big business so as a direct result we've seen an uptick in interest in our city I'm which I'm very very grateful for however we as a city I feel the need to\nAct on our own and reduce that commercial tax rate that's what's killing us\nNo one is going to tell me any different I ran a business here for ten years I started running a multi multi million dollar businesses here as a kid when I was twenty two twenty three twenty four years old it's always been commercial tax rate it's always straddled us and it has traveled us\nMore more than ever in the last decade and a half it's crushing the community\nAnd that the business community\nI feel as though and I know my colleagues in the business world feel this way as well what happens locally and and maybe not just once I get maybe we can say Rhode Island because Rhode Island is is poorly rated as a as a you know welcoming community for businesses\nUm what has what happens is once the state gets business they forget about business they only care about enticing new business\nAnd that is a very narrow minded way to approach things\nYou and I know Roger that small business and and most of the listeners out there I'm sure to they're pretty shocked a small business is the backbone to our community\nBut once we get them we forget about them we we keep raising their tax rate raising their tangible is raising their improvement ah improvement tax we constantly are in for the quick grab\nIt's very short sighted\nAnd that's one of our biggest issues here we need to take care of the ones that are already here I've been saying for three years [noise]\nDo you see me fumbling through some papers here I Do the right well the reason being is that um you\nStruck on something that is so for timely so yesterday um the chamber of commerce at a a meeting at Kirk re and they had the the two gubernatorial candidate say among and Raimondo and so he said the Mr fun and and this is\nPart of I don't know where you where you're politics is on on his uh uh election to governor but he said\nSmall businesses deserve [laughter] listen to those small businesses deserve the same level of attention if not more than the large companies because they like\nUh the same resources that's my focus some strategy on a continual improving our economy and focusing on us the Ninety percent of our economy but small or medium sized businesses and as a business owner myself I always feel like like it's always um\nIt's always the companies are\nLike a fidelity and a CBS and um and some of the insurance companies are ... you know everybody's talking about them but what about the little company so\nAnd right on the current tax breaks ... they get the benefits not that they don't deserve it but they they still get everything it yes right on track to business people think alike\n[noise] All right well that commercial trucks rate I Want to say one more thing so during the forum the other night I couldn't see where are you know I Know you were you were seated they're listening to some of the other a Kennedy said I was a way of the back but one of the candidates said when he was talking about the commercial talked for cutting it in the house\nAnd I said ... higher on you know so uh\nI I thought that the but you said are you didn't say that about the candidates have but you said we've got to reduce it and I think that has probably um what were you we can do and I I don't know can we reduce it in stages probably there'll be the only way to do it\nI think it has to be done simultaneously you have to wait for enough to come in in order to take some out of that ... commercial taxi ideally wouldn't it be nice\nI mean I Would love it if it could come in and slice it in half but that unfortunately isn't a reality when you have a hundred and forty million dollar budget that you have to ... that you have to utilize to run the city it's just not a reality um what we have to work on it it's the chicken or the egg thing you know what I mean we have to work on bringing more business\nInto the city so that we can take away some of that tax rate\nAnd we have other questions so for Denise\nAh and we're going to talk about our school system or in a moment and um we'll be talking about renewable energy and and other things or maybe economic development to up but\nWe want to mention that we've reached that stage in the program but if you want to say something where if you do to make a quick You're welcome to do that a seven six ... six hundred\nIf you want to talk to a dinner you saw this as I like I said unusual for the people who by the time to uh\nMake time available for incoming phone calls but your your your show Denise it is and we're going to do that All right so now that we've invited people to a call or let's talk about schools so while we were having our candidates forum the other night the school committee was meeting at the same time ...\nAnd the teachers guild was over there um\nAnd they um they're making themselves known though they're they're walking around without a contract and and so forth so I was wondering whether\nOr not just I'm just going to give you the subject of schools you can talk about some of the issues with the schools like attendance graduation rates or you can talk about the ongoing negotiations with the teachers\nWell obviously I Would like to see that resolved we have a three million dollar shortfall coming up in the next two years and we haven't solidified what is happening with our teachers that's obviously of the most important um everybody knows I'm not run school committee\nI at city council but what I Do realize is that our schools have a direct impact on our local um half a local economy home homeowners homebuyers so on and so forth um I have a lot of ideas on what I what to do with schools\nUltimately I don't I don't know that we have the right formula overall uh the problem I see an end link discuss hit it right on the head um during her speech at the forum when she said\nOne of the biggest issues is is we have a high rate of poverty that is true but however our curriculum is designed to same exact way that's bearing ten is the same exact way that new and mass is the same way that the the wealthier communities are\nWe yes it's true that we are curriculum has to be the same way we teach math science English\nAll all the core issues but I think what we're missing\nAnd how we can give our impoverished that I'm tired of that word but our impoverished community a leg up is what I think that we need to expand more on our on our interactive programs I co ops\nI've talked to a Roger pick out about this and I'm really excited about meeting with him after the election because I I Do have a great idea\nNow now I just really want to thank everybody from the bottom of my hot all the support 'em and I hope I can count on your support on November sex I'm I'm really looking forward to dig in and ... and working\nAh right

time and making the time to uh to do the job is state senator and ... then we just sort of got onto the subject of our senior community\nAnd um and of course we ran out of time these a Fifteen minute segments so up because I collect those go so we want to pick up there but we've got some other topics to talk about but but seniors I'm a senior\nI'm One of your constituents from as a matter of fact ah I'm In your constituent a neighborhood for a set of district twenty four ah what can you can you do my crowd\nWell I think that it is just so important that we protect our seniors and as our duty as legislators to make sure that the programs\nThat provide seniors with the ability to stay autonomous and age in place with dignity or just really really important um programs that help seniors\n... afford their medication and I don't think that anyone particularly someone who has worked their entire life should have to ever choose between having to pay for medication or having to pay for groceries\nOr rent or any of their other needs and we've all heard the stories of people like maybe I can go one more day without my medication I I Can't pick up my medication till friday or that it's so expensive and the types of programs that protect\nEnable people to be able to afford to live comfortably need to be protected\nAnd you know a as a senior not all seniors are interested in in a a meal site although that's important too is very important\nAnd not all seniors are interested in line dancing a bigot that's important to them all but I'm interested in the topic that you just brought up I'm interested in the issues that seniors have to do that really\nHit the pocket book because when your pocketbook has hit is a senior your quality of life diminishes so those are the ... and I

Smith of the matter with a kid who admit but it's still a long time we'll put a subway good morning Lynn Good morning or what we do a informant here is ask you to review what you do with all our offices of mock Smith them and some of the things that you do not do\nI'd be happy to wear a general practice law firm but Mike Smith and I each focus our practice in different areas of the law mock Smith focuses his practice on areas involving litigation both civil and criminal civil litigation is any I'm just you can imagine being resolved by a judge or a jury in a courtroom [noise]\nUm it can be a business disputed this contract dispute dispute over real property maybe boundary lines or or purchase in sales agreement gone wrong or about to go wrong but the lion's share of the cases that he deals with our personal injury cases where people suffered an injury or damages\nAs a result of the negligence of another and that can be a malpractice by professional like a doctor another lawyer dentist\nArchitect nurse accountants or any profession you can think of\n[noise] or it can be um a defective product it's introduced into the market the causes injury is probably\nBut the charge you a sliding scale fee so you see maybe nothing or next to nothing um\nAnd Rhode Island um ... association also has a referral service where\nTheir attorney so we'll take a reduced or no fee into it pro bono to represent you in bankruptcy court and you can ask the court it's called informal ... where you can basically petition the court and say I'm too poor to pay the fee\nSo can you wave filing fee those were options that are available are available to you can list all your creditors indicate that you have no source of income to pay them and that you want to discharge\nSense like if you have no assets and you're just collecting SSI you'll probably qualify financially for a chapter seven which is a straight liquidation\nIt's hard to if you have any source of income it's usually ... like a working source of income job it's hard to qualify for a chapter seven anymore um but it sounds like you might qualify that's an options available to you but again there's going to be some cost you you really going to be paying the lawyer the attorneys' fees\nOr the attorney fees the filing fee or both [laughter] um the other option is if you truly have no assets and you're only source of income is that's that's why\nYou can let people just pursue you for the non payments they'll bug him on the phone you know the phone calls eventually they'll file suit against you they'll get a judgment against you can they collect against you know you have no assets and they cannot attach SSI in order to satisfy a judgment\nSo essentially they'll have a stack of judgments against you\nThat they can't collect on now and you meant win the lottery they can collect when you get a job if you get a job they can collect [noise] if you inherited house and it's in your own name\nThere'll be able to attach the house later on with regard to those judgments\nBut for now simply ignoring them [noise] um there's not much they can do to you and it later on or should you be successful and get a job or an hour to house to win the lottery they can file for bankruptcy and get rid of all those judgment leans\nThat's another option is available so essentially you can do nothing and they can't do anything to you or you can be proactive and filed for bankruptcy and get rid of all that that it depends on how much you want to spend\nIn order to get out from under and just feel like you can breeze\nCarried on a final question in the morning or I don't know exactly oh I see where it came from focus on law or um website I Would like to know if I Will be eligible for disability and the near future\nI've been diagnosed with 'em so you saw it right to when I started to do a disease I'm\nAnd Kenya lower office helped me applied for disability benefits or something you do over there I I've never heard much about um disability\nIt is not something that we do as a practice it is a very we call it a limited bar there's a certain amount of attorneys that practice in that area because the\nJumping through hoops you have to jump through to get a a disability application through successfully are so numerous um that unless you do it every day it's very difficult to be able to jump through all those hoops\nNow you have two options so you can apply yourself on line there's a process that she goes through um the Social Security department website\nAs I say dot Gov I think [noise] um there's a process by which you can apply yourself and there are certain conditions\nUm there's a process by which you can apply yourself and there are certain conditions that automatically qualify for disability and if it's ... it's called the blue list I think if you qualify from and have one of those disabilities\nAutomatically almost automatically qualify for disability however if you do not have\nOne of the um situations it's listed on that\nThat a list you're going to have a little bit more difficult to qualify as a result we don't handle those cases we prefer to refer them out to somebody who does that type of work every day it's very familiar with the process very familiar with the farms breaks and lawyer with the people\nIt's been my experience that you usually don't get it first shot off and have to take an appeal and once you take the appeal then you're often successful is being able to get disability provided you can demonstrate that you cannot work in any way shape or form and that's basically the standard um you can be crippled\nKind of like me with my arthritis and still not qualify for disability because you can perform some function\nEven though we have limitations um\nPut his little more difficult to to difficult to get disability than some people think it is a ... my suggestion is that\nIf you want to apply to your own that's fine but do you prepare that you're probably going to get denied unless you're on that list your your disability on that list and then you probably won't want to engage an attorney with regard to the appeal ... engage them right from the beginning it just makes more sense\nI did a couple of these when I first started to practice many many years ago didn't really care for the process to never really learned a whole lot about it but as I recall unless things have changed if you were successful in pursuing an application for Social Security essentially\nWhen you do qualify for Social Security disability Social Security pays her lawyer you don't pay your liar so you really have nothing to lose if you truly believe he'll qualify and you're actually believes she'll qualify there's really no\nRisk for you because the lawyer will be paid in the end by Social Security so it is certainly worth consulting with someone if you want a referral for someone with regard to Social Security\nTo call the office seven six nine four one to zero I'm not going straight that back then I have to go to city hall but the lady who answered the phone who's there today is Brenda she'll be able to give you that referral if you do need assistance and you want to consult with somebody\nIf I Need a lawyer\nOther than Social Security or divorces please feel free to call the offices of mark Smith underestimate so location is where you find me and the number there is seven six nine four one to zero or you can try to reach mock into Providence office the number there is to seven to fourteen thirty two\nAll right well

I'm a\nGames coming up to three games over the last\n... yeah what do you go out for me where do you think well\nI think that by the way I had a life and the other night and the night and\nThere was a show that I was pitch a as the red Sox lie\n[laughter] you would I Would be a nightmare right now I'll tell you what\nGreat and crush or you take the name off the back of the Jersey and you wouldn't I mean he wouldn't have been torn press I mean he was All right ah and then this other kid they pitched in game to a real rural he was a he was somehow confusing them at the beginning with this or would that curve ball and and and the high fastball the mixture of the two but\nIt's it's it's a matter of time on the is sitting there watching it and you don't want to get complacent and you don't want to get 'em arrogant at all but you're watching it and you're thinking to yourself\nI'm arrogant at all but you're watching it and you're thinking to yourself even if they're getting them out early in the game you're you're saying to yourself the next time around he won't be able to throw that pitcher they won't be able to to get a you know whoever it is ... and you know second third time around but by the time they get into the bullpen\nIf somebody on and on and on every night it's somebody different the other night it was known as a pinch hit home run the next night Vasquez draws a walk\nYou get ... tend to be with a with a full extension you looked like Michael Jordan in the outfield going for the dunk making that catch and you've got Steve pass a drawing a big walk you Jay dean base head to head off though I mean literally when you look at a championship team and I know you and I have seen a few\nThis is what defines a championship team it's not one guy it's not you shut this guy off and you when it's everybody's different on every given night you're seeing somebody step up\nCamera looks better I Can't say enough about what native all these been able to do for them in the eighth inning can you believe how smart those days darn Brodsky look if you were to listen I Hope you didn't listen to me and I know I was mild compared to the other talk show hosts here and in local sports radio but\nEverybody wanted to take a shot at Dave Don browse ski he didn't go out and get anybody in the bullpen we didn't go out of that we didn't do this we didn't do that\nEvery single guy that he acquired has had a major role and their success I'm Talking about Nathan of all the Steve pass or you go to um even in Kansas or the other night base at the world series I'll be I see what you want\nA and Alex Cora literally like the like he's got the answers to the test every single movie's been mayor\nNow going back to you going back to your question three games in California or your comment we got Walker viewer tonight against Rick Costello they're gonna you know Dave Rob's handcuffed himself with this line up that he he chose to go with with two straight games\nNow you're going to see to it at that I hit his back in there on a regular basis it's going to be different going against the righty I don't know if it's going to make a difference and the other big question coming in is JD Martinez ruled his ankle pretty well pretty good and I know he played and I know they're expecting them to play but there was this big thing we talked about about him playing the outfield\nAnd ... moving a second I don't\nKnow if that happens now I don't know if if if his ankle is that bad I don't know if he starts I don't know if you go at your regular outfield and you have them on the bench to come in and hit when you need 'em too and you can double switch if that happens\nAnd move ... second but with his injury that might be a no and void ah that conversation might be might be new at this point I don't know if we're going to see that tonight they ask Cora and he said you won't see monkey at second and then he can he hesitated and he said at least not to start so I don't know what we're gonna see\nJoe the are the three games the temperature is going to be Seventy days agrees to be a big difference ... Shaw is absolutely\nA also a we've got a ah ah what's his name but I\nFear Costello tonight and ... and you're thinking evolves the but a little surprised that they use them\nFor two except for games one and two out of the Penn but I was listening last night and really you know these guys do end up throwing Thirteen fourteen pitches in between and he's got a day off so I it it wouldn't be it it's still wouldn't be unlikely that he if he hasn't announced it already that goes for settled with all the I Know there was some question\nA but I'll tell you physically from being their game one um they were never really in that game there was a minute or where the game was close I think in the fifth inning when they had come back and gotten the runoff sale and there was a couple of LA fans behind me that started to try to get into it but they will quickly snuffed out\nBy the Boston faithful um the crowd or the weather that night just everything that it's everything that is Boston came up and uh\nEverything was that was aligned and and you wonder how that's going to play for them in Los Angeles and and let's not forget to this team was there last year entered into a game seven\nThey were ... and remember last year they were they were off last year there was a team that ran away with it record wise all year last year if everybody remembers the Los Angeles Dodgers were the team that beat last year and you know nobody believed anybody would beat him and then Houston beat him which was unlikely a\nAt the time and it was the big story with the hurricane and it was a great you know feel good thing that they were able to do that ... are at the last minute\nAnd that that pay dividends for them but I mean you you you you you it's easy to forget how good they are with how these first two games have gone so that's why that's why I'm Glad you bring that up and I do want to caution everybody yeah ... it's not over but you look at it on paper\nAnd I don't know what the Roberts was thinking game one I understand the game too I don't the wind up he went with to not have Muncie in there to not have a ... ah you're going to see it tonight that's\nIt that's another good point is gonna be the best line up against that ...\n... and again like I don't\nScore is going to manage this J. D. situation that I think is the only tidbits juicy on our end of the thing and and like I said too hot to believe\nThe ... that's juicy on our end of the thing and and like I said too hard to believe and it's I'm not I'm not prying about this or Saturn in any way but rock hoped to my recollection hasn't laid yet\nLife ... law and then a little bit more on and off for about an ad\nThat and I think he finished the game defensively but just showing you how loaded we are oh yeah and and and you know the big thing was are they going to panic and not want to take J. B. J. out and he did get ahead or in game one can earn games to kids who got thrown out at third are trying to trying to ... you know stretch it but um\nKnow you take out then attendee makes the catch you can't take ... to me of ... suspect I mean I don't know if there's no the HDL roll the dice and keep ... and on the bench as a weapon to\nYou know at Avi by I tell you it maybe you don't agree with it in my right to this point the tourist areas and then she'll give us on flight shine for me how the red Sox I'll shine your opponent or there are ... ... it gets really meant so much\nAnd they want do you want to J. D. out there and so I don't want to mess with that and and and and do you want him out there with if there's any kind of ankle problem I mean it it would be one thing if if he was the agent with this ankle thing and you had to take somebody out\nBut this you're putting him in the physical feel the play where you know all I remember what happened to Blake fly hot and the ... uh two years ago and he and Chris Young and a lot of guys\n... routine plays turned into a\nYou know DL stance and and in this case it would be to not be able to continue in the series so\nWould say and it would not be a popular thought right now and I'm not overconfident at two o but how bad is this an ankle and depending on the severity of it the arrest bringing him in and the fourth or fifth standing as a pinch hitter\nAnd double switching moving somebody over in the outfield to send our moving ... to write and moving moving a movie to second to me it's not crazy to me but it's\nNot your caller your last caller made a good point of a we have a deep enough bench way you could sell their but after that you could play that you know I don't even get to take up when he thought he could come out and you got some of your pay check the nationally known to tell us much else who\nAbsolutely and the national league game you know the national league line up it's always interesting to see how they go seven eight nine ... that they put the pitcher eight and\nIn our case with poor soul pitching\nAssuming that that the outfield as intact as we know it or even if Jay deeply seeded and that's the big thing of JD plays that my point is null and void but would you put ... would you put your cello eight Jackie nine\nMovie one so that not only can pour cello hit but you really can't touch around you know you you you have you have this random Jackie after him and then ... like they've been doing this\nThis kind of like bubble lead off thing that they've had yeah I like that I don't know what you do a and Vasquez too is giving you good at that lay on I don't know catches it's going to be fascinating and I don't know if like I said if you see ... ...\nAh because it's Walker viewer pitching it's going to be interesting to see how he does this lineup card and how Jay defense if he starts who are you sitting monkey or been into not ... or ... or J. B. J. more you're not coming out no matter oh\nWell you know when I call your mind that I have a light face right now I feel like the picture that concert made a loss is tonight I Am not afraid of ill and they'll crush orange crush your ... but I just don't think I'm not afraid of it right\nNow I Want a price on short rest Sunday against or shot in Seventy eight degrees to win the world series one of the thing that would be for him if they can get one of these next two and ends up with him with a chance to win this thing and then if they don't do it they come home with too much rise\nOn your ...

I mean and I and I had it and I'm going to play that interview from June when I when I uh for Santa exactly what's happening now and I said to him you know you're you're pitching really wow I think you know on\nYou know he didn't want to say it at the time of course he didn't but let me ask you this I think general is gone\nThe take Frasier or do you make involve your clothes or how about Joe Kelly how about your Kelly's the only Red Sox pitcher in the postseason that has not walked a batter imagine that narrative Kelly is locked about or in the playoffs\nIt only it was rocketed Charlottesville polling violent I was thinking closer for him and I used to I knew he could get on it I knew it was it you know it was just something you were going through a yeah I wouldn't take a closer evolving maybe but I Do not want to give up on his you\nKnow I don't either and he can give you more as a starter enough more valuable but if the novelty of kimbro being able to throw a hundred miles an hour\nWorn off now that we're seeing that from raise your ... from Kelly within that from evolved the you're seeing that you know league wide now everybody seems to have a guy like back in Ireland\nStuff is going on there still find a guy out in the odds\nRight so to me you're seeing I think the last the law a few guys and that's why ... why when you've been listening you know I've been saying at all yet after when at this year\nIt doesn't mean they're not going to be a good team next year and be competitive\nBut you know there's they they caught the the wind caught the sale at the right time and they took off and it's just one of those things you can dial it back to that Yankee series\nA boom next a couple of different decisions things go another way that goes five sales going with the way he was not you know you can you can spin there's so many ways and they'd be they'd be playing golf right now it's just the way that the the cookie crumbled and and they they just stepped into the rate you know for the whole time\nBut you know I'll give it to him on the last couple of ... but I don't want them back I don't care\nI ... and that's why am I going to be more and more that are waiting on line but one question before I let you go eighth inning tonight for the two Red Sox um pour sell those coming out who you're going to are you going back to evolve the who went to ...\nI like your idea I take it all the take my chances shaky chance I gave or if you're a real yeah absolutely going to kill and I just want to say one quick thinking ahead the red Sox pull\nSomething I've always believe if I have a choice between a gene is a lot of over in a social ... a team of the great defense hip to share with the ... every time especially in the playoffs\nThey show you how to play small ball\nThey can hit the big shots can pitch and man they can play some defense and uh they can dial it up and they've been they've been really\nComes down to defense and picking when you're at the end it's Cora it's abhorrent\nGot an individual basis each one of those guys it's like he's their older brother and they don't want to let them down and it's not like fallow last year you don't see the face\nYou don't see the attitude you don't see the disgusted nature of these guys are bought into this guy it's like they're following a cult or something I I it's it's a bad example to say that but they are all like\nYou look at them and they're all like in a trans whatever he says okay and work and I let you go All right my friend ... when a good morning you're on the joke show\nHello you're on the show are you there hello can you hear me um I I hear they're okay with\n[noise] can you hear me\nUm I I Am I K we'll going to try and back then somebody was there and they waited and then they weren't ready and uh we'll give you a chance to get ready and call us back because\nWe're all about second chances like David Price and Ryan ... you will need a second chance to have great pizza for the first time and one of my friends are local a pizza places here and I'm Talking about the lumberjacks\nJoey gallon here people who love pizza love lumberjacks pizza seven six nine P. I. E. S. is you take out an delivery number missed algae lovers Porter are lumber Luna pizza step up to Seventeen different specialty pizzas but there's more than just pizza Rhode Island's best wiener is just a dollar fifty each loads of salads\nBut our score is going for the jobs that night and I made this point on the people\nHe's done a great job in terms of going forward tonight but also having an eye towards tomorrow if that makes it does he knows\nWhat any coordination of all that said wandering records so want any for a\nA Chris Sale back and get you stadium right you know it's not like he's asking these guys to go out for me you know like stabbing themselves whether NATO because he knows that he's going to eat them it got dark appoint police record the covered for the sake of you know depleting the line up down the line incense\nTwo quick questions and I know what you mean I think that kind of sums it up as far as how he's been able to make the balance um if they're up for the two tonight in the eighth inning\nDo you go to a ball the again and not worry about game for a and go and go for game three to go up three oh or do you think he goes back to the conventional Barnes raise your some combination of those guys Kelly's been unbelievable as a walked anybody\nI said I think personally I think you would say they've already cut I and I say this because you know maybe the prospect\nThey're starting either at ... or ... just argue Palmer answer was at this roster scary to me going to a game park okay I think you have to maybe ...\nMaybe this was just this one time and I'm and I'm saying just wants to it because he made fun of all he has been lights out as a starting pitcher drop these playoffs I Know you've got a great job in this quote unquote rover with the new term coined by Alex Cora ... but uh it just uh I think you would say that I just go with\nYou know Jill Kelley are certainly emerged in the playoffs then a great guy auction why not ... like in the wall that are\nAllergic or use out of water reuse and gave one when they\nCame up right that I got him he was ... you say I'm In a situation like that you certainly have options available as the day off every place there should be crash save a ton of all the tonight and then you know what why do you start to bottle which you know who knows a vehicle that your\nHow 'bout how 'bout uh will be two two part question I ... and we know we've got to get going here which will be secret sail again this series a and B how do you feel about the possibility of David Price on them on Sunday with a chance to win the world series\nI mean I I Me personally\nI think it would be great if you saw David Price on them out on Sunday because I feel like he's got so much for like flip the narrative on the guy you know it's a rare yes and also he's barbecue Vaughan yeah after being for nearly three years us like you know a curse word almost right now he's\nYou know she slipped the script yes he did the job of juice to any follow up the other night I thought that was what\nThe performance they didn't use that in a Clinton game but you get all of them in ... in the world series and he's done that and now he's ... and now he has confidence and I think those ... those two things together and that's what they're probably probably always sought\nWhen he came to drive the red Sox he wanted to be a lot of humanity received and now what do you get to perform\nHe's dumb to performing and dial the adulation as comedy goes way\nAs for Chris Sale\nYou know maybe this is this is or if it gets to a game five how about this you start Chris Sale and that you're bringing the price like say because Chris Christie fail right now you know we don't know what he has health wise you know a\nScore raved about his stuff the other night it's going to have you the best in the playoffs yeah what am I went for reading it once again it's not like he's out there for a while\nBack up on yeah walked out of the ... backup plan than a than a David Price at this point and that the baby keep those a righty but that's on the ... over the past on the bench I should say\nI mean do you make a good point um last question I mean are you going to go we overlooking at all possibly the Buffalo Bills scheme for Monday Night or are they as bad as they look on paper\nThey look pretty bad I feel for what is that they are going to their advantage there will be behind them because it's Monday Night the set\nAnd are they are\nThey they certainly if Rob Gronkowski does why they certainly know how to guide to get under his skin a little bit witnessed the game last year in Buffalo great I'm Glad you know I just uh\nI feel after the patriots cutting off like the way they get to say the last second white and having to fight tooth and nail to get out of Chicago what the way I feel you know this is almost\nA pie week you know before before our in our town next week yeah\nYeah ... is our next week yeah if I feel you know you got to take care of the early ... like that hang around\nYou know if we buffalo you'd never know they certainly are in sort of a Jekyll and Hyde mostly I guess jak so to speak or anything or we'll see what happened but I feel like you know what you saw it on the patriots when\nI got ya and how Bo locally I Know you've ah we've been talking about a local high school football and how early this how quickly the season went by and ending soon and other stuff locally that we you want to let us know about that we can find in the pages of the times and end the call\nCall I I was I Would like to tell people that check out today is all kinds of calls for\nRockabilly story where we talked to are your people that are close to him a than a\nHigh school football lies you know we have this last regular season and division one division two that I I I think all the games it sounds like they're being bunker to watch tonight because they're predicting what monsoon than everything else Carl Marx or\nYou know for all that you're going out at Wesleyan watched every job or not that hard their own it's a hundred and five nothing in the last two weeks\nYou know it's that's probably the longest cost right from one point to the other states are horrible down to watch to lay off but uh\nYou know the paper that should be a ... ... what socket wrong like you know ... and Charles Koch they've had a very good year after year contract because I'm On the record for playoffs marvel there's a lot lot going on a lot still up for grabs and a lot of it all covered in the pages of the times and the call\nHe's the best that it locally and die he helps us out and does a great job when he comes on to give us analysis Brenda McGee here ladies and gentleman a brand new we appreciate it and I try to stay dry tomorrow and now we'll look forward to talking to your next week and hopefully talking about are remembering a wonderful season in a in a World Series champion\nAbsolutely Joe a well a talk again next week back so much you got to my friend thank you sir I Know that yeah good morning you're on the show\nThe ornate Joe this is Dave calling I Will use have it's always good to hear your voice send a following Brendan I'd I I always love to get another good a good boy sign hair and a good opinion and what are you thinking about this morning you thinking a patriot you're thinking Red Sox what's what's on your mind the month so I'm like I'm going\nI I'll tell you what Joe take that didn't Rocco doors small ... that was the Sox\nYes he did he played with Tampa Bay and he played for one year with Boston\nThat's what I thought I thought because I I think I can remember what senator or right right\nYeah he well he probably I'm not sure he probably did both I'm In the brief stint here he was center field um initially and when I remember when he came up\nAnd I remember that he came up really quickly once he had gotten drafted by Tampa I and then as you heard um with Brendan eat that variety of different coaching\nJobs and duties and coordinating with them and uh I wasn't aware until hearing from Brendon that he was so highly coveted by all these other organizations that are looking for manages I was surprised when I heard the news yesterday pleasantly surprised that he had been hired\nBy Minnesota but to hear that he was actually ah in the works to Cincinnati for Texas for Toronto and that that was the guy that everybody had their uh their finger on a says a lot about what he uh what his reputation as in the game\nThat he had a couple of years if I'm not mistaken I I'm trying to go back I mean that's\nTwo thousand ten thousand eight American League championship series he ended it for ah for the red Sox by getting a hit 'em for Tampa in two thousand and eight if you go back I he was part of that team and a and a great part of that team and uh\nYou know obviously injuries and and different things got in the way of him having a longer more successful career but you know not too many guys\nI can say they hit a home run off Pedro Martinez encourage young so I I just started my own eyes so that because I\nKnow but he had um I I'm not sure if it was a backer yeah that's that\nYou turn his knee I can tell you that for sure that he tore his knee and I know he had he had a couple of other odd different health things that that were ah were were plaguing him now where um they that he was it was tough to overcome and otherwise we probably would have seen you know who knows a but he definitely was cut short by injury\nAnd it's always great when you see a talented a young athlete type player\nThat has that unfortunate situation where they do get a career cut short by an injury or circumstances like that and then they're able to still be\nA great manager a great coach and uh like I was saying with Brendan in an earlier caller Steve we're seeing a movement to have these these much younger men and women for that matter are involved in in coaching and he's been jobs and you know it used to be that you know if you were young you wouldn't even be considered for those kinds of things but now it's not\nUncommon you know late thirties early forties you gotta had coaches in and all of the pro leaks\nThat's right and not only that but I mean he's a local guys you know what I mean I mean ... you hit it right on the head I mean how many guys that we have we seen come out of my say Charles\nIt's an ill that you know\nIt's it's something to see ah I eat I Know first hand from my time in high school of two guys that three guys that made the NHL one guy that made the NFL how one guy that made major league baseball a rape just coming right here on the northern Rhode Island southern Massachusetts area or in\nForward and I'm not worried you know and Brendan at the obviously knows probably knows a lot more than I Do a bow baseball he does a great job at what he does and he may be right but for me\nI'm OK if they do bring of all the end and they do start Eddie Rodriguez ... tomorrow because you know if you don't think you're going to sweep\nAnd he ended up losing gain for ah but you don't have to use all these other guys in Europe three one and you've got price sale and all you both I mean to me it's more a victory is more important than than this is kind of been the theme of the show we been talking the whole time about saving\nFor tomorrow and I think that's why Aaron Boone AJ Hinch and maybe now they Rob is they're going to have a post traumatic stress disorder from this post season when they watch the highlights because they're going to be able to see where Alex Cora\nLike a high school bully literally went in and took their lunch money you know bringing and Chris Sale in Yankee Stadium to close the door bringing in West cello bringing in of all the as he's done um you know going for these victories ... at the time when he thinks he can secure them and that's been the difference\nYou don't play for tomorrow night Joe you play for the game you play for like the winning goal\nAnd that's it what do you like a Monday Night for a school for the patriots bills\nOh my God\nIs it we're overlooking them I ... and all the excitement of the world series and this looks like such a bad match up I'm for them\nThat I don't want to uh you know they beat Minnesota in Minnesota this year that was the biggest upset in Seventeen years but I think that was I think that the cat without the bags so to speak after they did that I don't think anyone's taking them lately anymore and now they're on quarterback number for\nA journeyman Derek innocent off the street literally ah because of how they and I said this at the beginning of the year they really left the cupboard there as far as quarterbacks when did the Buffalo Bills with how they chose to approach this season so I don't know what to expect other than I Hope we get out of the healthy because\nJoe you took the words right out of my mom get in and out of there no injuries [noise] thirty five thirty five or ... something in that\nAnd I'd be okay with the employer in there to um I I really want to I Want to see a Rogers Brady game next Sunday night without any baseball to be a distraction like it's been\nAnd I've I joked about it but it's truly last night the Celtics in the Bruins were on\nAnd it's like a complete mental overload for me right now it's hard to ... I Can't I Can't not care more about the red Sox right now and the Bruins had a spirited contest against Philadelphia which they won three nothing\nWhich was chippy a lot of fights or ... played well a shutout now Cassidy speaks about\nThe competition which is the first time that I've heard the word competition because we've all been talking about a goalie controversy with to grasp maybe\nAnd the Celtics come back down Fifteen and beat Oklahoma City as my father pointed out wearing white jerseys on the road in Oklahoma City I don't know what was up with that last night but the Celtics the three into the the Bruins despite all their injuries are um\nI are here and um you know I think there are the odds are against him a rate now with with uh the Bruins ... down McAvoy down Kevin Miller but I'm going to see what happens with them but we'll be unfold focus on them going forward and be able to ah to concentrate on that Steve\nSports overload sports overload Joe I think it's a good thing to have our data that this weekend I'm getting ready to fire up says such a dozen years subs will be ready\nYou know what I had to say I had one Tuesday night um and I tell you what I don't care\nWhat anybody says about health and concerns and odd arranged in a ... a year at Fenway Park and you're enjoying the red Sox a victory at a sausage onion and top a sandwich I'll tell you what it doesn't get any better it doesn't get a better than it\nGot to fire whether or not before you go into ... which is Joe those are the best that those are the best for the house\nWhen I ... my ... my ... my seat was soaking wet I sat down and I didn't even feel it I didn't care\nAnd on the way they are a lady when we were walking to the game a lady told us that it got cancelled and I said I'm there's no way a canceled then I looked on my phone and I didn't see that it was but there was nothing that was going to take away a sauce for rainbows on the way to Fenway Park that and I drive and now it was just it was in the ... first at night\nIt was God's joke I tell you what my friend I have a\nGreat view of a great weekend go Red Sox grimy Monday we'll talk champions I write a letter alright yeah I Know\nThat was Steve everybody we appreciate 'em join innocent Tommy the giant has chimed in here we haven't heard much from Tommy as of late and I'm thinking about selling off the players\nHow about selling off players and I'm trying to do in terms of what I was talking about I'm trying to see what you mean if you want to text me back in ... if you can't call and you can text me and then I can come back on the point\nBut Tommy the football giant ah we love the ... when he chimes in and um he must be excited for Rocco too are being here locally and doing all the great things that time he does for the kids in the community um\nRocco a big story of of yesterday obviously the world series turns back a on tonight eight o'clock will be in California for a walk with you or your\nDeal or against Rick Costello and uh let's see what Ricky has tonight he's been pretty flick with the stick you know what I'm saying report fellow a couple of big hits already this year\nAnd how will that play out tonight if he's pitching well and he comes up in a spot this guy's got some uh some pop you hit it over the outfield has had a couple of times\nAnd or how does that play and to um to the strategy tonight nationally ball is a different kind of ball different brand the ball will I'm Out score a play a National League style tonight or does he a stick to what he's been doing which is just the final conventional wisdom on almost the game to game basis\nAnd I'm like bringing Craig Kimberlin for six out save or bringing Eduardo New Years and I know the match ups but bringing pneumonia than the other night with devastating the way he's been hitting a surprise me\nI Know the match up but that anyone expect him to have a home run and um you know the of all be thing bringing in the ... has been amazing as well so let's get back to the phone lines here on the joke shall we still have a couple of minutes seven six nine zero six hundred is the number if you want to call in and give us bought steak morning you're on the show\nI chose Henry Henry I know you're excited as well or World Series and let me ask you a this Cora manage this thing now like I'm like a football team that's up by twenty points playing prevent defense or do we manage manage like there's no tomorrow\nAll hands on deck that's it Henry's out you're all in like me I I think that's what he's going to do\nA totally hands on deck is no other way it's always been managing the whole thing so serious\nAnd since then incredible um like I just said a it's been a different guy every night you've had a game\nWell I'm like I just said a it's been a different guy every night you've had a game where uh where Jackie Bradlee joined you haven't had a couple of games with Jackie Bradley junior has been the hero you've gotten great stuff out Steve pass\nI Know not a lot that being said about him but the stretch at first base in the Yankee series that on that final play the ... the home run that he had\nA which was the game winning home run the before the big one run by Jackie in that game um and then just the other night even I'm a good at that to draw that walk\nOff a last Ryan Madsen and you heard the Roberts talking about a liking that match up I was surprised I'm I've been surprised by a few things Robbins has done um one taking by as out I think uh the guy that was throwing so well he takes them out to put mats in in\nAnd ah and then then to bring water and the other night and and you know sometimes the ah the analytic some of the game and and what the computer says you've got to manage it with your eyes and I think to a degree Cora\nHas been combining um you know all the same metrics and all that nonsense that is such a big part of the game with a what he feels about his players and and how he thinks they're going to perform in a given situation\nThan manager stick with it plays on a broad Kimberlin have\nBackup that at this at this uh this\nShowed me that he has all of us and its players and he knows exactly when I don't know how does that but it does have the confidence in the confidence sewage into the players and this is why I think\nHe has this all ends on deck\nWith a hole playoff series is passing out through game series is all of the name of the game and\nDo you bring you've already in again tonight or you off the table because he's starting\nBring anybody can\nOkay so you're on that you're on that note as well I don't think he's I I it's like you said it's there's no tomorrow mentality and I know the the the popular consensus probably everybody listening out there given the choice nobody's going to jump up and down for joy to get ... or even ... Rodriguez for that matter as a starter for game for\nBut I mean how do you feel about being if you're up three oh you've got to feel good ... no matter what I mean to me it's all about winning right now\nThat's what it is going to play a game not for the fourth game\nGot to play for the game and I got to play for this is this mentality\nWhat are you going to happen where do you think of J. D. and uh how they approach that situation with the ankle injury and how they see whatever\nYou're right about that well I didn't catch\nA little boy that I Know what was coming a lot stay tuned for

an update on where things stand according directs reporting at the mail and effect ... days prior arrests\nUm I'm terrorist related charges or terrorist activity as ... reporting a Florida resident formerly a New Yorker Fran Dan landscapes afar a chicken Boston police department um I\nThink providing leadership during the Boston Marathon bombing security and investigative I\nExpert Dan we're learning this altogether right now I asked after twelve of those devices were found to work a day or thoughts\nAs we mentioned yesterday there's a lot of evidence of the fact that these devices were not going to detonate a by the way they were developed whether that was intentional or just a ... he didn't have the knowledge doing\nInvesting as they would get a bunch of forensic evidence both of the devices how they were male or the tracking numbers for the ANC the panels are very talented folks from Secret Service FBI ATF NYPD put the puzzle pieces together and got this guy fairly quickly\nUm these things are are ... and the getting the information out as to what was a was tight towers typed or the manner of his presentation\nLaw enforcement has folks who do these types of things send out letters rant and rave\nOther their frequent flyers that they know of and uh sometimes they get more off the rails and others but making sure that uh everyone across the law enforcement spectrum has all the information they can then probably focus on this subject and tie him into the to the actual evidence that they were recovering\nAt the scene that that is in custody and what will happen\nUh we're going to see a search warrant it is home for sure we're going to see a\nA a statement as to what's going on or what happened here or there'll be follow ups with where he bought the ink where he bought the staples where he bought the wires where he bought the alarms uh they'll put the evidence together to see exactly uh what was going on leading up to the building these devices\nI doubt it it is unlikely that we get several people to do these devices if these were group committed to harm those devices would've activated so it's probably that he worked alone or they'll see if anyone else help support him but they'll identify how he did what he did and possibly why\nThat is going to be the question again the investigator to\nMorning it's John ... again they they do have someone in custody and it is a someone known to authorities that's what we know so far that it is someone known to authorities he's a former New Yorker and he is someone decides all breaking there's going to be a two thirty press conference but apparently it was someone\nWho was known to authorities what I mean by that is as you've heard some of the coverage he's the type he

was told that the some of the devices were considered so dangerous and unstable and that's the key phrase here unstable or that they were detonated and destroyed\nA rather than transported to Quantico, Virginia which is where a that's really the hub for their forensic analysis I in this case Melissa [noise]\nCatherine um thank you so much that we understand that we're going to hear from

jumped back you know the Fox news a breaking news coverage on this Friday where they do have it already\nTalked a bit about forensic profiling based on the evidence and an individual but there as a Trump Card has got to shore dialing I write about it last hour which is when you have different data points so you know how many packages you had you know geographically how they spread across the United states you also know the\nThe timing of when they've been discovered\nAnd you can work back in some cases when they were processor postal facilities\nAnd you can you can triangulate that information using algorithms and you can start to the areas where the suspect I suspect we're likely operating out of in order to get the packages to all those destination and\nWith the timeframe that you've been able to identify so you can triangulate that information down into areas where you can really start to start to drill down but\nI I I think one of the things that we may find out today is that this investigation was really moving at a lightning paced um because of a number of factors not just the evidence I'm not just a what they were able to process what they saw from the TV\nBut now ... information about this person being known to then that's a huge lake offshore I in any investigation well and I had\nBeen reading about the mail center that they were focused and on a late yesterday and today it handles hundreds of thousands of packages or a day and you know they were they were looking at that as well in terms of that original or origin based information that they might get not saying that they all came from there but they were looking for that\nPlantation Florida is where we are watching us Catherine heritage is along a with breaking news for us and ... and before I

Cranston mayor Allen fun and\nBring Trump supporters to Joe ... that is the purpose or was the purpose of the Baylor\nSo without question folks the election is a week from Tuesday and we are going to follow the breaking news and we are going to carry when President Trump speaks life\nBut if there was anyone that in any way has been doubting what people are going to have to side with the selection and it's very very simple if you want four more years of Gina Raimondo if you want governor among down\nThe um the focus off of the Caribbean that much is true so let me um [noise] let's see\nUh don't boom boom ah\nOh my God of course\nDo you think this mailer is aimed at propping him up among Republicans\nAre going to answer that\nThey had the press conference let me just see some of the things wouldn't it be great if all the pundits called this a liberal ploy could just apologize irresponsible helpful claims [noise] um well we have to wait and see what all the facts coming up we'll have to wait and see\nNeed to wait\nAnd see when the facts come out that is for certain uh\n\nAlright folks again seven six six Thirteen eighty seven six six Thirteen eighty I think that\nThat President Trump was very very strong in his support yeah I Know of um [noise] in not in backing up law enforcement\nUh too funny that's funny um\nRegarding that whole situation looming debt ... back in since it is breaking news to a Fox News channel covering this whole situation\nAttention right ... ... ... was that this alone people would stop and look in the van according to some of the fourth out there\nI was really pleased to see the president you heard the president talk about the fact that there is absolutely no place in our country for this kind of thing and that we need to come together as a country because we really seen too much of this and that country now you have a prominent leaders on the left receiving a possibly explosive package if you have\nRepublicans saying you know gone down at a baseball and then I and the name of health care we've had Republicans are in the cabinet herring happening have protection because of the death threats against them because we cannot live in a country where if you were serving in addition of leadership\nThis is what you're on the receiving end up so I think this is where the conversation needs to stay out of the country from the president or the politicians on\nDown so Lisa's point if I may mess of America we saw the best of law enforcement of the president and I say set the tone to your point was perfectly we all came together no matter where political ideology is a political party as Americans came together and they got the call\nFor that allows for one thing that the president said to just in the context of that with that let the world I gather as American citizens because when this happens we all know our hearts thought when we saw people's filling out of Time Warner and evacuation zone\nThe CNN headquarters are a couple of days ago onto the streets of Manhattan\nFifty a stray and\nColumbus Circle there ... it's ...\nIt's jarring and the whole world watches us in this metro recoil and be you know resilience and they watch us go through these than there is a vice it started showing up in other parts all the way to the other coast and so it is the world watching it's very interesting that\nHe would remind her Ronald Reagan was said the rebels fact because we're Americans\nCan look at the screen real quick and maybe you can look and describes some of the things that you're seeing here I mean it looks like pathway of someone taking pictures but they're coming out we had a closer look to kind of like health care to\nBreaking news they do have someone in custody and will continue to follow the breaking news on the suspects are the Trump or the Drudge Report suspects Trump will be all\nUh the make America great again bombing suspect in custody more could be in the mail the good news is that it's twelve packages none of them have been detonated none of them seemingly are anything sophisticated\nAnd uh that is uh in fact the good news regarding uh this whole situation on this Friday with the FBI arrest one person connection with the male bomber so [laughter]\nDrudge Report suspects Trump mobile wallet is being carried in that he is obviously a fan of the president\nAnd um but folks you you you have to realize with with all of the vicious attacks\nThat the media has going after the president that's why then you have people that want to step up and defend the president in this way so in in many ways a when President Trump says you have to look at it that way when President Trump says the way the media behaves towards him\nThat or it's going to set off someone in that regard to than a reacted in that fashion so the good news is no one has been harmed they have this not in custody\nAnd I think that's the best way to look at it he is state says he's Apache could be could be set up we do know\nChris says the city of ... going to make us all look bad or good afternoon Douglas in a way I agree with Chris and there's a little while it's not a good thing\nI agree with Chris and there's a little while it's not a good thing good thing for me anything with trailers picture automatically goes in the trash well that is uh I'm I'm kinda surprised even\nUm [noise] that are on Twitter um prominent\nLocal reporter was questioning do you think that this is a done to help Joe ... mailer that went out and the answer is a hundred percent yes so um there's no question that it was done to try to prop him up\nAnd try to get Trump supporters I don't know where that's going to go down the report last night the video that you saw on channel ten\nCertainly very disturbing we spoke with the man behind that who was featured in the video\nOr that works for ... we spoke to them a little earlier will have that pod cast a but the big news of the day really comes down to this whole situation that they do have the bomber and then look what's ahead we have ... ah she's a Red Sox Dodgers in the world series tonight\nAnd and then it is a term is going to be a nasty nasty day now folks seven six six Thirteen eighty\nOr CNN calls people who are male suspicious device as Trump's targets that that's wrong of course they're going to be\nUm they're going to be against him like that but they do have this person in custody and he was riding around in his very odd ban they had been following him for quite some time and he certainly seems to\nUh be able to\nUm that the person that they've been looking for and he's known to law enforcement and that's where it comes down now or if you have a thought on that if you think that maybe stays just put he she thinks he's a Patsy that they are setting this guy up to make it seem as though he's the one that's been sending it\nUm seven six six Thirteen eighty seven six six Thirteen eight if you want to comment on the trail of

Kelly is now the manager of the Minnesota Twins I don't know if I had mentioned that earlier\nBut um that's\nThat's a tremendous uh you know local boy makes too yes and um and what else I'm watching this thing about uh the bomber\nYeah you can see than sending what do you mean they determined he dumped assemble them up into devices and nothing in the devices were dangerous the FBI says nothing dangerous and the devices\nOh really and I must be getting the right skills [noise] I thought a that's a\nWell anyway this is going to unravel um I've had the TV on but I haven't been listening I've added on closed caption and I haven't been reading it because I've been paying bills\nWhen someone on Indian yeah Trump supporter\nYeah and and that's unfortunate because he must have done this child support or in the world to think that that would help Trump I mean\nYou know I said that right from the beginning if this is a Republican he must be the dumbest strategist in the world to do that because that doesn't make any sense but you know\nHow the as you said earlier in the show you you don't know what kind of people are supporting you when you ask them for a for a pedigree\nUm you know you were making Kelly uh got into a here's another thing that I was thinking of when I was [noise] uh no wonder him so age\nHas an amount of years since\n... Megan Kelly oh no\nNo I Know he's blemish on their farm euro\nYeah but it it I guess you get into trouble about I'm black face or something\nYou said the other day on the show yeah you couldn't do it for Halloween you know during his mocking the black people yeah well\nToday it's considered that but back in the gay wasn't so um you know before you even touch a a a subject like that especially a national\nUh a national figure like she is I Would have been very careful what I said about that but it reminded me I've talked to you before about\nI I haven't watched it in a while every year when I went up north\nI I I haven't watched it in a while every year when I went north I never had cable up the I couldn't afford it so [noise] but I had a um series called genes\nIn Worcester and the guy that played Worcester was the guy that played the doctor run house you know he had a long run that show how does\nYour ... okay so you know the guy I think his name is Hugh um [noise]\nHere's something or rather isn't that awful but at any rate chief in Worcester I Would watch every summer I watch the whole four seasons and one of the oldest and it it it is a hilarious episode involves\nA group of um\nGuys from the club that he belongs to it it's a parody it makes fun of the British\nKind of ruling class you know it's PG would house um who is a funny funny writer but he does this gene in Worcester thing and they they they rent so as a minstrel group and they all have blackface on\nSo um you know of course the today it would be considered um\nMocking I guess but and I guess it was back in the day to when you think of a I mean I Know you were talking about Eddie Cantor the other day a an album Joe and Joe what's his name out Joel said\nOh yeah ... ... ...\nYeah yeah uh but those things change society changes and sometimes\nYou have to be careful what you do I make an Kelly I never I never liked her well liked her I Know she had a big blow up with Trump because he made some remark about her that was taken is sexist and\nI didn't dislike her but I I was never a big fan of her as I like Greta Van Susteren she's gone from Fox too\nBut I you know I think this is I'm\nSomebody somebody said the ... million killing the robot walks\nI like that you want to fly for\n... at Fox\nDoes who's won both wanna be your story ... ... if you go back to Fox because he wants to promote the news\nYeah I don't know I mean I like Laura Ingraham except that she's on at ten o'clock at night\nOr not they're going to go to go to ...\n... and uh well I don't know it depends on ratings sets the you know um they can't and Tucker Carlson has a huge Twitter fly following he's got he's got over a million followers on Twitter his show Tucker Carlson\nAnd uh the five they've got a very rural Twitter following it there there were eighty people following Twitter and I think the total is something like six hundred thousand or six I I don't know I haven't looked in a while\nSo I I don't know how they how they figure that out of the programming but at any rate it's like every place else said you know if they've got a a spot that ah that they think is weak but I haven't I haven't ever watch Rachel Maddow have have you ever watched her\nFrom a foreign seconds\n[noise] well yeah that would be what I Would watch or for too but I don't know what her ratings compared to hit any entity\nShe ... she beats a\nRachel Maddow beats Hannity\nRunning in ... I'm kind of a yes or if you're going to report was oh wellness real liberal you should be willing to no show\nYeah well I obviously she turns me off for some reason John I I don't know there's something about her that I don't care she's\nUm I don't care for I don't care for her and not because of review is because I've never listened to her long enough to get all riled up about her views is just something about her attitude and I'll tell you on Fox I don't care for ship Smith\nWell again ah when I when I read the FBI thing was the bottom of the ... of the FBI Director speaking and in the first thing they said is that all of them all of the devices none of them were dangerous during no explosives in him\nApparently he thought that was a ... hobby\nAnd then it's not suspect did not many of them that's what it said suspect are not ma'am oh I mean they may have made him and it's in the gun partners\nI mean he may have made him in in ... in the pot and is that they're looking for right now that\nIt's not well I'm pretty sure that could be the case\nWell that'll ... now he faces fifty eight years in prison or so so apparently the captain was wrong okay here's suspect faces five federal charges its name Sam that's from the department of justice so you're right there and it doesn't say what the charges are I'm\nNot no it doesn't this guy that guy's a wacko if he thinks he's helping trumped by doing this crap I mean he's he had the Democrats\nOn a silver platter uh to say that we conservatives are crazy and Trump is behind it and all my God this guy did not do us any big savers\nSaliva in DNA the stamps\nUh the um but when a ham of that statement about it not mailing them why they document\nOff and they did the right to the FBI can't make a mistake like that\nWell maybe well did you you are eating at a cost cashing right\nYes yeah you know in ... no no I was reading the bottom that Fox News puts on the coast of oh\nI see the ticker on the bottom that's\nCorrect that's the one that Senate\nOr like they may have screwed up because I don't see anything about the bottom say by saying he didn't mail them so it's possible that maybe Fox navy screwed up with the ticker at the bottom because that's happened before I I've I've read\n... this was a saying though was\nSomething\nThat could be different different places addressed in front of a quarter was but um but it's similar to others a\nSuspect was a criminal record stolen property driver drawn just convictions but it doesn't\nSay it doesn't say anything about him you know it's just a few years in prison that he faces sweet some accounts anatomy wrong ... well I'm certainly one of the nights on we'll find out\nWell you know what my question is how did this guy find all the addresses of these people\nI don't know well there you go one couple were wrong and he's ... now that's what I said if I wanted to send them to Robert The narrow I Know when I got his own address\nExactly or George Soros for that matter I don't even know ... I don't know where ... Clapper Maxine Waters lives you know this guy either he\nHad somebody working with him which I think it's about which I think its case or he spent a considerable amount of time looking up and doing this research of these addresses justice and say pipe bombs too\nI\nMean what does all this political gain gain by doing this I mean if these bombs were fake what will have gained by it what what do you think his goal was\nI I don't know in a you know they they haven't set a motive yet okay or what they're saying\nI'm the I'm\nHe was around some some of the pack and doing to you as well so for some of the rest\nOf the [noise] he's a Republican in the criminal records are done then I bought the mailing that the that came on the FBI\nHi yeah I'm In St Louis that I'd rather than was being said so it isn't something I I I made up trust me [laughter]\nI I Believe you're at it right ... I think maybe a Fox they have a list misquoted about him not sending them but you know it ... but it also could be correct too because you never know this guy may have had accomplished and maybe accomplished mailed out was out I mean whoa whoa whoa more as time goes on this guy was just arrested\nSo well hopefully it will do war\nOkay don't you don't you find it kind of strange this is this garbage is going on just this close to the election I mean it doesn't sound kinda suspicious to you [noise] I don't I'm not one for conspiracy theory chair but you know what this is just way too coincidental\nThe time I'm surely not Trump people that a Trump which one's going under and whatever they would throw him out of the but it's certainly not a Republican doing this uh this is going to be he he may be supporting Trump because apparently he's an Indian and he loves within the Trump is doing for the Indians\nAh you know we don't know why\nOkay the um the so they said the Mickey\nMouse that were made Mickey Mouse bombs\nThat are um but I but uh it doesn't you don't see that anything the FBI or what\nThe hell late date they did an X ray of one of the devices and they said it was filled with a some sort of powder and broken glass\nThey allowed well the FBI I said it was in the same box underneath that we were talking about a month when Christmas rate was was talking\n... said that um um none of the devices were dangerous that's exactly what it said\nThey were all ... yeah they were all fake ... they all made to look like type ... that's right so\nI mean I don't I mean if this guy I don't think his guys goal is to kill anyone I think his goal was to send a message\nTo somebody you don't put it you know you don't put a ... or something with that uh that was just trying to I don't know what they're trying to do but it's they're all coming to get the politics because people are selling it to Rome liberals\nRight well you know as much as I Can't stand a lot of the people he set these actors to I don't condone this crap that all human being\nOffered you know I Believe anyone can go you can condone this crap\nNo absolutely not absolutely not I mean you know this is and it's but what this should send a message there are crackpots out there on both sides and God only knows what the next person is going to deliver the next person's gonna shut real pipe bomb\nShelter don't get don't don't even suggest such a thing oh God you know all the women that you don't even give anyone an idea\nYeah I Know I Know I don't have to give them any ideas of the things are calling All right John you have a great day\nJim ... in Athens Rania\nKnown John Hi just sent you an email yes it's a picture it says look\nI'm there to carry a cross the street\nAre protesting a question I see it when you want me to do now I just wanted to show you that there's a lot because all the thing is they're all is\nNot an option and at the Mayo white and it's because they're not getting a race that though I just wanted it to be out there um\nWell it certainly I yeah I'm so that the the uh it's it's out there but she's\nShe's not going to do anything until after the election season where did you not only me probably have you with a man would you give them they'll get the Donald before the election you know look into the drone western\nBut you know okay look into that drone question\nThe question what okay now that ... that the layers school a mayoral academy yep okay that is a non union\nThe boat all charter schools are non union that while Charlotte yeah that's why they don't make any money the kid do teachers don't make a lot of money okay you know act like a secondary major\nAt charter schools making Seventy six brand [laughter] what are ... and you listen you give me Seventy six thousand dollars and give me the summer off that's a hell of a job\nOkay so then do you think that we're better off having non union or union are\nYou another gallery if it's not even an option now know that is that I thought well hey I was off and then by the way of actually don't be surprised of trauma doesn't go to union [laughter] sure they shouldn't get big enough\nYeah and now now that now that question when they did the evaluation on homes yeah\nOkay now is that a set price on them when they do evaluate soon or it gets sent to city hall out and then it gets really revamped or whatever however you want to say that uh\nIf you appeal it if you appeal it have you had an outrageous thing or the let's say you have an outrageous increase he got a city hall and say wait a minute I was going on here everyone else is getting into a hundred dollar increase mind one is six hundred dollars seven hundred dollars\nAnd they look at the field card and they say well it's because of the garage drive or we have no garage no garage and they just they they check it they feel adjusted in a day or the or adjust the value\nStay out of the rain if it's possible and be safe that's what it's all about my screen just went blank on me and I'm looking at the clock uh and\nFor nine seconds before a clock that I'll be watching Fox News tonight but I listen

show thank\nYou Jeff good afternoon and it's great to be here as always with you here on firing line Thirteen eighty\nOf course he is a in his first term as a city councilor here in the city of one socket no stranger\nOr to the people he's been a servant of the people for many years a he has a great legislative background from the general assembly he is a good legal mind and an asset to the city council when it comes to legal ease [laughter]\nNobody's said something like that to me in a while just appreciate that don't have that every day\nUh but uh you are or in your first term or just a little a little bit of insight on your cell phone I'm On your first term as a city councilman or you have any reflections on a on the process\nYou know it's been a really interesting two years it's been a busy two years you know when you look back I think historically we have\nMore work sessions and met\nAs a body more times than any other city council in recent memory you know I was I'm speaking of some of the other day and I was saying you know it's remarkable that we were inaugurated December sixth two thousand and sixteen\nAnd we had to work session December seventh through thousands of sixteen um it was and that was\nOn the inventor G A issue and it really was amazing that that we we were thrown right into it and for some of us that had been involved in and government in the past it was you know comfortable and for others it was a learning curve\nIt was a learning curve for me in terms of you know serving on there in a simple level and um I have to say\nAnyone that asked me especially people I you know down in in Providence orange and Ken\nUm for the war court house or wherever I Am I see a lot of um\nWell the war court house or wherever I Am I see a lot of um attorneys who are former wraps current wraps former senators current senators and they'll say hey you're on TALK of the city council now huh again like how do you like it'd be like you know it's not like being the state house San jose\nI always say the same thing now it's better it's better it's more fun it's it's more rewarding it's it's um [noise] I think when you serve as a state representative for senator there for the most part unless you're on an event unless you're at\nAn opening unless you're at you know some type of charitable thing you you you operate largely in visibly you do most people don't know what you do ... ... people don't know what's going on or in Providence\nWhen you serve on the on the municipal level you really get a feel of what's happening in the city you get to speak to people every day you you're really engaged I like being engaged so I really enjoyed this I did the best two years of public service I've ever had\nA great to hear and your your are very engaged in the community besides a city councilman\nI ah you know I often as another person's engagements off I see you and your beautiful wife\nI was just about anything happening in the community always volunteering outfits from the library to the playground a lot of sense whenever and wherever you're needed to I Do see John in uh in in uh Nicole out there working in the community\n... truly my better half and I can tell you that um she's ... she's now to make me a better person and I really enjoy the things that we do here in the city and the things that we do together it's a it's good it's it's fun and I'm\nI'm really like I said I'm really enjoying myself I'm Sorry I'm really hopeful that you know the voters will have the confidence in me to return me for another two years\nThey a big part of a a council men he is going through this budget process I I've talked about it with some of your uh your your associates on the city council I Want to talk about it with you I think it it merits some good discussion\nI'm your first term you talked about the inventor gee right out of the gay you had this huge a bombshell if you will I may be a bad\nAnalogy today a that was really dropped on your lap and very contentious a situation behind that boom you or shortly thereafter working on the\nNatural resource that we really have a lot of more so than any of our surrounding neighbors okay so the fact that we were just going to give that up\nFor Eighteen million dollars over Twenty years is short money for\nThat type of loss of control the one thing that we have so I said what do we do like how do we make up that money be good neighbors and also be intelligent and very forward looking to things that you know with renewable energy [noise]\nUm and I thought about solar so we I put together\nUm the renewable energy subcommittee I chair it of course Beauchamp is a member Jim ... of member and we started meeting with um some companies that do this\nWe put on our feet there were proposals we had all of that analyze and now here we are we met with for vendors the other night and um I think we're going to get ready to choose one soon\nAnd we have the opportunity here between savings to the city and income to the city\nI don't want to give out specific numbers but it's more than that Eighteen million that we would have gotten over Twenty years for selling water so we don't give up our water we are good neighbors we don't we get involved with a bad actor of a company and yet we still read more than we would have ...\n... it's a total win win so I and and and I think that once this once this happens it'll people would be really happy with with where we went in this direction\nOr don't want to pry too much on this I Know it's a work in progress every looking at like solar farming or utilizing rooftops of ah of governmental buildings or is that something has to\nBring all the no ... and that's not that's not prime the amount of that that's in a public document that than they are paid where we're looking at we're looking at tracks of city owned property and\nSo the ... came back for\nOn tracks of city on property and there's some other ideas among the things that will be floated that I've been floated around but I mean I haven't done this alone you know the council has been great about this and the members of the some printed I mentioned you know we've met a bunch of times they've been great about that and then um the city council is is you know\nHas open arms on this issue so um it's a good group of people that I've been working with and\nGrateful to uh to have had the opportunity to serve with them and the capacity to have\nIt was just kind of shows that you know sometimes I guess you can't be excited over excited about a dancing apple in front of you as they could be a full chicken dinner on the other side whether it's actually for\n... well that's right and I think that what I what I said was and I recall back in ... and early ... two thousand and Seventeen I said you know we get so caught up when we see these shiny objects in front of us that you know money get it right and then you end up like\nOne of us that you know money get it right and then you end up like look look where we are and there's another issue I don't know if you want to do we have time you don't know if you're a\nAnother issue is the um the Senate grow slash waste water treatment plant issue and\nThat's a huge quality of life issue and if I could go into the way back machine you know I Would have tackled somebody when they were trying to sign that deal and said don't do it um let's not import crap\nNow some people don't understand that that actually happened\nAlready has a lot right now so let me let me write as dire as our readers digest version is where the waste water treatment plant\nIs off of of um come straight down behind the ... the the fire station there are two facilities there's our wastewater treatment plant\n'em and waste water is what happens that goes down your sank down your drains and dining toilets and all that that's where it all goes to be processed and then there's also a sin a growth facility and that's a a sludge burning\nFacility and what flood jazz sludge is all the stuff that ends up being left over from the wastewater treatment plant all the nastiness gets burned at Senate grow so\nThere are trucks Eighteen wheelers of that stuff being brought to the city every single day from communities all around New England to be burned so we literally\nYou know they say hey I'm not going to take any crap from you well guess what we're taking crap from everybody\nAnd that's true every day and we do it for money and so where that city I'm now is there an economic benefit from Rochester is\nIs there an economic benefit from not having to send our sludge outs where there is\nBut in the end I mean he we need to start thinking in this city about who do we want to be as a community do we want to be the city that\nTakes everybody's crowd do we want to be the city that has to deal with the smell do we you know do we want to make life better for our citizens and so I think when we get into the mall the story is before we get into long term deals because the money seems right\nWe really have to think it through and see if there's an alternative\nAnd we can't jump at the shiny objects so I Wish we never gotten bad would send a row I Wish we never would have and I think that they would have said that down the line with inventive gee I Wish we never would have gotten bed with them I Wish this didn't happen and uh I wasn't prepared for a\nFor that to happen and so we didn't do it but now we're about to do something in my opinion that's way better and um that will only benefit the citizens\nOf our last meeting you did bring up a sin to grow and waste water is a couple of gentlemen there but I guess you couldn't speak as you want to do to the way it was listed on the agenda I was going to be rehashing yeah but on the next one and yeah I'm\nActual has a communication next to Jenna so and and have it like so it's wide open right cause entity\nBecause we spoke to just the order reports that's all you could speak\nTo under the open meetings act but if I I'm going to have it as a you know build on the way I listed a cast a wide net so I can talk just about about anything and I'm not you know and I don't\nTo you know I'm not there to crap on [laughter] the guys that Senate grow in the wastewater treatment plant because they're great like I like those guys and they're doing their their best and you you can't you know you're never gonna get rose scented air coming out of that valley um\nBut it's a hindrance and and some citizens are paying the price for the economic benefits are and then when you're trying to attract new citizens into businesses I can tell you years ago I was looking for a place that was a place on crumbling hill wrote a great apartment great price isn't he can't do it no way in heck I'm living you can't\nDo it and you know what's really alarming and I know\nThat we talk in the city about oh we wanna we wanna relocate all the fields all the athletic fields to cast park near the high school well\nUm I had the unfortunate a situation of having to be at the high because of a a motor vehicle accident I was at the hospital last November and it was on Saturday morning um and the smell out right outside the emergency room the air was so file and you say to yourself wait a minute\nCast park is right down the road so we're going to\nHave like people come into the city of um other towns and when they're going to be there and this is what they're going to smell I mean what are they gonna think of us like so that's who do we want to be as a as a community and I think that we really have to think about that and what does it cost to get out of that what does it cost to continue um what can we do to make it better\nAre we willing to bear the brunt of that\nUm if that's the case or do we just keep complaining about it and say well I'm not going to pay for that ... that's what I think we need to hash out\nBut there's a couple of the real big issues that the the voice you're hearing John Brennan will be working on in his next term selected by use of papal and that's what we're talking with him for a consider a vote for John Brennan November six you heard some of the\nThings that he is going to continue to work on is your city councilman genre got our last two minutes at this point I always step out of the way and say the last two minutes yours to address the people\nUm by the way John thank you for coming to the forum ... Wednesday night which is now posted on W. dot com if he did not get to ... and you can look them up for ah for your educational purposes to be in a high dot com fish shake your time in the ...\nI

reelection and I'd be really honored and humbled if if you'd consider voting for me again and putting me there and\nHaving the faith in me to to to do\nUm the right thing on the city council as part of the legislative branch you know I I intend to hold the elected leaders in the city accountable for what they do and what they say and what they don't do and what they don't say I'm and I expect to be held accountable to I'm certainly not immune from that and\nUm I you know intend to continue um living by the charter it's really important and just being a very open and honest and trends parents

[laughter] yeah and our heads dry a couple of things uh well before I go to the main part of my call ah whatever address you're not the previous call but to call before last mhm\nOkay uh I did not say that she said that the mayor ... ... what I said was you asked her and it was\nA if she ever if if you thought that uh we have allied or something of that nature\nAnd she said well yeah I you know and she says everyone lives she qualified with that and then you asked why she didn't like a brand is because he's a liar ... I'm not a you know\nI'm not making this up and it was the same way well whatever I'm not you know and she calls up there I mean I'm I'm for her in one aspect of economic development that I Do agree with I Do agree with her on that we were long overdue for economic development is to in the city I mean we're stagnant right now\nI don't think anybody will argue that point of that show up almost and everybody's mind every candidate should be focused on economic demands\nAbsolutely absolutely and that part I Do agree with Ron but where she kicked off she said well I'm I mean ... economic development no no no she kicked her call off by saying I saw how brand riding by the other day Neal Ninety years old\nThat's what caused the avalanche of all the calls of people that were kicked off that because it was her goal to emphasize his age I\nDon't know what kind of bullshit trying to pull on the radio but again maybe she should maybe she could stay off the radio like I should still Facebook because I Know what I hear and I know who says one on the radio I'm very fluid on our voices now just like she ... me I'm ... with her\nAnyway end of that All right now ah this clown that was going around milling these pipe bombs yeah walk in the world is he thinking it seems like he's helping Trump at all I mean he's making he's making Republicans look back my doing that okay because\nJust a few are just not too long ago okay ah Hillary Clinton said uh you know that uh that we shouldn't be civil and not not always as Republicans but ah the Democrats shouldn't be civil because we're not civil\nAnd then a couple of days later the bombs Robert Lowery should now she's saying you know we should be United okay\nHe this this clown did not do any say any good\nWith us with with my\nAnd you know what it was a call in or John I called John earlier it either this guy has an accomplice or he had a lot of time on his hands\nBecause how well did he get Robert Deniro address George Soros says address Brock Obama's address fill the Clintons address all his address is ... how in the world I don't even know where\nYou know I I don't know where um these people if I\nA hard time trying to figure out where to start looking for the information I\nHave a funny feeling though that he is a ... he's probably got an awful lot of time on his hands and that's the problem with people like that they have too much time on their hands so they can get into this kind of missed if I'm Wondering if the guy has a mental health issue as well\nI mean I often times that's the case and that seems to be a major problem that we face in this country we have ticking time bomb zone out there\nUm you know individuals with a year a ... a violent and then they have some mental illness issues\nExactly you know and I don't\nKnow what he was trying to accomplish the ... but they should certainly hold him responsible when you think of the fear he put in certain the individual the disruption of\nUm businesses and evacuations of building a responders or having to spend all this time chasing this guy around it and you know all of that\nI could do you think so I I don't know\nWhat I Do ... and ... yeah yeah for ... binary code jak a girl\nBut I I Do know that Halloween is a holiday where people spend a lot of money they spend a lot of money\nYou know they do in fact you're talking about a ... ice cream place yes on diamond hill road treated and otherwise you can look at a joke or daily Quinn\nYeah well there's one in Bellingham not too far away so\nFar enough I mean there yeah yeah that got going on for Ninety five\n... you know they seem to do very well the dairy queens and they're all over the place\nAnd made after rain rain rain or get out of a jogger yes I Do\nMhm hey don't pack it all area\nI Know I mean that's the big ... that's a major problem that we have we're saturated with a subsidized housing and I'm not saying that everybody who lives in subsidized housing has a you know doesn't have any money to spend but their funds a limited so you can't depend on them\nTo support some of these ideas they're gonna have to you know you you know you need to get everybody involved just spend a few dollars in town\nThat I did I say well if they don't get me going good of a bigger fatter that good so it is a bad name for market in that area\nWell it's up to the people who own appliances to get out there and that that is their job to recruit\nNew and and uh that that is there I mean we can certainly\nThe administration whoever will and whoever's in charge of the city administration\nThey can certainly do everything possible to accommodate them encourage them help them along the way make sure that there were no road blocks but when push comes to shove it's the owners are those plans is we're going to determine whether or not they're going to fill those spots and I\nHope they do actually because I Would go back to what buddy for governor doors up\nI I agree with you the truck but there\nAre no and that's the year but that that's a problem every elected official has every politician has that there are people who become your followers are\nThat you probably don't want his followers and but there's not a damn thing you can do about it but uh you know once the association is made doesn't make you look good that's for sure\n[noise] Stephen King is Halloween party mhm Halloween party in any way rice and she she put it under what certainly most people were scared\nYou know what I mean our our ... fan\nYou're talking

I I I Believe the numbers over twenty homes going out because\nSome of the paper will be coming out my dad knew a straight or right on diamond now and then the diamond some will be coming out by modern history\nI Know I see those two states to link to it mhm state but I think that if someone said that's just temporary\nYeah there's one that takes you to Moran street but that is temporary only during construction I Believe that it'll be sealed off once it's finished\nGot straight as one that's like the one on diamond hill is street and then as Lauren street and I guess that's the one that is just temporary\nRight right right right right now I guess that put an out of types and everything in the ground for the sewer by never thought it was that much ...\nThey're developing an area where there's never been any homes so they have to start from scratch you know put everything in the water lines the gas\nLine line and got a fire hydrant in your shoes you know when it's gonna be\nThere so when they put like the road and there and the sidewalk and start doing the houses you know we are but they say in November the guy told me yeah we're going to be putting in the roads were doing what he said\n... going on time no that's why I'm In a long and I'm\nGlad I didn't notice condos you know the condos right on the side [laughter]\nYes yes it was over there you know ...\nAnd uh so you get some condos\nWell some of them don't care and some of them I guess it's kind of close to them where it's going to be you know\nWell they'll put a buffer you know the the the I'm sure there'll be\nCaught up in the planet so I says oh well when I was going to be more private\nThat's right that is correct and they still got some land in the back so somebody already so one of those condos already so I guess he was an apple with it\nYou know that it was just saying maybe it was when president that could have just been a coincidence so who knows\nBecause somebody bought it well I Know one man that was there was complaining about it so I don't know it was him that so is there was just somebody you know right right but it's not going to weed out bad once it's done you know well\nI I'm happy to see new homes being constructed in the city because I think these new properties will bring some quality people to the neighborhood or there'll be investing in their own homes and we need more of that in our city in my opinion\nBut I put everything that the water pressure stays okay\nYou'd be fine we've got a big water tank up in east one sockets or water water pressure is usually a problem in east when socket\nI Hope not and I would always knew I was coming in but do you know there's always a good place for you know\nAbsolutely yep okay you have a good\nNight All right you do you take care bye no yeah I like to see a new homes being constructed I Know there was some going up in oak grove there were a few scattered sites around the city where they're building new homes\nThere's a development on a dime and he'll wrote up the street here from the radio station and I think that is good for the community these are nice homes and they're going to attract some good people to the community\nOwner occupied property is very very important in my opinion that that makes worry\nA quality and improves the quality of a community let's put it that way I think that's another big problem we have you have a lot of absentee landlords\nThat live somewhere else and they don't take good care of their property some do but many don't and that harms the city in my opinion\nWe have a little bit of information about this um I guess the bomber\nUm they call them demand to bomb\nHis name is uh Caesar's ... essay why O. c.'s fifty six he's a career criminal is a

hard to believe good evening good evening fell and good evening to ah listening audience um hot to believe that it's been two weeks since we've been here and\nLast week 'cause you know we were at the Alps for a a campaign rally event well campaign greet me however you want to classify it and it was a tremendous success it was um\n... it was just overwhelming the turnout that we had and I'm very very grateful for that and I want to thank everybody who was there Phil everybody who came and chatted\nUs and contributed to this ... that we've got underway here and ah it will culminate soon on on November sex or which is election day and\nWe ask everyone to please get out the vote and have you ... if you will be so kind to consider voting for our brand um that would be most appreciate it and so that's why we uh my friend\nThat was a great night and again if the food was Tony and Denise yeah right yes it's apply but it was a great night because\nDenise Sierra yes that's apply but it was a great night because when it began it was for people age\nThey associated with everybody had a good time they left and as fast as people were leaving more people were coming in because I wasn't just the same old crowd which we love seeing any way somewhere appreciates us a point\nThere was a lot of people you don't normally see there are exactly and we went a little bit pass the time that we were supposed to go and it was still for a laugh\nOut but it was a great night to be out\nThe survey was certainly was and uh I think that um what you're saying here feel as the participation has truly outstanding mhm and I think that the participation was somewhat enhanced when\nI mean I don't care we don't care what sign you had in your yard if you add all Lisa ball valley side we don't care about that\nYou need help we can help you you got it yeah we're moving forward with that\nThat was in my mind when I was just brought up that point so I'm Glad you refresh my memory and you hit a home run with that people love that that night the response you got when you said that\nAll right and it was it was good for you for saying it because we don't have that right now there are people that she has grudges against al ... being one because he's appointed ... pain in the past that's ridiculous and what he's\nWanting to bring to the city of when science letters that have to do with any nothing if it's good for the city it's good for nothing cause okay doesn't matter where it's coming from out of it we've got a couple of course we're going to listen ... I can see that point I Know I have such\nPower cola welcome to the polls are guys how are you [laughter] hey I Love\nListening to your bath or I'm Glad they could have got me on hold for another ten minutes All right it would have been great okay but thank God first trap memory and not sign a privilege straight and how ridiculously simple Easter is and how vindictive she is because she doesn't get credit for nobody should\nSo that was great and\nHow can you remind me and the public when you were with Charlie bold Ellie she must have been adopted her she didn't fall off that very I can tell you right now with her what the Charlie say all the time I work for you\nI work for you all for me you know that's the exactly right yeah\nAnd that's I heard it back then I heard it all the time\nNever ever said I have to put in a public records requests to get an answer to that question because I was concerned about government you want to push me away that didn't happen on the trolley that didn't happen under anybody until we use a bold Elie Wiesel for deli\nShe's evil and and you know when you brought that up that was right on the mark and I just want to do a\nLot of comments were going to be originally I tend to jump on the other day and I was very impressed outer crust with the people that were there the people that were there other people that I have seen at meetings\nFor the last decade okay am I right so yup exactly these are the people are always saying involved the government\nThey're not the people are more man and the wine and crack is in the north end and maybe get a lot of men and and sit down and visualize things and don't have any idea what the machinations or the reality of the city wants to talk so when I looked at these people and\nIt was one after the other after the other and you know nobody can do them all but there's other people and I've been involved and ours massively impressed that the people supporting you and people go into that ... where the people who truly\nNot necessarily the richest not necessarily the shorter than fifty dollar plate and Lincoln okay on or a or wherever else she holds her fundraisers these are the people that did a ten dollar bill in ... that ah the heart and soul of the city on socket\nRock and roll and that's exactly why we did this\n... ... exactly the right thing we saw\nIt needed we needed to have that we needed to have\nA reunification of people the common denominator there that night was we all\nOur city we all love the city of one socket and he's a good hard working people many of them are retired summer not some and\nThere was a cross section of people that they were young people young groups of people that were um you know that I graduated from high school together I mean it was just ... it was really it was really\nEncouraging to see these people together and and ... for them to have gone out\nThe ... and ... for them to have gone out last friday and doing whether this was a very\nHumbling experience for me personally and I am so grateful and um if I Am elected and I hope to be on November six I'm I Will\nAs diligently as I possibly can to repay them for the expression of support that they displayed last friday so it's um it will be very very interesting Ron\nPaul they will be and and and uh the the\nThing is there and I saw that and I hadn't seen it until this week when I went down so gave it to me\nThat thing that put it in my mailbox or that's that spoke so many uh issues about you that you are you a a ... year we bonded eloquently despite their lack of a tennis last week\nBy going through the line item by line item and I listen to that and it was very accurate and people need to realize this woman has a hypocrite ally of fraud and and realistic way and ... and ... are there but I don't care but\nYou know at some point in time deep down in your heart you've got to tell you that you inshallah we did the wrong thing by babysitting this woman to where she is [laughter] you know [laughter] really it really is\nAnd I you know not for nothing I've been on a long time as you know and she is clearly not the brightest Paul she keeps these people\nOn because of our insecurities\nAnd I'm tired of it now I'd like to go to the sort of say a little debate you had any issues brought up some sit there\nAnd you know not not everyone got to get not really five minutes not really this is the school to many went first followed by the city council and then the male candidates all\nHad five minutes to present you know their positions and she presented her as I presented mine and basically that was at rolling and\nIt was it was very very nice I mean a ... it was just very nice it was interesting and ah you would have enjoyed\nSo so ditch and labor a pit bull ... did they do a sit in the corner quietly and let their warmth left at home that was their husband and family\nLeft at home\nLast come home that was the right thing to do\nShe was the one that was what you would expect a mayor to be my last one she was smiling she was pleasant and he was he was known event there was anything but when I said\nSo again that just froze my position I Choose a hypocrite because Steve Dahl and she was she\nI think she did was she had to do\nNow which is what she always taught by the way you know what you might eat when what she had to do for our police saw\nI think I think there was enough blowback after chance after some of the mailings and she sent that whoever she's paying to advise ... campaign finally sat him down and saying you're going to ruin it for yourself to be no saving you unless you stop\n\nWell clearly should hire the best and the brightest who got elected in the first place mhm and Albert knows his name but clearly he didn't encourage her to do many of the things that she did Clinton family did because they know what an evil person she has deep down and they just fed into her own frenzy\nThat she thought that was her best costs because as I've heard from many many people actually talks to friends and family she listens to nobody bought herself and then the problem is five years into administrator Sharon and I didn't do it on this show I send John\nAnd I didn't send you the link ... over the wall street via\nUSA Today oh no I haven't\nYeah oh yeah oh yeah but you've seen it\nI think the first person to share with me was the person who read it only hours asteroid appeared and that was a friend die\n[laughter] you know Dr ... oh yeah\n[noise] so\nSo again you know she didn't while she puts up all these false\nAnd misleading things about her tenure as mayor\nAnd her five years despite the fact of getting all of this money that she did not work for all this money that you have elaborated upon and and ... so efficiently\nA supplemental tax where okay prime okay the end of the deficit reduction bond millions and millions and millions of dollars that this woman to do anything for all she had to do is sit there and be stupid and they would have came into our air\nOr three Ninety One dilute avenue\nBall for seven forty eight zero one\nOkay there you go before you read that just before you read it out of it and I'm I'm sure you feel the same way because Romney brought it up there was a time when it was hard to put up you sign on lawns because people were afraid of retribution from the mayor\nThose days ago and I think enough people are starting to believe that this campaign by Albert you Breen is real enough that it's it's really got some momentum that you're getting these phone calls and letters by the way from supporters that don't care about the intimidation no more\nNo campaign has really gotten some traction there's no doubt there's no doubt and I'm I'm I'm starting\nTo sense and it's a little bit scary I'm signing to sense\nWell neither am I felt this kind of enthusiasm\nA ... and and you know what I remember a perhaps they might have been a campaign oh maybe for this kind of enthusiasm I probably would want to go back to the grass\nRoots the basic grassroots effort that object Cummings when he ran for city council and that was a long time ago I mean I I Am talking\nMaybe ... around the time that my son was born and so I think that's one jak served\nBut jak you had a real enthusiastic population out there that really worked hard for him yeah and so we haven't seen that kind of enthusiasm sense\nBut I sense that you know when I go out like we did today uh but I did I can I read that letter\nI Want you to read the letter that would go back to the phones right after okay\nThe letter is dated October twenty second two thousand Eighteen\nMr brand or by the way I Am not going to reveal who the people obviously who sent this to me or what they owe the amounts that they intended to contribute to the campaign Mr Bree in\nWe had hoped to attend your fundraiser last friday at the Alps but something came up and we could not make it we had already plan to donate ...\nSo we figured we would just mail it today we received that\nBit of nastiness from the campaign of the current mayor and were angered by it so we bumped up our donation\nBy fifty bucks we wish you the best and hope you kick but good luck sir and it's signed by two recipients\n\nVery well read back to the phones Albert sure welcome to the polls\nHi there how ... how high you know this is Hi this is Dick ...\nHey my I Know in my brain rock index now are you\nOh I'm terrific and listen I also was unable to attend your uh event at the ... club as I\nTold you
