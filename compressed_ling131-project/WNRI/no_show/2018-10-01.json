now there's the greater ... used to say let's play too and that's what they're gonna do today yeah pretty amazing they these four teams the dad even after a hundred and fifty two games right back where they started on opening day dead even at a right now the hockey team even though they're playing at Chicago is the Milwaukee Brewers\nThe cubs man he had the best record in the national league for the last ten weeks but the brewers went on a seven game winning streak down the stretch to catch him\nGain the tie the brewers of what to eat and they won eight teams in the last month so that Wrigley Field but the brewers might be the same debate today will state then you have the dilemma of the Dodgers the Dodgers were on the Colorado Rockies the other game\nThe Dodgers had a better record on the road this year than I did it all uh although I did because what I was six to three six games with three at Dodger Stadium so it's hard to tell which way it's going to go\nThe one overriding that if there is one is that the home and Julie baseball when fifty four percent of the time yeah\nThat's a should bring some a comfort to fans out there I let's talk some football here uh when we talked about maybe the demise of Tom Brady and the New England patriots but they ah they looked like a a bounce back team in a bounce back game against a division leader yesterday\nYeah this is the way they play football Bill Belichick everybody in the sky is falling when he loses a couple of games with the number but you know last year there were two into after four games and now after they wiped out it's often it was not barest back there one game right the Emmy right where they want to be\nIn one of the playoffs gotten there'll be right to the New England patriots but that's the way they play the game starts slow and they and his bat\nAdmit I wouldn't get too excited if you're a new ... New England fan because Miami Dolphins how were they Serino coming into that\nBecause terrible but I mean that game was on why played the raiders let's see if they didn't even if I couldn't\nBelieve that dolphins yesterday\nWell how about the bears how 'bout Michel ... risky throwing for a career high six touchdowns my goodness they won three in a row\nAnd everyone was raving about these Tampa Bay buccaneers Ryan Patrick first two games with putting up Joe Montana like numbers well that's over the last last week and then the bears yesterday destroyed forty head\nAnd Mr this is you said the bears second year quarterback there was whispers last week articles and everything suggesting that he's a potential ... well he had some kind of a game yesterday you won't hear those with for a little while\nYeah one touchdown pass shy and the franchise marks by said luck man again it's in Nineteen forty three you know we talked about the patriots are bouncing back the cowboys looked like they were back to\nThe air\nGo ahead yeah they they are they really I was a very important one for them to ever win or a but the cowboys got a tremendous game out of the big deal you know like two hundred and fifty totaled yards so they're they're in a ... that's a funny division there's not much to lead the way the\nNFC East the giants are nowhere a red skins and eagles there's nothing going on there so it will say that there's two really a tremendous days now the super bowl favorite\nOr the LA Rams won their foreign oh they're complete game great quarterbacking\nAnd then you're going to have another foreigner what came after that I play if Kansas City wins at Denver\nKansas City getting really period quarterbacking is my second year player Catholic my homes right now in Vegas\nSecond year player Catholic my homes right now in Vegas the teams to go to the super bowl the favorites or the rams and the chiefs\nMm [noise] um at Notre Dame football they look pretty good in their victory over Stamford this weekend\nThey did they ah they started new quarterback the last game ... book\nIs the casting numbers on his field manager ship and leadership stupendous you know they people said it wasn't that big window beat Wake Forest by a lot will they be beating seventh ranks Denver came by a lot better than a night\nIn the book is the reason why you got two more years of eligibility is an extremely accurate castor was the other guy brand new ... not\nIt was when Bush was only averaging twenty three points per game on our fence and the last two weeks with the book from California they've they put up nearly a hundred boys who gave them something clearly for the better for Notre Dame\nYeah you guys mentioned odds earlier what in the world is going on with Alabama for credit lord they're they're out there breaking records\nAre legendary in Las Vegas now those are the odds makers are in all of this Alabama team I mean last year's Alabama team broke a lot of records in Vegas would point spreads and whatnot and they say this year's Alabama team is five points better than last year's team\nAnd a and the reason why obviously Alabama's about him in the country for the last ten years but there's quarterback from Hawaii he's so good that Vegas was treated like he's a first picking the draft elderly never had an explosive dynamic office before this year they do watch out\n[noise] I Know it was the a writer a car but uh boy Tiger Woods the windows sales are I mean you've lost all forms matches Phil Mickelson lost both of his they were brought back down to earth pretty quickly here\nAnd there was no diamonds back during that you talked about the great final hole to finish you own a golf club now Chanel outside of Paris about what you really have there's nobody plays of the final hole very often 'cause the matches were closed out I was going to barest you up for the American golfers really\nMet Tiger Woods is whack a Ryder Cup matches he's oh seven in ... he does not have a good record it the Ryder Cup for whatever reason he has a losing record Mickelson as the most Walsh is an Ryder Cup history for the you know it's\nNot good team player that match you up in November of ...

B. C. so much of the Yankees are six times in the last twelve games Nineteen guns the season\nAh they're off and just kind of one dimensional which is\nYou know company because you can pitch to it but it's scary because you walk a guy or two and that's a three run Homer waiting to happen uh and so that's going to be a real challenge I think their their starting pitching is is good enough for a playoff series\nA but then you know it's really going to be what do they have to do to get through Wednesday who's starting game one after they win that game\nA ... and then the bullpen has some parents hopefully the best in baseball and it's been really good this year but not against the red Sox ER is over five against the red socks over six at Fenway Park so they've been they've done well against that both at Oakland on the other side the four and a half months\nSince you've seen them may or may which is incredible so and it's you know they took care of business that guys running for sex\nBut it's a different team they rebuilt that bullpen they've got multiple arms to string together the Brits to play trying in one of the better closing the game and trying to come into the eighth inning Thirteen times this year so unlike kimbrell they they use it as a four or five six out guy\nOr so so you know Bob Melvin really starting pitching isn't\nGreat um you know you got no hit by a guy who's probably done for a year though they've been sort of coy about whether or not he could make a return for the for the playoffs I'm assuming he won\nA but they they don't mind you know they get three or four innings out of a pitcher if they don't mind I'll string together that both kind of shift and we know what that can do in the play offs and then\nYou know they got the only guy is it more over on young lady Martinez right I mean Chris Davis is just tear forty eight home runs major league leader ah they've hit more ... more home runs scored more runs on the road than any other team in baseball so they're not going to be intimidated by the way they can be drooling over Fenway so\nI you know I I don't I think look purely baseball perspective I'd rather see them face the Yankees I really I I think they take care of business has access to it but probably the Yankees and everything else that comes with it right that the the magnitude\nAnd the the the attention and the huge media following in Boston and your ... you know what does that to the young players that is what you'll see they'll Yankees a little more testing or they make a game seven of the Yale cs last year so he's young guys have won the series they\nDealt with that uh you know the red Sox still haven't got something to prove so we'll see how that plays out\nAbsolutely a great great takes right there and just looking at it I mean you can really make the argument ... any of these American League teams and we've been saying that all year I noticed that over the weekend with the Astros and Yankees and the red Sox wellbeing hundred when teams but I mean you just made the case for opening and they're just such a scary team I've been watching them all year\nWondering how they're doing this and obviously you mentioned Blake trying in in the year that he's having and Chris Davis Chris with a K I just I don't understand how this guy can do it and that's the way they make this line of God they wait they make the line move and then obviously you look at the world champions in what they accomplish last year\nA and how playoff ready they are and I know you've talked [noise] um a lot about\nUm bragging in in the year that he's had a MVP candidate and then you look at Cleveland and and their situation where they weren't extra innings against the cubs away from overcoming the curse\nAnd then you've got the Yankees like you said who maybe over achieved so we thought last year making it all the way the game seven at the ... and all they do is go out and had a guy like John Carlos standing so I mean it's\nYou can make the case for any one of these teams and and I think it's going to be a great play off\n[noise] yeah I Do too I mean you know all the all the elite teams are are are in the American league I mean I I say you know and and listen I I think the red Sox you know when the first round I think\nThey need to 'cause that's that's you know the last two years editing short of making it to the second round or certainly disappointment a and I just I worried about that second round I think you can in Cleveland might be to most complete teams in baseball and it doesn't mean that better than the red Sox but\nWhen you look at their bullpen their starting pitching then they've got it all a while the red Sox still trying to sort of work things out you know can Chauncey had a funny line but it kind of ring true rings true that that this might be the worst one hundred wind team in history\nAnd that yeah there are a great team you know went on to see a game or a hundred and eight game without being a great team but here you are at the end of the playoffs are at the end of the regular season on the on the verge of the playoffs\nAnd you really don't know who you're a guy is you really don't I mean they do they've got a plan you know but as fans we sit here looking at it I I have no idea who's coming in if they've got a one leading the seven term that really do and and\nWe won't know until that door open to somebody comes up I think that's why I Can't wait to the playoffs here because I just\nThere's so much uncertainty for team with so much potential uh that I don't know I've seen that combination a long time you know oh seven they were great tea and you knew that going in a row for Thirteen they were the underdogs and and you didn't have expectations especially if you have expectations\nBut but there's still that kinda uneasy feeling and you've got that you're just not sure how it's going to play out so I Can't wait\nKind of hit me there in ...\nI feel I Am in my late overlooking the national\nLeague and there's no way we what we just sat and everything I mean the numbers back it up with these with these powerhouses in the American league obviously anything can happen in the playoffs and I have been able to watch a lot of the national league teams but I I mean is it possible I'm overlooking I ... I think the one that's coming out of the American league I mean it's I just do\nYeah I Do too although I'll tell you what this Milwaukee to you right now is uh is is just reeking ah and then you know ... ... ... it says a thirty second\nHome run out the one that got away yeah\nAnd uh yeah they they but they I I I'm telling you that you know you never know what's going to happen and it doesn't really scare me or I think the Dodgers are you know the cubs are still very good team that kind of under achieve so they could certainly come in and and run away with something and\nIt seems kind of under a tree so fake it's certainly come in and and run away with something and but but the first team I could watch them closely and they're really something Colorado world I mean in court field and the owner of what happens up their true but that is all about the world series at that ...\n... if it said to me though you're right I think if you're going to get our rankings no doubt the top four teams in baseball and the American way\nAnd say it's going to be fantastic we've got to look forward to when we won't even not get going on hockey but I Know that's ... that's bubbling in my mind in the back burner we got the uh the Bruins starting and obviously I'm you know looking at the lines and everything it's a it's exciting to have hockey next week to for real\n[noise] yeah no doubt about that than regular a little while yesterday and it's all about you know who might be a defense\nFor now [noise] you know what the deal with ... now that'll factor in a you know it's ... really got to be ready to play on Wednesday he says he will be but we're nobody knew anything\nOr are they going to be great I mean I Can't wait times are great because you got your Wednesday or Thursday and then he got baseball friday and Saturday the red Sox so perfect or in a row right into this we have ... opening night one day in Washington Thursday you're going to have the patriots and the Bruins both going full tilt\nFriday's game on Saturdays game to\nA Sunday we all take a breather I'm drawing you know and and and catch your breath and we keep rolling with a day on Monday and I'm guessing probably at night baseball game that we don't have schedule yet so this last couple of weeks ago the fantastic\nCan't wait is is a this is my favorite time of the year and then there's just so much going on it I was saying right before you called it's tough to give everything a\nIt's it's it's proper credit and coverage I mean is that you could spend all the time on on any of these things are so many juicy a story lines and things that that develop and things to to think about so that's why it's so much fun to do this and we so appreciate your joining us in in a\nGiven us some great stuff

can be uh you like to say price but you worry about this ... ruin the disease or whatever if there's anything to that with his hand with the nerves and everything in the grips the ball but we'll find out for sure\nAnd then obviously I'm you know you go to a guy like Nathan of all the that the veteran throw straight gas it's tough a protest rise up and get after that fast ball when it's a hundred miles an hour and it's you know fifty forty degrees or whatever it's going to be so\nIt's going to be find them all Rodriguez Rodriguez Rodriguez is a he's kind of a wild card if he's on like he can be he's he's a fantastic pitcher we know that\nI it's just that he's had some injury problems and I know he's going to pitch in some capacity I think it depends whether they play open or whether they play the Yankees whether he's in starting rotation I think you'll be in the starting rotation\nIf they play Oakland but if they do play the Yankees and the Yankees when the wild card game playoff then I think you'd probably see Rodriguez and the broken\nBut either way the guys these guys are all going to perform\nOn us soil\nBut either way the ... these guys are all going to perform\nAlone so it was such as this at this point you guys like um [noise] I was just so it was a toy innings\nI think that's a great thing because you can get all your efforts you know you're only going to pitch to in South it's just tell us to just say listen I Want to put you in five and ... in the playoffs\nFor horns statue office learns is that for ... sake or we can go a couple of warnings all stressed\nOut she can when you make a good coming out after foreigners that way the Joe psychological you're on a given and you've got to know that for the pitch\nI think you're going to see more of that this year and I think that all change with Terry ... Andrew Miller a few years ago I think I don't think it's going to be a strange at all or unless the guy is dominating for him to be taken you know to be on a pitch count or to or oil for exactly what you said\nUm it's about victories and I I think the days of seeing a guy maybe go seven or eight strong unless he's absolutely got his stuff I don't think you're going to see that but I got to get to a this other call before I guess so I thank you for your time my front\nBut thank you [noise] good morning thank you for waiting you're on the show it's\nYou know there is there is I thought I thought to you yesterday I got to tell you you know Saturday Night was a fun night for me I I talked to a lot of people and a lot of people were giving me the thumbs down and I said they're going to blow them out tomorrow can you say that how can you say that I said listen they're gonna blow them out the game will be over\nThere they're going to be a multiple scores Sony Michel was going to run for a hundred yards and I was somebody actually put their hand on my forehead and said you know you I think yeah I got a fever I think you're getting I think you might not be feeling well and I said no quite the contrary I Am patriots fever baby their back I\nI have one question yes Miami to go three\nOkay they beat the jet they beat the jets are they beat the um the raiders and they beat Tennessee in a week one which was a seven hour game delayed by lightning and they actually won because Malcolm Butler got burnt on a long touchdown pass the ... by the way Kenny Stills um the directions were\nOne box borrow math I don't know if he took a wrong turn because he didn't show up he didn't show up Steve I have to hear all week about Kenny Stills you might as well be Kenny stance those are Kenny still stands I don't know one or the other and I don't and I'm not going to go on that note because the other sports show to a talk show hosts\nHad been on this negative connotation that the the patriots than deserve victory they played nobody yesterday let me tell you you know\nIt takes to like the song like the old song it takes to do it it takes two to tango so the the dolphins showed up\nThey just weren't ready you know like Mike Tyson says everybody has a plan until you get punched in the mouth and that's exactly what happened yesterday the patriots wanted it more and I told everybody that that would listen to me\nI'm not excusing the losses to map Patricia run the lions or to the you know Blake boy was in the Jacksonville Jaguars but you look at the you look at the scene\nLook at the scene Jacksonville absolutely the crowd going into it a couple of plays happened the patriots made some mistakes they got overcome ... in hospital territory by a very hungry team that you played in the AFC Championship game and then you fast forward to Detroit last week\nYou got map Patricia who's sitting on oh until may be playing for his job already I'm not saying that we're going to fire him but nobody was buying into the map Patricia\nA method of methodology there in Detroit it's a primetime game a and again you know the patriots all you needed to see yesterday and I'm not going to put too much credit for Josh garden but Josh abroad and being on the field changes everything talk\nShow you took the wars\nAnd made a difference\nYou see and I'm not sure if there was a show why he was the first guy in the end so much\nWe was I didn't catch that saying\nAnd he's saying up by it's almost like I I don't want to where it was well Joe but he's almost saying five at all\nYeah I felt that way with his comments and believe me\nI I don't want to make too much of it in one game but Brady\nSeem very pleased I don't think he made too many mistakes I think you might have wrong are maybe Rana wrong route once yesterday but they go to him on third down and he fought he caught that ball and he fought he didn't go down and just go down to small patriots receivers that we have we're quick wear loose and but\nYou know they don't take a lake and then keep on taking this guy is like Gronkowski he's going to catch the ball and you better be able to tackle them and you can't just ... a beast\nIt adds to mention to the patriots off as\nI said that yeah that would you call it a Adam is done\nHe's coming back that's another dimension Joe what can I say\nThey're gonna do I hope everybody get taken the cheese don't take the cheese they're going to do with you again you're going to ... I read a poem the lead off the show Steve about the people the fearful and faith listen going back to basics and restore NPR greatness and that's what time did yesterday and I got to tell you it's not only the emergence of Josh go out and as he gets more comfortable here\nMenu like you said you've got Adam and coming back Thursday you got to fill up to us that who I said you can call them a new Dionne branch because he's going to\nSay the foot yeah I mean he's\nHe's running precise routes I listen to the Brady out to the game I listen to Josh McDaniel door set is becoming the route monster he's gonna be the guy that like a Troy Brown that breeding knows he can go and he's going to have Edelman back\nIn the swat running nose Lance running nose quick outs and by the way you've got a first round draft pick\nHeisman Trophy level running back on a Georgia name Sony Michel when's the last time a patriots running back once over a hundred and twenty five carries and the guy looked like he didn't even break a sweat and then you're going to have the complimentary piece called James White who I think is one of the best players in a lead\nIn the league for what he's able to do on a weekly basis he can block he can catch the ball out in the backfield he can make people miss\nYou saw him do that on that touchdown run and then later that over the shoulder catch in the end zone James White is fantastic\nGreat complimentary pieces Sony Michel you got filled or sat getting more comfortable on the fence you got a whole Khamenei across Hogan the forgotten man and he's going to be back in the mix you got drunk you got Josh air guard an air Jordan I'm telling you this this off ants is going to be explosive\nIn a hurry and the defence the defence look better yesterday I don't know if it was just\nGetting a little bit more pressure but you saw an interception now\nUh you saw them get that fumble I was in Miami mistake on the snap but they didn't miss the opportunities yesterday when they presented themselves Steve\nShow it's unbelievable that game yesterday it just ... my position that patch always do with it it's shown images showing yesterday was on shrinking though\nHe was and that was not nobody was ready for that yesterday and ice ice I said you know\nI it he didn't have a training camp he really didn't have a pre season and they ... they're really emphasizing getting him the ball and and my fear was that they weren't going to use James White enough but they found a way to get them both a touches and catches and get them both involve yesterday\nBut they found a way to get them both a touches and catches and get them both involve yesterday and I thought they were smart\nTo the way they attacked Miami at the beginning uh attacking those defensive ends on both ends um and just pounding the ball in stain committed staying true\nOr even having Gronkowski staying into block early on in that game opens him up later on in the game you actually saw him in single coverage for the first time this year and you saw him wide open a few times almost Bronx\nSingle covered that Gordon\nAnd that's the thing and then when Edelman comes back it's I don't know what you're going to do when I when when it's a red zone opportunity now in two weeks 'cause 'cause uh\nOn the practice and and looking at the roster and I'm thinking\nBoy it's going to be interesting to see who the odd man out as they are so many running backs down my ... Jeremy Hill then you know at the time some Sony Michel ... that hadn't been hurt yeah so that was the first time I get to see him obviously we knew James White was going to be a lock and then um\n[noise] ah you know some of the under backs that didn't end up making it out of the out of the training camps so you know lo and behold we find ourselves in a situation now with Jeremy hose injury with on my ... you know ... subsequently moving on 'em to New Orleans and then ah we lose a rex burger can now to IRA and it's just funny that\nYou know whether they immediately thought he was going to be this in this much of a prominent role in despite not having the training camp as you said he's looking like a lick the guy that he is and also a his teammate Nick Chubb ran an alarm touchdown run yesterday so both Georgia running backs represented themselves\nWell yesterday and once again dollar check as you said that looks a lot better to some of those naysayers\nIt's a it's kind of unfortunate that that idea when got hurt because you know him being you know the first round draft pick and and now ... assessing the need ... thinking that we had the need on the offensive line and and how he was going to be use so\nUh it's again the ad for a guy that's been criticized a lot with how he's drafted um he may have found a real gem here with Michele\nThere I think so I mean I I don't know you know I think it's a really good START I mean he didn't play too well ... in Detroit\nLast week and he tried he had fifty yards I understand the third and won where he went backwards really upsets fans but yeah I think it was an overall loss of frustration where they often only scored ten points he he was far from the only issue the lack of depth that receiver\nGetting behind early in the inability to pick up or down so\nYeah I think it's encouraging unless they need him I mean you're right they had so many running backs the point that they released jealously embolden\nVoter was that a ... yeah ... ... in Miami now become a bold and uh I think is bigger strength was more in special change on bats later said he's one of the best special teams players he's ever worked with so but\nYou know ... got signed by New Orleans so they had a dog that extra that in the first three weeks it was held for the season and maybe bark at for the season so her cat is out of trouble staying healthy for a while now so it really throw a wrench in their plans and now they named Michelle they don't I mean\nOther than Michelle in white the only a running back then the last right now is John John Barter day more brought in for his part returning to build these you did have three hours yesterday\nRight right Kenya um interesting too I wanted to ask you something I saw yesterday the day that uh I got to talk to you at the camp I'm the one of the injuries that I saw was ... he was pulling up I'm\nGoing down the sideline maybe over extending himself on along Brady pass attempt turned out that that was the last play he would make a as a patriot as\nThere was some cloudy and his two it whether it was an IRA thing if they were releasing them and then it was I heard he was hanging around maybe potentially coming back and then we go through this situation with decker and now they find Gordon and then I look yesterday and joining Matthews is catching a fifty six yard touchdown pass for the eagles\nWas there more than ... than injury was it a money thing why did the patriots give this guy back we'll give them away or was it on his own or did you have any insight on what happened with not my take\nOn Jordan math was was when he got hurt\n'em that day or so desperate receiver they knew that he is injury was uncertain okay member exactly what the in laws but you know you wouldn't be out at least the first three four weeks I think they were convinced that he might not be back to the middle of the season okay I think they just thought they couldn't carry him because\nOf their situation at receiver mix and obviously that they could have gotten something in a trade for them they would have but given the injury and nobody was going to trade or some\nYeah I mean they made a decision I think you can say it was premature\nOr because he would have missed the pre season and the first couple of games and I just think they didn't they didn't think the risk was worth the reward of carrying him right out yeah he is helping pull Adelphia Philadelphia also shorter receiver that's why they brought\nHim they brought him and yeah and they do yeah I I just thought it was um it was ... I'm I'm very pleased with what happened yesterday I just thought that was an interesting side to that because I I knew he had gone to Philadelphia but to see him come in and make a play I was you know I'm thinking okay\nI think yesterday was the first game he's appeared in the sea yeah it'll be just signed a deal\nYesterday was the first game he's appeared in the sea yeah it'll be just signed a deal yeah I mean we'll see what he gives them I mean there are also Adelphia is too into now show you know they're not looking so\nAre there and you know they're not looking so great and and it caused by the first two games and now they've gone back to Carson was but I think he's clearly the better quarterback but\nYeah I think we'll see what math gives women and I think it maybe it is fair to criticize the patrons for being a little premature on that I just think they didn't think they could carry of what the roster spots they needed guys that could help now I mean because don't forget there already carrying Edelman grain he wasn't county has lost a first for games there'll be back this week when I go home now [noise]\nRight yeah I mean they're just they wanted bodies that to play\nIn that you bring up I'm just staying with the receiver thing quick because it's been a recent thing and everyone's been talking about obviously too early to tell on Gordon by a all signs from what his teammates have said to the media from what I've heard\nPhilip don't set complimenting is work ethic and saying he's really trying to study the playbook and Brady said he was happy to have ... yesterday we saw him go to him on a key third Downey made the play I\nInvolve things are created equal and this guy can somehow shake these these problems and demons that he has not been able to shake\nAt the core of this this guy is very talented and obviously playing with Brandon ... and Jason Campbell in Cleveland and a lot different than playing with the greatest of all time in my opinion so\nI mean am I should I just heard my enthusiasm like the show and calmed down because this is only two catches the thirty odd for Josh brought an or could this completely changed the patriots dynamics on on\nUm I think it's somewhere in the middle to be honest you know I think you have to catch it yesterday it's a good start ... I think he is a good a good person I I mean he has a substance abuse issue what you write all the goes away cause them\nTo be suspended for two yeah I mean all the guys have said he hasn't cause any problems that you've been here he's had his head in the play both ... really been trying to learn at a ground cows he said that Philip or set set so I think the work ethic has been good\nI don't know the hamstring how much is slowing down yesterday he\nHad a couple of nice catches but I think ... knows this is his last chance I mean if it can't work here only anybody else is going to give them a chance on you know I don't think when Clinton was going to release some or trade them there were that many other teams interested in right right you know maybe San Francisco maybe Dallas but\nSo I think that yeah he knows that it has to work here I think he can be a a deep threat it can also be sort of apply maker that they need them and I think it can work at it I don't think he's you know I think in two thousand Thirteen he had\nI think it was eighty seven catches he had a great year yeah I've years but I didn't really have done much said nothing right and um\nBut I don't know you gotta catch eighty seven balls and by you but\nIf he can give you thirty or forty catches with some big plays you know stretch the deep end make your respect them right hate the attention off ... exactly you know helped free up or set that's what I was a you know and then you've got Edelman I think yeah I can be a good edition doesn't he doesn't have to be\nFor me to to see the movie as a success he doesn't have to be the two thousand Thirteen Josh Gordon show that he can be terrible you know make a few plays but I think that the move can can really work out nicely\nAnd that's what I was hoping you would say and because that's kinda how I Am thinking and um maybe being more of a fan and trying to be positive about what the possibilities are but like you um I didn't really expect you know these huge you know fireworks in\nExplosive numbers but just the fact that just the optics Sunday yesterday's filled or sent in narrow Pattison both made plays again you know they might not even been on the field with him at that time I just feel like his presence\nBrings another element to that\nA long since we have to as you said at least respect what he can do what he could possibly do and I think God just patriots fans are excited that to have a guy that has that kind of explosive this again 'cause we all know what guys link Hogan and obviously what Adelman can do just that every down tough guy that he is making a\nMoving to change but it's nice to know that you know hopefully that's the guy they can go down the field to win in an open things are bad but again like you know just being consistent and being you know showing up and practicing like you're supposed to and being on time and things like that\nWe won't get ahead of ourselves because the track record is is what it is and we'll we'll just take it one day at a time one step at a time now getting tonight will shark week on Thursday or I guess they're opening up as a pretty big favorites against this cos team they had a heck of a battle yesterday with Houston\nYeah I I think the ... when I'm\nOut checked said after the game the Colts have a lot of new players since the last time they play that I haven't looked up I don't remember if they played them last year um but I I think that this should be I mean they call it's obviously have locked locker still coming back he was out last year\nAnd so I think that uh you know Jacoby Burr said is there a backup we're all familiar with him you know the avenue coaching staff and Frank right which is a good coach he was the bills backup quarterback the nineties you lead them to the\nFamous romantic greatest comeback against us during the ... coordinator last year for the eagles when they want and if you want to stay with the eagles have Joshua Daniels going back out of the or a job with the calls it the last minute you know yeah I think the Colts are\nYeah no uh there was a very poor yesterday by my friends at all at the Steelers are looking for a second round\nPick and a really good player for him um it's a weird thing is as bad ballads not under contract with the skills they franchise to him but he has not signed the franchise\nSigned a contract so she sort of in limbo because in order to trade and they would have to sign him and then trade him so much as possible they can work through you know all those legal maneuvering but\nYeah I think they are ready to move on for him but it's you know I think it's almost had a bigger effect on the locker room and on the field because they just all I think he was a popular player in the last ... you know they don't completely understand why you know he was franchise last year they had a year to work out a long term yeah\nAnd look they're they're just far apart probably on the numbers on what you are I'm sure the Steelers have made him\nSome sort of a long term offer but he wants a lot more SALT I think at this point the logical thing is\nTo get what you can get you know obviously not going to train him to the patriots because they look at them as their chief rival but yeah I mean if you're a patriots fan I think you should be happy because the rest of the AFC and\nYou know I'm In Kansas City looks good but you know Andy Reid started six at all last year and then they end up losing the wild card they tend to fade late yeah\nPittsburgh is a not looking so good they are one to have one\nUm you know Baltimore it's come out of nowhere I think there's three and a lot yeah but ah I'm not sold on Joe Flaco solve proof there's nothing to really there's no rams of the AFC [noise] no I think that they're you know they're right in it and so they're not behind even with the patriots early struggles [noise]\nDo you think the ... the I mean we they had a year to figure it out do you think who do you think's wrong if anyone's wrong in this Lenny on thing is he wrong to want to sit in the security I mean I Know the franchise them several times he is\nHe has been you know did on the ... no pun intended with all the with all the ways they get in the ball it just it seems like that to knock that off and trying to think as much as ... still stands back there and\nTakes those wicked shots to unload that ball and they've got brown and shooting ... shoes to running underneath it just seems like it's had an impact like you said and I just I I don't understand if you're not close to the way you want to be and you have a player of that caliber lake you like you said why you don't get that figure it out\nYeah no I think it is frustrating that they can get ... you know I always believe when you're having a association you lock the doors you get into the woman you don't leave do your work out a deal but\nThey haven't been able to get in a way that I Know he was franchise last year I personally don't think players should be allowed to be franchise two years in a row\n... I'm In the NFL is the only legal even has the the franchise tax break\nIn last I think ... frustrated you know he he you know he's a running back whose career as a short life and he wants the ability to test the open market people better services at the scales out and let them do it\nAll I think the Steelers are exerting our maximum leverage using the franchise tag yeah\nWell I Know that is that if he was allowed to be a free agent made in franchise and he was coming back to Pittsburgh because somebody would have offered him ... I think he's probably looking for what Todd girlie got with the rams somewhere for yeah\nFifty five million but I don't know what the Steelers have all but I mean I think that's the top running back contracting football like you know maybe they don't feel also the Steelers that with the NFL be ... in such a passing lay at that running back\nAs a as valuable anymore so um\nGuys I said I might have come to a head now still recognize they're not going to a great you know he has the right to come back the last six games to get credit for the season but what good is that going to do the Steelers have your addict contention\nAlready so who I think they're starting to recognize that we should get something for and then\nIt's it's just because I'm thinking of the fresh while I have young and they do it we kept young for a long time yeah the Thomas situation I yesterday I didn't even see that when it happened and I had to go back and and and look at it this morning\nYou talk about a similar thing it's completely different situation but similar in a in a in a little bit a guy that wanted uh we we we kind of thing didn't want to be there anymore and was kind of trying to get down to trade forum and then he holds out and he wants to preserve his health and he comes back yesterday and breaks his leg\nAnd apparently makes an obscene gesture to the bench on his way out on the current thoughts on her own Thomas situation\nI think that's the levy on bell fears what happens is Thomas Thomas held out all of training camp to report it just before the season was the last year of his contract he wanted a new contract they didn't give it to them so you just said okay I'll play the last year he didn't want to lose the money\nAnd now that he gets hurt yeah he's lost his chance to earn\nA you know big money contract I mean he'll get a contract next year but it's going to be at a much lower level than if you didn't suffer the injury and I think that's why he made the obscene gesture\n[laughter] you know it's a strange situation out there in Seattle well and I I mostly speculating I don't have any sort of looking\nBefore the game interestingly enough in trade or Thomas wanted to second round ... for him [noise] and I thought you know that's an unfair and then if you can agree to him a long term deal but\nYou know he he um but now I mean why would somebody do that if he's going to be a free agent you know at the end of the year you could lose them\nIt's you know it's a unique situation there and a lotta Peter\nI'm One of these people are not as big a fan of trading proven players for draft it's because I Do think ah you know draft picks are unpredictable and dollar check said last week draft picks are an inexact science\nYou know try a\nClear on accident example of that to see how that story plays out with John grew to make\nGreat so far this year yeah\n... ... right now you know he's to me he's a generational player he's one of the best that I've seen in a long time and as you said you know it doesn't it unless those to draft picks they brooding gets turned into\nGuys that can help him winning a few years that trade is going to get looked at but then the other side of that is if the rate is not going to win with this team anyway then as great as he is on defenses that really worth it to be a good team you know ... it's all in how you look at it I guess we'll next the amazing I\nKnow it's like they got they got a first round pick next year so you know take some time to develop and then they don't get on top twenty twenty so it might be twenty twenty for the for you know twenty twenty three at least for all we know you know why they're who got the best of the deal you know ...\n... we got to see any of those players you know or you know turn out to be\nTrue enough and just as quickly uh fitzpatrick guy if its magic might have ended I think a nod James Winston ends up getting the job back now probably after yesterday I'm just some surprising things around the league I didn't expect Chicago to put up that kind of an office of not showing against Tampa Bay\nYeah Trump risky looks really good the patriots go to Chicago and three weeks I think ah yeah and so we'll Mac I mean the thing was Chicago is there in a tough division with Green Bay in Minnesota so you know they may not win their division I don't think they will um but you know they were in another to\nAnd they may not win their division I don't think they will but you know if they were in another division they probably would win it maybe they get a while but yeah it's risky looks really good and they will blew out and you're right it's Patrick has come back or if he had a really good for us to games last two games they have lost the struggle so\nUm I think ah yeah I think they will go back to James Winstead I mean given the money that they've given him right but if it's Patrick not bad to have as a backup\nNo he's he's definitely shown that you know he can for a little while at least you can only got a little bit down and and get get something going on and then quickly lasting surprise maybe the leagues so far with all the\nSituation they had the Tennessee Titans are three and one would victories there'll be Jacksonville in Philadelphia yesterday I'm doing it with ... gathered in Mariel combination ah\nMy ... I was a big win Sam yesterday\nYeah you know the titans both got I think er about checked said one brave oil wells here that he thought of any player he's ever coached and they have their differences believing but any player that he's ever coach would be a really good coach it would be brave or\nI think right or showing that they'll be top and interesting you lead the tight starting a corner backs are now a mouth of a\nButler and look around at Logan right yeah sacred starting corners in two thousand and then they have the lowest they signed deal you know it's like the history of the patriots south so yeah not very I mean the the parents I think is good so Mary owner can play like he has a\nYou know who's in that division Tennessee Jacksonville I mean yeah I think they can win that division and not you know the patriots play in Tennessee and in November So that should be a tough game yeah\nI'm sure that you know the former patriots will be motivated look I don't the patriots have shown so far this season at least four games are much better home team and they all rode\nTeam that's for sure but you're you're right when you say you look at the schedule now will\nAnd obviously Patrick ... has been a bit of a ... I'm surprised how well he's done we'll see what happens tonight with them or I think maybe that the Kansas City goes down tonight but we'll see just maybe an upset protection for me but this Kansas City game now to Chicago game now the Tennessee game now some of these games that maybe\nThe ends made it may not have gone through much of a they may be better games than we than we expected now\nTo Chicago and a tennis game will be a challenge you know they're going to\nChicago will be you know the next door at home and the Chicago so that'll be their next road test and a and I think ... gonna beyond that we have to play better on the wall we can't get behind like we did in Jacksonville and Detroit Tom Brady so that's really tough to come back from behind on the road just\nTaken the time I

I think you would say wait a minute timeout\nSaturday White House ... wouldn't you have the state police at best a gate this uh I may tell them about it but you really want to call him why your channel twelve have him investigated no that was done to try to drop this bomb on the cabin\nAnd why would you tell someone here's the number of some of the Washington Post CNN so my questions again for Senator Sheldon Whitehouse\nAnd I'd love to try to folks I Will I'll Try I'll Try to get out there and reach out so I absolutely will try to reach out there and get to him\nSo\nNeeds to be answered\nSo what needs to be answered from center the White House is exactly why would you do that\nWhy would you tell someone to contact the media and then does that mean that he doesn't uh trust the investigate you have the FBI at your resources you have the Judiciary Committee\nInvestigative body but instead what does he do\nHe tells the person to go to the press so my question to post these questions remain unanswered by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and again I implore\nI don't want to say beggar plead but Providence Journal channel twelve channel ten ask Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and folks you can call US citizen call channel ten coal channel twelve called the Providence Journal asked\nHim why are you asking Sheldon these questions who was the reporter is that how you operate it as attorney general is that how you operate as us attorney if someone called with a report that somebody rapes someone did sit ... attorney general\nI was here in Rhode Island Sheldon Whitehouse was Rhode Island attorney general he was elected in Nineteen Ninety eight he served Nineteen Ninety nine to two thousand two is that how we operated\nSo when someone called his office with a complaint\nOr they want to report something he said oh here called the Providence Journal they can investigate hair call Parker Gavin get in the IT channel ten here cult let me give you a ... notice and when you call Tim white you got a really blow this up you've got a really sell it to them\nSo it doesn't matter if the stories true\nYou know it's like the Seinfeld thing remember it's not a lie if you believe to be true\nIs it that is that how we operated Sheldon sits on the Judiciary Committee and encouraged a fake accuser the whole thing was made up I Want to be very clear about that made up\nThe story he encouraged the guy to blow it up to the media\nAnd then lied well a reporter is the one that could investigate this a reporter could investigate it why would the Judiciary Committee investigate it why would you hand that off to the press basis so appalling and disgraceful\nOr you can read all about it folks again I'm getting email I got an email\nOr this is from Lauren John yesterday my sister went\nTo the Rhode Island convention center with a friend\nShe actually went because she does like vice president Biden alright fine she was outside as Senator Whitehouse was than talking to the media I can confirmed for you not one member of the Rhode Island media asked Senator Sheldon Whitehouse\nAbout the FBI and the fake accuser not one she had heard about this story\nHeard you talk about it I had told her about it and she stood there and waited for them to ask Senator Whitehouse about it not one of them asked him a question about it they only asked how did it feel to be on the national stage or what was it like having vice president Biden come in oh that's great\nThat's great plus he was on sixty minutes last night nice job what boy there you go what a great job really getting the answers audible Sheldon water disgrace that embarrassment this guy comes forward with a baked accusation\nAnd what's even more appalling it's like it's not even the White House was positive that it was true\nI'm sure right away the guy sounded like a not so what does he do oh go to the media tell them who is the reporter who is the media outlet and is that the way when does he ever done that if he done this all along so if someone calls\nMe just to see if I can wrap my arms around this if someone to call center the White House when he was the attorney general it said I Want to report a crime by a big public official\nWas that is the way he operated as attorney general not called the Rhode Island state police no no no instead he said oh here called the Providence Journal he had no intentions of letting anyone know that he contact until this guy to contact the media not\nAnd then they said till the FBI got involved and ask this nut job that made up the story\nWhat made you contact and again folks we don't know what the media outlet is apparently White House is hiding he's hiding behind the old has been washed up Claudine Schneider suddenly emerged Claudine Schneider has lived in Rhode Island in over Thirty years\nWho the hell cares what ... thinks well Claudine Schneider Claudine Schneider folks all they want to say is Trump Trump Trump and try to dragging on that what a joke he is trying to end on top of that you know what the problem you know what the media did report\nWhite House laid out by the way he laid out the media did report on this locally the meaning did report Senator Whitehouse laid out the steps he feels that they should be taking to get to the bottom of the whole thing oh okay that part they report on\nThat part they go and lay out of how they should be conducting investigation no one asked that support they report on you know Senator Whitehouse I'm just curious as you're laying out\nThe steps that they should be following as they're going to investigate this whole thing at what point do you put that they should contact the media that part I haven't seen\nTheir reporting on Senator Whitehouse said these are the steps that should be taken\nAs investigators are going through this investigation we want this we want to find out if or did he drink blood or Bud Light duty drink hard liquor or just a beer when he was jailed these are the questions that he feels should in fact\nBe asked and that the media goes with Senator Whitehouse lays out the questions that should be asking the investigation you know I I for some reason I'm failing to see the part that he mentions\nThat the FBI that the ah that people should then contact the media as they're trying to get into the middle of this whole thing\nFolks what an absolute disgrace seven six six Thirteen eighty morning it's John ... it is the John ... show\nWill take more of your phone calls again judge Flanders has got to join me at one thirty they says horrific good I'm Glad good let the FBI be after Senator Whitehouse and as this not the FBI says to this not that made the fake report who told you to call the media center White House told me to call

hello\nGood morning John this is ... ... it's a privilege just to talk to you\nShake you very much good afternoon Steve Moore and uh had\nDianne Feinstein Maxine Waters that strict pillows Chuck Schumer Kamala Harris Cory Booker Jeff Flake and then we showed the White House John Doe and you just say anymore\nAt the party in her testimony sheet that there were four boys in addition\nTo her friend and herself she could not remember the name of the fourth boy and no one has come forward\nSo also she has struggled to recall him recent events relating to the allegation Dr Ford struggled to remember her interactions with the Washington Post think of this she thinks she can remember the year that my memory from Nineteen eighty to Dr Ford could not remember\nIf she showed a full or partial set of therapy no to the Washington Post she does not remember whether she showed the post reported the therapists notes or own summary of the notes\nThe Washington Post article set a portion of the therapists those was provided but in her testimony Dr Ford could not recall whether she summarize the notes with a reporter or showed her ... her the actual notes\nShe does not remember\nIf she actually had a copy the notes when she texted the Washington Post on July sixth\nAnd then Dr Ford refused find anywhere therapy no so the committee folks do you see the pattern here\nDianne Feinstein they immediately get the Washington Post involved when Sheldon Whitehouse has someone contact him what does he do he tells the person it's a fake fake accusation against Brett Kavanaugh to contact the reporter\nDr Ford does not remember what the house of salt delivered took place or where the house was located more importantly listen to that she doesn't remember how she got from the party back to our house\nHer inability to remember this detail racist significant questions she told the post the party took place near the Columbia Country club that club is seven miles from her home\nShe also testified it's a twenty minute drive from my childhood home\nShe agreed for the first time in her testimony\nThat she was driven somewhere that night either to the party from the party of both\nShe was able to describe hiding in the bathroom locking the door in exiting the house she described want to make sure she did not look like she had been attacked\nBut she had no memory of who drove her or when nor has anyone come forward to a dentist by him or herself as the driver\nGiven all this took place for cell phones are waging a ride home was not have been easy she said she ran out of the house after coming downstairs did not state you made a phone call from the house or that you told anyone else there after she does remember small distinct\nGold anyone else there after she does remember small distinct details from the party unrelated to the assault\nShe testified she exactly one beer at the party and it was taking no medication think of that how many I add one beer how did you get home I don't remember who drove your home I don't know who drove it at a party I don't know\n\nDr fourteen three people who attended the party all three have submitted statements denying any memory of the party\nDr Ford has not offered a consistent account of the alleged assault according to the letter to Feinstein she heard judge cabinet or mark judge talking to other party Gore's Bush was hiding in the bathroom after the alleged assault but according to her testimony she could not hear them talking to anyone\nOutside\nIn the legal contacts here's the bottom line he said she said she said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this cases even weaker that Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either refuted her allegation or fail to corroborate them\nFor the reasons discuss below I Do not think a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence for the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of the evidence standard\nDr Ford has not offered a consistent account or when the alleged assault happen in July sixth taxed she said it happened in the mid eighties July thirtieth she's that had happened in the early eighties August seventh\nShe said it happened one high school summer in the early eighties she didn't cross out the word early for reason she wouldn't explain September sixth Washington Post article ... report it Dr Ford said it happened in the summer of baby to\nThan the sub September sixteenth article reported the notes from an individual therapy session and twenty Thirteen showed her describing the assault occurring in her late teens but she told the post and the committee she was Fifteen when the assault occurred\nShe refuses to turn over the therapy records for the committee to review\nWhile it's common for victim must be uncertain about dates Dr Ford failed to explain how she was suddenly able to narrow the timeframe to a particular season and particularly year\nDr Ford has struggled with Jennifer I judge Kavanaugh as the assailant by name known name was given twenty twelve marriage therapy notes NO NAME was given a twenty Thirteen therapy notes Dr Ford husband claim she recalls hearing capital as being\nAt that point cabinet was being was widely reported the press as potential Supreme Court nominee if Governor Romney was going to be the president in any event talked it took doctor for Thirty years to name her say a sailing\nDelayed disclosure abuse is common to this\nSo this is not you know I'm sure they're not disputing that\nWhen speaking with her husband doctor for change your description the incident to become less specific Dr Ford testify she told her ... her husband out of a sexual assault before they were married\nShe told the Washington Post she informed her husband she was the victim of physical abuse at the beginning of their marriage she testified both times she was referring to the same incident\nDr Ford has no memory of key details in the night in question details that could help she does that remember who invited her to the party how she heard about it and she does that remember how she got to the party or go home from the party these are all very very important\nA doctor forwards explanation\nOf why she disclosed her allegation does raise questions listen to that folks and again good afternoon it's John Detroit is the John ... show she claimed originally\nShe wished for her story to remain confidential but the person operating the tip line at the post was the first person other than her therapist or husband to whom she disclose the identity of her alleged attacker\nShe testified she has a sense of urgency to relay the information in the Senate and the president she did not contact the Senate however because she claimed she did not know how to do that she doesn't explain why she knew how to contact the Congress one but not her senator\nDr forts given much is a doctor could not remember she was being audio or video recorded restrict the polygraph could not remember when the polygraph record the same day as a grandmother funeral or the day after the funeral\n[laughter] think about that it would also been highly inappropriate to administer polygraph to someone who is grieving\nFolks I mean the whole thing just falls apart the more you go through all of this\nSeven six six Thirteen eighty seven six six Thirteen eighty you can email me John at ... dot com\nJohn ... dot com um again coming up at one o'clock it is political Monday so we are in fact going to talk with Justin cats managing editor for ocean stay current dot com and then judge Flanders is going to join me\nAt coming up at one thirty and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse has a lot of questions to answer\nThe national media\nIs looking into the fact think about this just for a second the national media is looking into the fact\nThat Senator Whitehouse that the FBI is investigating center the White House told this person and made the fake accusation um why did Senator Whitehouse tell this person to contact the media\nAnd yet it's for whatever reason folk someone I I don't have an answer why they would ignore story like this I I don't I Wish I had an answer I don't have any answer for you\nSeven six six Thirteen eighty it's All right there if you go to ... dot com I I don't

J. was on ... was another little car like that\nAnd apparently it was a stolen car and the only reason they could tell was stolen whoever stole it did such a great job with the numbers in anything that the front bumper\nWas taken off because the owner said that one time you had to replace the bumper but could not the bushes around the you know the salt beds and he couldn't find too so he put one square\nSo when they took off the the bumper that was the car okay\nSo we're we're known as the president selling stolen cars well the law is very simple\nThe guarantee auction guarantees titled to a car so we gave the person that we sold a car to their money back and we got out on the back for the auction okay but it wasn't fun I mean because of the two public people right\n[laughter] and\nAnd the guy the guy that that had bought the ... he actually bought a car again I don't know if you bought it from the FBI or wherever you bought it from but he got the car again and in and of course he kept it I Can't remember the last name but a\nA pretty well known for a known name and they don't a machine shop or something like that and he wasn't too happy\nWith the those are the types of things that you have to live with you know and the good times and the bad times ah\nAnd if you want that in ... it was very dedicated are there because he lives but now the new beginnings and as you know like I said and folks from Facebook when he came from Florida\nHe didn't just selling he was here I wouldn't know it he just come into the studio sit down and sit down and take over to show for two hours that he could care less what I was talking about and ... and reminisce and talk about because he lives in\nAnd across you put together auctions that is a garage and things to broadcast live from from there said here from WPRI radio and I'm\n... sold the business and and moved to Florida but it very dedicated to pads dumpster in treating the Sean and everybody in Nepal dumpster also be when he was alive or and or anything I've aspirin for charities he never never hesitated\nSo I lost a dear friend and he was the same I gave it sympathies go to Judy and Terry and Eric Kelly\nI'm

walking she uses their feet if he's in a car she certainly not driving I Would say most mayors unless um they're not feeling well um I Can't remember a mayor\nThat did not walk\nIn the parade\nA but that's a that's up to the mayor um\nTo to be it's a very long walk\nA and um it to be as far as I'm concerned I'm\nThen she gets she's on the front 'cause she goes to the reviewing stand I mean she is the man when socket let's understand something or the or ethnicity when socket his is a somewhat a co sponsor has to uh taught him fest it's always been\nOkay I mean you can't get him on MORNING from uh the uh the committee as to the job that uh daggers Nino does or what his crows or for the city or are they put on a ... a which is a\nAnd the ... the the other thing is this on such a sacred

okay forty years so it's a it's a non political event\nAnd if it's becomes political than it has to be interior and that's something we're not going to find out about it\n\nIt depends on the leadership that you're dealing with if leadership at all anyway a that's a story on that but it is a\n\nYou're gonna have to show me why have occurred concrete reason why why um what the reason was if you share that with anybody\nUm because to me ah she certainly knew was going to be an issue because there'll be no on this by the way is\nUh she certainly knew what was going to be an issue or because of the you know all this by the way is handling the button number one that's given era to the uh\n\nThe grand marshal which is up for ... who have to be running for school committee that's

the day and I'll be brief\nUm for some reason I had not received my car registration and\nSince my registration is due in October\nI was advised that I probably should check on it well\nYou know I looked in a few places to see that's the kind of piece of mail that I Would have dealt with immediately I get a lot of mail\nMost of it or requests for donations and I have to plow through that stuff all the time but a ... something that came from the state of Rhode Island I Would have looked at immediately\nRemembered German ... not ... we're now my mum and the people I Know\nI'm aware of that

she said Oh yes and she told me how much my registration would be and then she said look you can do you belong to AAA I said yes I Do she said you can do this at AAA cause I said\nI didn't know whether I couldn't say with certainty that I had received ... and lost it nor could I say with certainty that I had never received it so I said look I don't know [noise]\nSo she said well you can go

yeah it is here this weekend\nThey are busy busy busy getting ready and I'm Glad to say on this will be reporting on the weekend whether each and every day looks like a gene dandy weekend for autumn fest looks great\nAnd that's good news on the edge goodness rainy outdoor event [noise] um but uh you can uh you can live and die by the weather or when you're planning a major outdoor multi day event such as autumn festival in so much invested a in a course on one of the crucial\nUh el ... elements are at this stage of the game\nAnd a lot of people don't understand the funding of autumn festival goes why what goes where a vendors versus a onsite sales one of the key impacts to the economics the two key impacts would be a the beer garden in the amusement rides for the economics of the festival itself\nI'm\nAnd looks good looks good\nLooks good so ... we'll start off today and we'll tell you the next twenty four hours and will lead into the weekend\nOr tonight live and all that or fifty five degrees will have some shower activity much like we're having now continuing or the roads are wet out there uh and I'll just say 'cause I just saw this on on diamond hill road um be careful folks even though it's not a you know a ... a river flowing down the street\nAll the roads are still wet and they can be slippery\nDoesn't take a lot of water actually I Believe it or not besides hydro planning of deep puddles of roadways are very slippery with light rain versus a heavier rain\nI'm due to the fact that there there are certain things from a motor vehicles and tires and things that end up on the roadway and you get a little bit of rain what happens is those oils lift up the just like a you know oil and water don't mix all the oils will rise up\nHas that little bit of rain gets underneath that are in creates a little bit of a slick spot or when it rains all heavier eventually washes off the washes down it washes up and it just sits there like this can be very slippery there was a vehicle or coming are down ... diamond hill road going towards the laws\nAnd it was a news was no traffic there was no side street traffic there's no main street traffic just as vehicle coming down and I was going to take a left on St Louis on over here are and just didn't slow down enough\nYou know on that turn\nAnd uh in slid a there was some skidding thankfully did not strike but came very close to going head on into the telephone pole out here\nI mean is dumped inches from it and I'm sure gave that the driver quite as scary as able to you know stop the car back it up and continue on down the road but\nJust to to say or don't take a a light rain or for granted when it comes to slippery road ways they can actually be more slick\nAnd rain conditions like this then heavier rain where your main concern at that point becomes hydro planning their safe driving segment of the day [laughter]\nAnyways just shop productivity continue gets side by some time uh overnight or she has sixty five degree high tomorrow we're expecting more rainfall tomorrow and then we saw today it looks like it'll be a afternoon early evening into the nighttime where the heaviest rainfall will be tomorrow\n... sixty one and then after that rain Tuesday night\nLooks like conditions really do\nShape up which is good uh especially Wednesday on on getting that park ready are usually the or the tents or the ... going up to some point Wednesday and Thursday and friday it'll stop moving in sound system assembly and so on and so forth leading into the weekend so that looks like\nA the back half of the week is going to be excellent weather for autumn fest um what will keep you up to speed if anything looks different\nOr Wednesday upper sixties around sixty nine degrees wants those morning showers make their way out either late morning early afternoon a sunshine will come out looks like a fine Wednesday fifty six overnight\nOr Seventy five on Thursday sun and cross throughout the day that Seventy six Seventy five expected to be mostly dry a little breeze ten mile an hour winds sixty overnight into friday Thursday night or tomorrow we'll have a a a deeper or analysis of what's going on right on up this weekend which is a very well be in Studio with me\nOn a Thursday night they do have a fundraiser going on in the beer garden will tell you about that tomorrow night\nSixty degrees the overnight while I went to friday sixty two the daytime high and it looks like that'll be the coolest day um but the ... the grounds on technically open on daytime friday looks like it'll be a chili friday night as well that is the pay one price\nLooks like it'll be chilly friday night as well that is the pay one price a ride event friday night the amusement area in the beer garden of the two entities upon them that's open friday evening\nOr so maybe just a little chilly but it looks like it'll be dry\nIn sixty two the daytime high and when we're talking about those event you talking about like six o'clock at night it's going to be in the mid fifties so it will be a little cool friday night Saturday looks fantastic sixty six the daytime Hi sunny ... mostly sunny skies excuse me\nA will take that looks like it'd be a dry Saturday fifty three overnight in the Sunday\nUh mid seventies\nDoes it get better than that what a great Sunday or for autumn best looks pretty good for the um\nThe fireworks right now Sunday night looking at a clear skies right through firework time just a little object right now I'm seeing something they're around six seven o'clock at night or maybe the brief brief is the showers but it really looks like it's nothing much right now\nA mid seventies clear skies on Sunday great fireworks night will only have a low in the upper fifties run on fifty degrees\nSo should be a very comfortable evening at on that in the parade day still looks good a re close to Seventy sixty nine Seventy degrees on Monday the parade steps off around nine AM and there'll be approaching the mid sixties by that early in the morning\nSo it looks like a ... right now and nice parade day on Monday\nA again right around Seventy degrees are mostly sunny skies and it even looks good and this is important to some of the workers\nEven looked great on Tuesday after on them that's because that's when a lot of the dismantling does go on in the park or looking they will be in the mid seventies so right now things don't change can be very happy being and on this committee member\nOf the weather looks like he could not be better for that stretch we will keep a close eye on that weekend forecasts as on them ... does approach we have to take a a a a moment here a few minutes when I like to bring to you right now\nIs a a news conference that took place here in the city when socket\nOn this was a two o'clock this afternoon at the ... the police headquarters\nHe he actually did shooters way you know he did he said that to someone we didn't have any more information that served on those type cases you are you don't want to make an entry unless you really feel that you have to and\nAnd as time went on we try to to get people to come to the windows will come to the ah\nAnd we used to ... and we didn't and then it was we have to weigh do we go in\nAnd potentially had someone who's been injured\nYou know why us going in there was going to create a confrontation or them\nWith a seven year old house showed\nCommand staff myself Emilio ... making the decision to make the entry into tactical team did an extremely good professional job sweeping ... unfortunately the victim of died of or gunshot wound or the suspect vessel doctoral control\nGene 'cause he's been telling you go about approaching\nOn any time constraint that we have to speak to him right now so the next\nFew days left the clippings\nThen he's obviously a winning needs probably someone professionally to speak to him so it's a way that we can do that without a\nComment on this\nOr it's it's it's\nThis woman is the the\nTurkey a crime of domestic violence she's been she's been led it's all you got a seven year old now that's missing both his parents\nPsychological issues that though\nThe fab made had to curves just because it's certainly not making excuses for\nIt it's just tragic and the thing is is is if you look at what the record is is there I don't know how how you you can't predict I mean he had some issues back like I said you talking back in ... uh Thirteen and then maybe prior\nReally you know police involvement it's not like was situation responding to a house\nYou know on a monthly basis or ... or a number of times in a short period of time there was no indication of any type of problem like\nThat [noise] I wouldn't say to go back\nTemporary restraining order that was on crafts for children for\nYou know if you're watching is they have used to have relationship maybe not physical ... verbal you think to yourself I tend to measures necessary for longer needed not\nOpportunity I think to reach out to other people from being were relations what more\nI mean she looked like she ended her relationship with\nYeah I mean she looked like she ended her relationship with\nAnd she moved to she's not she's obviously not living with them so it wasn't a habit of the situation I Know you're referring\nOr victims of domestic violence who just can't break that cycle we need the help to to to actually make a clean break it looks like she had made that break and then just unfortunately going back and interacting with him just on this weekend a result and then what happens so hard to predict that I don't know I mean I Would think and again I don't know\nShe there's no indication right now that wherever\nKnow if this is a routine thing that it's every other weekend with a visitation is but it looks like we're ... and she just throws out and was going to go\nTake her son back out from the end with the visitation and\nIn the house at that particular time or we\nHow long they were married divorced her\n... little old for for\nShe filed for divorce in January two thousand Thirteen and the divorce became final in December of two thousand Thirteen\nOn as far as the actual initial wedding I Know that they were living together sometimes six [noise]\nFranklin Marion or where several hundred times or anything that\nReally are we going back now records we had an issue where they were we had been called to\nSpouse for\nLike a two thousand four\nAround now their charges there was a surgical we haven't forcing a lot of domestic goals we go to our system is just a horrible on your\n... everything you know there was one from the previous a mother of his children\nGoing to get a temporary restraining order which if it's not far beyond the temporary strain was expiring mushy following record\nOn the calls are even talking about lens called to the friends that were to call one called the wrong phone okay she's here\nAnd then call in and then there was a second call\nI shot and I'm going to shoot myself it was in or anything on the time between those who falls on a longer period that love you're talking about climate came to the police station now the or where they are you calling from Glen to the woman on the phone that\nAunt is here to claim that child or second call saying that I shot as my as you've\nGot to work out he was in conversation\nSpeaking with this woman she was in conversation with him\nThe past few days you know the night before and had the conversation with him and I guess speak some in less than a daily basis they were involved in conversation that morning and then she could tell he was upset about something in fact she even said hey you know\nJust you know ...\nAnd then he ended the conversation by saying\nMichelle ... she says here I got to go and hung up the phone she didn't ... clearance for\nAnd just very briefly there's not really any real conversation he makes a statement so I say I ... I just shot my rights I'm gonna kill myself\nAnd hangs up the un hangs up the phone\nOnce we answer and then she Claire best which started the whole trip chain chain of events that we were involved and he said something that duration between those two calls minutes now if\nWe didn't it will if you look at it from Fort she used to house it wasn't that long period of time after he on up that he pulled back there was some time whether it's ten minutes Fifteen minutes we have an ... we know\nI was feeling the only one who called ...\nA set up we're trying to establish it you know from people in the neighborhood is there anybody did you see anybody in the house did you hear anything of that and one of the neighbors that was how schools ... said they they felt that they heard shots but\nToo much I didn't think too much of it\nUntil I put me on the right thing to remember a time\nWhen we did get down there we did know from the cold\nWas having a conversation with him new certainly responding there we were to believe you know again\nUnder the assumption it with this woman is accurate and what she's saying they should be a mayor in that house there should be in the female in that house and they should be a minimum\nWith these these ... ... now it serves hindsight and it's twenty twenty\nYou really don't know ... they might have been multiple kids they might have been multiple children in the order could have been more adults because you you you just don't know when she only\nWhat he ... he\nShe's from the time as a massive violence\nGuy in the past is another violence or\nI I wouldn't I wouldn't say it's time and I couldn't give you statistics on that everybody can use the ... we ended up killing someone but you know it it's it's concerned it is concerning domestic violence even simply threatening people intimidating people doesn't have to be physical this woman that live in fear\nEvery day every day a\nOr ... thirty friends or or spouses or whatever and it's so it's a horrible thing for\nVictims we hear a socket we have an advocate that actually works in the buildings here today would they want so when we identify that we believe we've got someone who's\nSituation where it it's a dangerous for them we try and get them that had that they need to make that break from that cycle to get away from that of you to get away from that abuser but it's it's a difficult thing to do and it's just like anything else it's almost impossible to predict who's gonna take it tore who's going to take it for that do\nYou have any indication that she was active in this case you have any of the resources\nOr had no idea because like I said from our records you know this is there any evidence rest last contract we had with her was two thousand and Thirteen so again you might have come in after it smells like a situation that we had a house a\nHappens that you'll get a period of six months where people are still ... but they're not getting along\nUs when you involved in disturbances in that so this state's the state's us back to two thousand three teams\nAre when are you there here to to her for anywhere from two\nLoans that they were never the prior mother and his children were never married they lived together we're going to be at a temporary restraining order\nThat she had told him without that woman and then this woman had the temporary restraining order Michelle I'd be temporary restraining order that we were able to find for that sure window in two thousand Thirteen and but there are no other heroes or an underground complains that was not that we now that we've seen and we're definitely\nForget that type of thing and I'm half way and this girl comes up to me you want me to walk you if you want me to help you cough I carry [laughter]\nAll I can say is I don't care where you're crossing in this area ... job is to be very careful\nYou know I'm In a call ... not all walk or whatever and there's a police Scott common they didn't even stop\nWell that's unfortunate [laughter] you got to prop [laughter] well\nI think people need to review the rules you know pedestrians have the right of the time yeah they have the right of way if they should be standing in a crosswalk button and don't don't always think that that's going to happen it's going to happen ... you know got to be very careful as on a day for a nice\nOne site costs they liked me and I I watch for the other side with the other car was coming yeah and the speed it up in a good thing and I didn't shout I would've been an angel\nAnd you got to be very very careful\nAll my God you laugh\nAnd as a driver you have to be careful because you have people sometimes who just jump out into a crosswalk and start crossing would be for the issue of cars and stop a whole other issue and then you have people who don't cross where there were cross walks they cross wherever they feel like it yeah that's another problem\nAnd cave walking around and so much of it as much of it you know I go to confession\nYou don't tell me right Jay Jay walking once in a pool border wall right well as a grouch cost to make sure they're not coming when sometimes some people don't even do that so yeah you know they give you a ticket and that's right they do and I can\nRemember going by family to Radio City mhm\nComing out of the show was gorgeous that's probably the

and again the invitation is there if you would like to talk\nEmail comes in from Ronnie says for those of you who did not listen to coffee and this morning\nThe that's the talk show on oh when in ah every morning the city council meeting will not be telecast live broadcast live on radio this evening due to the inappropriate language that was used at the last meeting\nThat language is against the FCC regulations and the station could be fined if they perceive the threat of its repetition and ear the meeting anyway so you can hear it live on all when on the Internet but not on the radio\nA radio will replay it later at a later date after it's been screened for\nInappropriate content\nInteresting ... spread the word so people can listen on alternate side so go to the meeting itself [noise] well that's interesting um when it comes to\nWhat you can say and what you can't say on the radio I'm and I'm trying to think of what was said and matter of fact I'm Ron makes mention of comes from Richard fragments and um\nI didn't realize that you couldn't say that on the air [laughter] they'd be honest with that thought anything anything goes today good grief when you hear the music or that a radio stations um\nBroadcasting um I don't know ... something puzzles me here something puzzles me maybe somebody can straighten me out on that seven six six Thirteen eight that's our number as we talk with you\nKnow somebody else ends in an email about the council meeting it says it's disgusting that the two radio stations in the city don't cover the city council meeting alive as it occurs\nAnd it says um\nThe other stations should be ashamed of itself for using the excuse he's worried about fat and its language and the ... should be ashamed because now we have to rely on Jeff's uploading the meeting to the website days after some times when he feels like it\n[noise] PC\nDo it and [laughter] uh well said well set on that\nJak raise not as bad you know what I mean this is level the bad and and shoving level Sheldon Whitehouse as he appeared to me of bad you know I can disagree with with Jack Reed but he he's not he's not a total jackass like Sheldon Whitehouse is you know\nNot yet anyway [laughter] ah I'll tell you well\nI don't I don't think he would uh you know obviously I don't know him and it's just all my opinion of speculation but uh\nI think he I think he just has a little more respect to not stoop to the levels that these crazy progressive not job stoop to mhm mhm yeah I could be wrong but\nTime will tell [laughter] but so far I I have to agree with you he hasn't done anything that stupid\nBut so far I I have to agree with you he hasn't done anything that stupid\nHey now well to be a little while ago before I called you made mention about a foul language and music\nYes and the radio and stuff yeah I\nI don't know what stations y'all listening too but\nAll the music that I listen to on the uh the big name radio stations\nThey're probably some of the biggest sensors out there really cause as soon as you said that right away to songs came to mind\nThat a Ninety four H J why they they they have a radio version that they play which is different from the from the version on the original albums because they they use the word ... yeah ... yeah I Know yes and a couple a couple occasions in that one one of the Steve Little song and then there's another song\nBy a band called ever last where they you know they they get rid of the coup for word again but then they also completely bleep out\nCruel forty five when he's referring to a gun mhm and they and then they completely bleep out the word drugs\nWhen he's referencing something in the song about somebody what they're doing you know the word drugs so they bleep out not only what's deemed to be you know like a profane we're at a swear word right but they they bleep out of the words that they think a politically incorrect\nWell that's interesting and you know maybe I stand corrected the music guy here with the extreme vulgar lyrics you know the F. word being thrown around like a confetti\nIt's probably somebody who's listening on a you know something other than a radio and I used this I'm exposed to this from vehicles you know you hear it from fifty miles away it's cranked up so everybody can hear it so chances are it's not radio\nNo I'm most likely it's not I actually find it offensive when a stations like the one I mentioned take it upon themselves\nTo censor out words that they've deemed yeah to be inappropriate you know I thought the whole thing about music is supposed to be musical expression and and as long as it's not profane you know and I mean and and and subject to FCC guidelines ... they were they to to censor that out you know\nMhm mhm [noise] now I Know the board the words that were used at the council made and just getting back to what started all this the you know be yes I'm now that I'm surprised that that is something that can't be said on the radio\nWell like I said that poo poo word beginning with S. and ending in tea is always\nYou know we're in that on the radio yeah yeah\nYeah I guess it all depends on who's in charge and what they're thinking maybe it's a call on their pot what they want eared on the station and what they don't want to hear it on their station I don't know I\nDon't I don't know either I missed that so I don't know anything about the costs of meeting what's in question with regards to what was\nSending out there would be yes you know um but not\nBe as the term exactly like you said it just like that oh no no no no the ... the full version of okay feeling letters like oxygen to pooh pooh ... yes exactly [laughter] so if you said that I think it'd be in the clear right a gang like\nA Thirteen eighty safe now if I said that ...\nI think they're all that [laughter] okay All right but what if you said it in another matter um maybe I'd have some explaining to do yeah OK then you're subject to the FCC [laughter] okay I guess I I'm not really sure how to be honest with you [laughter]\nOkay maybe I could clarify this maybe someone could clarify or somebody says something that they're not supposed to say that's right All right my cow dung yes exactly [laughter] okay [laughter] ... have a good one by\nI I don't know what to make of it maybe you have a comment seven six six

I don't understand all of that as well so\nIt's something that um I I I don't know what the attraction is to be honest with you I I just don't I I I don't understand people smoking whether it be the traditional cigarettes or whatever or these uh you know these electronic devices [laughter]\nI don't know why anybody needs to do that\nI think it goes back to Sigmund Freud's a you know a little theories that some people are I guess from birth they need to suck on something else that they just progressed to whatever it is\nMan you might be onto something there yes that is definitely\nMind very you know even in school people chew on pens and pencils and who the heck knows but I I think it's an oral fixation that they need to ah [noise] my now rice put something in their mouth\nHanding out more bubble gum or something and I\nVote for lollipop while the pomp see you go [laughter] you know those dumb down and have long lines\nCan be a different kind of dumb down and back in your mouth instead of smoking on an e cigarette not a bad idea none of them than I Do and it probably be cheaper to those dumb down some pretty shape it can get a whole giant bag no reasonable amount you know they probably have him on sale at Halloween to\nLoad up on on cable it's safer for a lot of bad idea\nAnd you know I I had turned on I was talking to someone when the uh the program started but\nI heard one of the call is talking about calling Sheldon Whitehouse yes\nAnd I have to say that I I was talking to someone and then they said are you watching that whole thing that hearing\nSo I started watching the herring and I got so aggravated by all of that going on and they were going to go in for the vote well I call I looked up on line I coughed Sheldon Whitehouse his office here in Rhode Island\nNot a soul answered the phone and this was in the afternoons I don't know what they were up to ... million and ran off I guess since he was out in DC\nSo being a persistent little a woman I looked up his D.C number and I called that DC I'm [laughter] and no one answered that but I left him a pleasant message\nAnd told him he'd better not vote to uh you know a delay the uh the confirmation of judge Kavanaugh I don't think he can what I said but I just had to leave him a man\nWhich they did the right thing and yet to be commended as that caller is to be commended for taking the time and you know making sure they get your message\nI I was just so annoyed I'd never done that before and you know that was a way that I could reach out and maybe let him know that you know representing me whatsoever in Rhode Island so maybe you know\nYou get and they want us to do that with you I like a blessing [laughter]\nSo I just thought I'd call in and give those two messages Oh
