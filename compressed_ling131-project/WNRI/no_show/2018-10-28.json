might have\nAnd understanding that the city schools face\n\nThe city schools face all kinds of problems the major problem\nWhich creates all the other problems is poverty when socket\nHas the highest

high school in Nineteen Seventy nine and went on during my bachelor's degree in management from Rhode Island college in Nineteen eighty three\nMy wife Charlene and I purchased our first home unwilling road and we raised our too talented son Spencer and Peter there we still reside in that home we persist over twenty five years ago\nI joined my family business the sushi insurance agency thirty five years ago and I have on the agency for the better part of the past twenty five years I recently completed a ownership transfer to the Thompson insurance group who now running against using the same name and location and I'm very proud that they they kept all the employees as well most of the employees anyway\nAll I Am a resident of the city I like to think of myself as more than just that because one socket is more than just a a city it's a community a community I'm proud to call home\nOver the years I've supported and I've been involved in many wonderful city based organizations\nPosed as both as a sponsor and by having shirt on the boards of such groups as the stadium theater foundation early on the museum the museum of working cultures preservation foundation\nThe YMCA the northern Allen chamber of commerce community care alliance in one side of the Rotary Club which I've been a member for Thirty years I've also shared on one second planning board in the past and it was terrible and socket Harris library board of trustees\nServing as part of these organizations and others has allowed me to truly see how much one sock it has to offer\nAnd has given me a chance to work alongside people in our community who devote themselves to ensuring that our city is a great place to live work and raise a family because there's someone who has done all those things here I can tell you that it's just that\nOne sock it isn't so much a place that needs to be saying it's a place that needs to be champions on main street we have a world class theater

reality if you choose to give me a vote on November six I promise I Will work the champion our city and that'll work just with everyone you choose to serve our community and to do just that ...\nI Believe one side as best they are still ahead but there's only one way forward together because together each day we can make 'em sock it the kind of community can all be proud to call home thank you very much [noise]\n\nThank you David Suzie telling his case will be speaking next there will draw the name who will follow telling this case\nAnd that is going to be Roger Gillette you'll be on ... and you go into in the case\nFor\nFolks my name is Thomas Keith I'm running for city council um the first thing I Need to tell you is last month I got married to my [noise] my campaign manager over here\n[noise] okay [noise] so far\nSo good [noise] um\nSo I only have five minutes so I Want to just get into a couple of issues actually uh the first issue I Want to talk about is marketing um I think what socket does a really poor job marketing it though I think\nWe have so much to offer but we don't\nPut enough emphasis on\nWhat we have in in in how to market it so for instance is\nCBS okay let's seventh largest company in the United states and they call when socket their home this is their headquarters you go to any CBS across the country you pick out a package from them and you turn it over and you see when soccer Rhode Island\nAny other city in town across the country would kill to have that in their backyard and we have a right down the road and it's almost like we take that for granted\nWe as a company like CBS comes another dozen companies that either works alongside them\nOr services CBS and those companies wouldn't be here unless a corporation like CBS was here in the same thing holds true for a hospital landmark medical center\nThere's another dozen businesses that they work alongside landmark medical and again they wouldn't be here if the hospital was within our borders so we need to take that kind of stuff and just really promoted and we need to market it\nAnd we used to send it out there to the world so we can get another dozen companies that fit that profile\nI'm In an off of that my next topic I Want to talk about the commercial tax\nUm and then off of that\nMy next topic I Want to talk about the commercial tax rate\nOkay this is a is a really hot topic and\nDeservedly so\nUm our commercial tax rate is very high\nAnd nobody here will deny that and everybody here agree that we need to bring that rate\nDown okay and that's that's a no brainer [noise] the frustration is when we come to budget time [noise]\nIt's almost like the commercials ... becomes an afterthought\nCave we go through the budget hey blah blah blah get to the end there's a commercial tax rate or we\nMight take it down a dollar we might take it down to two dollars two fifty [noise] okay when you have a company sitting in the wings like a market basket like a like a Dave's marketplace and they're checking out when socket and they see that we took our commercial rate down three dollars or they're not knocking down our door for that ... something\nAs critical as the cost of ... we are setting goals for that kind of stuff okay here's here's one gal okay take the commercial tax rate was cut in half\nOkay let's take it from thirty six dollars don't Eighteen dollars okay now you have market basket that saying wow but you know I like what they're doing over here let's let's have a conversation\nWe have to set that go\nOkay and and something like that it's not going to happen in one year this is the kind of goal that we have to say okay let's let's take the commercial tax rate cut in half over five years\nOkay that that's something a little more than ...\nSo one of the ways we can do that is through responsible budgeting okay I've proposes before I said that the city council why don't we take the directors take the department heads sit them down and say hey how can we help make your department more efficient\nHow can we take a dollar\nHow we spread a little further\nAnd these are the directors that are doing this every day because they know their department better than anybody else so why don't we always pick their brain and get the best of the best then use that\nUm another another way I Want to approach that is citywide programs okay you'll read the newspaper that uh we're looking into renewable energy programs\nUh that's when the city we're going to look to to build solar and wind in order to offset our electricity cos if something like that is worth potentially Fifteen million dollars\nThe past two years it hasn't been on a mode multiplies and I've heard my fair share of criticism I thank you all for that as well because it's helped me to grow I have interface with thousands of people over the years some stronger than me some richer some smarter and some not\nLearned in a crowded room\nYou cannot really tell who was who so it it's always best to say last and do more I thank you for your time and make I continue to ... the less are beautiful great country a beautiful city and this humble servant with your vote on November six\nAsking you to please cast your vote for me the year on November sick and do Ritz [noise]\n\n\nOr they plan tonight [laughter]\n\nWe have Julie Brown speaking next following Julia will be will be John brio\n[noise] good thank you [noise]\nGood evening everyone and thank you for allowing me to address you regarding my candidacy for city council and especial thank you to ... for hosting us and to W. on our eyes for sponsoring recording [noise] my name is Julia brown I was born and raised in when socket I attended when socket high school\nGraduated from St Andrews school and then went on to Providence College where I graduated with a degree in psychology and philosophy\nAs a member of the community I have witnessed the diversity that we have faced at once I acknowledge the communities grow\nIf elected I promise to work collaboratively with my fellow council members and the mayor to find fresh and innovative ways to help support new and existing businesses and when socket\nI Will be an advocate for the use of our city and sharing a quality education and supporting new and existing programs ensuring a successful career into adulthood\nBecause are you is the future of one pocket\nAnd finally I Will work vigorously to further our existing food art and entertainment industry finding ways to ensure its continued growth and prosperity\nWhen socket is a melting pot of culture and talent with the potential to significantly increase our cities revenue\nLet's make our city not only a place to visit but a great place to live\nLet's make our city not only a place to put a great place to laugh I bring this whole new perspective energy and into the council and respectfully ask fear about November ... thank you very much [noise]\n\nThanking Julie Brown and John brand making his way to the podium we'll be speaking next and following John brand will be John John Morton with an H ...\n[laughter] [noise] do you think you're just a thank you to\nMatt and Jill ... W on our eyes for this a very informative and really good program and we have I think\nFirst of all I'm John brand nice to see all I Am the current\nVice president of the when soccer's city council\nAnd when I look out you see so many faces\nThat you know because usually at these events we've got our candidates here of course and then usually all the same faces that come out to these events and these are the events that you wish you could have at the high school or at the stadium and it would be filled with people and it would be you know all kinds of people that are coming out to find out\nWhat their leaders have to say but you are the ones that are engaged you are the ones that we can count on you were the ones that are here so you ought to be applauded for that and of itself so thank you for being here I'm\nIn two thousand and sixteen I was elected to the when soccer's city council and I was kinda surprised I got elected because I just wanted to serve my city again and I was really hopeful that I Would and I did and I was\nSo grateful when I when I was elected in and for the past two years I've been able to serve the city um and not only as a city councilman but also in the community I'm a member of the Rotary Club and other clubs nice Columbus\nClub Lafayette circle L'Oreal clubs or do good work in the city\nAnd what the past two years has given me is the ability to connect with some of the most positive people some of the most incredible people in this community that come out and just give\nThemselves each and every day it really is a fantastic thing so I've been exposed to some of the best people and these have been some of the best two years of my life a lot of candidates have spoken about\nCollaboration and what you hear a lot about his collaboration I'm going to collaborate with everybody I think we need more collaboration I guess the question is who doesn't want to collaborate\nUm I think we all do I think our differences of what makes us special you know we all come from different walks of life on the city council right now and we all bring different perspectives and we all have different opinions and sometimes we agree and sometimes we disagree\nThat's not a lack of collaboration what that is is a lot of ideas all coming together and trying to find the best one and I think that's what we do and that's what I've ... to do in the past\nTwo years on the city council you know [noise]\nThe past few years we were able to do some really good things I agree with a\nTom chief in in the fact that we have a high commercial tax rate this council over the last two years is passed very responsible budgets are that have been very good for the ... but also very good for the commercial rate and we've tried to trend that number down we were successful ones not so successful twice\nI think budgeting is so important to the city councilor and you have to be able to pass a responsible budget\nOf the things I wanted to do was hold our elected leaders accountable and it doesn't matter who the mayor is whether it's you know our impulse fear or Kevin Coleman or ... or ...\nIf you're the executive you have to be accountable for your actions and the city council because they've come up with a accountable for its actions I Believe that we need to hold all of our elected leaders accountable for our actions are and actions\nI think that's so important you know you've got ... many candidates here tonight\nAnd that's because this council thought it was important to go back to an elected school committee and as an attorney one of my skill sets is is writing legal documents and I was able to reduce the legislation and move\nThe wall forward on getting us back to an elected school committee so now you've got candidates here tonight thankfully the referendum passed overwhelmingly and that's where we are going\nI think ah another very important initiative we're working on his renewable energy in where we're moving in a direction where\nWe are going to be able to generate and save the city over the long term millions of dollars and that's a big accomplishment for this counseling and something that I spearheaded on the ah renewable energy subcommittee so\nThese are all things that I think are really important as we move forward and I pledge to work with whoever gets elected should I get reelected because I think it's really important to be able to say\nAfter the election when this is all done thankfully I Know your outfit and I know we all are when this is all done that we can just work together\nTo find common ground and there's going to be arguments there's going to be disagreements\nAnd that's okay that doesn't mean that we're not collaborating if everyone in the room\nIs a green than nobody's thinking and that's the point we have to be able to know built a deal positively with our our differences and move forward so I guess what I'm saying is I Hope you'll find that over the last two years my service you\nWas a beneficial that you'll grant me two more years to serve in the city council if you do\nI Will be both humbled and grateful to return and serve you as best as I possibly can and trying to make you proud so thank you very much and thanks for being here [noise]\n\nVery few times I got to bring them down in height to me\nIt's one of the moments John ... is going to follow after John Ward we have\nDan gender [noise]\nBoy am so or you know\nLet's start however so I don't like disco crazy\nCrazy first thank you to W. on our life are offering this kinds who rushed to present ourselves to the community and the voters and to ... or a restaurant so that we can have a place to do with us comfortable and a very nice by white\nOr for those of many of you know who I Am but for those who do my name is John Ward I'm running for city council\nUm I did grow up in the city though I wasn't born here actually lived in North Smithfield for the first seven years of my life but that's my parents' fault [noise] um\nI did essentially grow up in one socket I attendance St Joseph's school mount St Charles academy and I'm a graduate of Bryant college than a with a degree in accounting and so many people know me as the numbers guy and I tend to get up and speaking of ... numbers out\nAnd people start falling asleep so I'm not going to do that tonight we're not going to talk about numbers but I Would like to talk about a budget and the different way and I'll do it quickly because it's about philosophy of government and its budget and what it means\nYou or I have a record you know who I Am and you can watch the meetings you can read the papers you can\nDo the dogs the whole nine yards [noise] um my philosophy is very simple\nBeing on the city council being the mayor being involved in the city official it's a serious job cause serious business um were running a\nMinimum one hundred and forty plus million dollar business not counting the enterprise funds so serious and what we do is elected officials has an impact on people\nSo again we have to take it seriously um and what you'll get from a gym can oil very simply is I Will take the job seriously a roll my sleeves up or do the hard work that's necessary I'm going to read the documentation I'm going to ask questions I Want to push a challenge and this is one thing I Know for sure\nThat's true in life everywhere in business and family instead he government et cetera\nNo one person has all the answer's no one person is going to lead us to the promised land no one person can give you a silver bullet it takes a group and I've heard it constantly\nMurray and referred to it everybody talks about collaboration and working together um and again in theory who doesn't [noise] um but it's required but that doesn't mean\nThat doesn't mean you always have to agree and there's nothing wrong with having disagreements okay because not everybody's always right and not everybody's always wrong um oh you can agree to disagree respectfully hopefully some times strongly\nSometimes not so strong but it's okay to have disagreements but it's always necessary to do the hard work that's required to make the right decisions or at least at the best decisions you possibly can because it affects people's lives\nWe heard from some of the schools I heard the school committee earlier they suggested that one of the biggest issues the school department has its poverty\nI tend to agree with that and what that means is we don't have to make the burdens any worse than they already are people in the city not everybody but there's enough people in the city that struggle financially we are in distress community where not all rich so\nAgain from my perspective we have to take it seriously and make sure the decisions we make do not make life any harder for people\nSo again um I won't I won't spend more time you know who I Am host the view I have a record you know what you're going to get I'll do the job I work hard we may not always agree but I promise you I'll do my homework I work with people as much as people who work with me and I will insist\nNot only for myself before my colleagues that we make informed\nFact based decisions not based on emotion but based on facts and data and as you get from a gym can or thank you very much Leslie I'd like to thank the host um the ... as well as W when I arrived for having this event and I think you all\nOf a coming our going to be very honest it's a much better turnout than I expected this very refreshing thank you [noise]\n\nThank you James can all air our final city council candidate making his presentation Richard fattening\nLadies and gentlemen [noise]\n\nBoth of you know me my name is Richard factor I've lived in one socket for sixty seven years and married for forty two years and I've been with the same woman for forty five years I have two adult children that went to a ball and socket school systems I went there so did my wife and now my grandchildren are going there\n\nI always prepare myself but I don't usually follow in sixteen I came out with this card and basically\nIt was what I pledge\nTo be fiscally conservative unproven fight against wasteful city spending become a fierce defender of the city's taxpayer dollars were full time as your councilman never knowingly Mick voted decision that would harm the taxpayers all the citizens of the socket I've completed all those\nPleasures I started\nIn two thousand ten or eleven I asked the\nAdministration of a mayor from paying to serve\nIn some capacity so I could give back to my city\nAnd he had an opening on these on the border review and I rarely talk I learned a lot it wasn't a stepping stone because I never thought in my lifetime that I Would run for politics 'cause I just felt that not was wasn't what I was or who I Am\nBut when the budget commission came in and two thousand twelve if everybody remembers we got whacked big time\nForty forty three percent\n\nForty forty three percent\nSingle family homeowners to family everybody else supplemental tax on the vehicles five quarters and we still have supplemental tax right now are two point five million dollars that's built into the base yearly\n\nI remember at the time zone and fighting at every budget commission meeting for them not to take away a homestead exemption\nThat would've been a forty two percent loss for the people who could not afford that why did they come up with the homestead exemption back in the day because the people in the city couldn't afford to pay the taxes\nAnd right now\nBetween the Seventeen percent from forty two to twenty five and the and the the supplemental tax that equals six percent\nWe're still behind by twenty three percent\nSo that's what I through my head in the ... and I said I'm going to run for city council I'm going to be independent I'm going to make a difference\nOn Iran wants didn't make it then I ran against a Mr Steve Casey because that seat was the people see\nAnd I wanted to get it back and they only beat me by a hundred and thirty forty votes but you know what I wasn't deterred I said okay I'm going to wait for years and I'm going to run again or I should say to six feet\nAnd I worked really hard because I wanted to represent the people like me\nMiss the average citizen\nThat we will be abused could beat up by taxes and I\nGot a seat on the council and I'd pledged that I Would work hard to do everything it was a tough situation for me because I'm not used to\nPlaying nice with people sometimes I'll admit it\nBut I got to work I rolled\nUp my sleeves I made some mistakes but I'm proud of my track record and I have papers over there anybody wants to grab one show you what I've done the last twenty two months\nFive ordinances\nBenefits the citizens\nI'm independent I came into this how soon to sixty by myself and I'm In this race to get reelected by myself\nI don't think the council should have a team or any team\nThe only team that I Want to be on as a citizen state\nThey voted for me two years ago and I'm working for that ... that the that voted for me out I was told when I get under zoning board that you're going to make enemies when you make decisions on zoning and if you can't accept that fact that you don't belong in disarming well I've\nHad so I don't have a lot of enemies folks but some people aren't happy with me and that's okay I understand that but if you look at the budgets that I've been part of\nThe mayor's budget in two thousand Seventeen 'cause I didn't think it took her to know to go down as far as the taxes this past year\nLooked at it and it was a tough decision but I looked\nAt the five to six thousand single family homeowners how many two three four five families that were I think there's a couple of thousand maybe it has commercial businesses and stuff about sixteen hundred and eight so way both and I looked at what\nWe've been hit with and with the amended budget and I looked at that also and I said well you know what we need that extra three percent\nSo I voted for that\nAdministration budget to give the taxpayers more relief which brought us down from twenty three percent to twenty an addition to what the high a valuations were\nOkay [noise] boy I tell you so fast five minutes [noise]\nI'm Still the voice of the people\nI still work every day I've I've sacrificed what my family and everything to help the people and I'm asking you to give me another chance to get reelected as you're constantly so I can continue because I had a goal of six years he won't be sorry\nYou really won't be and I want to assure everybody and this is my last thing I'm On the negotiating team for this budget for the teachers but I'm going to tell you\nOn recently been told homeless out to be as a matter of fact ... city forward\nI'm In fact I laid off about agenda uh it'd be jam with the September ... valley breeze article titled\nWhy I'm running for mayor\nWhich explains why are you running and what I intend to do\nOne elected\nBeen lost over the course in for that has been lost all of the cost of this campaign\nApologize\nOh the cost of this campaign\nSo allow me to repeat what my agenda is and why I Am a candidate one to ensure that we have open honest and transparent government\nNo secret deals\nOr unilateral decisions made without the appropriate input and collaboration of our other elected and appointed officials always remembering\nThat we are conducting the public's business not our own\nTo actually\nThree tax relief for actually our tax
