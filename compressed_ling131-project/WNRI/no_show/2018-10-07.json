expressed on the following program of those was hosting participants and do it it's like those are the ownership staff or advertisers have W in Iraq\nGood morning this is Brendan Murray and you are listening to health and wealth radio heard every Thursday morning here on WN are I I Am president of a company called health and wealth ink and\nWe believe we are the only company that truly brings health care and wealth care to gather for the consumer and you know it may sound obvious well we have things like um you know early to bed and makes man healthy wealthy unwise right I\nI remember when we started our company name we we had been in the business I'm already for over a decade but\nWe incorporated as health and welfare officially two thousand fourteen and I remember I was telling my cousin and he said well that pretty much sums it up health and wealth has a nice ring to it doesn't it\nBut the idea of bringing together health care and wealth care in a way that makes sense for you the consumer is something that really hadn't been done yet in our industry and so we are blazing a new trail and uh it just makes good sense to us that um\nIf you're concerned about your health care that one of the things are really concerned about is your wellbeing and part of that is your financial well being so um\nYou know any time you make a decision to\nLower deductibles to lower co pays to minimize out of pocket expenses\nTo a save money on prescription drugs um to cover surgeries if you go in the hospital to worry about um what happens if you need help\nWith assistance with daily living activities of daily living what you're really saying is\nNumber one is I Want to be cared for well but number two who's going to pay for it that's really the question and that's a question of wealth now if you have your own money or your own assets the concern is well how much of this do I have to spend out of my nest egg in order to fuel my health care\nAnd so really pretty much if you're if you're really doing a thorough job if you follow things to their\nTheir natural conclusion as soon as you start talking about health\nWhat you're really what'd you really looking at is really a health wealth continuum we'll call it that so\nIt's like a like I was explaining to my son he's Thirteen he's asking a lot of questions about space and time black holes you know he's really fascinated with with the the science of space and you know\nOne of the things I explained to him Israeli at I Believe it's space time I don't think it's one without the other I think it's based in time together and you know as soon as you have distance between objects there's a distance in space and in time how much\nTime does it take for life to travel and so from one point to another so\nYou know in science we have these things continue in space time together and I believe that and I are planning it's really health and wealth planning were the first to do it\nAs evidenced by our name but even more as evidenced by the vision of how we see the business so if you were\nConcerned about your health and well if you have questions about your health and well if you just want to make sure that your partnered with a company that understands these things and thinks about them and this way then we would really welcome an opportunity to work with you\nKnow we're very fortunate\nTo be working with uh\nSome excellent people families throughout New England and uh\nNot only are in Rhode Island Massachusetts Connecticut and New Hampshire on but we have clients in Florida and we have clients in California we have clients in Illinois and Indiana and Texas and what happens is as people are spread out or\nThey have friends and family or someone sells their home and when socket and moved to Arizona um we don't just say bye nice serving you we say well we can continue to help 'em\nAnd now with technology you know we are able to keep in touch with people I'm\nNot only with the telephone but even computer wise um you know you can actually do a presentation for someone on your computer and it's not quite as good as being in there you know in their home or at the kitchen table or at a desk but I'm the technology is there where we can actually um\nYou know run a presentation from her computer and you can be watching that from the comfort of wherever you are as long as you have a computer access and Internet access so\nWe are old fashioned if you want to say that word in the sense that we still value in home appointments or you remember those those old TV shows where the doctor would be called in someone was sick and the doctor would be called and the doctor would show up where would they come to the home\nAnd have the briefcase the stethoscope right and they walk in at any hour of the night you know to come check the fever and\nHe'll maybe prescribe a solution clean air rights and freshwater ah and\nBut that was that special touch I think that was the point of uh of seeing that in the movies was this was extra attention this was special attention this was ... years treatment you know where the professional in this case the doctor\nI'm cared enough about that family and the relationship there was personal enough that they\nCould come into the home and so we've kept that um\nThat spirit of personal attention alive in our business you know there's many people in the financial world to\nLet's face it there are a bit stuffy you know um they pay a lot of money to have the fancy office and that's nice to have the fancy rug the fancy desk pieces the fancy um you know paintings on the wall fancy receptionists the fancy plants and there's nothing wrong with fancy that's wonderful but\nYou know you are expected to go drive into town to sit with them and so you pay trying to find parking it's expensive maybe if it's in in the ... in the city and you know you get there you're lugging all your personal uh papers year wills you trust your retirement accounts your\nYour ah copies of your insurance maybe if they if they even know how to look at that tax returns and you're going to someone's office and you know maybe some of that personal attention some of that\nIndividual I'm feeling of special attention gets watered down or even lost completely um over the years\nWith technology although it's become easier to be in touch what happens is some of the companies have lost the sense of the individual and I remember maybe a little over a decade ago one of the ...\nDid you all and I remember maybe a little over a decade ago one of the big\nInvestment firms don't need to name names are but they sent out letters to their consumers instead of you know to their consumers who had five thousand dollars or less than in in the account and they said go on line you know\nUm if you want to make any change if you want you know because you have so little in your account we can't give you the individual personal attention of the advisor so go on line you know this is the kind of\nResult that you get so technology can streamline\nProcesses can make communication that much easier but it can also eliminate the human touch so health and wealth um we our business of people so I'm Brendan Marie I'm the president of helping wealth my business partner a and co owner cofounder of health and well Jim Scott\nIs an investment advisor representative we're both licensed also in life health accident property and casualty insurance knowledgeable about every form of life insurance not just one uh\nWe're in ... we are informed about all forms of health care insurance from group health insurance to individual health insurance products to a Medicare supplement insurance plans prescription drug plans to accident plans\nTo disability to foreign travel insurance so let's say you're going on a trip to another country or you know someone who's coming from another country maybe a relative or maybe they're not us citizens or we have\nSpecific plans that can cover for that just for that trip you know someone's coming for a couple of weeks we got a plan that can cover them for that those two weeks you're going to another country for\nA month or a week um you know maybe they don't recognize your local insurance plan when you're in Europe or you're in Africa or you're in a one of the islands but we have plans that are international that\nAre coordinate in any of those countries are throughout the world so and they're not expensive um\nTypically your pet you typically those plans for for a short term trip might be you know under a hundred dollars for the entire trip and yet you may have coverage for things like not only emergencies but\nYou know we do have a pretty good website that\nShows a lot of what we can do for people I mean if you go there you're going to see every kind of insurance that you can imagine car insurance we do it homeowner's insurance we do it liability insurance we do it um Brelo policies we do it\nEvery form of health insurance that you can imagine we do it long term care we do it\nRight and then ... we do it retirement planning we do it so ah\nIs pretty comprehensive but you can also just see a little bit about who we are and you can also just email us through the website to schedule an appointment or to ask a question uh\nAnd we can follow up with you from there so we are at health wealth financial dot com that is our domain health wealth financial dot com and we are health and well think I Am Brendan Marie\nSo today we're talking as we always do about health care and welfare I watch wealth care caring about your wealth so one of the things we do in our businesses we\nGemini who's my business partner we let you know we come from a musical background so we were we played music together for years even before we got into this this business and so we're kind of lyrical and the way we think we're we we like to\nWe like to rearrange and re think you know certain uh sayings you know maybe common sayings out there the good ones don't need to be changed but there's some that you know need to be rethought and because\nThey get used or misused overused to the point where they seem to lose their their original meeting and I and I'll give you an example of what I mean but one of one of the examples would be um you know health care and we we came up with wealth care what his wealth carrots caring about your wealth\nAnd and it's not just health insurance it's health care so\nYou know you could have an health insurance policy\nDoes the insurance company you have care about your health you get that feeling you get that sense and it's not just an emotional thing you can never really prove does this person or does the c._e._o. or does this company care about me but it's evidenced by the policy itself what what kind of extra um\nLevels of care do you see that are offered uniquely through that insurance plan\nIn other words your doctor's your nurse practitioners your pharmacist your ah the person administering that flu shot right they're all part of our health care experience aren't they so we love our doctors are we love our or we like our\nWe love our doctors are we love our or we like our\nPharmacist or we don't\nOur day to day experience with our health care but it's the health insurance company that we're going through that really help provide the access for us to maybe a\nBenefits or or services that go above and beyond simply\nPicking up your prescriptions at the pharmacy so things like home delivery you know some people love to go to the pharmacy every day it's a kind of a ritual it's an experience you know you get to know the person that behind the pharmacy and it and there's a lot of reasons why people like that\nBut there's other people\nEither because of circumstance or desire that they cannot you know get to the pharmacy it's more of a burden than it is a um\nA pleasure so home delivery service the ability to get your prescriptions delivered to your home Ninety Days supplies and maybe even in a cost effective manner maybe in a way that you can save money by doing so as a double when the conveniences there and the cost savings as their things like\nAccess to a nurse that you can talk to twenty four hours a day that some of the plans might have\nYou know membership at the gym\nMagazine that comes a health magazine that um you know goes out for being a member of the talks about healthy living\nA and and and that kinda stuff so there's lots of things that your plan may offer that go above and beyond just the fact that it's insurance and and it's really about health care\nCaring about you caring about your health and and that\nThat administration uh\nOf those services behind the scenes\nYou know you're looking for companies that invest in that companies that have a vision about health care have a vision about how to serve their consumers better and on the wealth side it's the same thing you know I Can't tell you how many times\nI sit with well pretty much almost universally when I sit with someone and I'm fortunate enough that they want to talk about the wealth side of health and wells so\nSometimes consumers come over to the wealth side from the outside so we help them with a Medicare insurance plan or we help them with their group health insurance through their company and then they said do you do this you know\nOne of the triggers right now is simply age\nIn two thousand and eleven that was pretty much the first time that roughly ten thousand people a day started turning sixty five in America so there was a baby boom we talked about this every show but I'm going to say it again\nOr from Nineteen forty six to Nineteen sixty four that was the baby boom\nAnd those babies were born from Nineteen forty six to Nineteen sixty four or they didn't stay babies they grew up in as they grow up they started affecting pretty much every industry that you can think of a they affected politics right major um major decisions major\nPolicies are programs like Medicare right um\nThese and and even Social Security now it's a lot of it is affected by built for unaffected by um the baby boom so uh you know one\nPeople are are taking out and collecting Social Security than are putting in that's what puts a strain right on maybe I'm One of those programs and they have to think creatively about how to how to deal with that moving forward\nWhen I was a kid in the seventies uh there were like ten different elementary schools in our town\nAnd and pretty much in many many towns throughout the country there were there were a plethora of uh of primary and secondary schools there might have been two or three a\nWhat happened is that was the baby boom and so the baby boomers coming up through the ranks they they were you know in the seventies they were school age and they were buying cars so the automotive industry was booming\nAnd as the baby boom moved on some of those schools got turned into condominiums eventually you know they just there wasn't the population anymore to sustain that many kids now the population was still existed they just weren't in high school anymore and so housing\nBoom in the eighties\nAnd what's happening now is at a record clip baby boomers are getting on Medicare\nAre taking Social Security for the first time\nAre retiring off of their work their jobs and are and so one of the things that happened in two thousand eleven is that's when the baby boom started turning sixty five at a record clip ten thousand people roughly per day and now\nSeven years later right they're not sixty five you know five six seven years later what they are is they're Seventy and a half and so what happens at Seventy and a half as you start realizing you have to take money out of your IRAs individual retirement accounts so that's ah\nCalled our MDs required minimum distributions so sometimes now we're seeing an uptick and phone calls believe it or not from clients to\nSee I don't know about my arm ... when do I have to take that out and how much do I have to take out and I have three different IRAs do I have to take it out of all of them are can I take it out of one of them what happens if I don't take it out\nPeople know about fifty percent tax fifty percent fifty percent of what what's the tax when do I get you know when do I get penalize when do I need to take this money out so\nIf you are approaching Seventy so you may have gotten you may have gotten on Medicare six years ago and now I'm\n... and so once you're once you're dealing with Social Security and once you deal with Medicare you know that's an ongoing thing you may review your plans any given year but now you're actually approaching Seventy and you're saying what do I have to do about my retirement\nI Know I have to start taking money but where do I take it from and will I run out of money and these are all the questions that that eventually might ask so we're getting calls in the west side we're getting calls on the outside but what we offer is a combination of the two for any of our clients health and wealth and we'll show you how the to connect\nBecause where they connect is the end symbol\nAnd so it's not about one or the other and I could make a case with you about all the reasons why health is the is the most important thing in someone's life and then we could just spend another hour on all the reasons why wealth\nAnd when I say well we're not talking about who's got more commas and zeroes and their net worth because that is true that is one measure of wealth but a natural another measure of wealth is simply\nFor the least amount of money nothing more frustrating than spending more money than you think something is worth and not having a great experience you know I always use food in my in my in my analogies but you know went to a restaurant\nSomewhat recently and it was more expensive say than other restaurants might be a\nNot the most expensive restaurant you could go to by any means but just we'll just say a little bit\nMore pricey than your average restaurant but the quality wasn't that great and you know when they they didn't they didn't bring now you know they didn't bring up the bread before the meal like they usually do and and when they did they didn't bring out the dipping oil and and they forgot you know I'm\n... and then my my wife ordered a Caesar salad with anchovies and they brought one anchovies enough salad you know ... plural isn't it anchovies was one that was one anchovies on there so you may as well if you're going to just put one anchovies just don't even mentioned in righteous\nJust chop it up and put it on top but\nYou know value is the key some there's nothing worse than paying and overpriced a paid for and overpriced product that inferior quality well\nIn your health care and then your wealth care those are two big ones we want to get it right\nSo sometimes I'll sit with clients and they've got a financial advisor you know\nIf I'm sitting with someone [noise] sixty five Seventy years old usually they have something saved you mean like again like I said before you may they might not have many commas in many zeros and their net worth but they've got something saved and it's very common for people to have someone they've worked with over the years but\nVery very often you know they feel like well I haven't really heard from the person or you know\nWhen I call I kind of feel like I'm like down on the list of important to them and that's not something that you should feel like you know again I don't promote feeling as the main reason why you should do business with us it's not how you feel it's also how would how we deliver you know its results but\nYou know you definitely shouldn't get the impression that\nI'm a burden to this person I'm working with it if you're dealing with your investments in your healthcare you have the right\nYou have the ability never mind the right you have the ability to get great service\nYou know there are some hungry businesses out there a fear ... people hungry for your business and who deserve your business you know so we're not the only people out there that are hustling to pay attention to to customer service but we have that plus the knowledge base plus the vision of how to do it\nA plus the infrastructure and the background and the experience and the people behind us backing us up uh so it's not just me and it's not just Jim we have Jonathan Travers our general office manager who's there when we are out on the road to call\nTo take calls to assist clients with questions and then we also have our network of accountants that we can call if there's a a deep tax question right we have special uh\nExperts within different fields that can actually answer questions so if I'm sitting with someone on a long term care question I Know quite a bit about long term care insurance but I have access to also myself\nTo getting illustrations done for me that can look at various products that might work for that person in that state so it's even state specific um you know some people\nAre maybe someone has sleep apnea and for some long term care insurance companies that's a problem if they're not wearing their ... their sleep apnea mask they're ... they might not accept\nWhereas another policy in might treated a little differently so um\nIt's very important to understand that it's not just\nYou know I'm not just banging the drum shooting the horn ... crashing the symbol and saying can work with me health and well now we have a business that can service your needs um for now and throughout your retirement you can reach me off the air at eight eight eight four to nine four seven\nYou can also reach us on the Web anytime at health wealth financial dot com and we're coming into a season the fall is a big season very big season for\nConsumers and it's a big season for health and wealth because it's a review season and you know we offer reviews year round\nBut this season in particular coming up in the fall\nThere's really a great time to get together number one because there's something to talk about you know the plans have changed the plans will change now how much they change\nYou'll get stuff in the mail health health plans I'm referring to right now you'll get materials in the mail you know right right around the turn of October or you can start to get stuff in the mail you'll get ads on TV you'll get letters but\nThere's nothing like sitting with health and wealth to get personal run down the personal attention to what's going on with the insurance carriers and their products they're offering this year so if you live in Rhode Island here in Massachusetts and if you're in another state you could call as well because we're life\nThat's what you said it's a and if you're in another state you could call as well because we're licensed or in many many states throughout the country and growing daily so we're adding licenses daily um\nMaybe not literally daily because you know we'd be done and fifties the days right but we're we're
