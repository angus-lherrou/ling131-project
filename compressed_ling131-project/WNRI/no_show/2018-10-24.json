Scott I'm On the money is about to have an obligation to Connecticut Republican\n'cause you know I take a look what she did hair polls\nThey have a Republican because you know I take a look what she did hair told us take a look all Malory who's thank God there on the ... even the new person the new democratic nominee to Toronto is talking about colds or Janice is that enough this is going to stop welfare if they are going to do it and go down that\nRoute it'd be good for a governor from because I'm going to compete with Governor Baker vetted well whoever the new governor is in Connecticut to get their businesses in here and make sure that we focus on our guys to our local businesses and make cuts for them\nAnd therefore what people need to understand folks is people at different strengths now you have the envy\nThese he why it is very obvious\nThat Governor among do does not have the management style or skills to be able to run those different departments he's very good at raising money he's very good at crisscrossing the country and getting a speech he's very good at getting press for herself you are more of a manager administrator you'll\nMale song have the better skills\nThan would straighten out these departments this is what we need we need a signed up to me it's like a football team that you need a worst to first we need a delicate type of governor that would make sure every\nPart of the equation is working actively she'd be stolen special teams should be strong on the line backer should be strong with the offensive line governor among do it's like a mishmash all over the place only concerned about selling tickets fan\nAnd John you know you know I Am I right around I'm a large huge big patriots fan for a big bill bell attractive how I run government how I run this campaign to sell them with your job to try and do your job focus on the little things in the basics even something as basic\nThat's important to everyone the business I missed one could be attending a trash can down there and do what I Love this you know the governor should put out these executive orders us as all these great things oh we're gonna lemonade plastic bags\nAnd plastics at our beaches well she gets rid of the trash cans and it's gone to college what does the vendor who's a as everyone going into anyhow plastic bags were the garbage and then leaving them on the beach this saying it is\nThat it up way to run a state it may have found you must feel very strong folks this is the time I have dubbed it the ... that have been going on I like that saying thank you very public and not govern association took that for me by the way I don't live there running with it but it it's accurate every single thing they touch\nTurns into a disaster it turns into finger pointing they like just afraid that turning the corner to set us up and somebody else I Want people to know and that at some of my closest friends are in law enforcement and they were that somewhat afraid to speak out you should know the morale\nAt the Rhode Island state police has never been lower and one of the reasons the reason is is because governor ... wanted to take a statement make a statement she took that colonel ... who was not qualified as nothing against her but it is the Peter principle she was clearly not\nPrepared to be the head of the Rhode Island state police but instead governor among do got rid of her she skip\nThough she put her in the top position skipped over six people and the story\nAt the media does not focus on is that no big contract that went out to Chicago that resulted in a landslide fundraising coming in from the Chicago area that was you know be contract pay to play that Governor Mondale put him play with ...\n... per max out don't relatives up John that I Can't I underscore how worried and twenty\nFive thousand dollar no big contract to study diversity fight and the troopers that I talked to say morale is down some go skipped over six people said\nNothing against her but there is a chain of command there were men and women that worked very hard to be an opposition governor among do like everything else she wanted a puppet that she could control and it was about that no big contract or that happened in Chicago governor on you I Believe with\nThe ... the troopers you or someone they could rally behind because you believe in law and order\nAbsolutely John you know it's so frustrating as you know when I was a criminal prosecutor I used to do a lot of work with a safe place particularly the organized crime you know the hours at a narcotics and organized crime you're at the attorney general's office you know they were always always the pride and joy of Rhode Island\nYeah when they used to be on the Tonight

Massachusetts yeah I think we've lost five or six of these guys yeah you know to other departments that doesn't happen it happens when you have a governor and it's out of control yeah governor that's

I'll watch some of it you know it's funny as years ago I went in two thousand four\nAnd I went in two thousand seven a friend of mine asked me if I wanted to go and I just the first thing I thought of

right um seven six six Thirteen eighty but again I I agree with President Trump first of all if you missed his rally last night he was just terrific\nPresident Trump blast I address the fact that at this rally\nAt this a Caribbean that's making its way President Trump declared the U.S will be cutting aid to three Central American countries have accused of failing to stop thousands of illegal heading to the U.S border folks why are they coming here why are they are on their way here\nWhy are they just passing through Mexico if they are in fact you know trying to avoid danger and popped after Pablo Rodriguez for these people leaving war torn countries since when did Guatemala or one to one country one is Mexico one torn country\nHonduras Warren how Dorothy they matter that they're fleeing these countries they they just don't want to live there they want to come and live here for free so I'm Glad President Trump's at a ... a failing to stop these thousands died out now it's over seven thousand getting closer to ten thousand\nThat just plan on like bomb rushing into the country and I say no way we are sovereign when do you agree should we let these people so that they just decide they're going to come in All right so what if Seventy people that I just start walking towards Fenway Park with no ticket what are they just going to let\nThem in this isn't sanity just what no way\nSays it's a national emergency for hours on Monday White House officials were unable to provide an explanation to the president's threats\nWhich reflected focused apparent frustration with the Caribbean and its determination to transform into Republican election date now taking us out of the Providence Journal but I just had to been to Washington Post story\nBy passing through all of these countries if you and I are in a dangerous situation right trying to run out of it because you run into the first I think like when it's pouring rain out right if it's pouring rain out at you like

couple of the candidates for a for office here\nIn the greater when socket area and today it's going to be Melissa Marie I'm the second part of the program\nShe's a a councilmember running for Senate and also Julia brown who is a running for city council\nLet's see what's going on tomorrow tomorrow or opening day uh as we have Chris ... joins us every Thursday so we'll kind of look over the issues of the day will tell you where the caravan is on the way to uh to the border\nAnd [noise] excuse me and we'll talk a little bit about the\nHow I'm Alan fun I mean I see I was at the coffee shop this morning it's between five and five thirty in the morning and um there are not as many TV viewers at that time has arrived five o'clock in the afternoon must have been for ads against Alan from\nMen that guy is a real bad guy if you just go by the number of ads\nAnyway we'll talk about that tomorrow friday's program Denise Sierra who is on the council has purchased thirty minutes and will chat with her about her candidacy\nUm to have a council that's well represented as far as you know having people from different parts of the city having people from different age groups um different nationalities I think it's important to have a diverse city council\nAll right so I'm if I'm elected you'll be talking about that and frankly is a topic that um I Would give us some consideration too so we're I'm under issue one the general category of community engagement as you looked down at your nose is there anything that uh\nThat we didn't cover in this area so that we can make sure there were comfortable with a laptop it I think we're all fat okay so topic number two\nAs we move through the program or is education\nAnd a looks like um you you said you went through and socket public schools and then the then the the two years or\nA at a what was the ah San Andres St Andrews a grade school and so I guess you were pretty satisfied with a whether your education but I thought maybe you could talk about how Julia brown sees education from a council perspective\nUm I definitely think that um\nOur education standards mean to be raised I think we need to raise the bar as far as that goes um I Can't really accept the fact that you know now a days\nWe can pass with a D you know what does that tell our students that tells our students that you know as long as I show up and do the minimum amount of work that I get to get on by that might seem like a solution as far\nAs you know the graduation rates and things like that but we really need to raise the bar you know I I went through them inside the school system with some amazing amazing teachers I mean the teacher sacrifice and they\nGet up every morning and show up early and leave late and they really dedicate themselves to their students but I think um with the standards that we have now I think it's difficult for for a lot of different students to access you know if you raise the bar you're gonna you're gonna jump higher if you keep the Barlow\nWide jump higher if if the bar is is out of minimum\nWage you know there's a law school of thought out there that says a nobody should ever failed\nSo keep a bar low enough so everybody can jump over it apparently that's not the or my position if it makes any difference what I what I think on this segment but I'm lowering the bar is is um is what people think or should nobody wants to hurt the children and make them feel\nThis is what people think or should nobody wants to hurt the children and make them feel bad\nI mean [noise]\nIf that's if it's about feelings I mean that's not preparing students for the real world I mean do we go out and get a job in say and you know the person you're interviewing what's says oh I'm going to hire you because I didn't want to hurt their feelings I mean if that's if that's what we're preparing our students for than for not doing a very good job\nWe're talking about education and this is a segment and so we know that the teachers are in a mediation right now with the city of all and socket and so we'll talk a little bit about future compensation and um what um what do you think of a of the other shoe and and paying teachers\n[noise] yeah um you know as you know right now you know there is we are at a standstill as far as that goes um I Do work\nFor when sock it as a substitute teacher um so I Am not in the union or not in the teacher's scale so I can only really hear and see their experiences\nRight now and you know it's tough on the teacher is you know I I work alongside a lot of teachers and help them out during my free period on when I have ... it's called prep time um so I go out to different classrooms and how teachers out I'm with whatever they need and\nIt's difficult because now that they don't have a prep time that they usually would have in the morning\nThere now kind of rushing around with that worked to rule thing that's going on\nJulia era in let's say it was like a six years ago you were in when saga public schools do you see a and this is\nNot on our gender but I was just wondering do you see a difference in a teaching when you were a student there and what is like now working with the teachers are from the other side a big difference\nYeah actually I hate I tell the difference [laughter] yeah I tell my students I say you guys are so lucky every student gets the chrome book\nWhich is for those of you who don't know um they're like little mini laptops computer computers yet and they get to work on math reading type thing and\nWe didn't have that are the only thing that we had when I was in elementary school was technology which we only had as an itinerant once a week so these kids get to use their computers on a daily basis and it engages students they enjoy it\nThey work hard they you know do their best in school so they can earn that privilege of using their chrome bucks so it's it's awesome\nAll right um so um yeah there is a difference no charter schools where you we we know that the matter of fact you know when we go to a break and we play a commercial charter schools are campaign issue um one one or the calls the mayoral academy elitist\nI'm and I'm and other other said was the mayor academy is the best thing that could ever happen so where where do you come down on on a charter school issue\nI support the charter schools in the city I support any option for any student in the city\nTo choose and have an education I now I Know it is a lottery system but to get the opportunity to go to a charter school that's amazing you know I and I can speak first hand when I was given the opportunity to attend than Andrew school on a scholarship\nTo be able to attend a a smaller classroom setting\nThat didn't wonders for me as a student um when I was in school school is very hard for me it it took a lot of extra effort I had to study you know ten times more than the average student that got you know an easy a getting A's and B's was was not very you know didn't come easily for me you know so\nI think to have to allow kids to have that option and to have that availability that's that's awesome and that's not a lead us that's actually enriching argues and that's one of the main points that I have\nCould we do a thirty second side borrow a above that school or we're all day in and and so forth I I don't know much about\nUh CNN drew a saint Andrews is in Barrington Rhode Island not it's a very small school I actually graduated with thirty kids in my class which made for a very fast graduation which was awesome because I hate graduation [laughter] take forever\nPomp and circumstance [laughter] yeah um and it was a great school and it was a school that you know because of the fact that it was small it really allowed for kids to get that one on one this is a charter school or a prep school college with a group of us All right\nSo um so I'm your ah your position on charter schools will stop fighting about charter school yes okay\nAnd what about the final thing on education before we get to economic development one of my favorite topics how about the communication between the console me narrow running for school committee and here we are talking about education what about the communication between the council and the school committee\nYeah um you know yes I Am not running for school committee I'm running for city council but I find that very important that there needs to be an open line of communication between the school committee and the city council\nYou know getting a firsthand behind the scenes view of the goings on of of the school system\nYou know from my perspective I think it's super important we need to have that open lines of communication [noise]\nNow I just go to your show me looking at my phone from high tech you know I don't know if you can ... for somebody actually called into question and I read the question of subtle I'm going to ask you of the question because I already know the answer because we talked about a so somebody wants to know or how many\nHow many council meeting so she attended well um there's your answer cola\n[noise] I've I mean all let's say in total I don't doubt or just\nRecently recently I I mean I had as many as I can I mean when there's a meeting I Am there unless I have a previous engagement I Am their rights I think the\nThe ... I I don't want to prejudge call but yeah you know they might be saying well you know she's running for calls about how many council meetings\nAs high as you are a threat it yeah I mean a lot of them a lot yeah ...\nSo it's not like she's never attended comes from you know All right so communication between the ... school committee is important and I I I think you you thought that maybe once elected because that would be nice to have occasional meetings with the school committee to\nYou know it'd be great to get a good talking about things All right we've got a little more a little more time here we're going to talk about economic development and I did mention that I show us the ah\nDo you want to see change do you want to see progress\nAnd and you can answer that question on November\n... brown running for city council was a pleasure having you in the studio and um we wish you the best on November the six Seventy so much um if you're getting you you'll be the youngest member of the council if you get elected that would be amazed\nAnd there would be nothing wrong with that hey thank you for you so much the preceding thirty minutes a purchased by ... brown and now we're going to have some commercials some of them political some of them not so nice ... nice\nTo have you know that some of them at the ...

the Fifteen minutes purchased by Melissa Marie candidate for Senate district um twenty\n... twenty four is the other guys in twenty\nThat's great we just had that governments are yes yes well fear good morning good morning to you and um we're going to chat a little bit about um your um actually we're going to have an opportunity and the next few days to see each other on a\nRegular basis yes yes they are Willis who will be here also on friday and I think on Monday but anyway this is Thursday but this was the road [laughter] we're going to chat with or are you sure I'm not [laughter] to be quite honest with you\nA show here you are a sitting member of the one socket a city council um I was just listening to some of the council tape or a few minutes ago uh you know when we were doing the news and then so you're an active councils you you're kind of a double duty here I'm going out on the campaign trail and\nAnd also attending to your constituents sub show a told me a little bit of both or\nThe campaign has it been busy it'd been knocking on doors um oh yeah during\nThe campaign stuff yes and yeah you're right I've been doing double duty I'm a as obviously no matter what happens in in November I Will be on the the city council or until the first Monday in December\nSo and ... edition to my council duty is I have been campaigning you know I'm a big door to door person\nAnd that is because I think that there is nothing that replaces that face to face contact um\nYou know I'm also on a lot of boards and committees I'm very active in the community and I think that that's really important as well and I have always believed that being an elected official means more than just showing up for meetings\nOr showing up for session if you truly want to be able to adequately represent the community\nThat you need to be out in the community and that means community events\nI'm Talking to people about how they really feel and you know if you just go to a meeting and you go back home and and you're not fully engaged in the community I don't think you can really get a good sense of\nWhat the needs of the community are so it has been very busy but you know I like going to doors um I like talking with people sometimes\nYou um you know you get an earful and um that's that's what you sign up for you know people aren't always going to agree on everything but I think it's important to have that dialogue\nOn thinking about your a senatorial district and uh so as a city council person you're going to go to a lot of snow with no ... on you have to go to pump confess to\nWrite and a lot of other noticed repealed activities ready for that\nI Am and I\nAm going to be just as engaged in the community\nAs I Am now ... because again I think that that's important um I Do want to bring up the point that ah all of my opponents and I want to clarify the ... there are four people running for the office I think we don't talk about that enough and um perhaps some of the other candidates say my opponent\nUm whether or not they mean me I fairly sure they do but there is no incumbent in this race is an open seat\nThere for people running and I think it's important to recognize that you know when for people step forward to run not you know it's it's difficult to run it's a it's hard on us hard on your family so you know I think um that we need to be a careful to not be dismissive of people's candidacies\nBut I you can expect the same level of community engagement for me as a senator as you have seen as a city council are\nSo when a lot of the candidates come around they always have all the little placards and are on the block who does a little card and it says a ... something saying I stand for this this right away and palm card right what does the Melissa Marie platform\nIt's not always about having the time it's about making the time\nAnd I've gone to a lot of really important community events you know three or four or five just in the past couple of weeks and I've been disappointed to see that sometimes I'm the only elected official there and oftentimes I'm the only candidate there so you know I think you can say I have the time but you can count on me to\nTo make sure that I make the time and that when it's\nWhen it's time to show up that I'm going to be there to represent you\nSee you on a friday or a friday morning okay for having like Melissa Marie thank you receding time paid for by Melissa Marie their front broke of\n[laughter] friends a vibrant Oh yes [laughter] I think it will do that again preceding time paid for by

Thirteen into in game since dropping game seven of the eighty six a World Series seeking it's for title one Fifteen seasons tonight\nOr we get a David Price going up against he ... he engine you ... what do you got there\nWell I think once that yeah you got audio stab you off into the of the red Sox\nOr this isn't a must win gained an eye for the Dodgers but it's close because of the Boston Red Sox go up by two games to none that\nHistorically they will be an over eighty percent favorite to win the world series so the Dodgers really need this game tonight\nAnd ah there's a lot of things you know current shot they worry about how he pitched a really I think great as he is the first ballot hall of famer I think his performance level of an declined you can see that on miles per hour in his fastball down but he was very complimentary the red Sox\nIf they do a great job on the way around I hit home runs they put the ball and why they have single they work count they draw walk they score run or a really good team\nThat's one of his ... his contract you know he can opt out of his contract is after the season there is no way he's going to do that he's showing eighty nine mile an hour fastball now he's definitely decline he's going to stay with the Dodgers on in the current contract that's for sure\nYeah ah we will a game to tonight as I mentioned and of course uh well I'm a recap uh later this week I had a preview game three two guys up for our listeners are on our great affiliate can step out when the bay area\nUh the raiders traded away another asset and I'm Ari Cooper or that person picks from Dallas are good for the rebuilding effort or by John Gurdon or or a bad move is some fans of said\nI think it was a very good for the raiders they won the street\nGive you know the first time I've had some positive about crude and this year but here it is today you know well the raiders picked this guy Cooper I'm already Cooper Alabama with the force overall pick in two thousand Fifteen and he did have excellent for ... seasons in the league it back to back sales and yard receiving yards\nUm so he he was excellent at the last two years he's gone into the decline of injuries he's lost a little burst and his numbers are just out and I think the cowboys got a guy that's not nearly as good as he was two years ago so I'd say the raiders when this trade\nBut it is also a risky move by the cowboys Matt first round kicks the NFL Draft are so valuable you can't even put a value on it if you look at him for a second the Brooklyn Nets traded away for first round\nPut a value on it if you look at him for a second the Brooklyn Nets traded away for first round pick circadian peers right five years ago and that was the worst rate in the history of pro sports they're not saying the cowboys are gonna fall victim to that [laughter] what are those first round pick our flight all yeah\nAs I mentioned are there are ... billion I should have mentioned are Katie WN affiliate in Las Vegas to that's where the raiders are eventually headed a you mentioned hoops that LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers are off to a zero and three start some growing pains what what are we looking at here\nThey had their suffering the suspensions too I mean angry with one of their better players he's out for three games Ron does out for a for three games a rebel for four games actually\nSo you gotta give 'em a little break there but they're playing competitively or free games have been close they could have won this last one but it's just it just boils down to the fact they don't have the three point shooting that LeBron is still with the cat as unskilled for driving and kicking the great three point shooters\nAnd the Lakers just don't have them and it's also a reminder of how good the west is forget about\nYou know the the elite rockets and the Golden State warriors think about the other teams like the jazz at the nuggets in the walls and the blazers and the clippers\nDidn't ... that are probably better than the Lakers right now so they're really have an uphill or climate it ends and just make an eight seed in this play off\nYou know you mentioned brand in Ingram and his a four game suspension he thought it would be more on Monday we discussed the ... between Los Angeles in Houston are wondering why LeBron James wasn't more involved in this thing and then having his teammates back\nSince then you've heard a Rondo say That's Chris Paul is a bad team made a big baby Glenn Davis chimed in saying he played with both and he agrees with Ron do that to Chris Chris pulled the bad teammate Ingram meanwhile said he's glad he stepped in and had his teammates back\nSomething LeBron James uh when we talked about that did not do what do you make of anger ... comments\nI couldn't agree with the more likely ... like you said we talked about it on Monday This was what bronze chance to prove to these young Lakers you guys are impressionable it look it up Philip ... like you can imagine\nAnd here you have this fight the Lakers are frustrated great time for LeBron to jump in there with his six nine two hundred and sixty pounds all muscle and all he did was just talked to Chris pulled over on the side is Fifteen Years I've never seen LeBron can do a frack as the NBA not once I mean dream on green tenth and I'm a few times in the play offs but LeBron didn't bite on it\nSometimes he's too politically correct for me abroad he plays it to save you know certainly\nThere are also not paying them forty million a year to get thrown out of games\n[laughter] good point well what are they paying you lie manning for a New York or do they need a replacement there I mean one in six do they just sit out the rest of the season\nLike say they're playing for next year Matt there's no question and the indications are that you have to come back we're waiting for twenty million a year but you know that\nYou're talking to people to build pro football teams and it's built with the first two rounds of the draft you have to hit on your first and second round draft choices\nAnd like the Cleveland Browns have had a very poor record them that that's where they have so many bad years and the giants have done very poorly in the first round and that's why they're in a rebuilding motives very hard to come back you got it on your first two picks and the draft\nYeah and one other thing with you I've met he played very well on Monday nights lost at the Atlanta Heathrow for three hundred and Ninety nine year old she looked trait but the second he gets in the red zone and I I've noticed is about him for Fifteen Years now watching them he's terrible I'm a red zone he doesn't want to take that risk\nThat quarterbacks need to take in their hope for longer by some time and he won't do what he just throw it away and they kicked field goal and it's caught up with some I think he's worth respecting the locker room they these other players the teams don't think he takes them necessarily risk the quarterbacks have to take today\nYeah no I I imagine there's some a lingering doubt about the office of line they're considering what he's gone through lately ah it it's that franchise uh guys we appreciate your time we'll talk to you again on friday thank you so much\nValue that fear that\nNight that's ... cornered Donna given

like you'd get about socialism or being a socialist I've not social nationalist it back down and said I'm proud of it that's it you should be he's right\nWho's the fact that it was going on with ... and I went to the Academy Awards or are they are one of the awards and he was a black face oh what was his name I don't I don't need a great\nHe does the commercial now from from vodka or something on on TV I don't well somebody will say you\nKnow most hands on guy in a world one of these guys you know and uh went to any any what's going on with a black lady I\nMean it's ridiculous it's ridiculous I mean I'm the I'm now I don't know why you would want a unless you're a navy Navy SEAL me they can't go blackface now\nI don't know John okay that's\nPolitical correctness gone a box that's what it is it's a just a it's a progressive as the political correctness it's a\nIt's part of our we're living through a period of time where we have to win this next election\nMissing nobody if you look at the TV and listen crap away in ... and you live in a discussion of brings\nThe least think there'll be all the year ... that's the reason they promoted continuously they they don't stop they don't stop 'cause there's nothing in by the way you stop to think about it\nWhere where do we have a problem with race problem in our city I don't I don't know of any\nI haven't heard of any okay I I haven't had any complaints I mean on a kids being bullied in school or or taunted in school because of because of race I haven't heard of any\nOkay I mean a ... who it is it's in ... these people are very high paid people\nHighly paid like this one Williams his own family's ... Republican this guy gets paid big money the trash the ah the Republicans he does a good job on it\nI mean this guy that did nothing Trump could do nothing nothing you can do it I'm telling you if you gave everyone a brand new car in this country it's the one who can say I don't like to call\nRight okay and if I gave you a big big electric bonds you say I don't want to because it doesn't make any noise\nThat's right that's right to take it\nBack [laughter]\nOh one favorite I Believe\nThe eventual you'll be able to get in the ... blind and drive\nPeople should take me to the packaged will now\nTwenty seven languages [noise]\nI still I still love my ballot braille not I'm only kidding\n[laughter] I Love it said dancing answered the man yeah sagging Tony thank you a\nQuick or a request them front listening it was six children affected by a strange virus in Georgia\nI was downstairs working so I didn't catch it all I think it was similar to that to see that virus disease that I we spoke about last week at Michigan with six children died from a F ...\nThat we've talked about that last week John and they have no idea what it is or how to cure it nothing that children it's like similar versus some of the polio as I heard something about this morning and it was in Georgia\nIf if he were a Republican the Providence Journal would had would have had one banner headlines about that\nUsed to them in this country I Believe I ...\nI Believe so you notice how I I'm I'm very careful with my wording I'm like the Democrats when they say\nTrump might take away your pre existing conditions except they don't emphasize might they kind of glossed over Trump might take away your pre existing conditions so all their their um\nTheir boats words or they emphasize that they're very very follow me and I'll bet you you do not see the replay of Obama Schumer and Feinstein when\nThey were talking about illegal immigration you can't do this blah blah blah but that was before Trump you know we're gonna have a new time period we used to have be see now it's now it's called the ... she did you know that ... know\nBefore the Christian arrow they don't say before Christ and I know domino or you know eighty they don't do that anymore it's before the Christian Era I'm well we're going to have a big key before Trump and all what what the Democrats\nSaid big tea and what they're saying ha so we're going to happen in real\nTime eras in this country there'll be rewriting history that trying to rewrite history anyway so um that's that's the issue that I'm thinking of today if it was a Republican person who\nWill planted the suspicious packages he must be the ... he or she must I Want to be a gender neutral um they must be the dumbest person in the world I mean they're going to be as dumb as a rock\nThat's a rock sitting in my front yard it got to be that dumb to think that that's going to help so that doesn't make any sense and I hope they do find who was doing this I really do and in who whoever he or she is they should be punished\nMore wrong\nWell I I'm not a I don't I don't\nSee a similar I mean look at everything Hillary Clinton did she she compromised on national security and she sits on the stage and they say he is the real president and she's like a Bible had go yup that's me you'll do three\nI mean she she smashed a phones and BlackBerrys and deleted over thirty\nThousand let me tell you something if the Democrats win the house you will see the end of all investigations the Republicans will be in the words of my late husband whistling Dixie I don't know what that meant but\nThe swamp you\nAnd that to me is the scariest thing about these congressional elections because we will never know the truth and\nRemember how they they ... how how they made fun of a representative newness and he was this and that that want to tick Adam Schiff la la land again\nOh there was nothing there a ... and ... national security come to find out there was nothing about national security and what known as was looking for there were things that would embarrass some people in the bureaucracy in the swamp\nBut there was but you know it gets people weren't listening\nTo to a Fox News they're getting ten percent of what's going on and I got the Ninety percent for most of my life so I just don't listen to them anymore\nI just don't bother so that's what's on my mind today Tammy in Frank Irwin nice nice people beautiful store and\nI'm like okay you too bye oh\nWell you\nKnow it's just three more things very fast I heard a young lady this morning on up front I I don't know who I don't know who she was but she she was saying number one she said that I I Want to make sure that people don't get angry at teacher as she said and she's a sub\nShe said that teachers are not getting their prep periods that's not true\nSo I don't want people to have the wrong impression ... teachers are working to rule which means they come in at the time they're they're told that they have to they don't come in early anymore if they've got something they want to do\nNow they have to do it on the ... period a lot of times people would come in early and and get some of their um their material going but the teachers are getting a print period at least\nI'm a middle school and high school I guess she works at the elementary school if teachers are getting a prep I Can't believe the union would allow that she she said that and she said she was a supporter of public education but she also support a\nChild to schools well charter schools and academies\nThey open to everybody a lottery doesn't allow for me it's like buying a ticket to win money doesn't mean you're going to get in so it gets em I'm qualifying my remarks\nIf money is being taken from public education for those schools I Am totally against them and that has been my position right along why because they don't have to follow\nThe rules as to which students they they can accept it and then it's like chain migration once you once you win the lottery everybody in your family then is allowed to go to a child to school and let me just say this\nShe apparently went to a place where the class size was small and she said it helped her learn\nOf course it helps you learn but what a public school teachers don't have the benefit of having Fifteen people in a class they they have to take up to thirty I Believe that's right I could be wrong\nSo you know I'm a big defender of teachers most of them I Would say Ninety nine for Ninety five percent of them\nAre dedicated people there there's always the few I guess I don't know I haven't met them all the ones I Know a very dedicated and they work hard and they care about the students so um that was another thing she\nAnd they care about the students so um that was another thing she said she said something about power plants but she said I we weren't together and she named um she\nShe named a sushi chef ... somebody named paint winning you think I can remember her name but she said why politicians that were working together and opponents ... just like the group\nIs I I don't I never heard that before but they're a team let me tell you I don't know because it was an independent\nNo no no no she she didn't say saying\nFeeling whether they're working together well why isn't Suzie you're working with the with the uh the incumbents what does he go against the incumbent on sending up there\nOh I I'm not making any comments about what's going on up there I'm just I I never I seldom listened to upfront but I had a workman coming here early today so I was up\nAnd I I happen to share it and only time I hear up front is if I'm going to breakfast to something and I've got it on the car radio\nSo I did hear her and I thought to myself\nWell she aimed for people and she called them her opponents but she said that they were able to work together and and I thought if nothing wrong with working in a group of course you're all a bone\nOr this and I remember what they're saying I'm saying what they're saying is he said apparently is that if they were elected they would have no problem working with the rest of the council and with the mail that's what that means and I understand what you're going OK okay thank you bye\nBye\nBreakfast is served all day seven days a week and misuse family

more than two hours being transported they wouldn't tell me anything where I was going all they said was they said your life is in jeopardy we're taking your more secure place\nFor the most secure place they were taking me to turned out to be novel fan yeah one of the most vicious\nTorture camps in the country the campus itself was well known throughout the country for excessive torture\nThe camp itself was well known throughout the country for excessive torture human rights violations and actually the execution of some people some people actually tortured to death and then thrown into a whole lot in the camp facility\n[noise]\nWhen now all of the charges are getting tremendous ministers\nYes that's correct all the charges there were there were three charges against him a domestic violence was one that's in the lower court that was completely dismiss\nThe remaining charges one of which was possession of contractors when my household goods were sent here\nI hired some people to pack my household goods into bends\nOr somehow some old contradictions ah from qualification when I work for the department of justice they were when they ah some sort of a container with some old report certain cases I worked on and those are those cartridges more than twenty five years old somehow get mixed in there\nSo uh you got that takes the position that even if they find if you go into the country with even one single contract you're labeled as the terrorists\nThat were dismissed\nThat was dismissed that along with the other charging the other charge was\nThe other child where they resurrected the guarding the ammunition charge that was also this was the three charges against me were completely an entirely dismissed my wife was called as a key witness in all of these cases if she failed to make an appearance she was offered to come in and testify on ten different occasions and she never came at a single time\nNo your wife's now why is your wife and drove all know\nThere are several criminal files against my wife for various crimes are currently she's out on bail but there's also a sealed file on her with the intelligence community\nWhat contained within that file I have no idea I don't know when they're going to want to see a lot I don't have any of that information as of yet but I'm sure I'll find out more about\nWhen a when I returned to Uganda that's incredible and uh what about the ... and what you're doing\nWell my wife has kept my daughter a little beyond the in hiding for more than nine months only within the past five weeks has my former wife made the decision to re contact me and allow me access to my child but that's only been via WhatsApp over the telephone\nI typically in the past I'm In the past five six weeks I've probably had\nMaybe eight maybe eight contacts with my wife but only over the phone\n[noise] what's going to have to be doing\nWell what's going to happen is some again this is not confirmed yet but the talk I'm hearing from the court prosecutors as they're probably going to be jailing my former wife for seven years probably going to serve seven years for these various crime she's tremendous\nAnd again we're not talking about any extra time that could be added one set of the fire was unsealed so once that happens if in fact that does happen that what would happen as a I Would take custody of my child\nAnd you're bringing home the here\nUm those decisions have been made yet whether I Will raise my daughter in Uganda and then come here I'm a few months out of the air or if I if I Will completely relocate and uh and the back here in the United states\nIf you came to the United states would it be more difficult for her to get custody of the trial\nWell that would be impossible for her to get custody but the thing is this if let's say they lock her up to seven to ten years in a maximum security prison is set in that case a theoretically there'll be no one no no no custodial parent to properly raise my daughter\nBut let's say she doesn't get that kind of term as you get out early ... could you find you know for the child\nShe could in fact if my daughter was a poison Uganda she couldn't\nHave done try attribute to who you're going to leave it there are bringing home\nWell like I said in the event\nYou know in the event that she's incarcerated for a long term than in that case like I said you know I'd have a decision to make on on how that's going to be on the\nVerge of a British on of growing up there here\nWell it's a it's funny it's like a six to one half a dozen of the other the are the people in Uganda they have you know they have their issues but the people in Uganda have the values and morals and we have in this country forty or fifty years ago one of the big things is my daughter would would grow up with proper values and morals over there\nBut I'm a part of your life\nThe thing about quality of life has quality of life is sort of an interpretation of your quality of life there is dictated by how much money you have we have a large comfortable stayed home with a very high level of security\nSo uh you know considering it would be a situation of we have a very large comfortable home we have domestic staff of counterterrorism police to sign up for the protection of the property and um you know it's quite comfortable there\nWe're on we're way up on a mountain on the back of the mountains were on the front which offers a magnificent view of that whole area and um the back of the mountainous linked victorious the largest lake in the country twenty six thousand four hundred miles so we get a nice breeze coming through the state at all times\nThe uh when I made your wife's I've never met somebody so nice so polite and all my life I mean some ... ... it's amazing it's the same person or that a ...\nWell that that nice person is quite the little actress because that nice person once I once I was granted bail and I had more access to people who are are in governmental authority over there I found that\nMy wife struck a deal with the former inspector general of police in five of his henchmen all of these people except for one now are actually being held the inspector general the former inspector general collie Cairo or he was a he was charged with espionage against the republic of Uganda numerous murders\nUh he actually had plot to kill the president of Uganda and then take power and he himself would become president is some of the allegations against them this man is a very very bad highly corrupt public officials\nAnd it took it took them some time to muster the\nYou know to muster the ah\nThe strength to be able to take control of this guy because he was a well placed confidante of the president but I guess I'd go to a certain point where you're the president made a decision and that decision was that we can no longer have an individual like this year\nSo what did happen was once my former wife got the front of ... and his ah his five henchmen\nThey struck a deal and the deal was going to be ... said well we'll just we'll we'll make of this guy out to be a bad guy will deport 'em out of the country will sell those numerous assets including as a stay at home or and all of us other assets and then we'll split the prophet split the proceeds that was the plan that they had\nBut luckily I'm you know the uh I retain the best of legal counsel available in the country this man that represents myself and the other three members of our party which I'll get into that or he's the number one human rights attorney in the country\nThey I'm Still on your own\nYes a home that's in the state in Uganda that's that's my state I bought that connects with her no she's not she is not an owner of the home\nSoon oh I see who could you get to these ...\nOh okay oh I see who could you get to these room\nShe believes she has marital writes my legal team they uh they do not agree with that position they do not concur on that\nYou know you live if I remember right the state you live in is does the wall around it yeah this we have a fourteen foot wall around the whole there's ah is that why they need the the the one who would forty guys\nWell the thing is that uh you know they didn't know what to expect but it's ah it's highly secure I design a system myself there is a very advanced technology with camera thermal imaging technology I'll tell you that my home is probably as secure as the president's home in Uganda\nThat's incredible that's incredible so your daughter right now I was where\nWith my former wife

day for me to work on this stuff pumpkin yes um but when I bought a a pumpkin it's\nA sign said pie pumpkin and they've got one about you know the size of 'em are most likely cantaloupe you know could I not obese or I had the uh the rice to Hamburg the stewed tomatoes\nAre also uh I use the white boiling a bag\nUh also uh I use the white boiling a bag rice okay that you don't do too you only need one okay [laughter] it was ... it looks like there's not much rice in that bag until you cook it is I Love my gosh there's a lot of ice and uh I didn't have spices I typically don't use send them in nutmeg\nPicked up some of that and ah I I got the pan either go get foil in rap\nAnd they get all my ingredients and and I tell you a ... I first of all cutting the pumpkin a tougher than I thought no guy uh never did it before and cleaning the pumpkin or didn't enjoy that a a ... a spoon and I mean is there a a a thing you might use to get those cuts off\nWell what I Would do once you've got to pump and you have a nice day are available and I would have the pumpkin\nFacing you and take a knife and go edge all the way around it so if you do one inch with a knife thing going for the do the next ... all the way around uh doing it to take out all those seeds and those are\nThe like long hair it's almost like corn when you peel it actually ... so you got to pull that out eventually going to get it all along yeah now a\nTell themselves are told well\nI'm the upside down baking in the water or in the U.S kept me off to this uh it it will steam up in there that's the whole purpose of it so when you take it out and break the ... the chef Gary warned me about not to get a steam burn 'em soul just mentioned that as well like a and then I check it out I'm buttered it\nAnd then I took my er send them in a in a ... a fair amount of sentiment and that\nHas a nice brown paste all around inside in the bottom and then I said oh and then not Meg they cannot make did the same thing with the nutmeg and have a a a good coating there is a nice a solid brown all around and the bottom a Mitt made my a rice right up my Hamburg\nOr didn't cook the tomatoes left them there put them all in is a thing\nA dump the the canister tomatoes right in their mix that all up dumped out whatever juice didn't get plugged in their\nPact that baby up put the lid on it bake that thing for another ah forty minutes or so took it out crap that CEO in the house just smell like a Yankee Candle I got to tell you the pumpkin sentiment ever had the aroma that came out when that cover was lifted was just beautiful\nUh you know the enemy smell the litter box after that it was it was so\nPleasant to smell a cut it cut very easily very tender pumpkins especially after the steaming process perfect you know death and then you you actually cut and it came out like a pie we're even though the center was gone you know the filling stayed in his position yes which was a surprise\nI was expecting a mess but it didn't happen very easy to cut and plate okay that baby on a plate set among the table Dina rain that dinner bell come run into all its nose so wonderful\nYeah well thanks chef Gary Wright than we tasted it and it was just absolutely will [noise]\nTheater as heck awfully tasting it was so cognizant\nOr I may have over spiced it yes uh that's what it sounds like then ah we have very little of the dead center that was as far from the corps could be and uh but the rest out for the animals\nAnd it's still out there saying not even the walls wanted uh but uh it just was a disaster okay kitchen disaster I\nPut two hours of my heart into that thing I understand and it was a kitchen disaster where that go wrong chef Gary\nWell listening to your dilemma after the first baking plus\nI Would have taken sugar\nButter lying those two parks all the way around that lately cope with cinnamon not make remember you want to do it to taste just like the salt and pepper I Would have done it that way and then\nI would've stopped my pumpkin tended Osama upside down and we're the pumpkin would ... I Would probably put a couple of things of a whole close\nOn the water pan and let that steam and take that in\nAnd that should have given you as we can taste okay I is as it sounds like it was and when you see a brown pays them both that's a lot of cinnamon yeah I was in a lot of ground based yeah yeah this is more like you want to sprinkle\nAgain like the salt and pepper to taste less is more ... exactly exactly and then I ... I Would do the sugar also would you be heavier on the sentiment in the nutmeg is nutmeg new more personal choice functional choice yeah and you also can buy\nCinnamon struggle already made\nAll right so now you're not worried about that blend as much exactly yeah I mean it had a head you could write in it it had a\n[noise] a brown that that that was too much of a ... paste on them that was too much I'm OK and but the pumpkin itself the texture it was nice and soft all extremely ... in that that outside peel if you will write very easy to step in some places it just ... off the hamburger or\nTomatoes how was that not nice there was a portion that didn't make it in the book and like there's leftovers in I Tupperware that are and they hate that has never hit the sentiment in the nutmeg right uh so that they enjoy\nLike now remember folks with this stuff pumpkin you don't have that's just one recipe with the rice and a\nHamburger and tomatoes you can stop\nIt would meet stuffy Brits stuffing chicken uh\nHow 'bout onion would you put any onion and a pumpkin she says aren't you afraid of the hamburgers and I'm not\nSure if I did on me and I would use Pearl onions okay yeah I we used ... yeah yeah but you could suffer with ... you could stuff it would all vegetables you can put anything you want in that pumpkin bakes mhm so that was the turkey and the uh\nThe bump beat the race and they still tomatoes is just one choice well I should have a I was worried that the onions would be too potent for it I currently I didn't have that concern about send them in a ... a nice yeah yeah all\nRight chef Gary well thank you for those tips okay or should we give something away I fix all seven six nine six hundred allied it up light it outlined it up\nBut they uh made it their business to try and learn English as soon as possible because they knew in order to get ahead you would have to speak English but and I don't remember I mean correct me if I'm wrong I've never seen a a a ballot in any language but English at the polls\nNope\nI ... and again as I as I said I I Believe what we should be doing all of us we should all be promoting the English language I've said as for years we should make English the official language of the United states is the only thing that holds this nation together\nMore or less [noise] sometimes I Wonder if we're holding our selves together but the English language to me is very important\nYou might have any comment as far as that is concerned and what do you make of these pipe bombs and a suspicious packages that were mailed to high ranking Democrats president and former politicians as a former\nI'm President Obama Hillary Clinton were at the receiving end of some of these uh\nMessages that could have been very dangerous be interesting to find out who's ... who's behind this\nSeven six six Thirteen eighty that's our number good afternoon Iran WN alright\nThere's complaint yep it sure is\nWell looks like name straits going out to stay in a way I didn't hit the big money Lowry\n... neither did I neither\nDid I didn't want it or you don't even have to come forward in a Caroline is\nIs he doesn't have to come forward no\nNo no we're not kind of money you don't even have to get your name or nothing\nIt might be best if you don't rain [laughter]\nGet telephone off the hook yeah or or to Canada and smoke so wait for the rest of your life [laughter] you think that we're having any Larry last week yeah\nI went to the ... I don't know if you've ever heard of martyr small foil all this stuff yeah I was in for a special Nineteen Ninety five child a tire rotations oil change mhm\nDa da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da\nDa da da da di di di di di near in trouble that's just my own personal property it's bad enough what you can like so am I read a lot of the time was one to another building the guy started with just one time I saw what happened up the street\nSo he put the brakes on colds aligned and fixes one line ... ... on the line just so I get home you know ...\nYou know it's three hundred and fifty dollars for another job ... it's a hundred and fifty dollars for often two hundred dollars a labor so I still do\n... I Am not going to get an act called my cell phone with no brakes\nThis is a very dangerous situation Larry ... and these people are out there and people up there I never got to fall for Nineteen Ninety five special again I Would I personally went into that office I told him I Want a tire rotations an oil change and that's it period\nThis is the second time this happened to be happening in a couple of years ago and another place up there\nSay the same deal so they were running a scam and you know what what somebody that's wrong Lowry they're going to add up to her as my grandmother told me when you're right you keep rolling but when you're wrong and stuff\nI think the ... the ah ... what I my suggestion would be big apple who you do business with\nMaybe I'll talk to your last week like I said I got a real good mechanic now yeah and I found a mechanic over here on my neighbor and he's not going to fix or anything less really has to be done but they'll leave a guy who works and I think I Want to drive dot com yeah right you know I thought I hit somebody that could I have some some cars kill somebody you know\nBack back to do it in the lottery and I'm not a happy camper alright ... you take\nCare bye now open line conversation the main man has spoken tried to save a buck and got stuck [laughter] so basically uh what he said maybe you have any\nComment seven six six Thirteen eighty good afternoon you're on WN R I\nOr go to Larry how are you I Am fine how about yourself a hunky dory All right uh I'm just curious if a school can any ... that put a proposal like kids got to wear uniforms\nWell they could talk about it I I Would think that ah they might have the authority to establish something like that yeah\nAnd I'll come we haven't heard about that\nI don't think it's an issue mom with most people they tried it before nobody enforced it so they did away with it\nYou know you can have all the rules are that you want but if the rules are not enforced or the you're wasting your time and that's what happened the last time they put together a dress code they put it together you remember that we're giving free closed the people people were saying they couldn't afford to buy a T shirt or whatever the heck it was and\nThey gave clothes away so people could be dressed in the dress code and\nI'm pretty much shows especially the older kids did what they wanted to do and that was the end of it\nI Want to form that but I if I don't want that for everybody that's talking about why\nI just I don't want to start everybody that stock and don't want to get on a school committee and we just we knew that don't you think are good but the children\nWere I I Am I certainly do support the idea of a dress code yeah there should be standards ah as to how you dress to go to school um but it's again if you don't have the backup you know you you if\nYou went back that up well um I Would say\nThat it might well\nIt would be them but uh you have to be willing to enforce the rules and uh that takes time it's a lot of aggravation this day and age you have good parents who tell the teachers what to do and you have parents who tell the administrators what to do\nAnd you have students who tell ah the teachers and administrators what to do so you'd be it would be a ... I could see it as a constant battle that's what happened to the last time they try this and they spent so much ... time trying to make it work\nThey finally gave up and said well we've got other things we've got to deal with and that was the end of the dress code\nOh how uniforms or whatever\nIt not faking it they if if something and keep pushing it let's just drop it\nWell I'm not saying that that's the right thing to do but I can understand why they ended up doing what they did because they were just spinning their wheels getting nowhere\nWow oh well okay but I I'm just tired of hearing uh fourteen years on this twelve years on this I did this I did that and yet they get they get it I I probably would be a great I ... well it may\nYou know it will certainly are in the real world out there uh after you leave high school and there are many jobs where you will have to meet a standard you will have to dress a certain way at your place of employment so you might as well get used to it you know\nAnd all the years I worked at the same company ... uniform that they go and buy you a better world\nOh absolutely probably had no choice you had to wear them and that was in\nThe way it right\nRight right right and that's and there are still places like that today there are many jobs where you have to meet certain standards and you can dress like you're ready to crawl out of a sewer\nAnd uh you know but now I I I guess I don't know maybe I'm old fashioned you will join the club on that one [laughter] it one more thing yes ah we had to get in on a\nSecond floor she's Puerto Rican ... and the women I've ever seen and a daughter mhm they can talk fluently Puerto Rican fluently English yeah and when that women friends come over here as he goes I'm Talking with\nYou know that's that's smart and I believe that very nice yeah well I Would say it is a again\nIf you had a\nOh no no I I Am sure there are those who want to learn the language and uh again ah it's pretty tough not to not to learn I mean if if if it's common sense tells you if you're going to live in the United states you should learn to speak English as soon as possible\nI I really think is a lot of 'em that can go walking with but they don't do\nWell but that could be two and a you know again I I Believe you might be a French background as I Am and I know the French people were very thick headed about that decades ago let's right and but they finally ... up and said if we're ever going to get anywhere ah we've got to start speaking English\nOr both amongst ourselves in out in public as well so\nBut I I agree with you they should have a ballot bad well\nNo because what it has in this case is the government does actually supporting or encouraging people not to speak English that's what it boils down to they never did that before no never never\nI agree with you on that on to say I I you know it's going to get ... well\nRight here in the quiet city of Woodstock as you'd be sure to tell

United states I guess there are nine thousand of these opportunities zones that are being established and I understand that when sock it as one of them\nAnd I'm anxious to see what this is going to mean now there are tax incentives that are been put in place\nIf somebody is willing to get involved in a development in a community that has one of these economically distressed well first of all you got to be an economically distress community and if you have one of these opportunities zones and you decide you want to do something in that zone\nI guess are all sorts of tax benefits to invest so I'm anxious to see what that means for one socket anybody knows more about it than what I read let me know but I I haven't heard of anything specific\nBut um\nI Know that when socket is one of the

says that the pharmaceutical industry in the United states spends six billion dollars a year on drug commercials I was not surprised so I guess it's not our imagination that there are an awful lot of

shirt on the boards of such groups as the stadium theater foundation early on the museum of the museum of work and cultures preservation foundation the YMCA the northern Allen chamber of commerce community care alliance in one side of the Rotary Club which I've been a member for Thirty years and I've also shared on almost like a planning board in the past\nAnd it was terrible and so I could Harris library board of trustees Mm\nServing as part of these organizations and others has allowed me to truly see how much um sock it has to offer as give me a chance to work alongside people in our community who devote themselves to ensuring that our city is a great place to live work and raise a family because there's someone who has done all those things here I can tell you that it's just that I'm\nOne sock it isn't so much a place that needs to be saved it's a place that needs to be champions\nOn main street we have a world class theater an award winning museum a nationally known house of blues and jazz acclaimed restaurants and small business owners are chosen to invest their and ingenuity time and talent knocked community and\nWe had a beautiful intact historical buildings that was one look television there's a story of what one sock it once was its time they start to reflect what when socket his now and can become\nA place where we value our long established business community and welcome new businesses with open\nA place where we see a growing ... community\nOne that adds to the fabric\nOf our city a new and creative ways and\nA place we take full advantage of our rich history and proximity to the historic Blackstone River in soon to be completed by the way in a place where people collaborate and work together to bring that vision into reality\nIf you choose to give me a vote on November six I promise I Will work the champion our city\nWork is with everyone you choose to serve our\nAnd to do just that serve\nI Believe one side as best they are still ahead\nBut there's only one way forward together because together each day we can make 'em sock it the kind of a community can all be proud to\nLike very much [noise] Mm\nThank you David Suzie telling his case will be speaking next there will draw the name who will follow telling his case and that is going to be Roger Gillette you'll be on deck so hey you go on this case\n...\nI've ... my name is Thomas Keith I'm running for city council\nThe first thing I Need to tell you is last month I got married and to my my campaign manager over here [noise]\nSo far so good\nUm\nI only have five minutes so I Want to just get into a couple of issues actually ...\nUh the first issue I Want to talk about is marketing\nUm I think what socket does a really poor job marketing is on\nI think when we have so much to offer but we don't put enough emphasis on\nWe have in in in marketing\nSo for instance is ...\nOkay let's seventh largest company in the United states and and they call when sock if their home this is their headquarters\nYou go to any CBS across the country are you pick out a package from them and you turn it over and you see one soccer Rhode Island\nAny other city in town\nAnd then you turn it over and you see when soccer Rhode Island\nAny other city in town\nCross the country would kill to have that\nAnd we have a right down the road\nWith a company like CBS comes another dozen companies that either works alongside them or services CBS and those companies wouldn't be here unless\nCorporation like CBS was here\nIn the same thing holds true for a hospital landmark medical center there's another dozen businesses that work alongside landmark medical and again they wouldn't be here in the hospital was within our borders so we need to take that kind of stuff and just really promoted and we need to market it and we used to\nSend it out there to the world and so we can get another dozen companies that fit that profile\nIn an off of that my next topic I Want to talk about the commercial tax rate okay this is the really hot topic and deservedly so\nCommercial tax rate is very high\nAnd nobody here will deny that\nEverybody here agree that we need to bring that rate down\nAnd that's that's a no brainer the frustration is when we come to budget time\nIt's almost like the commercial tax rate becomes an afterthought\nGay we go through the budget a blah blah blah you get to the end there is a commercial tax rate or\nWe might take it down a dollar or might take it down two dollars two fifty or\nOkay when you have a company sitting in the wings like a market basket like a like a Dave's marketplace and they're checking out when socket and they see that we took our commercial rate down three dollars or\nSomething as critical as the commercial tax rate than we are setting goals for that kind of stuff I'm\nHere's here's one goal okay take the commercial tax rate\nOkay let's take it from thirty six dollars don't to Eighteen dollars\nNow you have market basket that saying\nI like what they're doing over here let's let's have a conversation\nBut we have to set that go\nOkay and and something like that it's not going to happen in one year this is the kind of goal that we have to say okay let's let's take the commercial tax rate cut in half", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Woonsocket", "day": "24"}
