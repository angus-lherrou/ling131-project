Allan Fung dot com that's two hours to age uh and they can donate which is critically important a vacant volunteer you know we need body knocking on doors every single day making phone calls for phone banks\nOr or whatever that they can just spread the word and our policy positions are up there you really need to transform a state and I'm ready\nAnd willing and able to do it on day one\nMan can you do it all the right thing the people behind you you're on the right side of history or good luck on the campaign trail will talk to you again are shot\nFrom the earliest Cranston mayor Allen funds right here on the John ... All right with that will take more your phone calls seven six six Thirteen eighty seven six six Thirteen any let me get then I'm looking up at I spy Sarah Sanders has to be giving a a press briefing at the White House press\nI think the doctor for an end judge Kavanaugh ah our victim to ...\nThat is just a sample of what Sarah Huckabee Sanders it\nAh RV thing that I felt that that is just a sample of what Sarah Huckabee Sanders is dealing with this White House press corps good afternoon to start if you drop a let's go to the phones good afternoon your next hello\nHello John how you doing very well go right ahead I Want to make a\nPoint where uh the media is saying and some of the blistering Democrats saying that you always have to believe the victim right well no I Will say that you should believe the victim when they make that claim but if you have no corroborating evidence\nAnd the material witness to that are alleged to have been there completely denied taking place I mean what do you watch you know what I'm saying\nI mean how much more can you go for now they want to leave the witnesses I mean the victims but\nThese people we're with the money to buy ... chose tennis with flowers and Monica Lewinsky walk 'em all making allegations against Bill Clinton for them to the bus and completely assassinating their character\nNot only that they they are inventing\nAlmost a a new form of justice in the country which is\nWhen anyone makes an accusation that it should automatically be believed and that's not the way our system is set up I mean the way our system is set up regardless of the allegation of the crime but he's you know it is a a you know it's it's innocent until proven guilty\nSo if I you know this is a good example this made on meet the press if I say a new stole my car that doesn't mean that I go to the police and they automatically ... I I have to show some kind of evidence of the police investigate to find out whether or not in fact you sold my car no one's automatically\nBelieve like that this business of\nYou know ... I Believe women I Believe survivors whoever comes forward with an accusation should be believed\nAnd that is absolutely insanity ... there's no dynamic like that they they are literally making this up as they go along\nWith other thing I noticed too in her testimony is this is what they say you know what do you remember most okay she remembers the stairway she remembers the layout of the room\nShe remembers laughing but she says she remembers being judged cabinet to do this only when she was asked if there was any uncertainty about who did it the state was Brett Kavanaugh that's\nRight and you were saying all the things that she did she never said that he was the one that absolutely\nYes that is exactly right and you know there's also the human dynamic that sometimes people either exaggerate ally and then they're put into a box and they feel they have to continue\nWith the lie and then they're just cemented into they put themselves into that and a lot of people may not be familiar with it but it was the case to put Al Sharpton on the map and it was from the eighties and it was the ... case\nWhere these allegations are so hideous initial story was that this young girl a was missing for the weekend and that these white cops are kidnapped her took or upstate and that they raped her in basically held her kidnapped does a huge story in New York cause protests that or anything else [laughter]\nWell when the real story came out it turned out that ... Brawley who is this girl\nShe had a boyfriend and she took off from for the weekend and she didn't want to get in trouble so she told her mother that's what happened and then people like Al Sharpton got involved and then even when the whole story was proven to be false\nPeople like Al Sharpton another they they just continued this drumbeat that that was actually what happened when it didn't happen and so something to pay attention with this whole Dr Ford store and some of these other stories Dr Ford to me was set up because she was promised initially\nBy Dianne Feinstein and others don't worry we're going to keep you anonymous you'll never have to come forward and testimony that is the trap they set for them now\nOnce they get them in it's kind of a thing of like in for a penny for penny or an ... pound now Dr Ford has to continue this charade of saying that all of this stuff happened otherwise she's she's a liar\nSo unfortunately unless something changes to her grave\nShe'll continue to insist that that this story happened but this you know this happens with police\nAll the time where people they steal from work right this back to work and they pretend and they come up with a story that someone came in and robbed them and the police are going on it\nAnd their boxed in\nAnd then finally sometimes after a while when they finally break them they say All right I made it up\nI made it up and sometimes you may notice in the news how 'bout sometimes as like a runaway bride you know the day before the wedding the woman disappears and then she says oh I was kidnapped and data and then it turned out that she didn't want to get married\nShe panicked and and you know the whole story falls apart and she wasn't kidnapped and she wasn't held she just didn't know what to do she got an itself in a situation and she felt boxed in on the story so to\nMake on the small cage you I just recently a Cessna one eighty and I almost boom I one child\nA lovely oh my God you know odd about ... green sometimes some of these flights like they obtain beer like those they call them the puddle jumpers\nHoly moly that's where they take your weight and are they only like eight people in the plane it's unbelievably loud now if you can fly on that\nYou do not have a fear of flying that's right [laughter] so but what I Believe now is they kinda tricked her because I Do believe they told her all along don't worry you're never gonna have to you know you're always going to remain anonymous\nOr them where they tricked her is Dianne Feinstein and probably Senator Sheldon Whitehouse they leak turn named to the Washington Post\nSo now she's stuck now she's in California now they start making up things she's afraid to fly or she needs more time all these delay tactics\nThan they got her you know I I Believe this woman never did want to come forward but that is the low level gutter politics that Dianne Feinstein and Sheldon Whitehouse play\nWhich is that you know and this is the last thing that people need them said they don't care about her they don't care about Brett ... day that in their mind they're sick demented evil mind it has all collateral damage ...\nInland lead us to find the means\nEnds justify the means ... percent notice Dr poured that woman Rachel Mitchell who is a question or you know she ended up being actually excellent because when she asked her\nAbout have you have any knowledge about a polygraph and and and then you know have you ever given tips on that some people are wondering where is this going well she and her pocket has a sworn statement from the ex boyfriend saying that he witnessed her getting tips to a friend of hers hot to beat a polygraph test\nSo she's asking her questions that she knew the answers to\nIt that's a good lawyers you just never ask a question that don't\nDon't know the answer to and forwards took the bait so she took the bell absolutely not no I don't know anything about a polygraph in that Rachel, Rachel sitting there with ...\nNot no I don't know anything about a polygraph in that Rachel, Rachel sitting there with ... statement for people saying that she's she knows how to try to manipulate a polygraph test and she's given tips on\nAnd not like a little tutoring exam of how to do it now the other thing that other\nNot that third accuser that threaten their crews represented by the port attorney they you know Ken party they they can't find one person\nIf you if you and I went to a party hold on let me strike if you went to ten parties [laughter] and there were fifty people at a party

they can't come up with one she also says that sweating it\nWas represented by Michael ... who's the dirt bag represent Stormy Daniels [noise] she claims oh I was also sexually assaulted I was raped by multiple men and everything else well her boyfriend\nCame out with the story saying he was dating her dating her for a little while and they started having a camera casual conversation about sex and I'm not going to get too graphic but she starts saying you know I Want to share with some use with something I'm really into\nAnd again what whatever light floats your boat type of thing but she starts to share that she's very open to enjoy these\nMultiple people involved in these ways you know again there's nothing wrong with that if you weren't consenting adults and there are people that are into that\nIf they're into swinging if they're into bisexual if they're in the ... I don't even care but she started to tell the guy that now he's turned off by it maybe there are some guys be turned on by it she was ... he was turned off by it so you start to wonder\nWhen she's like oh you know I I was going to these parties and there were you know group sex and all these boys were attacking me both the first question people are asking is why would you continue to go to the parties I again if there is someone I Want to be very clear if there was someone into\nChris ... joins us as he usually does on our up Thursday program and we'll be discussing the issues of the day and we hopefully will be discussing them with you\nW an outright win sock it\n\nLast year where he was Chris bar was the FBI\nReport on its investigation into sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is now in the hands of the White House and the U.S Senate senators will be able to start looking at that report in a secure area of the capital beginning at ... am eastern time that report will not be made public\nAnd Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is vowing that a vote on Kavanaugh's nomination will happen by the end of the week in South Carolina\nWas it over there\nThat's the Orange County sheriff after one cop is killed in six other officers are wounded during a shootout and stand up yesterday in Florence\nI Would ask you this families these officers here for the\nSuspect is in custody and this is he was a radio news refresh\nElm street pizza has three great special going on right now\nIt's our best sellers to lodge cheese pizzas fourteen Ninety five months tech as a second special to lodge one topping pizza is Seventeen Ninety ...\nSpecial number three on the cell and two small one topping teaches a loving ... tax season here elm street pizza is a perfect place to call the pieces but Monday Night was denied and Sunday football\nAnd will deliver to your getting together with race do you do on just a simple delivery charge of only two dollars an hour open every day at eleven o'clock on Thursday Friday and Saturday or open until midnight elm street pizza besides having them as these are in town where the easiest phone number to remember I'm seven six five six thousand\nAnd opening up those luncheon specials at big cell is six dollars and fifty cents per\nHour grind Hannah Pepsi and potato chips elm street pizza five Ninety six elm street problem says Dietz there into\nRefusing to comment on CNN report that says the U.S Navy's Pacific Fleet is drawing up a classified planning to carry out a global show of force\nAs a warning to China and to demonstrate that the U.S is prepared to deter and counter its military actions the report comes just days after what the Pentagon did call an unsafe and counter between us and Chinese destroyers\nIn the south China Sea tensions between the U.S and Iran are on the rise as yesterday at the state department secretary my palm pale accused Iran as\nBeing behind threats against Americans\nAt us diplomatic missions in Iraq\nIt is to blame for the attacks against our mission in ... and our embassy in Baghdad and\nNew rights for flyers a measure approved and the U.S Senate yesterday said minimum seat sizes on commercial flights and also prevents them from kicking off passengers once they've already boarded the plane and this is usa radio news\nAnd Eli amusements are back again for them to family and enjoy the ride and the kids that area and the grand midway more exciting\nFriday night twenty five dollar risk fan from six to ten pm write continually for hours back again on Monday from two to stick with a wristband price twenty five dollars and then\nRide or state be inspected daily and Julia Rodham fest weekend with the ... the news\nThe Oklahoma City zoo has a new policy prohibiting guns and the Oklahoma Second Amendment association says it's been getting complaints about it from members when they can't bringing firearms into that new Oklahoma Second Amendment association president Don Spencer met with the zoo trust yesterday telling them\nThat his group expects the gun ban to be lifted\nThe Jew trust officials say their lawyers are confident that there was news ban on guns is legal President Trump tweeted yesterday that a report in New York Times about his family his taxes and wells is what he calls a very old boring and often told hit piece about him\nBut it's enough to cause the state of New York to launch an investigation\nThe times article peak the interest of the New York State Department's ... in finance so much so that they launched an investigation into the Trump family business\nThe investigative story documented how the president's other friend Trump transferred millions of dollars spent his real estate empire to his children without paying the appropriate\nTax us for us for a radio news I'm Wendy ...\nAnd the New York Yankees are headed to the American league divisions series after beating the age seven to two when the A.

it is I'm Twenty one after eight ... joins us on Thursdays he has a list of topics to stimulate my or shall we say brain cells go ahead ...\nWell ... and and my personal opinion we've received some suspect\nThat political flyers in the last few months which I think have hyper bowl when it in just some truth so I wanted to point out this one from a Nick Matty yellow the speaker of the house I didn't get one I'm not in district Fifteen and Cranston if I got a copy of it and I think it's the most truthful political flyer I've ever seen\nSo this is Matty oh defending himself\nYeah you you sent me a copy of it in and it seemed to really resonated with me if I were in that district ... say hey this guy really did me a favor\nAnd I know yesterday's guess may think differently because you know the chamber works closely with the paw Sox nobody wants to see them leave\nBut um the the ... says the billionaire owners of the talking red socks want to use your tax dollars to pay for their minor league baseball stadium [noise] excuse me says the taxpayers have Dodger big bullet but around the should Haley Nikki Matty oh Frisbee shows the foot the taxpayers in the line of fire and that's from a ...\nOh Frisbee shows the for the taxpayers in the line of fire and that's from a quote from ... in the valley breeze August twenty two thousand Eighteen then it goes on and talks about the timeline of events and I I Want to give this a minute because I I agree one hundred percent with this\nSays timeline number one the billionaire owners of the talk of Red Sox asked you to pay for their rich the new ballpark in talking to\nTaxpayers' revolt against the corporate welfare\nFree Nick Matty yellow refused to give the and the owners demands listen to the people and put forth a fear of funding planned that protected taxpayers\nNumber for the billionaire owners abandoned would island and then fleece west of the taxpayers are more than one hundred million dollars knickknack yellow was the only elected leader who refused to play ball with the ... owners I agree with that one hundred percent\nAnd [noise] so um the folks in West I was talking to some folks are from a lowest area over the weekend and\nWell that just so excited about getting the plus socks up in ...\nUh but of course they were from they were from Oxford not ... you know so uh so what happens is that they they're going to get the benefit of going to the games but uh it is the city of Worcester taxpayers are going to\nFoot the bill but apparently the the you know this is um this is like going on I'm a around the world cruise at something they really want and they're really excited about and uh they don't get what a glass and so they got to get it\nAnd so ... I got to congratulate the plus socks owners law or shall we say I'm playing the chess game\nAnd um so what happens at the end of chess I guess you win the game right over at some events where you are right people winter right plus our soldiers one or did the city of ... people when well we don't know that\nBecause um we don't know what the attendance is going to be and um and whether there's going to be of more cost to this whole proposition than they expect we don't know but we know one thing\nWe won't have to foot the bill thanks to a met a yellow and he's tried to take the credit others will say well you know we don't have the boss socks and much too many yellows detriment depends on how you feel about the issue for\nI'm I'm highly confident that the newness is going to wear a quick I mean look at the Providence Bruins in the early nineties\nOr they came down I think the main mariners and they relocated to Providence that the biggest difference is we need to build a stadium we we had to Dunkin donut senator province civic center and we've had hockey games there before so the infrastructure necessary they move them ... was not significant I\nI see this happening and on and say I say\nWe've got to read it for a new stadium attendance may be five hundred six hundred thousand and then it's just going to Peter down\nEven a ... you know you know I don't like go local problem but they caught a doctor Red Sox inflating attendance they'd have a game where they announce ten this was twenty eight hundred and there's they literally counted four hundred and ten people in the in the audience so\nEven that even the\nAttendance of three hundred twenty five thousand is is inflated and it's going to wear down\nAnd people probably don't remember this when they were doing the analysis of the attendance in the ballpark it was the same people who did the analysis for the Ryan Center and they're they're off by fifty percent they're using the most Rosie is a projections but the Ryan Center right now is under fifty percent of what these people\nEstimated would be the attendance so let's get let's give them the benefit of the doubt face twenty five percent it's still does it make economic sense to build a hundred million dollar ballpark for a trip play baseball team so as far as I'm concerned\nAt the speaker of the house has always criticized it's almost like an empire the Pataki Red Sox um\nI think ... tried to work a good deal and of course my\nThe one he's carrying the water for me is uh the contacts and so I said to me um I Would probably you know pulled the trigger although I'm so offended with Kavanaugh thing I'm certainly going to vote more Republican than I've ever\nHave a ... this coming election year\nCarolyn ... ... email us some housekeeping matters she wants to know if I'm or what to do with us some coffee that she has to donate to harvest community church we had a fundraiser in front of the radio station on Saturday for the harvest community church here and when socket thank you I'm Mr\nMr brand for running that Tommy ...\nAnd so I got an email from Michelle [noise] excuse me Michelle yesterday she had some sugar and to both of them if you have something for that a charity can drop it off your radio station and will give a Tommy a call and he'll come and pick it up so the sugars coming in\nAnd from Carolyn or if you want to bring the coffee down to the station leave it here\nDo that and we'll make sure it gets to the ... community church just make sure it's not a bold coffee\nUm because I like bold coffee [laughter] but if it's a medium or [noise] just the regular Griner stuff like that you don't have to worry about ... ... I I\nHave to keep an eye on me seven six nine oh six hundred a telephone number seven six six Thirteen eighty we'd like to hear from you like we did from Carol in any other topics sub ... of course All right well it'll hit me on one\nWell I consider myself a I I maybe I think all in the sense I'm extremely biased American I Love American products I'm very take a lot of great pride in America and\nA particularly well not particularly but uh oh automobiles I Love American cars and I saw this with great pride is that GM has been designated by many people as the leader and self driving cars and\nThat you would America leaves or something I I I think is great and Honda um is looking to have a self driving cars and they don't have the technology that General Motors has\nSo they've just given General Motors to point seven five billion dollars to invest in something called GM cruise which is their subsidiary dedicated Jess for self driving cars\nAnd GM's market cap is about forty billion dollars or less rounded the fifty billion dollars that's worth of the company\nCan cruise the self driving\nSubsidiary of General Motors is what Fifteen billion dollars so\nYou can see that people are giving it a a lot of value and the future of self driving cars seems to be in the United states and and I think that's a good thing and companies that have historically been ahead of the game like Honda and Toyota are actually having to buy into our technology\nShow GM can use the technology from the Cadillac in there a shall we say a less expensive vehicles in the future you out on thing well a lot of people I think think the self driving cars are you know just ready to be launched or thing of the future but you have a self driving car\nWarns it warns you even though you can't see the car so going back to your point if everyone had it it would wear off the Internet until they come up with five and six jihad they'll integrate\nIt in your last but not least when I was doing a little over that Apple's so miraculous in the sense that\nI was in not Providence driving one day and they had this tiny little road had some construction going on like I'm Talking like just like the police put up like a stops and maybe there was like a a pothole or something and it alerted me to that I said how the hell is this ... know that this little problem is going on in this tiny pinprick of north Providence\nTo our listeners we're not talking about science fiction Chris has a ... a self drives today two thousand Eighteen Chris what about the speed limit so one more question on this before we\nMove to a Joe ... and some commercials but what about the speed limit is does it does it say I'm not going to sixty five is the limit on I'm not going to put you at Seventy or can you override\nUm I have to confess I've never gotten to the point where it tells me I Can't drive that fast so I could put it on eighty five on on a mass pike and there were ...\nSo it doesn't keep you at the speed limit no\nNo it it it does it know because that would be if it did that [noise] if you go down for Ninety five and you're doing fifty five miles an hour there it is actually in most dangerous defined by you so I probably would put it on Seventy two Seventy three Seventy four because you'll ... you'll literally it'd be like an old lady doing forty five and with what he said show the speed\nLimit is no dangerous to other drivers have ...\n... five I think so if you're if you're in the middle lanes on fifty five in Massachusetts um they're going to you you're going to they're going to be riding up your but I think and so I think is the only safe to do and the low seventies that's just my personal opinion looked just want them to even feel differently\nThey will um all of these things are coming soon enough where it'll all be resolved relatively quickly I mean it's I'd say within ten years I'd be surprised if the model that we have now driving and transportation isn't

I think I agree with you in day but it never ceases to amaze me that technology I never take it for granted I have this little computer\nIn my hand calls an iPhone that's got about ten thousand times more computing power or what they did it when that when I when we went to the moon in July of sixty nine [noise] um so I got this update from CNBC us weekly jobless claims dropped to a near forty nine year low\nSo this is probably not any credit to something Donald Trump did we have to make that\nOh so this is probably not any credit to something Donald Trump did we have to make that clear but the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell to a near forty nine yellow last week and the data points to sustain labor market strength and it's it's unbelievable because there's not a big big inflation\nUm the ten year treasuries around three point one percent\nUm I've never seen anything like it in my lifetime low low unemployment high productivity\nUm you know we'll see what happens with the ... if we end up creating more revenue for the for the U.S treasury I think we will but it it's unbelievably good economy right now and um [noise] the way we're measuring it and you know\nDon't give people hand I'll get my hands up ... or a job which were which were leaders in the Amazon issue which is a interesting but\nI just a phenomenal economy and it just doesn't make any economic sense that we're not going to have additional revenue into the coffers to hopefully slow down the deficit so I've you know I've got the greatest respecting well for Ronald Reagan first

we were in a deep recession\nPeople remember the the cars and crap because America Made in eighty two and ... and the economy that we had but it really was only about Nineteen eighty four before the economy really picked up um\nWe had two percent growth before a Trump somebody's economic policies now has put us into a situation where five percent may may not be a out of the realm yet for by one percent a five time it's just it's just phenomenal um [noise]\nAnd um I I think the president's he doesn't touch that many ways but having a great economy and having the money flow I've had people working on my house doing this and that and the thing I'm Sorry Chris I'm\nWe want to get to you the economy is so good and people are spending money getting their house suspects doing this and doing that and then obviously is not going to continue forever we have our ups and downs but I I just think it's just phenomenal and I'm hopefully continue for a long time\nWhen we grab a call here in the

quick thing at ...\n... if you want to switch lanes you have to do that only right\n... yeah my ... my understanding is a self driving cars is is not fully what what does the ... you know steer itself but there are times that you have to take over and they the criticism that I'm consumer\nReports had this morning is that you can be as you can self dries\nIn places where you really soon it you could have a one lane windy road and you can put on self driving and it's not really safe because you would probably eventually have to pull over ... go by but yeah it's not completely self driving and they just oppose that with the Cadillac that only led to\nFor me it took me as far as I Need to know because I'm you know I'm not an expert on these matters but thank you color and the other a couple of

anytime of usa radio dot com for usa radio news on Chris Barnes\nVowing programs paid programming is expressed on the following program of those was hosting participants and nowhere is like those are the ownership staff or advertisers of W ...\nMorning this is Brendan Murray and you are listening to health and wealth radio heard every Thursday morning here on W. whenever I I Am president of a company called health and wealth ink and\nWe believe we are the only company that truly brings health care and wealth care together for the consumer and you know it may sound obvious well we have things like\nUm you know early Tibet makes man healthy wealthy and wise right I\nI remember when we started our company name we we had been in the business\nAlready for over a decade but\nUh we incorporated as health and welfare officially two thousand fourteen and I remember I was telling my cousin and he said well that pretty much sums it up health and wealth has a nice ring to it doesn't it but\nThe idea of bringing together healthcare and wealth care in a way that makes sense for you the consumer is something that really hadn't been done yet\nIn our industry and so we're blazing new trail and uh it just makes good sense to us that um if you're concerned about your health care\nThat one of the things are really concerned about is your wellbeing and part of that is your financial well being so um you know anytime you make a decision to lower deductibles to lower co pays to minimize out of pocket expenses to a\nSave money on prescription drugs\nUm to cover surgeries if you go in the hospital to worry about um\nHappens if you need help with a assistance with daily living activities of daily living what you're really saying is number one is I Want to be cared for well but number two who's going to pay for it that's really the question and that's a question of wealth now if you have your own money\nOr your own assets the concern is well how much of this do I have to spend out of my nest egg in order to fuel my health care\nAnd so really pretty much if you're if you're really doing a thorough job if you follow things to their\nTheir natural conclusion as soon as you start talking about health\nWhat you're really what you're really looking at is really a health wealth continuum we'll call it that so\nIt's like a like I was explaining to my son he's Thirteen he's asking a lot of questions about space and time black holes you know he's really fascinated with with the science of space and you know\nOne of the things I explain to him Israeli I Believe it's space time I don't think it's one without the other I think it's based in time together and you know as soon as you have distance between objects there's a distance in space and time how much\nTime does it take for light to travel and so from one point to another so you know in science we have these things continue in space time together and I believe that and I are planning it's really health and wealth planning were the first to do it\nAs evidenced by our name but even more as evidenced by the vision of how we see the business so if you were\nConcerned about your health and well if you have questions about your health and well if you just want to make sure that your partnered with a company that understand these things and thinks about them in this way then we would really welcome an opportunity to work with you\nKnow we're very fortunate\nTo be working with uh some excellent people families throughout New England and\nNot only are in Rhode Island Massachusetts Connecticut new ...\nNot only are in Rhode Island Massachusetts Connecticut New Hampshire on but we have clients in Florida and we have clients in California we have clients in Illinois and Indiana and Texas and what happens is as people are spread out or\nThey have friends and family or someone sells their home and when socket and moved to Arizona um we don't just say bye nice serving you we say well we can continue to help 'em and now with technology\nYou know we are able to keep in touch with people I'm\nNot only with the telephone but even computer wise um you know you can actually do a presentation for someone on your computer and it's not quite as good as being in there you know in their home or at the kitchen table or at a desk but I'm the technology is there where we can actually um\nUm find out what's important to you find out what your situation is we may be able to tailor a ... a situation that would give you more coverage for the things that you care about what you currently have simply by\nStudying what you have and and inform you about some other options that might be available\nSo you're listening to health and well the radio I Am the host Brendan Marie\nI'm your host every week and some of you I Know of actually heard my voice it's when I go to a ... a someone's house for an appointment sometimes they say I've heard you on the radio I said oh good you're listening thank you um but if you're listening for the first time this is a show about\nWhat we call health and wealth planning and it's really a show about you your concerns because the reason I Do the show is to help you sort through in your head if it's time for an appointment you know uh\nI listen to I actually listen to four five six seven a different financial planning shows on the radio ah\nI'm from Massachusetts has some very good ones there but when I'm In town in Rhode Island I listen to some that are here I'm ... I'm kinda like whenever I hear something about the financial or the insurance industry I tune in are also estate planning attorneys you know if an attorney is going to be talking about wheels and trust\nUm irrevocably trust long term care planning tax planning I listen\nI read books about that stuff up I filled my head with increasing my knowledge as often as I can\nUh but what I what I find is that\nYou know what we're really it's not about trying to sell a product and I know there are some shows that do that you know that's just all about getting you to book an appointment so that they can sell you a specific retirement product or\nWe can do the same thing we can sell the same product that pretty much anyone else can that's uh selling you anything insurance or or retirement planning circles we can do that but\nUh what we really want to do is just help you come to the conclusion in your own head that maybe you want to do something because in the end it's not about selling you it's about ... a serving you\nAnd so that may sound like a different twist if you've never heard that before but that is how health and wealth works it's about serving you and serving our clients so if if if you can start to think about what's important to you than we can a\nWeek while I'm pretty confident that we can help you so we'll listen will share some ideas and then we might be able to implement a plan to gather that put you in a better place moving forward you can reach us off the air for consultation for a conversation a\nReally the best thing is to just call\nSo that we can touch base and maybe schedule some time together a\nWill come to you you're able to you are welcome to come to our offices but uh we will come to you and first appointment is just a gathering info having a conversation gathering info and then a follow up would be here some suggestions about what a\nBased on what we talk about in the first point about what might you might want to consider about moving forward or\nA third appointment might be implementation so the second and third appointments could be implementation of one or more of the solutions we talk about and and then from there on it's an ongoing relationship then it's\nWhenever you want to check in obviously were depending on what we do for you is we're going to be meeting annually or semi annually or possibly quarterly depending on how much we're doing for you and with you\nBut if we're helping you with your health care plan\nDefinitely annually you will be we'll we'll check in or just to let you know about changes if any and sometimes people say I'm all set I'm happy with what I have anything major I Need to know about Brendan and I'll explain it I said I'm sticking with what I have great you know no problem but\nOther times it's like well my situation has changed I you know I don't like I don't like that I have to get referrals or\nYou know for my doctors do you have another plan or you know I don't really like the dental plan that I have a can we talk about that or\nYou know I'm this plan that I had worked for me for the last five years but now I'm a little more concerned about you know major expenses and out of pocket expenses so can we review again the planet\nYour pharmacist your ah the person administering that flu shot right they're all part of our health care experience aren't they so we love our doctors are we love our or we like our uh a\nPharmacist or we don't but that that that affects our day to day experience with our health care but it's the health insurance company that we're going through that really help provide the access for us to maybe a\nBenefits or or services that go above and beyond simply\nPicking up your prescriptions at the pharmacy so things like home delivery you know some people love to go to the pharmacy every day it's a kind of a ritual it's an experience you know you get to know the person that behind the pharmacy and and there's a lot of reasons why people like that\nBut there's other people\nEither because of circumstance or desire that they cannot you know get to the pharmacy it's more of a burden than it is a um\nA pleasure so home delivery service the ability to get your prescriptions delivered to your home Ninety Days supplies and maybe even in a cost effective manner maybe in a way that you can save money by doing so as a double when the conveniences there and the cost savings as their things like\nAccess to a nurse that you can talk to twenty four hours a day that some of the plans might have you know membership at the gym or extra\nMagazine that comes a health magazine that um you know goes out for being a member of the talks about healthy living a and and and that kind of stuff so there's lots of things that your plan may offer\nThat go above and beyond just the fact that it's insurance and and it's really about health care caring about you caring about your health\nAnd and that that administration uh\nOf those services behind the scenes you know you're looking for companies that invest in that companies that have a vision about health care have a vision about how to serve their consumers better and on the wealth side it's the same thing you know I Can't tell you how many times\nYou know things weren't as expensive as they are but I'm the fact is that\nIt is expensive and you don't want to get overwhelmed with the expense but you also don't want to be blindsided by expense as especially if there's something you can do about it so when people get closer to retirement of becomes very important to really look at possible expenses in retirement\nBecause when you're working when you have income coming in sometimes it's a lot easier to get away with not\nYou know really having a plan because money's coming in the door and you're able to pay your bills the challenges if you do stop working all of a sudden it becomes a reality of okay where's the money going to come from so\nWhen I say it would be one of the things that we like to do is talk about um\nYou know ... do you have a budget not so much um\nThat we lecture you on you need to have a budget but like you may have had a budget when you were first starting out or maybe you had kids maybe you um\nYou know just got a mortgage or you know maybe it just became something not on paper but just in your head you've always been good with managing and budgeting and you know how to\nJust kind of self correct um you're spending so that you stay within your means but when you retire what I mean by budget I mean let's start thinking specifically about this phase of your life what you've never had to live through before which is the the phase of\nWhere's the money going to come in I'm not working for it anymore so where does the money come from it come from a\nThat's a new phase for people when they retire for the first time they go from stop working not to stop living\nUm but from stopped working so money's going to come from somewhere where's it going to come from we look at Social Security\nWe look at maximizing people's Social Security income so if people are sixty two and they're trying to decide should I take Social Security early should I delay it how long should I delay it should I wait till my full retirement age we actually have software and now we're not government employees by any means of course but\nWe do have software in our industry so anyone who works in retirement planning really should have access to Social Security planning software\nThat can run the numbers for you and so you can see it are based on inflation based on a you know we don't know what the future will be but we can look to the past and and say well there there has been this inflationary um adjustments overtime cost of living adjustments so we can\nKind of baked that into the presentation or the illustration so that you can see how much would Social Security cover for you and what will the shortfall be and whatever that shortfall is we need to make up that shortfall so the good news is\nMaybe we don't have to maybe like let's say you need three\nGood news is maybe we don't have to\nMaybe like let's say you need three thousand dollars a month\nMost Social Security is paying Thirteen hundred of it maybe we don't have to come up with three thousand we just have to come up with the difference and so now maybe you have an IRA and maybe you're going to have required minimum distributions and we run that number for you and we said well\nThat's going to be five hundred a month right well so now now is get the Social Security plus the required minimum distribution so now we only have to come up with another few hundred dollars and so we can look at that together with you in from that we can build a plan or\nWhen we look at the health care we may say well this is um\nThis is what some of the costs could be depending on\nWhat your health experience has been perhaps or no one knows what it will be in the future but we can look at history and what the last two three four five years of looked like I mean if someone's\nRegularly going to a doctor visits or or physical therapy or has knee surgery plan to there's no sense pretending\nThat that's not so right you want to factor that in so you know if we know what your expenses are or what they've been we can build that in and say well here's a plan that might work better for you\nAnd when we say better we're talking about dollars you know yes we are talking about your experience but we're also talking about money so you know\nI'll sit with someone else showing the plan and they may say I really liked this plan because it has X Y and Z you know maybe it's got a better Jim network than another plan for ... you can go to a gym for a little less money or whatever but you don't buy\nYou don't choose a health care plan is a better word than by you know choose your health care plans simply because of who has a better Jim network right you bet you buy for the whole experience and one of those things that we're looking at is expense\nExpense we've got to look to value today you know what that's the biggest challenge is binding value you got to look for value value means more\nFor less you know you want the best quality you can get for the least amount of money nothing more frustrating than spending more money than you think something is worth\nAnd not having an affair and it's you know not telling me she was in my in my allergies like if I get my restaurant somewhat recently and it was more expensive said than other restaurants might be a\nA not the most expensive restaurant you could go through by any means but just we'll just say a little bit\nMore pricey than your average restaurant but the quality wasn't that great and you know when they they didn't they didn't bring out you know they didn't bring up the bread before the meal like they usually do and and when they did they didn't bring out the dipping oil and and they forgot\nYou know I'm\n... and then but my wife ordered a Caesar salad with anchovies and they bought one anchovies enough salad you know an show visas plural isn't it anchovies it was one you know it was one anchovies on there so you may as well you're going to just put one anchovies just don't even mention it right just\nJust chop it up and put it on top but\nYou know value is the key some there's nothing worse than paying and overpriced a\nPaid for and overpriced product that inferior quality well in your health care and in your wealth cure those are two big ones we want to get it right\nSo sometimes I'll sit with clients and they've got a financial advisor you know if I'm sitting with someone [noise] sixty five Seventy years old usually they have something saved you mean like I get like I said before he may they might not have many commas and many zeros and their net worth\nBut they've got something saved and it's very common for people to have someone they've worked with over the years but\nVery very often you know they feel like well I haven't really heard from the person or you know\nWhen I call I kind of feel like I'm like down in the list of importance to them and that's not something that you should feel like you know again I don't promote feeling as the main reason why you should do business with us it's not how you feel it's also how would how we deliver you know its results but\nYou know you definitely shouldn't get the impression that\nI'm a burden to this person I'm working with if you're dealing with your investments and your healthcare you have the right\nYou have the ability never mind the right you have the ability to get great service you know there are some hungry businesses out there a fair bit people hungry for your business and who deserve your business you know so\nWe're not the only people out there that are hustling to pay attention to the customer service but we have that plus the knowledge base plus the vision of how to do it\nA plus the infrastructure and the background and experience and the people behind us backing us up\nUh so it's not just me and it's not just Jim we have Jonathan Travers our general office manager who's there when we are out on the road to call a to take calls to assist clients with questions and then we also have our network of accountants\nThat we can call if there's a a deep tax question right we have special uh\nExperts within different fields that can actually answer questions so if I'm sitting with someone on a long term care question I Know quite a bit about long term care insurance but I have access to also myself\nTo getting illustrations done for me that can look at various products that might work for that person in that state so it's even state specific\nUm you know some people\nAre maybe someone has sleep apnea and for some long term care insurance companies that's a problem if they're not wearing their ... their sleep apnea mask they're ... they might not accept a\nWhereas another policy in might treated a little differently so um\nIt's very important to understand that it's not just you know I'm not just banging the drum shooting the horn ... Blake crashing the symbol and saying come work with me health and well\nNow we have a business that can service your needs um from now and throughout your retirement you can reach me off the air at eight eight eight four to nine four seven to seven you can also reach us on the Web anytime at health wealth financial dot com\nAnd we're coming into a season the fall is a big season very big season for consumers and it's a big season for health and wealth because it's a review season and you know we offer reviews year round but this season in particular coming up in the fall\nSo thank you for listening to help them off the radio today look forward to seeing many of you over the next several weeks um\nEight eight eight forty nine four seven to seven have a great week and we'll talk to you next time\nHealth and wealth radio\nBut then he went out right when socket\n... seven Russian military intelligence officers named in a sweeping us criminal indictment that was just detailed a short time ago at the U.S Justice Department\nThe seven are accused of engaging in malicious cyber activity is against the U.S as well as its allies\nAnd any General John ... says some of the charges involved the targeting of organizations that have been investigating Russia's alleged use of chemical weapons US Senators or reading a long awaited final report from the FBI on allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell says\nMisinformation columns on top\nOf what was already been one of the most thorough most exhaustive federal reviews of any Supreme Court ...\nHe's still plans to vote to confirm Kavanaugh tomorrow or Saturday and this has usa radio news weather\nUnique flowers for a joy for sad occasion\n... square florist is a full service flour and gift shop we offer beautiful and creative fresh floral arrangements for an education\nFor more than Thirty years per square forest has been serving one soccer and the surrounding communities with our creative in floral arrangements that really stand out in any setting we pride ourselves on our good name and reputation in the business\nAre square forest knows what you're looking for because we listen to your place your order at four O. one seven six six twenty to thirty two or visit our website park square floors and dot com or stopped by at Thirteen hundred Park Avenue Illinois um soccer\nAnd while you're apart square floor us visit Peggy staffers are met life insurance agent for our home life for business eliminate uncertainty and create lasting peace of mind\nLife [noise] seven six two sixty three\nSixty six of the Carolina\nThis case you know if\nThat's the Orange County sheriff after one copy was killed and six other officers are wounded during a shoot out in the standoff yesterday in Florence I Want to ask you\nThis family of your career pleased with\nThe officer killed ... dirtier veteran ...

Larry right they can exit whining and around the other right\nThat is the way it was yes well I think both sides can a\nStick to the issues and as a ... a previous caller said um you know stick to what it is you plan to do if you're elected a mayor when socket and another was what are you going to do for the next two years give us the details and then secondly that's what that's what we want to hear\nExactly and you know what if adults are acting the way they were saying how do you expect details that you know that's not setting a good example of course they read the paper they have thing you know it's not the way it's supposed to be\nYou know and and the ... and they can ... you know we don't need them to get any more violent you know everything should be mellow\nI don't think we have to worry about the kids we have to worry about the adult [laughter]\nWell that and so but like I said the kids learn from the adult yeah that yeah\nYou know and and that's the thing you know I'm you know and I sent you a picture of the uh find did you\nI don't hear saying yeah yeah I did buy you that that yes okay\nAnd um and I did say to them last night uh ... about what I said on the radio too and then they said yeah anybody wants to make up fine go right ahead and do it um and I'm gonna work what somebody maybe we can make it a contest\nUm you know maybe we can get a\nYou know either a gift certificate or or uh you know a star gift certificate or something I'm going to work I'm going to work on that because I think that was an awesome idea ... by you know nice signs you know Larry not not nothing you know what I'm saying\nNo to Haiti several of the way\nWe say civil no matter what and I know um everybody knows them as funny and his real name is ... I'm ... right that's correct\nOkay so he doesn't have any signs out so if somebody wants to make science to him that would be on you know what we'll probably that would be great for us they have a uplift and people will talk about all the nice find in a ... a lot of good people\nRomania people get busy making signs that'll keep them so busy they won't have time to misbehave see that\n... exactly and then they they could do by law\nTo misbehave see that\n... exactly and then they they could do by local\nThreatened by all the materials locally right\nYou can go to ... you know you could go to the dollar store you can go anyway you can eat like why are they the void you can get a public event that uh that little shops downstairs that Larry porch with always does that\nThat's right did put in a shorter shop till I'm ... and the goal is to say that we can kill to buy one stone eyes that hard sounds good already you have a great evening and God Bless\nEvery All right Bye bye bye open line conversation continues good afternoon Iran WN I'll ride\nHi Larry it's fancy Nancy\nNancy Nancy how are you on a Thursday that sort of rhymes I think I don't know\n[laughter] I'm doing good yourself good thank you\nI'm sort of the third thing I Want to say today just remind me if I forget\nThe Melville library okay and the first thing about the Pillsbury house I was so glad to hear that that went well and\nA shame on the email a rumor longer you know they were trying to stir up a hornet's nest you know some people that's all I like to do is they drive on controversy well honesty\nOr you know it's all over social media if you were to believe everything that's on social media we'd all be packing our bags and are ready to run away you know so\nIt's like I mean you know God grow up yeah um and then things with the with the politics to American\nPeople now do other\nPeople in races realize you know look at the American ... ... a presidency the American people are sick of the political games and ah you know I'm\nPulling us for ... you know we think the other calls were saying you know they want the issues you know what are you going to do now don't attack where\nWe live in ... names to enjoy attacks and you know you see it on the local level state level national level in politics is always a dangerous game to get involved in but it certainly seems to be getting better and said excuse me getting worse rather than better\nWhen it comes to be a you know the candidates and their behavior\nYeah 'cause well there's so much media out there and what the Facebook twittering and all that stuff um I I think that kind of\nShowing it more [noise] um but yeah it is people they just want to know what why should they vote you win what are you going to do for them and I wish that they would you know\nSpend more time on that think about that more and and act on that um\nBut I I Would have got to hear that um my idea of the homemade signs for like ... and I hope that that does something good\nWell as I said it'll keep you busy and while they're busy they'll be behaving so maybe maybe everybody should make a make a sign for somebody ... just so busy and stay off a social media [laughter]\nYes um [noise] 'cause it I mean some people can be very creative and and you can see some really interesting ideas of science that people can come up with ads for instead of those cookie cutter signs you know that the printed pre printed while\nNow something with more character and I'm\nOld see only a tiny pop up we're going to hold you responsible you build on who you're the one who came up with the idea [laughter]\nYep yep I'm In the middle of a library um they they are open three days now I'm ... It's Tuesday and Thursday\nOne thirty are true to like six and I think Saturday it's like ten to three something like that but 'cause it was only two days before Tuesdays and Thursdays but now they've had it Saturday So I don't know what I'm turn the corner for the better on the money wise for the town\nBut I Know that the library did have the friends of the library at a a book sale\nI'm going to hear that a last\nSaturday yeah yeah so I don't know if that had anything to do with it or not but they had that and then and then Saturday hours cropped up\nWell our poor town of Melville certainly has its issues these days so uh hopefully they can get out of his slumping moving the right direction\nOh yeah and it's nice to see Saturday oh yeah you might have people that can't go during the week and you know they have the day off on Saturday and can go so that's that's good and for kids to absolutely\n\nAlready well thank you for that information and ah you have a good day All right thank you you too Bye bye now that's fancy Nancy\nGiving us a call city hall sent us an email um and it's the good news is it's the opening of uh the tractor supply company is going to be taking place we mentioned this the other day I had seen the sign\nIn\nThe window and they're opening up on\nA I guess it's Saturday yup on Saturday So that's the good news okay up at a\nRight across the street from one socket plaza where the old Wal Mart was next to John blonde so tractor supply opening looks like an interesting story I'll go check\nIt out you know we're happy to have a new business in town and hopefully it will be the first of many you know\nSometimes that's what happens you know when somebody moves into an empty spot other people feel empty sponsors will open line conversation is what we're offering you feel free to join us nine minutes after five and ... with you till until six o'clock\nNot too bad I think you would um I heard somebody got one of those postcards from that smart energy whatever yes it's a scam\n[laughter] ... what are they trying to get you to do switch over there and what you know like ... services that and\nI couldn't even get through to give you a phone number I couldn't get through so I looked it up on line and it the first of all it doesn't even go and national grid mhm maybe it's more of a Massachusetts thing than Rhode Island second of all\nAll the um the supply is instead of going through mailings just go through and oh All right come on the um\nThe government or is it ten and governors\nWebsite yeah those other companies that are affiliated with national grid mhm\nSo this was a scam well\nWhat I've heard with some of these companies and I don't know if it applies to this woman or whatever is that you initially they may be a savings but uh then you have to I I don't know I after a year or so or so many months now you find out that ah you get a ... I\nKnow renewable whatever and then you know you end up paying more so I I don't know if I wanted to deal with that\nYou know how it goes 'cause right now national grin I'm looking at the site right now [noise] national group for six months of Kirby ten point nine nine cents a kilowatt\n...\nA company called ... energy\nIs charging eight point three cents for six months or\nNine point three cents for twelve months what this is yeah it keeps you on your toes because we don't lock down that they that you started with this\nParticular group the supplier and when it gets close to the end or even in the mental I keep checking every once in awhile to see if there's something cheaper or what's going on as a matter of fact I'm going to call the one I have right now it's um it's a company called town square energy\nAnd it was see exactly when I'm up because I think I'm pretty close to being up so rather than waiting I'll just switch over to this ... energy\nAnd I'll just knocked on my calendar may try to keep track and when I come come close to five months\nI'll see what else is around\nHow much it I think you would be saving every month that would be if they get it out\nYou know when I first started with this I saved thirty dollars a month\nThat's a couple of chicken dinners\nOh yeah that's a a chicken dinner for four\n[laughter] yeah you know\nRather than giving it to these greedy people you know you know who\nWe all know got this big tax cut from the government and they didn't do what they were supposed to with it\n[noise] so let's give it to somebody else or maybe they're not so greedy\nWell money in your pocket knives and her dad or your pocket in somebody else's though\nExactly yeah and I heard about the big central grow windfall that the city just getting old ... ... was it three hundred and some odd thousand\nYeah something like that yes because damage I guess they created\nTell me that tend to Brooklyn to pay down on top of that pool\nWell no but I'm ... and they probably are just like to give it out in dribs and drabs [laughter]\nWell you know what I Wonder when the residents in this area got to be able to collect the one fall on the uh the stunts that we've been having I wouldn't buy it today\nHow was it oh rubble really really again today\nA again 'cause I had to go to a to do some shopping to stop and shop central and soccer doesn't have a full a supermarket and God only knows you don't want to put yourself in the middle of diamond now and then to enroll 'cause I went by there\nLast week and believe me whoever was directing traffic was on such a horrible job that we weren't paying ... was stuck at the entrance to the Gulf costs for almost ten minutes\nYou know and that that into section is a pretty hairy during the day the good thing is though by four o'clock when I'm are travelling by there they just the the everything is just about over so everything is back to normal after four o clock but during the day at certain times it does get a little well tied up\nThat they that my husband and I went by it must have been one of those oddball days because believe me the uh people who when we finally got to the intersection view that people who were directing traffic seem so overwhelm\nIt was incredible but anyway I'm getting back to send to grow\nWhen we went by there I went by there with my mom the first time I went by the second time my husband to go to Walmart and the stench was incredible\nDid you put in a complaint I was on the road do isn't going to put a complaining and even if we put a complaint does no good\nWell at least that comes up for discussion at every council meeting and if enough people complain may be some pressure will be put on this company to do something\nMaybe instead of doing the usual way I'll just switch my ah computer from a empower Rhode Island to city hall to the farms fell out of there and let them took themselves up instead of doing it with the uh\nThe voicemail because I don't trust the voicemail like I said before yeah when we did that committed to own a complaint committee that less than maybe six months\nOr a we knew we called those of us so we're then they'd say oh I was a very good amount we only got X amount of calls a and we look at each other [noise] you got less colds than what\nAnd we look at each other [noise] you got less calls than what we call it how come [noise] and it can never give us an answer\nWhat's unfortunate well like you said if it means calling city hall leaving a message there do that one way or the other make your voice heard so you know it just seems to me if they get enough complaints from enough people somebody somebody's going to do something sooner or later\nWell I Hope so because you know just about all avenues have been of exhausted\nAs anybody approached the only is of folks who are trying to get elected uh especially on the state level or you know ... what can they do for us so the people on the federal level you know well\nI contact her spoken English the very when he was walking around\nYes I'm\nWas he aware of the situation yeah because he was a couple of streets over okay\nUm I put it over the air about ... especially well both of them at general assembly or\nExperience I'm sure they still have their friends there and should they have people in higher places if they're running for election which we know they are maybe they could do something with that platform on that\nYou know if they if you see them in public ask them that question\nBecause sometimes it's so it's so bad it literally today was bringing Tennessee arises\nIs well that's unfortunate for everybody wants to put up with that that is for sure\nIt is so anyway I'm against that electricity oh Rhode Island and it's like playing um [noise] it's like playing for the wall street\nPlaying the stock market yeah you know you watch us stocks seated on some funky it while you switch stocks uh-huh think of it is that no good way of looking at it so that everybody\nAll right thank you for the call thank you aren't rhino so there were problems on ... hill road today the odor problem something we've talked about for years on this program [noise] maybe you have\nSome thoughts on that seven six six Thirteen eighty interesting a run sends us this piece of news and it comes from a time time magazine and um\nThey say Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation looks increasingly likely after the FBI investigations so that's interesting\nI Believe the vote supposed to take place tomorrow so we'll see what happens maybe you have a comment seven six six Thirteen eighty\nWe would love to talk with you any topic\nOn this Thursday don't be bashful pick up the phone seven six six Thirteen eighty we would love to talk with you\nIn the mayoral election on November ... it's a matter of night and day to\nSee the difference and candidates one issue is the mayoral academy the mayor of one socket is charged to protect the taxpayers interest the current mayor has taken a tax paying building off the tax rolls she's authorized hundreds of thousands of dollars being spent as we speak renovating blockbuster\nBuilding even though it's legal uses a school is still before a judge and her expansion of the school in the years ahead we'll take thousands of departments school dollars away from a public school system the current tally is over four point five million dollars\nOr during the judge Kavanaugh hearing it's rather clever how they put some of these political commercials together\nUm there are those was saying that a Senator Whitehouse his popularity has been dropping so um I don't know if that is\nGoing to mean anything come election day but we'll just have to wait and see right you might have some thoughts Sears is in the news again today as good old Sears\nThey say they're going to be shutting more stores including more came odds to be close their money problems are ongoing at Sears\nGosh\nSooner or later they're going to run out of stores at the rate they had going\nHey they've had their difficulties how long has it been the story heroin sockets been close I mean that

Historical Society as we continue to do our re filing of ... out of facts and a sore a picture of the old Sears on main street\nYeah they were on main street initially they moved around a couple of times we're on front street for a while\nAnd made it to the plaza and now they're going from the community they were in one socket for many many years [noise]\nGood afternoon Iran WN R.

thank you for that Dennis and you're quite welcome thank you thank you and they're so today I kinda got flipped on my head a little bit because we didn't finish something and we needed to do something and Denison, Iowa starting something so\nYou know you guys are used to getting out in the road early in the morning but I'm an office or jockeys or with just wanted to talk about getting yet they've flipped around on his way to think about it I mean how many days you start\nYou know what a plan and it blows up on it\nEvery day [laughter] every day we plan I vote going to do ten things and we get five dawn and we've got eight more to do the following day before we start on what we're supposed\nTo have a I Love it because I'm not alone then uh and and so it's good to have somebody here that you know folks I Hope tonight that you are that we can delve into some of the things that we run into a every aspect of it I Know that I'd be ended up every week but uh to have a dentist share with me a\nYou know to kind of confirmed what I'm saying or are we were talking a little bit uh uh and I want it to say that you and I talked to this morning about this a little bit and and I said let's just have a conversation so uh uh\nLooking forward to it and again this is new to me folk so we're going to try to win a\nYou know he's right about one thing when you when you start out with a plan and my plan today was to ride that desk jazz and then write contracts and and prepare for a weekend sales calls and then all of a sudden I realized dang I Need to get into trucking be somewhere at eight o'clock and uh\nAnd it was done and so here's my used to that stuff than I Am but we've got the roof loaded tomorrow we're going to make a permanent goes well you know that is when you bite into something ... excuse me you know you show up on the first day you looked at it you say oh dang why did I get into this and then\nAnd nothing's ready and you never know where it's coming from the got unique situations arise every job ... people pocket all over the yard will need to put dumps there's um trucks trying to get into unloading you can't get at it 'cause everything's there fought\nA lot of the day we started out and we have to take care of this every\nDay and you know what he's talking about and referring to we're on a job today and I was going to put the dumpster along the side of the building\nAnd we got wrapped up in uh the train was delivering the materials are we're paying attention where the stuff's going on and on what can the the material from the straps\nAnd then turn around and it's three to four cars parked where I'm going to place the dumpster and then I look in a corner of the parking lot and as the dumpster guys and then a truck looking at me holding his hand as well like will\nAnd uh and so plan B is going to be to come back to move that dumpster tomorrow to where we needed that six to seven o'clock in the morning so we don't get any resistance from the\nFrom the people wanted to park their cars I did go in and talk to the uh the guy with the little gymnasium or your time today just I didn't go into a restaurant because we know they're going to be upset\nYou know ... a cop and don't forget every year workman's comp division comes in and they oughta you they want to\nHave and they be below hope you're listening to brush I Am so happy to be listening to the dentist say all this stuff 'cause I've set at all but you need confirmation affirmation\nThat this is real this is just like your job now you may be worked for a fortune five hundred company you go in there and you're one individual\nYou don't break it down to yourself the way we're breaking it down for you well let me tell you what somebody in your company is breaking it down to what are you doing for your money and are you being productive in you know ... you know big brother's watching the show your case or and and I will ask\nHow how do you find that to motivate yourself getting that age where we are\nI Love getting up and go to work every morning but I hate him headaches every day [noise] worrying about whether you know material going to be on time that the material command that we are to I'm supposed to be in a week ago Harris has two weeks away\nPeople hollering at your wife's mind just like my job I just started when everything's not dead jam rip on kitchen out or a bathroom out without everything there\nAnd I mentioned that when I first started the show that you know we're not just we've gone on everybody else around us and the er the makes a very strong point that I made a\nI've said in the past then is and I know you don't listen to every week on my you're hurt my feelings and everything I'm only kidding but I said it on the radio all the time that I was when I go to a customer I Want to bring a cutout of a black dude disposal truck with all that guy's gonna cut out of\nA hobby trucks Abdullah leg guys and you know because we don't just represent you're like you and your son of men are the grow we represent other small businesses that are\nYou know absolute was not again so I think people tend to you know generalize or you know see you as one person and think it's just you I think it's important that people are\nHere that you know what where uh\nWhere they're representing a group of people and that's a\nHim every year it gets hotter and hotter keep representing because they you have to depend on more and more people every year to do your where\nAs you know in our industry twenty five years ago you wanted to give somebody a price indoor bathroom it was what color you are what\nWhat color toilet and will call in you know the tire of vinyl on the floor today my God you're going to do a job what brand manufacture a call our style\nIs three hundred toilets to change from you know a hundred and fifty tops the truth from what kind of glass door you're gonna do accustomed glass door you're going to direct stock glass door above a glass room glass my God that it continues on and on\nWe can give a price six thousand twenty five years and I always say six thousand that bad for him 'cause it's just\nWhat color you want you want to you want to call the top\nSeventy sixty five hundred that's a difference now I did was president twenty five thirty forty thousand I'm bathrooms and Roger ... you know it's like wow I Can't get I\nI Would never spend that and you look at the president say why I'm embarrassed for quite some time to get to fly you looked at it three times as you said that I figured that rather slowly yeah ... material to the new products coming out you have the time saving the the four legged my wife bought\nThe price to buy him as is his three to four times the cost of doing it the way they make a rubber\nNow that it's a self it is\nBut the rubber for ten by fifty three hundred bucks or all the time by fifty self it hit is seven hundred bucks so you know you you don't have to buy the glue you don't have to buy but they're going to save money and I said when it comes out to the same rights are going to make it a little easier on ...\n... it's the same with any product and so it's just generally you know Dennis does remodeling I Do Roche other guys do whatever\nBut ultimately does it cost to do business and it's material and labor in insurance and insurance like then it said a minute ago the vehicle insurance you know uh how about a little four O. one K. for some retirement money for us guys\nI was working for a union man just raised in fact I went to see them today to collect the job\n\nThe problem is that I see in residential home improvements and I got one that I'm looking at a note here he went to school for it and I read it or a comment somewhere on Facebook alright I'll admit it and there's some was talking about roofing and and some lady touted a competitor and said he went to school for it and I'm Still laughing about that one\nTime I have an oil rope and I've never seen a refund will know you ought to school I Know it's a school or high not\nGoing to get out there and do it again and don't get your fingers or make sure the product judgmental down properly as funny a but a ... going down that road for a second\nYou when you\nTell me what it's been like for you to find help industry\nIt's impossible to impose their nobody wants to work they want to make more money than your then you'll do I mean we can't you just can't find them in the mail that not dependable there on the phone more than they are often [laughter]\nOr you try to you Tom beat at seven thirty it's not hard to be there ... you know I'm a java seven thirty corner of eight eight o'clock oh I had to get a coffee the line was long\nI mean the minutes earlier I mean these kids are so low tech savvy those apps on your phone for doctors don't want it you can order it online and go on and pick it up and not wearing allies but he's an excuse that we\nGet in yeah that that they have all the answers until the problem arises and then it's everybody else's problem\nWhich had our way to go and it's really not that easy folks when you got a guy like myself I'm Dennis or any other the other guys up there on the board they they come to your house and they spread it out for dinner table and its ABC's DNA but it's years are but the practice a\nTrial and error or as I we laughed about there are no schools for this stuff ah ah\nYou know I'm thinking about developing a cost program for Eighteen year old kids that drop out just to get out of high school with no garbage intentional whatever\nI'm thinking\nOf my own and of teaching people what's important in roofing what the products or if I were if I were going to ask you a and that's a serious question because I Am going to do this or you know what would you need\nTo hire a kid to walk on your job site to have an equivalent to even just a year of experience but what does he need to know what I Walk on genesis job site a first\nI just got to do is be able to read a role he started with that one I had a guy a couple of weeks\nAgo ... years in the trade couldn't read a ruler because roofing\nA couple of weeks ago ... years in the trade couldn't read a ruler because roofing is you know cut the shingle cut the stars nail a mob put your rice or what is your daughter does not take rocket scientist to do roofing but this young man in his early twenties who was a very opt applicant it\nCould not readers guide dang ruler\nThat's not the one I Can't believe they can't read a ruler coming out of the school system that people want to Todd and teachers want more for why aren't rated them ruler\nYou know I go you wanna get into the schools because I I\nMaybe that well some of the things that the school system I like a lot of things they do and I don't blame the teachers 'cause they teach them how to set up their their curriculum set up for the government but years ago when I was in school you took construction class it was construction\nYou want to be an electrician or it was an electrical class you want to be a plumber it was a farm in class now they generalize everything into one class so you're teaching construction\nYour kitchen electrical plumbing and Mason every all in one class and save bedroom ice cream\nAnd that's in if you can get into that particular school or that program now there's hundreds and I'm sure it's even thousands era you can't get into the ...\nAnd it's individually trade so we've got to go back to the old way 'cause I don't see any new guys coming into the field\nBecause a lot of data you know that they're taking this ... taking all these programs putting them together\nWhen they should be individualized around so they're coming out of school with us so confused to come into the workforce if they don't know everything that don't can't read and and the teachers are doing a great job of what they want they're working with him you know\nIt's like you don't take a brain surgeon and send them to school to be a general practitioner that's two different it's totally different\nIt might be a lot of different uh so I I agree a it's a difficult it's a difficult discussion I used to be on the Finance Committee and and ... years ago and it's hard for guys practical guys like us\nThat are a very a B C D and he you know your your finger at ya you know you you sell it you put it up you collect your and you hit repeat that the the\nSchooling the way that they've approach schooling or I think you get most of your advanced stuff or you know you become a teacher in an advanced program you become a doctor and advanced program all of the engineering or go on down the line but when you become a a you know a carpenter a plumber or or\nThe trade maybe those are the ... programs that needs to be reinstated that's where I'm going I'm going to start a school where kids can come ... not a curriculum you know if you don't know how to talk English or are you gonna learn 'cause you're not going to work with me and\nI contracted to come in because you guys must encounter all sorts of things like animals I'm an animal owner a lot of times you doing jobs that people at work and so forth so you have any advice on preparing the property the land in the household for contractors coming in to do a job after that'd be\nChatting and we've got to pull up to a dock house we'd like to see the number so we don't have to shine a light that everybody's windows\nTo figure out what House number you are right and so there's one set on over at the door so we know where we call a blue the number on the outside of the dollars on somewhere yeah that's a good thing about getting bit by a dog now I'm Talking about why they're not number you look like there's\nA lot of times you guys coming in the price at nine and spout at night sure\nAt the time changes but I think yeah so the question you know we I Do get this or that I Will work on a farm somebody's got horses you know they want to make sure you're working in an area where horses are are out you know as you know as my bona there you know going to step on a nail a you same thing with dogs and pets all the ... and but I Will say\nWe'll do everything we can we run magnets ... by magnets are pulling nail from three inches underground but why do we do our best a hundred percent a clean everything up spec I did a job for an insurance guy up in the ... or ...\n... ... square root so how many nails in the forties square root ... ten thousand I don't know\nAnd the guy I thought he was mad at me and he came up to the door with a bucket or you can't you get to the door and he said I Want to say something you know the above the clean up and I said who cracked we miss something and it goes to view it a little paint bucket and there's maybe a few pieces a shingle debris and three of four nails and he said this is always falls on\nYou said the cleanup was incredible well people are concerned about that for their pets and uh you know a little faith in their eyes are running around Baghdad so that that is that we get that a lot we die you know are certainly that's a big uh\nI've had people ask me to pay for a flat tire 'cause they pick the male often Sanchez from my job [laughter] same here yeah grew and it didn't have had an amateur oh we've had over the\nUh interesting interesting to hear on the clean up a good show guys that yeah I just wanted to relay that message\nBritish so much I have to say the you know thank you for coming in with that um flooded but I Know in my hot and I know that you're you're you're you know you hear stuff like that are ... that that is this gives me a sense of ah\nOil can go to work tomorrow say I'm appreciative people respect for what I Am\nAccomplishment looking or to work tomorrow say I'm appreciated rivalry back before what I Am and I think\nThat when you put your but listen by hiring a little bit a little bit is coming in and he's looking for whatever you can get and\nHire a guy that's got some success like that is an eye and we don't need to Rob you were going to be honest with the best job we can every time I think that uh\nIs is I just got to take a minute with that you know what I Hope that my uncle and my father I'm proud of me when they hit us they should be a Chevron owed ... you know what you you'll get you'll get to work if you drink it was just gonna keep coming up I we were talking about how you doing today\nAnd I cut back a little bit on advertising this year and and\nTo my surprise\nPeople know joined the roof or so we\nVery very fortunate or\nYou've got an advertisement that demographics to how things have changed if you continue to do the same thing and you don't make any changes people change how they they look at stuff\nHow do I gotta I gotta know right here uh\nIt last week you know how people are finding a contractor and scares me not so much\nWord of mouth anymore or you know on the on the on line and stuff and for me I'm a dinosaur I don't know what to do with that grow up so\nI have a guy Stanley that's helping me to get without paying a small fortune because\nIf you go back and say fifty years Twenty years the Internet's government and the ideas of how long held off on the Internet and Joe blow calls you and he said all list wrongly seven hundred a month\nAnd you find out after six months they get paid a month just for something and then six months or nothing and you're not smart enough like me being a big Internet dummy to know what the hell they're doing it\nOr do what the law was raising the Yelp the goal goal in the face parking and Web sites and outgoing business now there's less persevere and coming and they and everybody wants a piece of the money raised then pay for this behavior that they're the ones that we're all the money's coming from a job\nFor Clint cat right exact right up by or how many times can you cut up a piece of bio one at least a sliver of by right life for for a quarter of the fire but you know if I get a sliver ... somethings always good now I Am saying that for my girlfriend much read on my fiance I Want more pie [laughter]\nOf looking at an article uh I don't know one of the trade journalism I read the pro remodeling the new homeowner data reveals that consumers depend less on referrals and finding a contractor that\nIs a slippery slope because I saw on Facebook re saying that threat I talked about you know yeah I did a few rows for a couple of friends of mine well\nI said just before that the seals she'll she'll tabs on the news now are so strong that you could put two nails in his shingle\nAnd it might be before heavy wind blows that you find out that your roof was her nails properly as fried ... listen you know a high they experienced guy but the other line stuff for you know I read his name on line I had a lady told me that is true story\nWill work in an up and the lady bought a driveway so she said I bought the driveway from you know company\n... and she said and and I swear to you this is a set up this is how people get burned she said I don't really care about the online referrals stuff I like the you'll liked him was he had some I you know was it good luck in a because you all those referrals on on the Internet\nThat might be something to do at least check it out did you know I like the\nHow much for the driveway and others driveway in my opinion and I but we're around a lot as well so you know we know which of course my opinion a dish driveway they'll gonna download up a little bit wider than out a little bit it may be a grand\nI I've been told her that I wanted to hear what you said so I can say oh you're in trouble but you wouldn't uh I don't want to say how much that was a bad decision OK I'm the guy that you tell I'm the guy did you say what do you think about this a\nDummy what any problems if I got a time I'll talk to you or she would say and she said I don't care about re first people\nI talk to you know huge bad deals you make the do diligence that you have don't blame the contract that when your job to urge the crap because you might be the one ah that's that's that's that's a a at fault for you know the crap\nOut of the lowly I had a precedent we'd get a job for and they're complaining about their driveway I found out how much it you're paying foreigners like half of what they should have cost stop looking at it and I wonder why is falling apart they did a niche and a half by during the expected ... eight thousand pilot projects on it and they have any out all the time there's nothing that I\nShould have been at least a three inch thick driveway and as you know they wonder why doesn't how all that while they they save money they got it done at half the cost and they say half the problem was put down\nThe street [laughter] you know I I could go on for about three hours with all of them then it it it doesn't it doesn't I hear a story after story and that's why I'm sitting in the ship because you his story after story that my real\nDone five years ago it's Lincoln who did it he's gone I don't know I forgot his name right or generate never mind that\nRight I ... that's why I have a lot of repeat customers you know you're going to do the best job all the time do I make mistakes every day but we fix them if we make a mistake that affects him\nWhere human I ah I have to tell the story way you're listening I Am using you for an example tonight uh I had a customer so reluctant guys nice guy who works at an auto body blaze so you know I'm Talking about you and he called me up and he was reluctant to ask me for a favor\nSo and I'm so busy right now you know I said I got to go home and I got to crank a
