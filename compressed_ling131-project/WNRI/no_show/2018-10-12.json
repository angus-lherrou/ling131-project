Ryan's appliance repair\nAnd someone like White House is very skilled I thought Sheldon Whitehouse Senator Whitehouse I thought he I found a very small glass site and what I Want you to understand a poll taken you can call in seven six six Thirteen eight if you ever thought on ... on the governor's race or if you saw the debate last night I just don't see what\nWould we have to lose wherever you are listening right now\nIt's one forty two in the afternoon what what would we have\nTo lose we have Senator Reid in Washington\nWhat would we lose by having a Republican representing Rhode Island and I always did it's always on best\nWhen we've had a Republican in the Senate and we've had a Democrat in the Senate both parties are represented what do we gaining I having four Democrats in Washington Sicily any\nWay it's been read at Sheldon Whitehouse read isn't going anywhere\nBetween Senator Reid is highly respected highly regarded with Senate Armed Services Committee what what would we lose by having a Republican down there how about this\nHow does that sound to you that we have a Republican senator\nWho sitting down with Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell doesn't that sound positive you how about in Massachusetts what would be the lose Elizabeth Warren wants to run for president she is running for president let it run for president good\nLetter run they're all going to run\nAnd they're all going to lose the all the all the Democrats think they're going to be Trump they're not going to be Trump no way he's going to get be no way the guy's a winter he is doing everything delivering he said he would\nAnd the countries getting better what are we here last night from sort of White House he's against the wall I thought he should have been pushed about the border I think he should have been pushed about illegal immigration and I think he should have been questioned about driver's licenses but he was a Senator Whitehouse also\nLast night was not question about the fact that he's talking about once we get the gamble back that he wants to impeach justice cabinet off I think that would have been very fair Senator Whitehouse will not reveal who was the reporter\nThat he leaked the story to the fake story about Brett Kavanaugh it's much worse than I thought he initially said he just gave information to this guy from Kevin ... much farther that he gave up all big story to reporter and then he congratulated himself last night and the debate on channel twelve Sheldon Whitehouse saying well\nI should be commended that I did not that they didn't publish the story well it was a big story it was a made up story why would they be publishing it in the first place\nAnd the other thing that really folks\nReally when you think of how Pauli get is\nSenator Whitehouse feels that the crock pot from Kevin in whom fate made up to date story about judge Kavanaugh\nAnd had had\nThe pat I'm On the boat that he feels that man deserved and apology that man deserves ...\nJoke pillow will not apologize to judge Kavanaugh and his family he fair judge Kavanaugh they need that stuff up that Michael I have an oddity that woman she made up\nThe second story about being a cabin or expose themselves somebody Gail made up a published in the New Yorker all nonsense no one could backed up any of this stuff\nChristine Dr Ford upstairs downstairs how'd you get the party I don't know who is there I don't remember where was the house I don't know how'd you get home I don't know who drove you there I don't remember\nAll of it he Senator Whitehouse is right there with Feinstein he's right there with Cory Booker he's right there\nWith Blumenthal of Connecticut he's white there with mental Harris he owes justice\nCabin on an apology but Sheldon Whitehouse is so jealous because Sheldon Whitehouse he fancy themselves that he'd be on the Supreme Court that's what this Israeli about during the Obama years White House has flowed out\nAs maybe someday he'd be on the Supreme Court he is so jealous of Brett Kavanaugh that should have been brought out what does that mean when we get the gallows back where you go to a peach cabinet or should have been asked about it a Sheldon who was the reporter\nBut you gave that big story too terrible alright folks let's talk about cell phones let's talk\nTo our print Sal AT Metro PCS

lot I've been as high as in the in the nineties one lady so may have known better\nCondominiums interesting story this is a carry over a story from yesterday\nWritten by Ethan show read they'd been in the valley breeze managing editor up and it is all about\nThe issue of condominiums and um\nI may uh SCA Mr I'm Bob ... condominium ownership [noise] I think I think he may live in a condo but anyway a this is out of north Providence a condo development\nKnown locally for representing the height of law idyllic living is in turmoil with residents they're seeking major changes in management and expressing lack of confidence in the financial decisions being made\nBy a condo association three movements within the Louis ... condo association where condos surround surround lush\nGulf the airways and greens are seeking a new path forward for the residential development with two hundred or more residents joining\nLast Wednesday at the knights of Columbus followed Douglas avenue for a meeting to discuss protecting their interests\nResidents at one overlooked circle are calling for an audit of all the money spent by the condo association a complete overhaul of the associations by laws and the revamping of the associations board of directors among other changes topping the list of concerns here is a new plan to invest\nFourteen million dollars in a seven year vinyl siding project residents say isn't needed and could cost them twenty five thousand dollars per condo you that\nThis is the latest in a string of what they're calling\nA poor financial decisions that are leaving them asking\nWhether the board of directors can be trusted and the reason I'm bringing up the story is because I have for a while I guess in the end the last thing I'm going to do in in my life is buy a condo because what happens is\nIs that condo association\nA board of directors can vote to put in let's say a new elevator like they did at my brother's condo\nWhen in fact I'm a lot of the condo owners didn't think they needed a new elevator but the board voted and then you get an assessment so if the elevators a hundred thousand dollars to change and there's a ten units in there\nOr then it's a an assessment of ten thousand a piece well anyway to make a long story short condo buying to me or doesn't give you the freedom of of of us freestanding residents when you buy the real real estate and that's my\nPoint I think it's best to rent and I'll tell you why\nYou know what that I think I'm I'm thinking more of yeah because\nYou can move if you don't like your neighbor you move now we've heard do you remember um oh what's going on and out the one that really made me start thinking about this that woman who owned a house on cash have and they open the bar\nOn casts a bricks bar opened up and yeah there was a ... all those issues in the parking lot is either a now whether or not she was exaggerating or whatever but she never\nConsidered there being a bar there mhm and that's when you own a house now ... and we know the real estate market fluctuates yeah so do they buy a house or two fifty three years later it's worth a hundred and fifty a stuck there for a while and then

two days ago\nYesterday and the day be pull off of the stock market or took up a big tumble and when we asked a Chris bull a about it a yesterday\n... three straight days now that are seen hundred now I thought it was to know and the other day yesterday stunk to\nYeah yesterday stunk and then the day before the first day I heard about it but maybe you're right maybe I just didn't pay attention the first day anyway Chris a bully we asked him about it and he said that they'll when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates it can affect the stock market oh explain that Chris [noise]\nThey'd been raising interest rates are basically to slow down the economy they the bellwether a number that we use is a ten year treasury for for a few years there was on two percent and now it's over three percent so\nInterest rates stock competing\nWith stocks let's take a look you know talk about ... credit union there are people back in the you know in the eighties if they're getting twelve Thirteen fourteen percent out of the day\nThey're less inclined to invest in the stock market that makes sense right it's it's basically you know it at that point it was sort of be risk free money or you think about other places other Federal Reserve bank paying Thirteen fourteen Fifteen Percent\n... considered almost risk free not technically but and then you look at the stock market so when you're having to compete with other fixed income instruments that hire that tenants\nThat tends to slow down the stock market so right now it looks like it could be a just a pullback you you don't know but people like to say a correction is ten percent so we've had that pulled back\nWho knows what the future will bring but\nIt just a reminder that the stock market does not go up every single day goes up a

rights the\nFact that it it got to that point and they seem to be an upheaval it it could conceivably be one and they just decided to do this and that people are saying well I'm as an association maybe they are and I don't know this that they haven't paid that much attention to over the years um [noise]\nWhen you're in an association like that what what creeps up\nUm is the lack of reserves I'm ... I can buy a complex and CONMEBOL end up quite a few years ago um they ... elected by keeping the fees low\nArtificially that it came about that they had to hit every and one was about twenty five thousand dollar assessment\n[noise] ah the people were paying it at over the years um but it was to put roast\nThe windows were leaking that would vinyl siding on a and when it was sold whether sold that it has to be paid at that time either by the by or all the seller so it certainly affected prices\n[noise] um so when you\nYou know when you have a well run an organization there should be a budget that submitted annually but as part of that budget and and I think you mentioned over the last few minutes ago this might be for vinyl siding or something you do as well [noise] if if this is a crisis what should have happened\n[noise] it is a crisis\nWhat should have happened over the years is or if they were planning on doing that rather than\nHaving everyone now and I don't know ... they're all what's going on but they could have paid into over years or so out of my condo fee and any well Ron organization\nIts critics said again and some places have a high right management company others I live in one day they call it helped manage to have their own employees and the more governors overseas and stuff is put out for\nA contractor signed by out of what I pay every month reassure and that raises based on in five years we're going to need to re route the rebuilding and we're we're gonna have to deal with this\nJust a quick interruption or just a short story ah I think about what happened is that they they have a new plan to invest fourteen million dollars in a seven year vinyl siding project and that could cost twenty five thousand bucks per unit and I think that's kind of what triggered all this a pretty high right\n... ... ... it's very high is kind of an ad that you're ... you're right but the people if they can I have a right to say yes or no that's true it's not these people so [noise] um ... it's a democracy yes you have to like everything else you have to compromise\nBut Iraq some well run on innovations that I'm not saying it was quite a while we're not going to say and there was some you don't get the mistake that a lot of organizations do\nIs rather than we had the complaints of people because a condo fees are then raised twenty bucks a month they basically keep that level like every other place you know when it could be ... I got out of the actually allowing them when something happens like this there's no money there and they asked people with\nSuch a thank you bye appreciate the euro answering both questions this morning and I will talk to your next week okay have a good way of my\nBest Buy Martin from a crossroads real estate group not only with a question of the week but then a supplemental question from a person I ran across last night um and they were concerned about I'm buying a condominium and all the\nShow is say I'm all the extra interference that you can get\nWhen you have to become a member of the condo association All right we're here on the upfront program recovering a whole bunch of topics this morning from real estate to um to the stock market\nAh Chris bully has a few minutes to spend with us and he's got other commitments based on how he's dressed I Would have to say they're recreational nature rather than business in nature although maybe you combined the two good morning sir\n... this is a great to be here actually I was stopping by the station for unrelated matter but I Know you were talking a little bit this morning about the stock market and the pullback that we've had\n... was yesterday day number three a day number two\nReally day number two in terms of the concentrations there's been probably five of the last six or seven days for the down yes history of going down\nBut the last two days have been chick hughley painful with Thirteen hundred points out of the things that dollars at twenty six thousand in change show a significant pulled back but I thought it was interesting that are two points I wanted to make there's something called the Dow futures or the S. and P. futures\nAnd that's an indication as an approximation of how the mock is going to open up in the morning so starting around two o'clock this morning I hate to admit why I Know that those up checking them and is an indication that there's going to be a\nRebalancing democracy this morning so right now the Dow futures are up almost four hundred points with an implied future so what that really means in layman's terms is that if that\nWas that happened there was no unexpected activity during the day\nThat democracy gained back a lot of weight loss yesterday and I think that it's really really good for the market 'cause you're gonna have pulled back and I think is going to be instant regret of anyone who sold into that yesterday because there's indications early on that the market decided to come back\nSo I think that makes a\nYou know a lot of sense and it's so much easier for the average investor to experience that\nAnd then not to have a protracted painful would draw down like we've had in two thousand two thousand one to ... to two thousand eight so if as a quick pulled back I think everyone feels good who wants to see the mock as if the\nShow um have anybody you know to do any are your people um called you know stuff like this or are they are because you know you've spoken to them at length or will be for something like this happens you sort of explain just what a their ups and downs in this business\n... it's both um a a dramatic\nTwo days like this I'll get some phone calls I if I've done a good job educate my clients and they're going to stay on their long term\nPlans that it's just an observation and they want reassurance to make sure that it's not going to affect their plans but oh yeah the ... the phones will ring and for the oil from a lot of advisors last Eighteen Nineteen months kind of coincidentally since President Bush President Bush President Trump took office it's been a slowly\nIncrease of you know most of the days and has been a lot about ... and you got to be careful that that doesn't allow you to sleep\nI Know you're on a tight schedule here but I just wanted to ask you a shuttle unrelated to over the top ... talking about in and you're going to say whether this question come from but I Do want to comment later in the program after you're gone about solar energy and a nice city council starting to talk about\nWind farms and so forth and I was just wondering how this industry is doing a in the investment area whether people are investing in solar energy or whether it's um like um like the marijuana industry ... off to the left of investing well\nInterestingly enough I'm I'm getting many calls about the marijuana industry and um it's tactically fill a legal in the United states do something I personally don't want to talk for for my clients so I Do take those calls and they say look\nYou know it's something that we really don't want to touch from an investment standpoint our personal opinion the sole industries on terrible\nAnd the reason why they're doing anything at all because they get any tremendous subsidiary by the federal government so if you were to make an investment on your home right now\nAnd put solar on\nYour your roof which I Need some room for it so I knew there was a reason why always dragging my feet or Mrs ... Richard ... who's been helping with it so my roof needs a little bit of work so I may look at it again but if I make a thirty thousand dollar investment into solar United States government is going to give me a third of that\nAs a rebate I'm a federal taxes and then there's also some state ... so\nOf the headline and yesterday was that they Fall River mayor has been indicted um so do you know do you do the gentleman at all or you just watched him from a another town\nWe've been in each other's presence at meetings a couple of times um if you've been around the guy he's a he's a pretty arrogant um swagger ing gentleman or thanks very highly of himself so it's not my kind of guy [laughter] so I Try to skip it\nReminds me of a Rhode Island mayor was going on but that's another from another day another time\n[laughter] um he was is that we are an socket me you know and he was in the paper about a year ago the fall river Harold I'm broke the news that he was being investigated\nAnd he subsequently denied that he was being investigated in an interview with channel ten um but a lot of the facts of his um Internet based company that he had developed an app we're starting to leak out then and then all kind of went away\nA cause it was under federal investigation nobody would speak about it and so yesterday's headline is the first time we've seen definitive results from that investigation but\nUh it's mind blowing his reaction is mind boggling that he's not accused of doing anything that\n... any number of other public officials I've ever been charged doing is just the his reaction is so extraordinary in my mind [noise]\nNow he faces federal charges use a pretty serious charges you\nSure I mean he [noise] and I'm not exactly sure what the nexus says it's not my specialty I'm going to\nI'm assuming that because the FCC seems to be involved to use some\nA method of raising money from investors that creates this federal um maybe it's a wire charge maybe at some other federal a connection but that the real issue to me as an outside observer is that he filed amended tax returns to attempt to cover up is fraud\nOr that had been since the accusation their allegedly faults tax returns sorry he committed fraud to cover up of fraud which is a pretty uh that's going to be a tough hole to dig out of\n[noise] All right so um we would expect a like a a few mayors and officials in the in the southern New England area around but after is all said and done we may have another official a spending some time in the penitentiary\nYou well yeah there there are allegations right now if the charges are proven and they stick it will be going away for some time for sure mhm [noise]\nThere's a an interesting secondary story to this it's getting very difficult to recruit a capable people to work in municipal government across the country but especially here in the northeast and when you have something like this happen\nIt gets that much harder to find a finance director or building official or somebody who wants to work in an environment or a town I'm In a straight a or time ministry and I want to get caught up there and there are increasingly\nAggressive recruitment efforts to find people to work in these jobs and having somebody at the top was elected who falls down like this makes it hard for that community to find people\nDid you have a question of well if the if you want to follow up on that but I wanted to bring up one other topic\nBefore yeah I Am going to follow up on that so when you got hired as a town manager or um or members right All right when you get hired the the Douglas select men had to you know find out who you were you know and where you work before and so forth how much scrutiny or is done\nAre these days and do you think based on the Supreme Court hearing Sen nomination procedures that we've seen that the towns and cities I even got to be more\nDiligent and deeper in looking over their candidate so uh what was that just a kind of a a freaky thing that happened to our Supreme Court justice\nThey might be unique things to judge Kavanaugh's travel as candidate for the Supreme Court I Will say that the background checks that we now do\nFor any number of roles town administrator finance director police and fire chief are very very extensive I'm not quite the same as applying to the bar\nBut very close and I found myself a finalist in many places I had options to choose from and doing just extensive interviews with police detectives on\nFor goodness sake just about everything I ever said in in public on video and my time either and when socket er into evidence that they had questions about memory\nShow Shelly do dig quite a bit yeah quite a bit so um so I guess I'm going into the business that you're um that you're in a you have to be a somewhat squeaky clean\n[laughter] yeah yeah I mean you do your best I mean\nWe're not doing these jobs to be fainted by anyone but there's a whole long list of responsibilities risk management fiscal management\nAnd all Personnel Management all those things that go into it I think that I personally draw the line at at business judgment I don't care about people's personal lives when I\nUnless it's distracting to the overall mission but like I say we're not interested in St we just want you to be when you're on the job [noise] exercise your best judgment\nBut your question I think this is I got\nSomething that probably ten years ago wasn't even a Bennett question but as far as like marijuana goes I'm In Massachusetts it's kind of confusing but it's quote unquote legalized right yep so\nConfusing but it's quote unquote legalized right yup so like what does the town of Douglas's feeling that are yours personally like are they going to allow cannabis to be sold is that how it works maybe you could break it down a little bit\nYou know we you could do hours about this and it would actually be interesting to people because it's been a legal for so long so many people have spent time\nIn the correctional system for it now Massachusetts has made it legal Douglas was a so called yes community on question for which was legalizing it which was legalizing it so it's set us on a path to\nHave zoning and other laws in place when it becomes fully legalized at retail for adult recreational use so we have a facility that was\nUm approved as a medical row mhm they have the automatic right to be a recreational\nPresents to sell it to you not know to do to work so for whatever you stay were approved for they can kind of slide over for the adult side so they can be an adult recreational grow as well as medical grow\nRetail is a completely separate issue\nOkay I see what you're saying so they just allowed to grow it for two different reasons a recreational and for medical now\nSo where we stand exactly town meeting has approved a free uses their um the grow\nAnd product manufacturing I should say two uses [noise]\nSo they can take the product grow it dry it extracts certain can have annoyed from it or in that facility or two separate licenses that they have to get from the cameras control commission\nAnd town meeting also approved but those uses for recreational so both medical and recreational I'm growing and product manufacturing in our town and where\nWe're going to allow retail\nBut under a licensing scheme that is now going before a town meeting on November thirteenth or wherever and they have to\nDecide high on the and I have to go through a process to be approved um zoning takes a lot longer and in Massachusetts you need a two thirds majority at town meeting so you really have to do your homework we're not there yet because the licensing will protect us will use our existing zoning but zoning will probably be done springtime have\nSuch a complicated yeah in a town has to go through this process and decide\nAnd it's an incredible industry or if you read the chief studies from Colorado and from the west coast you really have to have a lot of capital to make it a go of this is a very expensive upfront to build a facility especially on the growth side\nTo sustain the price pressure that will come from everybody dumping products in the market\nAnd then I think he's still competing against the black market is that what you're getting at like ... you know trying to make\nThat a huge balancing act for the cannabis control commission at the state level is how can you reduce the\nThe barriers entering the business or the price will come low enough to knock the black market out ... so it you know a hundred dollars a pound it's still a profitable product so you know it's going to be an interesting thing to see how it all those out\nSo English incidentally I'm ... is with us a former one socket a city official\n[laughter] nice way of putting it right at named formative it in town administrator\nNow currently in Douglas, Massachusetts which is why I brought up the marijuana should that I think they thought hey well legalize it everybody would be smoking it will be afraid just has it's just not that simple\nNow has been way harder um [noise] to get facilities approved and difficulties of occupancy issued\nIf you look at all the security requirements\nThe requirements of the product itself how it has to be grown and and the temperature maintenance and all the things that go along with it is complicated industry has a lot of money that's required a front and\nUm I think a lot of times people get halfway into the project and realized holy cow and this is a bigger deal realized and for the black market guys when they used to sneak around mills and when socket trying to do this because I Know there was a case study a couple of years ago [noise]\nUm they're making so much profit on it that they kind of absorb those expenses when it becomes a business and the profit margin is dinner ... it's a little bit more of a challenge\nDoes it for a program thank you for being with us here in the front program we will see you on Monday they will be here but I Will be here with um President Trump is going to

on the secretary of state's website and again I recommend both Rhode Island and Massachusetts start in Rhode Island\n[noise] next question is it legal to record our conversation with employees\nFor their knowledge and us interesting uh we got this question unrelated to somebody came into the office somebody you know pretty pretty well are you recording me\nYou know like I'm going to do ... anybody coming into your office they argue regarding me or or or people of that um I guess suspicious these days and probably for good reason because of so much surveillance video and and so much um you know are doing things on the sneak\nIt is I'm In is not illegal to phrases carefully it is not illegal to record a conversation in Rhode Island ... and other states\nAnd it's not illegal in Rhode Island as long as one party to the conversation knows they're being recorded so that means if you and I are having a conversation I can record the conversation on my cell phone and the pocket of my jacket\nWithout your knowledge because I'm a party to the conversation that's being recorded however if we're talking about an employer recording ongoing in the lunchroom where they are not a party to that conversation no they cannot do that that is considered surveillance and you have to\nPost that they are being recorded and that there are surveillance um items whether it be cameras and microphones located in that location because they are not a party to every conversation unless the boss its launch room all day and the gas for the employees and so it's not the boss very long [noise] so\nI Hope that answers that particular part of the question can you do it\nHowever the question is why are you doing it if you're doing it with the intent to use it as evidence in the courts in Rhode Island you can use the tape on which you are a party who is knowledgeably\nRecording and also a party to the conversation in court upheld battle to get it in in terms of relevance and all sorts of other ... as a den cheery issues but it is possible to get that type of recording and where Mr Bush and and I\nAre having a conversation I'm taping him on my phone the common instance I usually here is um ex spouse as the tape each other's phone conversations all the time is it legal to tape it yes is it possible to get it emitted into evidence yes it's possible is it a slam dunk no\nIf you are recording surveillance and you have not posted\nThat you are when you're not a party to that conversation than there is an even more difficult as an entry battle to get that and and if it's not posted that their surveillance recording going on you will probably never\nGet that in so it depends on the context but if you're having a conversation what confuses me it's a question says record a conversation with employees with out there\nStation what confuses me as the question says record a conversation with employees without their knowledge\nThe trigger is are you a party the conversation being recorded Emmert island and Massachusetts you can't do it period you can do it you can't get it in\nYou can't use it in evidence in any way in Massachusetts almost everybody has a party to the conversation knows they're being recorded and just to clarify because certain businesses are this way law medicine because this privilege\nPriests other religious um people there's a certain ... um professions in which there is a\nPrivilege medical privileged legal privilege privilege as a confessional that sort of thing\nThose conversations cannot be recorded in any instance unless I divulge to you that I'm recording and if I'd love to see that I'm recording\nIt's usually for purposes of a note being made to my file and as soon as that notice made the recording is destroyed the only exception and swimming record\nThings intentionally for the court like video depositions or sometimes our record conversations with regard to will if I anticipate this going to be a contest I made a record or video record our discussion as to the terms of your well those are different those are arranged\nYou are aware of them nothing is being done I'm On the cutesy you were absolutely aware of I Am recording un my office and\nI ask permission first than I Would hope that all professional so did the same thing\nAll right we're moving on with the ...

that I really uh really like\nNot much ... young people making the blues music nowadays and he's definitely very talented that songs on a bunch of commercials we had it a long time ago we had at first here on the joke show we're breaking ground set and trends\nDoing nothing as we've been doing here on WNPR rice in April of two thousand and Fifteen and we'll keep an eye going let's get to the phone lines we do have gas and this is I'm just going to be a a call and hang on one second\nA couple of adjustments to get right to the phone lines because we do have gas coming in\nGood morning you're on the show more than Joe how are you today and doing great\nYou must be happy about the red socks\nOff static Joe\nYeah I mean I Am doing a you know it's a\nThe the the thing that people are talking to me most about when I'm when I'm Out in the people I Know and people are listening to the show is you know\nAre they going to pitch Greg kimbrell again in the ninth inning and I said of course they are in you know and I was a little nerve wracking we're we're going to hope we'd be talking to Tom Cameron our usual Monday gas this morning and we're going to talk to him about a few of the uh\nIndian out there that game but um you know it shouldn't have been that close for one or the way that raise your pitch the way that certainly Chris sales pitch the way that Matt Barnes pitched in of course for cello\nCan't say enough about um what made them all the did you know if you look at the theories on the whole it was just prices are\nPrices bad game in general really I'm almost blowing the thing at the end that's pretty much it for as far as the pitching and how much time do we spend talking about ...\nYes but that's such a joke especially the playoffs now coming up there's got to be great strategy with the [noise] I I was very impressed with the ... yeah last game I stepped up the side it I'll tell you what it was unbelievable\nYou know ... is pushing all the right button is because a lot of people including the guy talking to you right now yours truly a I like ... you know it gives you a pop he's good he he ...\nHe can hit a three run Homer in a in a in an instant and you know you worry about it maybe as a defense of liability Leighton games but if you start divers you can always bringing new Diaz later in the game and uh you know the way that ... played in the game before I thought for sure Cora would stick with him instead\nInstead he goes back to nearly as winds up getting that key RBI early in the game and then of course the throw the perfect drove you made odd to end the game to get a ... and the great stretched by Stephen ... that hold a bag\nI Can't say enough about the play by noon yet and then it looked like he got hurt after the game but listening to Alex coral last night\nUm he's okay each backed him to be ready to go\nAnd apparently on New Year's as a couple of issues going on\nHe's gonna hamstring or a growing problem on the right leg in something a ... with the with the left side of the knee remember last year he had the knee issue we they carry them off the field it's a PC out which is the tendon behind your knee I Believe so he's got an e going on one end\nWhich is the tendon behind your knee I Believe so he's got an e going on one end and he's got the like the hamstring a growing thing going on the other side so you know we'll see but Saturday is a little bit of way ah from what from the game it's obviously game wants tomorrow now but he's had a couple of days to rest that\nI wouldn't be surprised if we see a combination of the two cars they both gave you something in that series ... played well to win in his appear yeah but ... but you got to say you know you you look at the team this year versus last year\nWhen they lost the Houston the same team that we're getting ready to face and you look at what the differences are of course the biggest difference is John Farrell is gone and our score is hair\nOn another one of the big differences you have in Rondonia is this year you didn't have him last year and then of course JD Martinez makes a huge difference as well\nUh and then you know when you go from that just the way they're playing ball or I Love the ... and I love the fact that we're going with three catches on that we did for this last series I wait the option that I gave him if he'd gotten this spot late and you need it to ... to somebody you you didn't have to worry about you know not having a catchy you\nHad three guys that can be other position and I think that was important\nAnd also we use Vasquez um you thought you thought you were going to see a lot of lay on based on how they own you know carry the weight most of the year\nVasquez was hurt Vasquez comes in and actually ended up winning the game ended up hitting the game winning home run or in the last ... oh yeah ... what is you know I mean every button he's pushed essentially\nI have questions about David Price pitching in game two at home in the cold and when when night off this Sunday night a versus pitching them or you know in a climate controlled atmosphere down in Houston and away from the pressure of Boston but we're going to hopefully be able to talk to the the\nUh this morning time caring and get his opinion on that\nI hate to even question our score right now the way that he's pushing these buttons\nYeah no you can't you can't go against them because this is ... ... and those are the players' confidence gives them the confidence by putting them in the slot\nConfidence is that the it's the key you know with my friend ... at the game to after David Price melted like a like a like a cream circle in the sun in the summer on the mound ... in the eighties just absolutely you know devastating home runs Gary Sanchez and Irish and ah\nAaron Judge play in New York New York walking by the red Sox are clubhouse you know they put down in my mind even and I thought you know like set it on the radio this is not the same Yankees team that we saw\nEven a month ago they got ironed judge back they've got this array of weapons in the bullpen they've got Britain got rabbits and they've got ... Chapman they never got to them they only use them in that final game and and why ... by golly they all did their job in that final game but but uh Aaron Boone yet you had to get\nSeverino out of there in game three and you don't go to Lance Lynn a guy that touches the contact\nYou use one of those good arms and your and your your your stop the bleeding right then and there and hope you can get back in the game I thought they had a bedroom tremendous missed opportunity in game three and that thing got away from them in a hurry and before you know it you know\nI think it was seven nothing my six nothing in the fifth inning and even he announces the national announces we're talking about unwritten rules and and you can't steal and you can't ... and I'm thinking to myself\nThis is a playoff baseball game\nAnd you know if they win game on I think that takes a little bit of pressure off of them would be a good thing so I then you see where he goes in game two but it'll be a quick hook you know it was a quick hook last Saturday right and and and then maybe if he tries to get out of the bullpen and yet the poll about quickly I urge you called or if they get these guys by any\nQuestion that's the way it's managed in the ... by corridor derelict described to that I mean\nHe let evolving go seven and why not bullpen arrested baldy with dominant I think failed gets a little deeper this time around you know you guys out of the bullpen and not just tangles that he's coming into the game but I I felt tangled funny was hitting Ninety six Ninety seven\nMiles an hour that's what I was excited about absolutely haven't seen that since July ... sell for him to come back now with a star and reliever parents I assume the shoulders feeling good seems to us found his velocity again tomorrow I mean these pitching match up throwing grenades and these are the match up across the board in this\nPeriod are incredible but you're going to have sale in Berlin show into the game on a Garrett Cole is a great pitcher and he goes up against price and game to ah they\nThey are loaded up we used in the maybe the only team in my mind Cleveland was there as well but we saw them all I mean I couldn't believe all\nBut but the only team I think that matches the red Sox favorably as far as starting pitching rotation goes a cause this this this rosters loaded and then they went out and added presently it'll soon at the deadline or the red Sox didn't make the Balkan ... that we know Houston did and those two guys have been really good\nI think his career he's been injured in a home run in game three against the Indians that come to recipes healthy that lined up even better so\nIn game three against any of that come to ... is healthy that lined up because even better so tough matchups across the board but at the company has to be done\nYeah absolutely ah it's it's this is will get into the best the best and as you said it doesn't get any better than ... Oregon sale and just quickly you mentioned a ... with ... the quick hook on price which I think everybody was happy about it you know hindsight being twenty twenty but\nI Aaron Boone did a great job wondering when team do you look at any of his decisions or some of them in this series I Know some of the New York media probably is critical I was surprised\nI'm In a in a couple of situations with him staying with guys and not getting guys out of there and I go into that it seemed like they had so many weapons in the bullpen and we got to see those in the final game but it was too late\nYeah totally I ... you know there's no question that that according to the better job managing that serious than than owned it I really thought of the big mistakes were in game three but that was still a three nothing game you know we we saw Alex core a poll David Price and game to what it was a three nothing leaving the second inning\nThree not only the third inning\nAnd and it wasn't coming in the cellar and it was really laboring and I was surprised that you know it came out with a four thing that was looking at a load the\nBases nobody out right and then to bring inland fled the last guy to me you got for clothes are\nOut there for guys who are hard throwing yeah our ... who\nBring in Britain bringing the Kansas bringing Roberts and you can chat green get outta that ending with one of your short guy you know then ... the next day and clean it was almost like you were trying to follow the script of of a regular season games this the playoffs can't do that\nHave slow I thought as good as he has been as you're even good and the other team that was the great\nFirst year for a manager a I thought things seem to speed up on them a little bit in the postseason in that short series and and I just thought core handled them all that much better\nI did too and ah we hope that we can keep this going like you said it's almost ballot check in the way he's doing things that you know you look at it and doesn't make sense and then the next day it ends up being the key thing from the you know the key moment from the game or the key player that that you know the key thing so\nAh we're going to keep it keep it rolling and keep our eyes glued to it's going to be tough Sunday night we're going to be doing a lot of flip and I'm sure I here in New England but I'm a big weekend in sports in uh we didn't even touch the Bruins is not enough time today but they're looking good so far\nA nice victory last night over Edmonton and uh\nWe'll get back to business I guess on next week Tom we we think is so much for joining us on a special day here on friday and a ghost outgoing red socks\nThat can be fun settling yeah sun is going to be a great and the Celtics next week opening up a if a schedule a looks pretty good for that because it will be five o'clock game for the socks on that all the Celtics\nI got to be a great we grew in playing great Celtics opening up looking healthy pads Casey on Sunday night like you got to be tough to watch the two of them but socks price\nGets about an hour to earn your trust and that's it and make your decision but if he's getting beat up you can go on over the football game and move on with your life and that's all the all plays out there that was a lot about\nIt absolutely is thank you so much time and we'll talk to you next time next week in pre said the call\nJacob thank you bye now the morning or on the show\nWind Joe I'm doing well how are you\nIn a private school wants is always\nAbsolutely\nWhat's ... what's your first take this morning we just saw we just talked to our special guest Tom can we run a little bit of a Red Sox ride but there's so many so much ground to cover here we got a\nUh probably well easily the biggest game now a\nOf the year you know they kind of get bigger as they go by dispatch Casey game shaping up to be a big match up a this could be an AFC Championship preview maybe a little bit too early to say something like that but you never know uh I Wish that that game was on at the same time as baseball as we were just talking about but um you know we were on\nAn embarrassment of riches right now will be here we go to a hockey team that looks poised to compete at least to be a one of the best teams in the east Celtics are predicted to be going to the NBA Finals at the red Sox the series away from the world series and now the patriots are well the patriots what's with are getting you know when this morning\nI think the patriots let's let's talk about Joe and right you had ten days\nYeah\nL A healthy I guess is that now he's better than a crack house care or destructive or whatever that says\nThis way yeah I don't know about that but yes\nI don't know about that but I think ah you know at the patriots our favorite Sunday night and I think that's for a reason because they've had ample time they've had that many by after that it ain't apple escape to kind of prepare get right and I think that extra\nTime will benefit the patriots remember last year the chiefs came in on opening night and just pulled away from the patriots and the fourth quarter ... wanted nothing in the fall if I've ever served in Iraq and you are right there was there was not a lot of film on that shift here at that time\nI think this I felt as if I felt so freaked out or\nTo our homes and calcium hell and all the other wild weapons at a Kansas City has this this whole on\nI was a shootout anyway for didn't want to thirty five on a study and I doubt I doubt it I think it's just got to come down to go as a condition team are better conditions team in the fourth quarter to a with maybe a vital onslaught\nThey agree with you I was listening to someone else this morning that was given they're taken when I think I'm\nA lot of people off the getting and it's not to take any credit away from ... homes I mean here's a rookie but he did was there last year behind Alex Smith so we know that he got to see the NFL game obviously he wasn't in there playing until the last game of the year which ended up and I know you remember this but there was actually like a quarterback\nControversy almost going into that playoff game he played the last game of the year\nAnd I think it came out like before kickoff that the chiefs are going to try to treat Alex Smith or whatever it was but they knew they had the guy but I look at him kind of like he's still a rookie and yes he's impressed me with what he's done so far\nBut it's still a rookie going up against ... Jack and as it was pointed out again and I think you did a already in this call Donald checks had ten days ten days three extra days to prepare for this guy the patriots with the mini by\nA chance to get a little bit healthy after that\nThursday night game and yes um time to look at tape and die if you remember which I Know you do and you referenced the games Kansas City was was I'm the same path as this last year with Alex Smith Alex Smith was I Believe considered to be in the front runner for the league MVP through five or six weeks last year\nAs Kansas City got off to the same hot start and this is about the point where they hit the hit the wall so we're going to have to see what happens this time maybe it'll be different\nI don't think defensively they're good enough I'm watching them in that then the game a couple of weeks ago Denver ... again back to them Denver should've won that game and they ... you know move the ball on them\nI feel like you shoot out a the better condition team may me when I feel like I'm ... like I said what the extra time to prepare can slow them down enough it's going to be up to ... cents to make please which brings me to um [noise]\nYou know the situation we have now with Edelman back Gordon we saw already dynamics that that can bring so it's got to be um it's gonna be a battle it's going to be in ...\nIn the dynamics that that can bring so it's going to be um it's gonna be an adult it's going to be an exciting game I was baseball wasn't on at the same time\nYou know that's kind of a bummer that people are going to be switching back and forth about base it's not like a ... a like a best buy or so I Try to give away like two television or something or to a program like that or\nMaybe entice people to go off by TV because there's no you definitely need to television side by side you do you do it ah\nI think the key player from each Joe and then Sunday night's game as a child that noise and I say this because homes as a as a two way threat in terms of a ... you know he can run and he could pass the ball and we've seen this already a couple of times with the patriots this year going up against a\nAllen I mean you you can have all the ... in the world the Yankees and the Indians are both out I Know a we're going to have our eyes glued to the red Sox image patriots this weekend but I Know talking locally that are ... high school has got a big football game coming up this week\nYes they do that down in Middletown tonight to track you Barco express I thought like recall going\nA picket tomorrow I think a ... on a one socket match up of three and one division two teams are could be looking at whoever wins that work at home and a quarter mile around a wire a short high school football that's if that's hard to believe it was only three weeks left\nSynchronized that I it's absolutely amazing what you think about it just feels like they just started a\nWell a ... or I have a better idea I think after this week at the start to question playoff spots and everything so it will be a very interesting scene where the playoffs start to falter place but a lot of plenty of coverage here in the papers of the times and the call so I keep it a walk right here\nWe always do everybody got to check out the ... times Brennan McGahn great stuff great articles local stuff national stuff well we had always has his finger on the pulse quick question Brennan I'll put you on the spot\nMuch more likely to happen David Price as a tone slow his playoff demons and comes out and spends a gym Sunday night or Patrick my Holmes continues this crusade and lights the patriots up at home in Gillette Stadium on Sunday Night Football which one of the two you think is more likely\n[noise] I I Want to have faith in price I don't know why me too and I feel like a that's a I feel that he's actually Joe and ah I say this because records\nSo he got the monkey authors back yes the other night and he got his first playoff what Chris Sale yes you got to play off one as well I think\nIt's time for a profile of ever that a trial for it to a to come through it you know what that is ... Sunday night that's reduction\nAbsolutely ... we forget about everything everything everything if he comes out and and and not know Brennan I'm just thinking about the possibilities whether it's Houston and if we can get by whether it's Milwaukee or or LA if you've got a price in sail boats going\nBoth going the way they can be going and then you've got anything anything like what Nathan above the was like in anything like what Possuelo was like\nOh gosh that we're going to be tough to stop with this off and so it's it's exciting for everybody and we're always excited to talk to you thanks giving us some great stuff this morning thanks for your time and we'll keep our eyes to the paper we look forward to talking to you next week\nUrging plus you have a great weekend you do the same I ...

football with us let's get to a demand that had broke Twitter yesterday we got a huge Twitter a post yesterday from well let's get to know\nA good morning my friend you're on the joke show\nOh Joe good to be on with you it's a rainy friday but you're alive any up the day\nI'm trying to be lively on a on a rainy friday and I'll tell you what a this game just keeps getting bigger I think by the day ah we we kind of knew this was going to be a showdown a few weeks ago the way things were looking I think ah you were among the uh the few that that kept calm when the patriots struggled a little bit with Jacksonville in Detroit\nThey seem to have rated the ship and a lot of areas are obviously there's still a lot of cleaning up to do\nOn this will be a big test on Sunday but as I said earlier a with one of my good friends burning McGarry covers sports for the ... times I you know build dollar check ten days to prepare for an opponent this is a rookie cornerback I Know he's not technically a rookie second year\nOur first guest starter and this is a guy that's coming into um which not going to be a it's not going to be like arrowhead stadium coming into ... next week this week\nYeah uh you know I think it's a big game but I think uh\nYou know I think people are I don't know carried away isn't the right word but you know Kansas City is five and all of that place while at ... gotten a lot of publicity but you know I read it this week at a at using the fly again but you know Bill Parcells used to say don't for them and catching yet I\n... at some point a ... there's going to have a bad game is going to face adversity um I think he's gonna be a good quarterback in the late but I just thank God you know they you know I think they're starting to make it like this is an ... patriots I predict seven to one thirty one twenty seven I think all go play well but\nYeah I think this is the best off and the patriots the white so far I think right now are you from the rams probably have the best off a football at least just ugly so yeah it's a big test for the bad but I mean the eat that there's going to\nAsk do you know get some stops the last two regular season games they play last year on opening night or a Thursday night they lost pretty handily and then two thousand or gain the game when everyone thought the patriots run was over 'em\nWhen they lost forty one more game in Kansas City so whatever people forget it two thousand Fifteen the patriots determine lay off the Gillette so Adele attract overall when you look at the eagles um and uh you know when you look at you know he had to read with eagles on the cheap spell check his hat or a pretty good steps against them\n[noise] yeah I agree points um this is a I Would not that playoff game a where there was no unbelievable ... a circumstance I guess series of events weight in that game with the clock management\nI think the worst thing to do is give Kansas City any quick scores so you don't want to give them any long passages you if they're going to score you want to make them making eight nine ten minute drive you know well if they're running out of it that way or limit the number of points just by the car\nAnd I don't feel that they can score so I got you\nThat's what I think I think you want to make sure our hill a deep red or take away from any big place let's just talk because there are three ways you can beat you can beat you\nWith a long pass deep he can be too with the um the jets sleep where he gets the bond goes around and you can be what the slip screen where he's taken a yard so they're gonna have to watch for ill because he can uh you know you don't want to give up to big touchdowns damn they'll really put your behind the eight ball\nYou know you make a really good point I hadn't thought of and and I just when you referenced that Superbowl against the rams I thought of that and remember what the line one for that game and there's no way they have a chance greatest show on terms and I remember looking at the clock and thinking wow\nThis game's going really fast when in reality the game really wasn't going fast but it was exactly what you said\nThey will conceding those two or three on runs and and even though the the rams were on the field like you said it wasn't you know boom boom too quick passes in there in the end zone and they've only taken a minute and change off the clock if the patriots can do that obviously like you said the clock is their friend they can limit the number of possessions the chiefs have\n'em and obviously the more you're on the field percentage wise the more there is a chance that moms could make a mistake and throwing the ball over\nEither with a tip bombing in inception of fumble things can happen so I I really think that's a that's something I haven't heard from anybody else this week but I think maybe that's something that they'll do what I mean the one\nDifference the one difference is is the rams first town really talented office I don't think they had a player as the net as dynamic as I recall certainly that or a receiver stood itself a\nHill and do a lot of doing wrong and then I didn't become like a running back so I think that's the one\nThing but yeah that Rahm Super Bowl they get us actually could see the run was six Seventy five cents a back several the whole strategy was you know beat up the receivers if they had a um at the receivers you know take away the crossing routes wearing them over the middle\nAnd then make take away Marshall Balkan the passing marine hunters Jordan is not martial law in his day\nSo ... yeah and as far as um the uh Kansas City defense do you think the patriots will be able to I think there'll be able to score on them I'm not sure what kind of approach we're going to have a in terms of what we just talked about defensively ah with with you know limiting possessions for Kansas City\nOr the patriots have shown you know different things on the cost of the last few weeks that they can do and obviously this is another week with ten days now are back for Julian Edelman and the Josh growing and project continues development\nDo you expect to see anything that we haven't seen from the patriots or whatever the Kansas City shows them no no I don't blame the best strategy\n[noise] yeah I think um Kansas city's defenses given up a lot of yards\nTo your ballot check pointed out this week some of it's been and garbage time so you know the defense of stats are very good mhm on area they are good is on their balance I think that the patriots you know it's important they'd be productive on first and second found out what don't you say that about but I think that uh I I think that that's the key I think the ... the depth\nThat corner is questionable so I think\nI wouldn't be surprised to pay to go up tempo hurry up [noise] um you know their defensive line is active\nChris Jones had an interception for a touchdown last week of the first half against Jacksonville on a screen pass mhm so I think you know a James whites of this we gotta be careful when you're running screens against them they're very opportunistic so that's one area but I don't see any reason that\nThe patriots or can't score on on this defunds idle idle I mean I I don't think they're as bad as their number say but I don't think overall they're much better than an\nAverage ... so yeah I think they can score on his defense and so if they can\nYou know thinking all Kansas City to twenty four points they win the game\nAnd that's kind of when I was thinking around\nThat range and and the patriots don't blowing all by any means but the patriots able to score a moron I that was kind of the direction um now I was meaning in looking at it but um again you know\nIt's it's a ... it could go so many different ways it's tough to hide it and you look at Kansas City meeting at this isn't on a statute or on people will just a a gut feeling\nI'm kinda glad in a way that um that they had the game that they had last week I didn't I didn't expect them to uh to win that way against Jacksonville even though they were at home\nBut as a patriots fan as a patriots follower of the team looking at your opponent I don't know if they're going to get 'em if they're going to read the newspaper clippings so to speak but\nAh they're coming off of the huge wind beating a Jacksonville defense that maybe I gave too much credit to and they're coming in here with this hot young quarterback these the talk of the league and when we sat out just to reiterate don't check with extra time to prepare it's a home game\nAnd as he as you put it at the beginning of our conversation then I treating it like it's anything different you know they're not they're not going to build this up into this you know special event or while they're practicing all week so I think um you know it's the perfect storm for Kansas City to come in here and get humbled and whether or not that happened to ... yeah I agree\nWith that I I just think\nI mean I Am a homes I mean you know he's not Joe Montana yet I I don't know you know five games I mean at some point he's gonna\nHe's going to play it back and look he's all go he's got a very good arm them eight dollar check joked that he can throw it out of the stadium but\nThat's not I mean most quarterbacks and yet a foul have good arms I think he has better but yeah I think you know they can view is hamlet some coverage is I mean look if they could to us Peyton Manning at times I think of is Patrick ... my\nAnd I think the key is you know limiting hail and Chelsea and then I mean look what is a good receiver by watching is not going to be\nI think the two guys that can really be to our calcium ill or that that I think should be the focus of the game plan on I'm sure it is\nIt's going to be a it's going to be exciting I I\nI don't know why don't make a prediction on the score I think we we pretty much kinda diagnose what we think is going to happen but um one guy I'm just reading through your stuff too wide Adrian ... up to this point really not getting anything out of him no sack so far this year\nYeah I don't know what it is I mean he's working hard he's always in the way from a day you know he's a good guy I just don't know if you know you know he's thirty that's all her head assault player now especially a fast rush or a receiver a running back is almost all for everybody except the quarterback and\nAnd ah yeah I mean maybe he saw the I mean it's numbers were inflated last year round at night and have sex but six of those cameras are six and a half\nOf those game against a game against Dallas or they were playing a backup left tackle\nYou take that out and you know but I still expected more I mean I I don't I'm not so I don't think the fed says ah you know I'm not sold on this the best but you know I don't think it's very good but but it does play better at home you know that's the reason to be and also as any defense plays better with a lead another reason if\nThey can get out on a\nOf Kansas City yeah it's just nice to see more place\nAnd get out on a of Kansas City yeah just a nice to see more plays out of this ... he did have a script sack script or upset but step of the receiver a an arm and a you know but it was nice to hear the interception of one of their pre say you know\nWhen it didn't it say I don't think the more place back there would be good I mean 'cause even you know an old ones are all or you know I always thought the Steelers defenses or better or all those\nYears there are ... because they give up your yards but what made the ... there are a little better on down there always during the red area\nJournal there's a whole field goal and also they would make some clay you know very opportunistic\nForcing turnovers you you go back through all those great teams and and all of those big games there always seems to be a moment where they were able to come up with the interception of ... you you said in a talk about your tweet from yesterday and I got all this attention on\nWinter I Know twenty five thousand years I I couldn't believe it I I just you know I saw every one I Do these videos I saw everyone else shooting or\nA you know indoors I thought it would be fun just to shoot outdoors in the rain and it was a down or is that I'm ... I guess people really liked it it was only forty five seconds and uh that's all Twitter allows you and I knew videos on my stories are usually anywhere from a minute to minute how\nTwitter only allows forty five seconds and I think it was forty eight seconds and I and I normally would have reached shot it but the rain was coming down so hard against that\nPost that I think it's good and I don't know in like twenty minutes opposed to that six hundred years and now I don't know I check the score as twenty five thousand people really like you never know what's going to catch on\nYou never know what's going to catch on low and not you know obviously are you do great work I'm I'm reading all the old stuff since we uh we began talking this year when I met yeah camping or you're really ah get down to the brass tacks of it so to speak you get into the real\n... and the nuances of the game and not you can also talk with um you know with the casual fan that that maybe doesn't have the you

going to be there from one to three so stop by get a chance to meet Bob Flanders who's challenging judge Flanders challenging Senator Sheldon Whitehouse\nFor that Senate seat at the east Providence ... club and I've never been here but it's located at nine here wrote in east Providence from what in the state and you look at the map when you go over the highway it's right along the east Providence waterfront\nSo if you're coming from you know you go over the highway through Providence and all of a sudden you get into east Providence and then when you get there are both there it is in fact\n[noise] and at\nThat time we don't know where in Rhode Island bar near plans to live I Am working to figure that out but he does have to register as a sex offender and tomorrow the will meet with his probation officer reporting live in rocks in the south than the gal NBC's hanging up\nYou know think about that folks of all the places right not going to Disney World where are you going to live on I'm going to go live in Rhode Island why governor ... should enough see this is a problem with the progress is with the Democrats left\nThis is the problem that is taken over what why is if we need that criminal sick dirt bag\nMoving into the state\nLook at what is going on nordstroms is leaving ... left the paw socks are leaving who's moving endured island\nThis guy who's a a sex offender or child rapist whose been locked up for Thirty years if we had a real governor a real governor would say I don't want that guy coming in here let him go live somewhere else let them go live wherever\nOn an island with other pedophiles and other rape is so but we don't want him coming here\nI mean how how is this possible ... that's where he's going to go live it's been living in Massachusetts because the laws here are not as strong as they are in Massachusetts what is happening so\nI don't you don't you think we would do you think you have a right to know if this guy's going to live in your neighborhood based on everything you've just learned and heard about it\nSo\n... why why would he come here in why isn't the governor responding to this governor among do I'm telling you folks this is another example\n[noise] that\nIt's the illegals they allow in or it is the pedophiles in the sex offenders\nThat these are the people that they will come in with open arms and you the taxpayer your the one that then they're chasing away your the one\nThat in fact that they are um are you know giving a hard time to end discouraging how many people listening right now I Know of people that leave the state moved to Florida\nI'll tell you this governor among do I I don't care who wherever you\nAre the only person that should get a boat is a person that can beat her\nPeriod she is going to do nothing you think it's been bad dispersed for years somebody tell you all over the next four years you're not going to recognize the state\nAfter governor among do finishes after the next four years every progressive liberal idea that she wants to put forward she's going to put forward illegals will get driver's license\nThat that she wants to put forward she's going to put forward illegals will get driver's licenses she wants to go with every progressive agenda that will help her boom with her run for the White House if Gina Raimondo is elected on November six and I want you to pay attention to the calendar\nSo today is friday October twelve\nSo you have the sixteenth is on Tuesday the twenty third and then the thirtieth\nAnd then the next Tuesday\nIs November sex so there's basically there's three weeks left or the campaign and then you have the Monday and Tuesday is election day the only thing that people should be working towards\nIs eliminating Gina Raimondo from being governor again for four more years because she is making promises left and right\nWait to see the things that she's going to put forward and it's all going to be done to try to submit that liberal progressive left extremist base to help her in a run for the White House and we're going to be the brunt of it\nSo people can vote for whoever they want I'll tell you exactly and I've been saying this from day one who am I supporting whoever can be Raimondo period she cannot get above\nForty three percent forty four percent max can't get above it and I don't believe that poll that came out yesterday makes no sense at all to me a poll came out yesterday that has trailer with Seventeen percent I I just I don't believe that\nChannel twelve had a poll that had trouble with six percent channel twelve had a poll that had fellow at seven percent\nThe Providence Journal came out with a poll ... percent and then a website who basically is for sale and buy for sale I mean it's like they're willing to uh you make a certain donation and maybe we can get your good coverage\nHas him at Seventeen percent I I just I I don't know enough about that poll I just I don't trust that poll\nI don't trust that poll I think it's a very close election but the last three weeks of this campaign I think it should be focused on\nVoting out Gina Raimondo that's the only thing that matters people going to vote for you can vote for whoever you want\nNo one's saying that people can't run no one's saying you know Arlene violent wrote a column Joe drill oh has a Democrat right to right now one thing it doesn't have a right to run but how does that help people\nPeople can criticize Cranston mayor Allen phone but if you break this out in their head to head match up phone when if you want this I Can't say it any clearer you want Gina out which I Do\nPhone could win period\nHead to head phones when there was one poll that shows troll oh within striking distance of Gina Raimondo\nAnd anyone that it's been paying attention every time Joe ... we've had on the show many times\nAnd I've had him and his lovely wife Marilyn fill in for the but every time that Joe ... opens his mouth he goes after criticizes end bangs mayor phone\nSo this is going to be a decision for the voters if you want Gina Raimondo well then you you have two choices either vote for Troy low or vote for Gina Raimondo\nBut then you can't complain as a matter of fact\nIf you're not going to vote for ... you might as well just vote for a month ago\n'cause she's getting the boat anyway so you might as well at least just gave her the vote because that's who's getting the vote\nRight it's just like a broker situation if you want to change governors which I Do I think the last four years have been terrible and I think it's time for a change\nThe one person that can beat her is Cranston mayor Allen Fung period the rest of this stuff is foolish this channel twelve comes out with a poll\nIt shows joke trailer with six percent and Patricia Morgan or goes on Facebook and says Joe ... is the only person that can be ... well\nI I don't even know what to say to something like that right I mean and again if you're a sports fan\nIn its ... it's we're entering the we're in the fourth quarter here right we're in the fourth quarter ... anyone I'm not saying if you're down\nOr if you're down five touchdowns right and you're in the fourth quarter of a game the patriots that down thirty five points and you're in the fourth quarter\nYou have to get a first down you have to start to get some points on the board I I'm not breaking any news here so now if you're in the fourth quarter\nAnd your true scores down right patriots down whatever eleven by eleven points ten points or touchdown you're in the game\nBut in the fourth quarter if teen trailer was down thirty five points for Patricia Morgan to say Joe trailer was the only person that can be Gina Raimondo well he beat you\nI I don't know I mean it just starts the border and lunacy a little bit but I'm a sports fan you do it was very exciting when the patriots came from behind and beat the falcons and the super bowl it was even though Mark Wahlberg and other people wrote it out but\n... anyone that is a sports fan knows it starts to become very crucial when you get the ball and you have to get a first down you can't keep punting\nOr you can't keep getting penalties at some point you have to start to move and when you get the red zone you got to put the lights on the board seven six six Thirteen eighty\nGood afternoon you're next on the John ... show hello\nGood afternoon John Steve ... either Steve Happy Friday go right ahead\nEthics friday John as you are\nHere can only do agree with that totally disagree with that okay we just an\nI ... I Can't think of all and I can make that never read any way I Want I\nDisagree with that we can only only disagree but I'm at a point to in twenty sixteen\nThe candidates have internal polls and the President Trump's internal polls showed him\nThat he still had a lot of support and he had a chance to win Pennsylvania Michigan Wisconsin and Minnesota and uh the Trump internal polls proved to be correct\nAnd and twenty fourteen Healy the moderate party put them up he jumped in he's run before people I've known him and then he went and rocketed and then it ended up with twenty two percent and came in third\nBut I just don't recall\nAnyone ever running out of spite I just I don't remember anything like that and I'm trying to think\nI I mean I maybe you could go back in Ninety two Ross Perot costs President Bush the election if you take Ross Perot out of that race Bill Clinton is not the president\nPresident Bush number forty one he gets two terms he won an eighty eight is vice president uh after you've been the vice president for President Reagan and then he would have won in Ninety two if you take Ross Perot out of the mix\nSo but I've never I'm hearing this just from so many people they don't understand why ... Patricia Morgan seems so intent\nOn destroying Cranston mayor Allen fund and people say this to me repeatedly they want they seems they want to beat him more than they want to be Raimondo and I don't have any answer for you\nI don't I Know there's all conspiracies and theories but I don't\nSeven six six Thirteen eighty good afternoon you're next on the John ...\nHello corrupt either journalism career yes go right ahead\nOr you know drunk trailers are for carnival Barker well\nHere's your here's your two girls are better you're generating long ago as a strep throat or going to ... two years ago a hundred and fifty year and this is what it has to do a you know through a a on their back to work to share\nA magistrate position well those are only ten year terms she did get it in June of twenty sixteen so it's eight years from now the magistrate position would end\nUp having to look for this one or two for her and you also have to return for the general inland or it's very clear or ... or or your fingers personal run them early settlers out of his mouth and around ... owns fine\nYeah I Know the motivation but it's hard to come away from anything other than that\nThat um I ... I never hear him criticize governor ... do I don't do I mean I I never hear Joe ... criticized governor among do in what I don't understand is let's just say you and I was sitting with him\nAnd he wanted to run and be the governor well\nYou know the way to do that is to knock out the governor she's the one that is not like she is the one she is the seventh least popular governor the United states she is lower approval ratings\nYou would think that he would be pounding her left and right with the tax in order to boost himself but instead every attack is directed at Cranston mayor Allen fog\nOr is it just run into affairs for journalism do you know it's going to happen to come and go and then right after ... ... sixty four you're in Florida\nI don't know what to make of it I don't other than I've never seen an election like this where people seen this this was not going on um [noise] even if you go back to the primary of twenty fourteen with clay pal angel ... and governor among do\nAngel tobacco virus could have beat her in a in a one head to head match up when the teachers union recruited clay Pell they basically sabotaged angel ... but I don't think it was done on purpose I actually thought they thought that clay Pell could win but for whatever reason if you notice\nEven when Patricia Morgan appeared with shrill oh at the endorsement\nAll they started doing was criticizing Cranston Marilyn ... and and for the life of me I I don't understand that in any way\nHum are troll and Patricia rather than the other person or an analyst but goes down on them or if it's really emerged to find\nWhere the ones that are going to lose on this whole thing\nRight no question yeah because because it's very simple you have a very unpopular governor in the form of Gina Raimondo and if I were the third party candidate first of all if I was ... I still don't understand why he didn't run in the Republican primary because it's open and anyone could have voted\nAnd I've asked about this none of it in his explanation does not make sense he says he needed Democrat\nAre Trump voters that would vote for him but you know in Rhode Island the primaries are open so anyone could have voted so they could have crossed over in voted in that primary much like many\nDemocrats are like Trump but at the unaffiliated voters like eminent affiliated voter they could have voted for him in in the ... in the primary but what I don't understand is you have Gino who so unpopular\nThat to me the way to move your number's up would be that he just does a full assault on her to knock her down and play into all the people that don't like are not going after the guy that's number two\nI I don't understand the strategy in any way I don't it's mystifying and Morgan goes along with the whole thing and then Arlene Violet jumps on the bandwagon I don't\nAnd with the whole thing and then Arlene Violet jumps on the bandwagon I don't I don't understand any of it I really don't and I wish I don't have an answer there's a lot of speculation out there there's all these people that are saying what you're saying of different deals and so forth but I um I don't know what\nThe answer to this whole thing is it's a very thank you for the call it's a very very odd election folks it is with three weeks ago\nSo seven six six Thirteen eighty seven six six Thirteen ...

of property tax rules that until the ... the other one incidentally I heard a clip on the news on W. on our eye where\nSteve ... was talking about the smell of a plant and he said about all of the pipes underneath the streets that are needed replacing\nWell let me tell you something he's right as far back when I was on the council we were told that those types of a hundred years old a hundred

well guess what it's under those those roads\nPipes that bloody nose roads it's like building a house on a swamp but no foundation because instead of doing thirty five you should have got eight but changed the pipes\n\nThat's the way it's supposed to be done my friends\nBut now see that road we did see you see a nice a nice and slow that is\n... ... when the pipes break and you've got to start digging up those same roads okay and they will be dug up if some of not already because of that system and because of the tremendous leakage of in the pipes\nThe water that comes in for a storm and to

way\n\nAnd right across the river from it they built on a military ... armed forces part they just put up a big sign and they just put up a beautiful a fencing Big M\nTimber\nI don't know what I paid for that but that's not a city that's not the city or a ... that's ... ... veterans council and I don't know how I don't think that veterans counselor that kind of money\n\nSo somebody's paying for that unless those kids that the random for the bus scouts or they raise money and for that\n\nBut uh the signed was a place that was hit by a car apparently a truck and now they they gotta do to take a pack but not that thing down that's by the way it's beautiful and the goal Trump shrubs there somebody had to pay for that\n\nBut you're going to have an event there and not upset takes place and it

street\nSince we're in the street again\nIt's on a right for you to get to the shell station coming out right it's just a side street before the show station on your right side that I think it was a lot of street\nOh I I was shocked I Know I Know who you're talking about\nAnd that was a sign that said Laura street but when they kept telephone pole down I guess they took it down and I don't know someone stole the sign or if they uh guess didn't put it back up if they're going to change the name of that state 'cause we set a new homes\nWho I think I think that they are changing a ministry that prompted you if that's the entrance to the new homes\nAnd came to new and kind of lake in to the new home is further down you know where they're they're building and they got those island cones and everything now yes\nSo I think that's going to be an escape did they just said that's going to be a new history but the other state which is how old is too and I don't know if they're going to change your name was or someone took a sign 'cause there's no sign saying the name of that state\nYou know they put up a new telephone pole I had taken it down and they didn't put a sign back up but so I don't know if they're changing that steak or someone just stole the sign because there's no sign as saying what state it as\nA but the other many of them as\nIt is houses on state and you can go to buy that state and then a new and can say hey that's gonna be a new state you know where the building\nWhere they were asking whether they were in the road and they got the orange cones and everything\nWell one thing that can be sure of the ... name anything without the city council\nOr they can't own\nComic keep it the same name but I don't know where to find someone coming looking straight they find it because if I go on I don't know what happened to the sign\n... street his own that that's the property that's any street I assume\nHey okay so they can just change the name of that you\nKnow they can the new one if they own a property they can they can uh the name it and then the city accepts the name\nI think that said that one down yeah yeah so this state I think someone just to sign or they didn't bother putting it back up and I think someone took I was on the ground and soda is if someone looking for a lot at stake and I find it because it some out of\nTown is on the sign they're saying the name of the state you know I found that state and everything and it was that I knew I was there will be able to come out by that state or the other street that they're making you know\nI'm surprised that the homeowners on a street have not called city\nI'm not complaining right Gina science going somewhere\nCould've taken it or I don't know if the city took it away or someone stole it you know but I don't care if they have in our company coming from out of town or somebody's looking at but I think somebody is looking for that state a diamond jail they won't find it 'cause I signed on\nYou know like the rescue yeah rescue ... at that time what they're asking what has to go there if I got in that state were you when you call\nWell I Would because I don't know until you're sort of I don't remember where Mara street was\nThat side state but there are signs gone into it I stopped by a bus stop sign is a sign of the street is gone you know\nI don't know maybe someone stole it to you know maybe they don't realize is going on\nWith or without a pet telephone pole\nAd but see they took down and they put a new telephone up and they get on the ground they didn't bother putting it back on so I think one light a ticket you know\nOK okay\nStart because they never think when they put him up they would put him back on it but they didn't\nOkay you know but\nIf anybody knows the rescue or anything you know I go there I guess they have a math and everything that I find it but it it'd be better if they put a sign that I don't think\nThat's why we have signed on every street\nI if I got to say I would I Would call about it but I don't live on that state so\nI agree you know the arcade and all it took out by by by\n\nSo large pizza would mushroom and

socket northern Cumberland\nEastern when socket northern Cumberland or if you don't know Michael very going to get to know him in this segment or so I guess we'll start off with some basic stuff about yourself who is Michael very\nAh that's such a complex question [laughter] so\nWe talk about that the first thing that comes to my mind is military service on third generation military and we were talking about that before the show began between my grandfather my mother my father my wife and myself wow that is a hundred years of military service\nMy wife and myself as a hundred years of military service\nWell thank you and your family\nUm my wife has actually been in for Eighteen years and has to combat deployments so she's got the the big service and the family um and I was going in for Fifteen Years now and I'm In the reserves these days I came off active duty in two thousand and southern\nUm I hadn't gotten a lot of college done because they're shipped out the basic at Seventeen and I kind of turned my life around on that one Seventy thousand seven I went back to college uh got a couple of degrees went down to Florida\nThat are my doctoral work and organic medicinal chemistry actually stopped at the master's level but I also taught organic chemistry University of South Florida for a little while\nOr guinea chemistry [laughter] all the study of carbon already much alright alright I'm all things matter in life are absolutely must be\nSo I've been in the laboratory field my entire time are both in the military and in the civilian world so the laboratory field is think diagnosis Everytime somebody's ever drawn your blood were the ones that find out what's wrong with you do a little less of the testing these days I'm a director at landmark medical center so nowadays I\nTry to provide a little bit of leadership and guidance knew some of those military skill sets that I had\nAn incredible amount of of of of life in in learning that you have been through just incredible uh but I'm looking across the table at I'm In the ... appears younger than I Am a I met at the salute you saw may I ask how old\nIt I'm actually thirty three years old I shipped out at Seventeen I've been in Fifteen Years\nOh well that's a credible uh you've lived Lauren Fifteen Years and some people do in a lifetime [noise] well\nUh I glossed over something so growing up I'm not from here ... um both my parents were active duty military I was born on Fort Stewart Georgia I Lived there eight months and I've never been back\nI went to fourteen different schools growing up I Lived on three continents I got to travel alliance um didn't get to spend much time in one place but the reason that I'm here my wife is from here and we met on active duty\nAnd we went into the reserves together we got married and when my son was born she asked me to move our home and I don't know if you're married but you don't tell your wife now at least\nAbsolutely right I'm actually so we both believe strongly that children should grow up in your family that was an opportunity I never had and so when my wife asked me to move her home I said the only answer I could\nSo suddenly when we see our lack of oversight and the state we start to realize that we're spending our money unofficially\nSo if we start getting that dialed in and start spending it where it actually has the impact it's supposed to spend goes down and if you're spending less money you don't need as much money and if you don't eat as much money taxes get to go down and I don't\nKnow about you but I pay property tax there and when socket and it breaks my back every year so yeah I I Would love to see a little bit of tax relief in this state for everybody because we deserve it because their money is being spent wisely\nAs the voice of Michael very candidate for Rhode Island state Senate district twenties when socket\nNorthern Cumberland or you'll see him on your ballot and asking for your vote today are Michael very uh interesting stuff about the budget\nUm I Know you've been all over the country is you're talking about your your growing up and you ... your military uh parents are in your family now military or any uh conversation undisclosed we talked a little bit above the funding schools or anything further on education in schools in Rhode Island\nIt's a good point I mean I went to fourteen different schools growing up I've seen a lot of ways of doing things good and bad um I tried to learn from each of those sometimes it's even more important to learn from the bad things so you know what to avoid and that is one of the unique things that I bring to the state houses seeing all these different ways of doing things\nUm and as we talk about education again where the tent best funded state in the country per student we found just over Fifteen thousand dollars per student per year ah\nOf the things I'm really happy that we have ten vocational schools in this state\nSo I Wish we had a few more when you think about what a vocational school isn't what it accomplishes not all students are necessarily college tracker college bound and that's not a\nDerogatory thing against them it's just who they are they don't want to go to college I didn't at Seventeen that's why shipped out to basic training\nUm so we have a vocational program you have an outlet for students that may not want to go down that normal course of study and that they can then get a meaningful skill set and jobs and command higher paying jobs right out of high school I'm competitive with living wages that's a good thing\nNow I used to actually be concerned about vocational programs because I thought it was pitching students and not allowing them to attend college so I did a lot of research on it forty two percent of Massachusetts vocational graduates go on to college\nSo it's not at all fair to say that they're not college tracker college bound if they choose to be all those students are add to that again the meaningful employment that they can get right out of high school I don't know about you I can\nAdd to that again the meaningful employment that they can get right out of high school I don't know about you I couldn't have gotten a good job at Seventy\nI'm Still working at W. N. R. I. [laughter] that Roger has a dog with Michael very uh this uh this program interesting conversation candidate for district at twenty and the state Senate continue on Saturday into\nSo we we look at that and then there's always this big fight here in our state about charter schools and they were all academies and these problems I actually um\nIt wasn't a system I was so familiar with I went to a couple of military schools couples civilian normal traditional public school systems but I'd never gone to a public charter program\nSo I contacted 'em both rise marrow academy and Blackstone belly prep and I got to go see some of the uh public charter program specifically BP I'm In one of their elementary schools things that I found that really impressed me\nStudents that you can get over two hundred additional contact hours with their teachers and of course the more time you spend with your educators the better off you're going to be without question\nUm they believe that all their scholars or college bound not a bad message to spend to send ever um\nI was really impressed with what I saw there there's a lot of misconceptions about the way they pull funding away from traditional school systems I Would invite anybody to actually engage in those conversations in clear up those misconceptions I still have some concerns about their lottery they were able to explain their lottery process I'm always\nHesitant when I see that because I think the students that go to the charter programs do gain an advantage\nWhat we're teaching our students is if you win a lottery you gain an advantage that's concerning to me because I don't think that's a good life lesson to teach anybody um\nAgain no I Can't deny that the results are better the contact our addition is a good thing so my mind isn't completely made up on that I look forward to working with the charter programs to to see what they have to offer so\nWhere you are going to uh have about five minutes just the fast is half hour and all the radios ... granted there are some issues that are dealt with that the general assembly level of the house the Senate can be very controversial\nUh we have a a one is in full swing right now are about trucking tolls programs already running extended programs to come in if you have any comments on a trucking tolls and and that impact\nTrucking tolls tie into the business friendliness of our state depending on where you go for your information while it hub Texas at forty at least there's this friendly CNBC puts us at forty fifth least business friendly\nOr what you can agree on we're on the bottom five we punish small businesses in our state and we lose them here in one socket we feel this every day because of the loss of businesses on diamond hell rode in ah\nIncrease in our taxes as a result of that and just the difficulty in getting basic needs met where do you go to go shopping\nSo here we have trucking tools which is you get one more burden to small business one more deterrent from businesses that might have been thinking about coming into our state and the best part is that they tried to go around us well that takes some extra Fifteen minutes\nSo I think it takes an extra Fifteen minutes and save a lot of money they're going to do it we're going to lose yet more business in our state these trucking tolls hurt us every single day and they need to go away\nThe uh other one that's coming into the horizon\nAnd it's been banned it around hasn't been dealt with it sooner or later it's going to be hit and very likely could be this year or it's being looked at a possible a windfall of education of of finances excuse me but also some are concerned about social impact the legalization of marijuana as many or\n... you talked to a minor somebody nice when you say what is easier to get a hold of the regulated alcohol for the unregulated marijuana it's unregulated every time somebody selling something you legally they don't care who they sell it to somebody paid for a liquor licence they care a lot about where that goes because they want to put that in jeopardy\nSo from that perspective if we legalize now suddenly marijuana actually harder for miners to get a hold of and that's a good thing very few people would argue with that Massachusetts we already know where they went\nSo we're going to lose tax revenue because our neighbors are going to drive two minutes up the street are going to buy a Massachusetts that's Rhode Island dollars going out of state never to be seen again that's a mistake\nSo from a revenue perspective because it's already going to be here regardless we're going to lose access to the money and from a public safety point that which is still purchased the league leaders ... components these standards there's no safety for a population we need to legalize marijuana immediately and follow suit with our neighbor or hand has been forced on us we\nWe have a a just a about a two and a half to three minutes here uh there's so many issues that in a very interesting conversation like vote for another half an hour or but I just want to give you a few minutes if you if you want to summarize your campaign and also let people know how they can support Michael very for state Senate district twenty\nWell again seven thousand doors today and I'm not done I still got three and a half

you can support me as well my commitment is to keep going door to door when I\nAsk of each of you to keep having those conversations with me and make me better what I Hope to do if you want to contact

it was in response to another email\nThis email said construction crews seemed to be working a short day on their project on diamond hill road and mend inroad must not be good for businesses in that area and um I I\nYou know go through there all the time so uh I have noticed that a traffic tie ups and probably there are people avoiding that intersection because of it so it can't be all that great for business one\nThing I happened to notice over the past weekend is you know I was up in New Hampshire\nAnd on the holiday both on Sunday and Monday the holiday I saw New Hampshire road crews out doing work both on Sunday and\nOn Columbus Day a holiday that they were out there working\nI was surprised to see that but um\nMaybe New Hampshire's got money that we can't spare I don't know because I'm sure paying state workers to work on a highway projects on Sundays and holidays must\nBe expensive but it is done in New Hampshire and talking about New Hampshire they've got some of the nicest roads [laughter] roads are terrific\nThey've got real good roads nicely paved and\nA rather interesting\nI'm okay this is interesting\n\nThis comes from Ron and it comes from I guess Ross olive oil

look at the pictures of the devastation I mean talk about devastation areas completely flattened I mean there's nothing ... nothing left standing\nFrom the air it looks like ah some of those sites that were bombed during World War two exactly exactly yes uh-huh ... yeah on the left basement of ... ... ... you're up\nRight thank you very much mine mine now maybe you have a comment putting you to say\nHi my I Know that maybe you have a comment putting you to send to my friends good afternoon Iran W went awry\nHello there\nLarry how are you doing what army Vinnie get close to the phone it sounds like you're on the topic I Am\nI'm all the way to turn off All right I'm Talking very good how are you today I Am fine how about yourself\nA lot slower puzzles before but a little poll just talking about flooding so\nYeah um I had a house in St Augustine that you could walk to the Atlantic ocean and four minutes it was on I guess you'd call it a barrier island ...\nWas on the line a beach in two minutes you could walk out the door and the other direction you'd be a niche coastal waterway so it was very close and I had to have insurance flood insurance\nAnd I had to be I guess that\nWas a three hundred and fifty five thousand dollars for an songs was twelve hundred dollars that's that's a long time ago must hundred dollars that was about to ten years ago\nNow that was above and beyond your insurance balanced\nYeah that's besides the regular nearer right [noise] but at the same time my house in to send me\nWas twenty five hundred dollars a year ... ... for regular insurance but part of the regular insurance included hurricanes insurance which was and that was probably about a thousand dollars of that bill mhm\nSo they still charge you one way or another whether there was flooding insurance to hurricane insurance book but insurance was through the federal government insurance would just through your regular insurance mhm mhm but the point I wanted to make is I just told your twelve hundred dollars for three hundred and fifty five thousand dollars a\n... a flood insurance ...\nMy ... my office in one sock it is on the second floor of the plaza center building merit glass\nBlowing it plans to send to always forget the official name of that building [laughter]\nYeah [laughter]\nSo because I have a um a business loan and SBA loan that's associated with the payroll perhaps stuff on the federal government says I have to have flood insurance on my second floor unit\nFor my things inside the unit so it has nothing to do with the fact that the building could flood it has to do with being Fifteen feet up\nYeah in the air you had some important isn't of ... but never it never the water's never reached that hide in in ... and he recorded flood in the city and of course we haven't had a flawed\nSince the flood control project was completed the after the flood of Nineteen fifty five I don't get it I ... I really there's somebody else in that neighborhood to another business\nI heard stories where they're paying through the nose for flood insurance because they're in a flood plain isn't there's no real way\nBy four when I first applied for it\nThey came back for the quote now keep in mind them only ensuring like contests where he was thirty five thousand dollars is what they had to ... I was insuring it for\nNow the three hundred and fifty five thousand part I was twelve hundred mhm the thirty five thousand and one socket on the second floor of the president of building was Eighteen hundred\n[laughter] add insult to injury [laughter] my goodness my side of the weight or I I also heard something about this\nAnd I I don't remember if it was a conversation with you or someone else they said this has something to do with the fact that the uh what is it the\nArmy Corps of engineers is upset with the fact that the city of one to sock it does not much maintain the barriers that have been along that blacks don't\nYeah I did tell you that part of it before ... that's the problem is the Army Corps of engineers long and put them on the phone when they did it they did not the city was supposed to maintain that they never did mhm it's been maintained by the Army Corps of engineers again\nAnd now I guess land and they are responsible for the city's not anymore but\nThe fact is they never redrew the floodplains back to what they were originally originally I with the ... flood insurance\nSo if they just put them back after the maintenance was done we wouldn't have this problem ... but just to give you an idea of what happens when you don't maintain it if you go down Clinton street and you get past\nKennedy manner and before you get to the Chinese restaurant and they said it was back there is a small\nArea where water comes from um I\nThink it's the middle of ... ... ... I think right yeah I\nIt comes on and if he tweeted that area between Kennedy man and the other the other land ... about twelve foot wide uh area that is supposed to be part of the flood control project is supposed to be maintaining\nUm the work was done around eight or nine years ago the trees coming out of it are probably Fifteen feet high already ... I'm so no one's maintaining and again\nBut the reality is so by the time the state says or somebody comes around ... redrawing the flood control maps they'll say we can't because it needs to be maintained [laughter]\nYou know and it would be interesting to see a way back when when this was built in the fifties after the flood what was the arrangement I mean uh it is it in writing that the city of one socket is responsible for the maintenance of the six I mean that that's an extended\nProject I mean there's this one can troll runs from miles through the city\nI mean they have the bike path that something they're a cold spring pocketing the whole Lincoln the Blackstone river\nUm um was written basically rebuilding after the flood and you should do well I mean you could ask is should the city be responsible for maintaining them then again if that if it isn't the city who who should be\nA that's a problem that I've had I've called gotten a ... a congressman just the lady's office to try and get it they did manage to get a um\nHave an understanding that I shouldn't immediate flood insurance most of the building my part of the building is in the floods owned by the way or the other section is um they brought him down to a hundred and twenty five dollars but then two years later the\nFederal government said we're going to add a surcharge of controlled insurance flood insurance so they added another two hundred and fifty dollars search on believable do and then the bills started going up each year so it's probably about five hundred dollars a year now\n... but there's no need for me to have it but no one wants to take responsibility and last time I called congressmen only these office\nI'm no one ever go back to me about it it was it was simply you know I don't think anyone knows it's either the Army Corps of engineers that has to redraw the if the state of Rhode Island has to draw them or\nIt's either the Army Corps of engineers that has to redraw them at the state of Rhode Island has to draw them or ... but it's probably not the city of ... and I don't think they're responsible for the bus control maps\nAnd who's the go to person that you should be able to complain to\nWell it's right on TALK I've talked to like the ... very knowledgeable guy ... running all this stuff um the state it was Jack Reid's office that that the Army Corps of engineers to do the work but to me Congress's ...\nHopefully someone in that office find the answer out on the right right when I last\nWhich was several months ago no one ever finally I don't know if they ever really got to make an asshole so they couldn't get back to me I don't know I don't know for the federal government or the state\nSo who knows but flood insurance should there should be areas of the country that no one should be able to go to the program yeah um I don't know what it's going to take you saw that the devastation and handle Florida that was really awful for a very fast moving storm yeah\nUm but you see that happen and things like the red river in the middle of the country ...\nUp north that floods devastated lots of areas and I don't know if they've ever stop the building now or the federal government has to buy them out a and only land so it when it floods will doesn't matter I don't know but for the insurance should be a lot more money\nYou know I Would argue with you there it would be it would be nice to hear more positive comments and a rather than um near the negativity that oftentimes prevails you\nBecause I don't know how anybody in and out and touch dog people all the time he just wanted to I'm and I'm going to come out positive and maybe something can be done and\nIf you want to you know people out there that that complain just sit down on you know just complaining all the time to get up there and help people in and help work and make some things you know you just um I think it was a tendency\nTo think Kennedy and point and I'm doing something for your country I don't think that your country is going to do something for you\nDon't have a lot what your country can damage you but what you can do for your country\nAnd we're only him when I close people\nBelieve that we only have one life to live on this earth so we're going to think of something positive to think about and I one life and not just um complain all the time and I know people sometimes you know why are on the negative side but you really have to think about positive things\nWill fit [laughter]\nSo that's my two cents a day like I don't get people ruffled than men or anything I just wanted to put my two cents a day I'm Glad you did\nAll right and one other thing I'm getting out the volunteer um volunteer you know and it is a wonderful thing and feel good about yourself you do something for your community and I'm not just talking about the stadium theater 'cause I'm a stadium in Iran too but\nUm other things you know uh go to church floating around community go to one of your local long claws and get on the Montana because you'll really feel better about yourself and help somebody at the same time\nWell said well said\nSo hopefully I get to see somebody out there and pollen tearing weather in the ... yet the church or all of the stadium or anything else hopefully I get to see somebody and if you've seen me say hey you went around the mail and I and I'm doing this because you can you tell me to do that so hopefully\nSome of the young they will um take my word\n... hope you put a plug in somebody's ear [laughter]\nYeah rarely rarely feels good to get up there in ... out there in the community and not just sit on the couch of\nAll I can say to you and your husband must feel pretty good because I'll tell you I don't know two people who do more volunteering than you do [laughter]\nWell I don't work [laughter]\n[laughter] oh yeah somebody else and pay the bills in um ... you know we we do work um and everything but you know it's two hours a week you know get out there and I'm On the air and you know the two hours that you're not watching a TV show or something like that you know helping other people\nWell I Hope I commend you and your husband for all the time you get the stadium theater\nAnd I know and I know a lot of people you know work up there and had two and three or four jobs just to make ends meet and then they get home and that tired and you know and then that day and you know the families with kids I Know it's very hard for people to do that but on the people that can do that I'm just get out there and I'm\nNo ... you know it could be any way that it could be at the church it could be a community center and could be on the needy or could be you know ... no one could be a ... pack it couldn't be anything just get out there and help you come here in the\nWorld 'cause you know if you if nobody does them with us we'll be mhm good uh that's it\n[laughter] All right well thank you for the call\nOkay and I want to hear something positive ...\nWell thank you for the call okay and I want to hear something positive All right we'll see what we can do about that [laughter] thank you yeah by now am I\nRight well said and I'm ... and the musical at the stadium happened to be there this morning it was a show put on for schools\nThat were over seven hundred students at the theater this morning\nThey got quite the production I have to say and uh she mentioned the costumes the sets the dancing in the full orchestra I mean it was so well done a check it out in its tonight at seven\nThirty tomorrow night seven

coast buddy fiancee and they may be on for politicians we where we sure will some day after he gets\nWell he says he's innocent unease and just to defend himself in court these all these charges a phony charges he's done a good job is not resigning and um I I guess he's going to defend themselves\nThat's what most politicians such that you can tweet us ... many of the bill and Hillary Clinton\nNow we've had some interesting people over the years haven't we huh [laughter] but we also have some good elected officials too so we should the praise them once in a while\nI was ... I'm Still looking for\nYou may not have all the elected officials local state and national you can't find one that you would say that you can say gee I I really rare\nMaybe make a home game well God Bless you believe in it yes yes [noise] and maybe even\nYou know okay well at least a I unfortunately um they're all gone but uh\nAgain thank God for their service right that\n... maybe even Canada mhm well yeah\nI Would say that he went down as a one of our better presidents I mean he certainly had a\nLot of admiration by the American folk during his administration and uh yeah I mean we know a few more things about him now that we didn't know before sort of tarnished his image a bit but I certainly did have is pluses to not perfect then again who is right\nAnd again the president we know ex anybody in the past good\nWell that's your opinions they hope to have well\nI mean even in Rhode Island is that at least a handful of people ah that think he's doing a very good job but the twenty three percent of Rhode Island is according to the Providence Journal NBC poll think uh they strongly approve of a President Trump socio\nFifty nine percent seem to\nUm well actually fifty two percent strongly disapprove and seven percent somewhat disapprove and then I find that I'm not sure at all what was the one\nThat makes Fifteen Percent [laughter]\nYou're right [laughter] or\nThe most of us think around we voted for Hillary ... some of us voted for the Green Party\nThat is true who's running for on the Green Party ticket you remember what it once was\nOh I Know if God yeah I Know it was both\nAgreeing that phone\n[laughter] well they'll be back in the next presidential election will be who he is the way when you're thinking\nAbout that either way of the governorship for governor and lieutenant governor moderate party candidates\nMm So am I\nWell I give you credit for voting because we uh as I said earlier in the program about one third of the ... of Rhode Island is don't bother to vote though\nTo know if they don't\nWell that is true of voting no\nYeah yeah but they I I think they also have a responsibility I mean they do have the right to not vote but I Believe we all adults habit of responsibility to get involved in in\n... they want to take the time they go and do it right in for a cap\nOn that they could that's right and then people have done that in the past yes yes\nOh yes that's\nFor sure well listen we thank you for your call and you ... the wisdom okay\nOh it was his most\nOf them right to kill their egos reminding us that today is Columbus Day or is it the\nIndigenous a day or something or other some uh areas some states have changed the holidays name or they don't want to ah give Christopher Columbus credit for anything a rather they want to focus on his his misdeeds yes\nUm I Want to thank Ron for sending me of Google Map of where central boulevard is in Bellingham and come to find out it's not very far from here\nOne fire a man and mysterious passenger or killed ... to pass it with Joe was never identified\nThat's interesting but as a couple of ghost stories about it too because one of the engineers for the train got in a cold sweat it we lived in New York and told his wife he says something you're going to happen and I'm not going to work today\nAnd there's all kinds of stories about it all and then you know one tops it off as soon as it's done we walk right from the presentation to the actual train crash site it's right there on the side of a a\nThompson on the main drag or twelve\nThat is interesting here the history of railroads in this area is a fascinating story in itself how they crisscross just about every community ah well ah in this area anyway in the Blackstone valley and beyond so much rail traffic so many railroads at one time I was a\nGolden era yeah yeah and uh what I like about this I caught just the tail end of this presentation two years ago I don't know what happened but I got there like halfway through it mhm and I kept looking at my calendar and they said we will do that as an even bigger and better the next time\nBut the most important thing on it too is you get in I don't know if you're familiar with Thompson at all or that the all the schools were up on top of a big hill and that's a huge mansion in front of it which was the original high school\nAnd where we're going to have the presentation is on one of the stages that Lincoln and everybody else to talk over the years because of all the males ... and the back half of it is the largest museum in the area

allergy brand Albert welcome to the ball\n[noise] once again thank you fail and uh we look forward to ah hopefully having many participants tonight calling in and are joining with us and uh so [noise] so let's let's proceed alright\nBolger quiet and\nI'll be running for mayor obviously because you think we can make a difference in this next after the election and maybe we should speak some about the difference what your administrator ... would be versus the administration than we have right now\nWell it's interesting uh feel that you would ask me that question because it's just a few minutes ago I met a young man out here in the I'm In the waiting area and handed me a card and he's running for state Senate\nAnd one of the reasons why he's running for state Senate feel is because he wants to promote transparent government he says is instrumental\nIn holding our accountable I Will work to increase government visibility well I think one of the ... one of the reasons why I have declared my candidate for mayor is because I Believe\nIn open on is transparent government and uh he's\nPut it very very nicely here when he says that kind of government bill and ladies and gentlemen is instrumental\nIn holding our accountable yeah otherwise you end up with absolute power and we know what happens when we have that because that kind of power rules abs\nBecause that kind of power rules absolutely and that is something that we need lot have I mean it's\nJust a a ... it's um it's something that we that we shouldn't have\nAnd we have the mayor is low on\n... is one vote he's the executive and up [noise] and he has to work collaboratively and collectively wet\nThe legislative branch of government and too often this administration goes off on its own\nNo no no no I I prefer listening to you because uh once again you were an incredibly articulate and once again you'll know that much of what I just heard the last ten minutes uh I don't agree with but we respectfully disagree and uh if I could just\nQuickly say the highlight of my week was a meeting up with my old friends and that would be filling J. J.\nO. things are going to be over now\nIf I could just interject where you were just saying the most important thing in the city want socket you know and and I listen to your opinion on employees' pension is a man and others and the like in a contractual obligations\nAnd and the market credit union I served and leadership on to sue someone on the most important thing and I think is we have to continue\nTo look for tax savings into lower the cost of living in the bedroom city known as one socket Rhode Island and I know both ears\nWill remember the days back in the late sixties early seventies where people and mash would come new and and I don't say Massachusetts but in in large quantities would come you\nTook that I'm like myself also Framingham okay to ban it sent the general motors to ally container to Texas instrument now are all one sock it was an attractive place an affordable place to live and raise a family would you agree with that\nWell yes and\nWe have lost that we are no longer a bedroom community where people seek to live to live a horrible way to\nPut away for the future and and not just you know I could never live in Framingham at the time I could never living right the market never buy and yet you cross the border and and you could buy an order talk at all and uh\nOver the last three decades we've seen a lot of outside investors coming on socket and basically they ended their head by a ah bars lot of the people it was of themselves and making promises they couldn't keep\nAnd tall and\nHow many times have you seen\nOutside investors literally get eviscerated and Italy even and leave one sock it in a quandary with vacant buildings or how many times really street yeah\nSo when you say that and and we bring up these\nIssues and and I look at a bike path and I look at the desk says and I look at the fact that people don't even want to pay their way whether it's subsidized housing you know we're looking at still\nAnd I know this is a sore subject fulfill even though it's not necessarily a as important to him anymore but the commercial tax rate and the continuation of a homestead exemption you know whoever and and hopefully it's you out of it clearly in our cars you know we all support you very much\nUh we are going to be coming to the conclusion of the fiscal oversee a and I see no reason why the general assembly would leave coal looper there to complicate\nOne socket self governance view no no\nNo and yet right now is is virtually an obstacle and has been to a fiscally conservative city council\nThat has tried to make cuts but under the auspices of the fiscal over share a descendant of the budget commission they cannot make cuts without his approval is the correct also well he ah\nI think that they can\nUh yeah he he does have some oversight over the budgetary process but I I think if they um I I think if they made some program cuts that they um he he would allow it I I don't\nThink like going from eighty thousand let's pick on a lot of time and going from\nIn he would allow it I I\nThink by going from eighty thousand let's pick on a lot of 'em and going from sixty to eighty thousand two shots of half a million okay and where this individual is is literally\nCash to make sure that we maintain a fiscal liability you think we could cut the ... you think he would or do you think he even would have said oh well who much\nKnow what look look look let me just tell you this I mean if we put together a budget that calls for providing the necessary services that we need\nIncluding the legal services and we provide those services at a discount for ... now and he disapproves of that then\nTo have a real problem because that's exactly the kind of thing role and that we are speaking we want to provide let me tell you who let just let me tell you that ... and we don't need these attorneys from Providence they get more\nMoney than our local people they don't do a dime thing that is more effective than we can buy right here and one socket so this is going to stop I can tell you now ruin it will stop\nAnd that's where we looked poetry because everything I've seen and clearly I'm falling as closely as your recently but everything I had heard and even when I make recommendations to a friend\nUh and they say virtually we can't put that trial you know we're still under the auspices of the fiscal all of a ship all over\nNo you're gonna you know you're going to see some significant changes in that it\nLet me tell you it's out of his room playing you know right\nYeah but that's okay it is out of control\nWe will get it under control\nWith mobile or without ... but we'll get it done\nSo going back to why I think that that is the most important common and I said that suddenly I was shown I didn't say it but ... and maybe I did you know the sixty one thousand dollar adjusted uh income per family\nFor the average household in the United states yeah versus ... thirty eight thousand pulling socket yeah now if we look at that that's the average family and let's talk next roughly say\nSeven hundred and twenty five dollars a week and the sixty one thousand is twelve hundred dollars a week okay so we're looking at the disparity between seven fifty and twelve hundred\nDeck and go ... stores and restaurants and pay taxes and contribute toward a more balanced city clearly there's no way in the world\nThat somebody cannot recognize a mistake cannot recognize this this incredible egregious imbalance in in income\nAnd and clearly we have to throw a strong man and a strong city cause which we hope we got an a and a strong majority mall try Sean general assembly\nTo make sure that the state who seeks to continue the burden the city when socket with high rates of a a subsidies takes on more and more and more ... hopefully the education\nOf children to bring them on on our with the rest of the state without\nGiving us big increases in our education budget you know to me that's probably the most important thing there is we have to continue to work on that without more and you said it yourself you just said that several times without burdening the taxpayers\nNot any more than what they are\nNo no we can't do it I I mean it just and we can't pretend rural and I don't know why it is that you and\nHave these conversations all the time and we recognize you know you can develop a solution\nIf you don't press adequately in effectively identified the problem but you don't want I can discuss the problem and develop the solution because at least we recognize and identify exactly what the problem is why is it that others can't do that\nYou ever think about that\n[noise] actually I think about it and I have and and I've been\nI'm not going to say I'm In love with the city I Want to talk of because clearly that's not the case\nBut I got to tell you I've been involved in the city one socket ... very very long period of time and I cannot go anywhere without without trying to take idea as authentic observations and and look at things on why we are different\nWhy we can't have\nYou know the affluence or the balance of some of the humanities what makes it work for them and not work for us so you know clearly you and I think about this all the time and and that was going to be the reason I was calling originally I was in one socket for almost a whole week\nAnd a\nGrab with two hands and run with how we're going to change the city where you have to wait for the city up we're going to welcome business because it's not going to be well what's in it for me\nBut it but the other thing too is look at my age I'm not looking for credit I'm not working for anything so everybody's going to be involved who got an idea that it's going to go back to the Jerry bull she go to Jerry Boy\nGod rest his soul yeah it was the mayor\nI think ah from Nineteen Seventy five to a a buddy is that that was the era that either but when he was the mayor\nI'll never forget this he used the campaign and he always won ... huge plurality but he he used to campaign on\nHis open door policy at the door to his office was seldom ever closed\nHe had an open door you want to see the ... come on and sit down you know talk and and so it's not just about select people having ideas\nAnd getting credit for it it's going to be about people\nParticipating and being being you might say sharing in the success that we achieve collectively the same as autumn fast the same you know having\n... you know it was just so nice to see all a bull Jay you know in uniform are doing is saying and being recognized because I got to tell you I don't ever\nEver recall seeing\nA community the vote tea like Paul Booth J I I don't I I mean his resume is just incredible and but he\nPersonify the kind of participation we're talking about rabbit thought you'll have an idea you have\nA\nSomething you want to share with us that might improve the situation step and tell us what you're thinking and we'll see if we can make it work [noise] so that's a huge difference from what we have now\nYeah and and it's it's you know a lot of people\nThere's two types of people that love buddy fiancee people hate but ... but one of things but he says he had said once okay it's because you get a lot of credit he's on him for the Providence renaissance opening up the river and doing all of\nAnd and he disagreed with that he said the credit is not all mine were if I had any genius\nAt all it was allowing the people who want to do it who knew they could do it by getting into government out of their way and allowing them to be able to accomplish exactly okay so it wasn't funny CNC okay but it was him that allowed\nIt to happen by letting the people who would make it happen make it happen and that's that's all it takes some time says for government to get out of the way to assist where you\nCan bring in bringing in the ... year old a field marshal this call's Albert ... step in and do your thing\nYeah you know and if it works out at being a field marshal I Hope you treat them like you were the French President yeah man I guess I Would have sheets that and say much exactly yeah and and we'll take it because it it's nothing but good you know so um [noise]\nI'll bet it's it's an opportunity that I feel this administration miss recorded been ahead of schedule on it now or a little bit behind but in my opinion time is running out on the city because we're losing the landmark money we're getting closer with the pension OK\nAnd it brings me back to the night\nOf the male whatever you want to call it wasn't really wasn't much of a night but one of the examples one of the points Lisa as mayor tried to make in her closing statement was\nYou know\nWhy would anybody want Albert brain handling a hundred and forty five million dollar city budget municipal budget\nAnd inside of me I'm laughing out loud even though I was polite and I said nothing the question should have been as a as a former financial officer for the city of one socket financial director okay and you sort of the city well in that position\nBut why would I leave a person responsible for this hundred and forty five million dollar budget who either in her former jobs would say how many stance or that you would like Sarah or how much change you need for the drier ...\nThose are the qualifications of a person asking the former finance director for the city of one side is about who's more capable of the budget your understanding of the budget I'm sure it is\nTop notch okay you've handled by just ... as a financial director as a city council person as a president of the city council or\nA been a big fan of your average ingredient for a long time I feel confident that you could handle a budget today um and the budget is not just\nThe administration's it's also the city councils that gives the final approval and uh I think maybe with your name on the city council if you add you as the administrative executive person as mayor of the city of Flint socket I don't see where we get a better shot well\nLet's see where this all takes us and we have twenty eight twenty nine thirty days left for us to get to that point and ah it will be if nothing else to fill it will be very very interesting\nBut what what we need and what we're asking for on the show and and in the campaign is\n... and has a vision Albert Breen has the vision I have a vision\nWe needed to become a little bit more contagious and we need the voters to come join us in divisions in this vision because voters vision to happen\nAlbum dream has got to be elected mayor these people have to be elected to the city council\nAnd then look out folks sit back buckle up and enjoy the ride because for once we have the vision we have the direction and in my lifetime and it's been so long since we've had a reasonable intelligent plan for the city\nWhich has been floating along under the dictates of the state and it's time for the city to stand up as a city because it is a city average yeah\nYou know it's we get very little reference\nIt's a city average yeah yeah yeah you know it's\nWe get very little representation of Providence from a a local wraps and we're going to need them on board or we're gonna have to put the thumb to them too and bring them in on the plane and say okay boys either with us or you're against us\nYou know from your past that if the mayor wants to go to Providence themself or send somebody on his behalf that can be done\nAnd you go directly right over their heads and you start asking if the only way you get things done and I could see the possibilities and it would really be crushing if this election doesn't come out the way it needs to come out\nWell thank you for the kind words for you and I am not discuss this top no he's not the way we we never have\nAnd um it will be a if nothing else has certainly will be interesting because there are a lot of people out there and let's not forget that you will have\nSome really outstanding people\nAre who are also running for school community and uh so if you want to if you want to uh mentioned that film please do\nWell okay we're ... we're Albert we\nKnow we know Donald bark and O'Donnell odd\nI don't know what can we you know Lynn ... yes we we know Eli NATO or\nWant us to get his orange ... here we've got six great candidates for five positions yeah we can't lose their album and all we can't we can't\nWe can't and and I want to make one more point because I just make it a point for everybody to get on board I was this little black bracelet that I got to a fund raising and we're just going to be another fundraising out what's going to talk about it in a moment but it's a brand Sunday at\nThe difference is Knight and day and that also goes not only\nFor a lot of what we stand for an album stands for but also stands for the money that's backing the campaigns now I Know pretty much I'll take small donations and they're all local donations from us people here in the city of when socket\nThe president administration takes a lot of money from outside the city and has had many fundraisers outside the city of what second and I wonder why people outside the city of when socket with bigger blocks would be donating to where the ... if they're not looking for something bad does it make sense", "show_name": "no_show", "year":
