winning numbers I wanted to make sure that right but they can come here yeah just keep it simple\nYeah we can get the ah the money for them indirectly\nAnd then I had a question for John yeah I'm kind of\nI don't really know how I feel about this a Senate president dominate garage area talked about\nPossibly superseding the local delegation in Providence that's tasked with the rebuild divide Ninety ... uh one night one night I think there is a valley because it's been a guy from New York trying to build\nSkyscraper there with multi use I think it's residential and commercial first he wanted to do three towers now which one tower he wants to invest two hundred and fifty million dollars in the problems in\nThe Senate president ... has said enough is enough we're going to the state's going to intervene if we're going to have this parochialism going on a promise where a handful of people are stopping these major projects from coming ... ... your organization taken a dancing as anyone I understand it fully or yeah\nI mean first of all the um he's not going to be able to do it without getting legislation passed and both the Senate and house mhm uh where it may be relatively easy for him in the Senate because he is the Senate president I'm not sure how the uh the house would feel that's been a lot\nGoing around about I think it will once the legislation is introduced that brings up a a myriad of issues is that who controls the state of local yeah and\nI think that's what they did a slippery slope on one hand it's like do you kind of agree with that they're holding up a project do you think that's just the process all I I I think the I think they're holding up I I think that uh in\nProvidence a there's a very very loud local minority a very very loud local minority who don't see this as what um they consider to be progress for provenance but the other hand of it as the state owns the land\nAnd is there another factor that uh Providence gets more state aid yeah then anybody could even imagine so I think I'm In a grudge aerial and\nAnd maybe even a house speaker met a yellow say are you guys may be an independent city but uh you are dependent on the legislature to prop you up\nYeah and and and to be turning down the opportunity for property taxes which which is I there'll be a tax able as Asian program I'm sure as there are in most major developments but um\nBut it does does open up that uh you know go by the same token if uh uh for example if ... opponent ... spoken out on the on the Donny has an opponent is send the prison or jail\nBothering you know I could say well do you want somebody telling us what we can do one grandson and you know and and so on and so forth so uh it'll be interesting to see how it plays out I understand the Senate presidents frustration because again it's the opportunity for cities Roger mentioned who gets a ton of money\nTo uh to get a some local money into the coffers without depending on the state\nUm and and the Senate you know the full disclosure I think most folks know that sort of a set of president material was formally a a an official with the one of the construction you know so\nIt's important for for him in in his mind set as well and I and I happen to agree that we'd better get or even more construction going in and more people back to work\nThe day I think as well like it could just be letting them know let's get moving here as well like if you're not gay I could just be a slight push them to say like let's stop dragging our feet maybe\nA shove yeah and I think it's I think he considers to be the right project 'cause I think people tend to forget that I'm sort of president material was against\nThe ballpark being in the end the redevelopment lander was as big amount of yellow\nWho thought that the ballpark in Providence was a great deal so it's not just a matter of any type of project going in\nBut one that he feels would have some benefit to uh to the city and the state as well so no official stance and now we haven't we haven't even really looked at it yet I think we're we're focusing on will be a taking a look at the referendum in our next board meeting which is\nA the next week actually unchecked if many meeting this week and uh find out uh what direction the board like to go on the on the referendum ...\nI think that I I kind of tend to agree that they're dragging their feet but I also don't like the idea of the state just swooping in and saying hey by the way we're putting this here whether you like it out because that is a slippery slope even if I agree with this project where you agree with the next one that they decide to do you know and I think that's a little bit of a slippery\nRather didn't do it before maybe would have a ballpark and production\nAnd now this is this issue of the is a good issue it is to me is a statewide issue in the sense that\nIf that building gets built when you drive into Providence area it would be extremely visible yes and uh it would be like the state house or like uh the Superman building it would be or the Biltmore building one of the uh or shall we say I cannot Nick structures\nBut um this is an issue for the greater Providence chamber of commerce to a lawyer and I would imagine that um ... you mean this should be this should be their invent edgy\nA issue uh in in in the marketplace\nYeah and and she said so uh well they haven't said anything I don't think anyone's really saying anything because it's just something he said he was going to do we just announced that a week from yesterday at the Republican expenditure council that dinner and I'm a [noise]\nThey may be some private conversations but how can you take on a position on something that hasn't even happened yet\nBut I just thought that they might have taken a position to on the original three building a project saying was saying this yeah the whole thing you know\nYeah I don't remember them taking a position I I buy they may have but I I just doesn't ring a bell\nNew chamber of commerce says criticize each other or critique each other like why are they moving on this or why did they\nTake public will\nBe back in a moment John Ward is running for city council on November sexed joined John for fundraising event on Thursday October eleventh from six to eight PM your support of

Providence on upscale retailer which they are the fact that they are pulling out\nThe fact that Nordstrom is pulling out it is it is an absolute death knell for Providence Place small because you know

clearly not a leader\nIs not in he's in over his head he is it novelty see this is also one of the problems mayoral laws he goes on every free trip that it's ever offered to him\nEvery ... you know it's funny when I first went on on the radio you're always offered all these types of things you get to go to\nYou know whatever it is free ball games are free shows are all this stuff that that people just throw to you because you remember the media and when you're when you're first into it there's a novelty like oh let's say something and then after a while you pick and choose a lotta times it's like\nI don't need to go to that or then that person wants to favor whatever it is he there's such a novelty with the laws that he never\nOn a free trip that's why he travels all over the place\nLoves and also just to let you go ahead you're set your citizen numerous times it ties the hands of the police\nHe does and you know like that\nThat is a city you can't do that I think they're saying that she's going to give them the equipment they need to let them do what they have to do with a straight a straight face\nIt has to be and I'll share with you you know I Lived when I moved to New York city David Dinkins was the mayor and New York\nWas absolutely a disaster New York was unsafe New York I remember I was flying to New York to interview with ABC Radio at AT T F green and on the plane I grabbed a time magazine\nJust you know it's just something to read a short flight right our Fifteen to New York\nAnd I'm at the time and maybe even less than that but anyhow the cover of the time magazine was New York city rotten to the core meaning the big apple people are flooding out crime was out of control I met Rudy Giuliani at\nThe Columbus Day festival we took a picture together he was like hey you know feather a fellow Italian everything else he came in and I singlehandedly the first thing he did Rudy Giuliani was he made Manhattan safe if you don't have a safe city nothing else matters\nIt comes down to it and right now I'll tell you what Providence is so lopsided Providence is one of the few cities\nActually there were more firefighters than police nobody operate that way and there's you know some fires in Providence but not most of the time the firefighters all they do is they carry people out on the ambulance but Providence\nYou they need there were more firefighters and police Providence doesn't have a fire problem Providence is a crime problem you can if people feel unsafe on federal help you can't have\nThat shooting at Providence Place mall and when they caught the kid he had a gun he fired at where did he fired keep in mind right outside of Nordstrom in the garage right right outside of Nordstrom people when fleeing I talked to people that said they would never go back to Nordstrom after that happened and mayor laws are described him as a knock on the head with a gun\nThat is not a not going to head with a gun that is a dangerous spelling fell in with an illegal firearms\nAge out if they don't see that he's in jail and not go head daddy's side all these phasing nordstroms of violence I don't know what to tell you\nYou know maybe before I let you go you talk to anyone and this happens all the time there are so many people if people are ever broken into you live in an apartment birds a family member would ever whenever they're broken into most people\nDon't I you can't lump them in the same category you just can't\nSo seven six six Thirteen eighty so I I don't understand all this anti Fong because obviously Gina Raimondo knows that may around phone could defeat her because otherwise you wouldn't be running negative ads about him and attacking him in debates\nSo they have another debate coming up I'm not sure I I think it's the it's I think it's a week from ... next Monday Night next Monday Night\nI'm not sure if it's televised though [noise] but um we'll see\nUh but I I don't understand\nThese people bailing out\nWhen to me the goals should be to defeat Gina Raimondo that first and foremost before anything else it should be that I also don't understand this whole thing of uh you know the the goal

winters I put a I've been running on my point to stabilize though it's got to the next winter than the average\nThat that's going to if you leave the gasoline and especially the ethanol in it\nAnd it's going to start eating away all of your gas gets an avid it costs a lot of problems ... best thing to do like the previous caller run into every year now actually a off of just like you said just empty the gas out put some no gasoline in there and it'll start\nLike three doctors I have a you know but that's true that's been caught\nMyself for doctors or the other\nAnd not be needed that do both of them live now when for doctors were really in trouble\nWell then it must be the guy pulling the chain\n[laughter] from somebody from uh my chain [laughter]\nSo how you doing today just a nobody excellent jak you get you very happy over the weekend with a confirmation them at the cabinet and I have to admit I was wrong on that one where\nWere you and I didn't think he was going to get there so [noise] but I was proud of or a Saturday I think's a Susan Collins made a ... one of the greatest speeches I've ever heard a senator makes sense a senator a one hand I mean that was one of the speech she gave\nAn after she was done with her speech that's when the man who changed flakes mind\nWrote to the president said I'm going to vote in favor of that was the Democrat Joe mansion\nAnd when Joe Manchin did that and I congratulate him a Democrat from West Virginia that's one flake decided well it doesn't make any difference ... so he voted yes\n\nWell I think flake could committed um\n... while he committed to win a\nForm of flavors lake voted no it would have been a tie that's right and that sort of broke the Thai that's correct and but but if it came to a tie Manson would I\nVote no no\nNo he committed before right after college speech any day committed in writing John\nIt makes no difference would be at that point he was not the swing vote that's true okay as soon as he as soon as a ... he became the swing vote\nAnd where parents needed a break the time if he ever voted if he if he would've been a Democrat in the history of the world\nBut because they were they were crucified them\nWell they're going to try to do that anyway\n\nBecause he voted for because like I said it was his his a declaration a day before that a is a reason why ... voted the way it did\nSo but anyway we're though which is great\nAnd last night I watched the swearing in which President Trump and I thought he did a great job and I was really glad that President apologized publicly to judge Kavanaugh for the horrible things that were went on during the ... I thought that was rather good\nAnd he was taking a hit today from a grand a\nOn on WB I wrong or that it wasn't necessary\nOr even though she's on some a Trump supporter and she's wrong ... absolutely necessary and the United states you had to apologize to have moved to the representing the nation\nThat nobody's ever going to what they put him through nobody ... understand something this is nothing to do with sexual assault\nThis is due with with with the with an announcement of sexual assault\nWhat all the evidence\nThat's right or without any evidence at all in fact the members something that the even the people who are putting it coming out ... years and years later told a verification there's so many people have told\nThem you know they told they went home and they told somebody and I told my friend and stuff well the ones that she told laws were well supposedly there\nSaid no I never was there and I don't even know this guy that's really good so it was it was based on his word against her word\nThat's right and so it was it was based on his word against her word and you don't ruin a man's life who's pattern in life is a total opposite of what they're projecting and saying this was all nothing to do but they keep it off the court\nOr because they're afraid of abortion is one of the issues and let me say this repeated again\nHe is a man who follows the written word of the constitution\nSo if they're concerned about abortion and it's in the constitution why are they afraid of them for it because it's not in the constitution\nThat's it's a fought with the ... decision and they're afraid that President is going to be changed and it depends on what ever come before the court again and he doesn't know what's going to come before the court and federal and then he has to make a decision along with the other eight other\nJustices justice says okay they might by ... by reminding me if you look at the declaration of independence and says ... were wearing title lady and lights and writes from God for the ... from life in the pursuit of happiness life liberty and for Savage\nThat's right life what the hell is life mean that means is Seventy million potential Americans that are winning the grave or don't appointment that were not present given an opportunity of lights\nThat they'll pay and they were they were entitled to mice a controversial constitution\nAnd even at constitution thing is even flawed and that and I hope that come before judge Kavanaugh is that that that tastes in uh in San Francisco when that ... that they've used as a inexcusable anchor babies\nAny one of the citizens are not\nAllowed or hopefully they'll veal or many different things that come to\nTheir protesting out of the court today again then I'd let me tell you something I Hope the Democrats took a hit this November I Hope people this is a democratic state and you're going to see if we were two and a guy like White House due to the United States Senate\nThan this state is going down below the tools you can't get any law after the after what he did during that hearing discussing swaps in college\nI just it does not deserve to be a United States senator any intelligent person should recognize that fact but we have many unintelligible people have oh\nThere's a lot of Democrats that still believe in being fair\nAnd you could be\nBecause you're a liberal well liberal they're not even liberal me more because you're far left it doesn't mean that you're a you're not fair it and then when you asked that protest which is a lot on the democracy and you have to be trained they paid\nAnd pay that's right that's what I was going on your tape prison that's not a protest that protesters ... uh me going down to the state because I'm pro life not because somebody gave me twenty bucks\nAn hour and a cast gets paid those people that are paid to try and overthrow a party or a government\nThat's right you're right\nYou're right that's exactly what this is what George Soros and the rest of the cold and that that's what they're trying to do incredible of excuse me too quick items five forget registry of motor vehicles are supposed to open the first week of September ... correct yes\nAt the end of August I heard on another\nTalk show we talked about that was disgusting that day and we're not going to open and according to the person who's the head of the registry they had not received a certificate occupancy from the city when you and I talked about that\nNo that's not the reason no I Know but they haven't said it's a construction yet\nYeah well that too but I Wonder if that was my question was have they received their certificate of occupancy yet\nI don't think you can do that too and finished\nOkay I all according to the ... the guy on the radio he says every they'd be done and everything was waiting for that particular uh\nThe guy the ... well I read the paper very extensively a very strong article on it I don't know whether the breeze or the call about it stayed in about a about they haven't been paid for what they've done\nAnd they they uh country could be the owner of the company or the mall have trouble getting all of the builders and the bill is getting having trouble getting paid from the owners and it's like the left hand to do with the writing is knowing\nOkay and I'm moving forward until they get paid for what they have already done\nWas like well okay and and uh but but they uh they said had been delayed but they didn't say it's not going to happen I mean that the only lost from flying out the window and this one\nBefore entering pre school\nMore than just to check the visual acuity comprehensive I exam wasn't sure that your child has the necessary visual skills to

problem\nAnd wondering what your stabilize their all time wanted weapon Bull Run to the weather there today where all those they have a different level rather\nWell the interesting thing about Consumer Reports that Ron ... says you stabilize make sure you top off the tank 'cause if you do during the summer months they're still gonna condense I Want to\nMake a lot of folks drive because we're not leaving the U. S. and I'm\nNot trying you know whether\nWe had this sub over the raid on a minute but I'm believable\nTo dream of tank spread a carburetor was a member of the phone and it's going to do and it's going to work perfectly right now\nAre ready to take a chance on just rolling it\nIt'd be dreams of the guys and it's not going to run a cell phone that's a little better\nJob but you you can't put stable either to burn it might get a little rough I wouldn't I don't think it'll tell\n\nYou don't put stabilize or no you're with your way to really know if you're trying to get us six another put a window so you need\nAir rather by walnut broken ground\nOn red ball I see you're saying I see what you're saying I got a\nGenerator stabilize or other every day and I make a run for three weeks I let it runs interested no\nOkay on what they said the worst thing in the world but we're not running all over ... ... yeah\nOK most leaving your decided okay thank you got to do by you know who you're on here that afternoon [noise] Hi how are you then good\nI like to talk a little bit today about a matter of life and death ah but ah before uh before I Do I'm going to give you a trivia question of the day there is a a chemical called lifers say which is used in the American ... agricultural quite extensively\nAnd it's been used now for many decades\nBut going back to and a half decades or twenty five years\nGive me the percentage increase in the urine of Americans\nFor the presidents of life for say why how much of a percentage increase from Nineteen Ninety three to two thousand eight dean did you say urine yes it's it's in a uh it's showing up quite for say the chemicals used in agriculture\nIs showing up a a big time in the urine of American\nPeople I have no idea twelve hundred percent\n\nPretty pretty scary isn't it ... your says yes All right not a real life and death two or three a week ago you had a murder suicide or in the city and I'm like a you know we've discussed cases like this before\nAnd one of the remarks that I personally have made is that uh the emotions\nSometimes can be ... in the mood of people can be terrible horrible things\nAnd uh if you look at the way as the the murder suicide was a written about in the paper I Would I Would think you would have to say that a a really bad um\nWave of emotion and and and ... and mood ... had to play into this kind of tragic situation because no matter how bad it it was\nAt least from the point of view of the of the shooter something like this certainly wasn't warranted would you agree no no never will be warranted okay\nI'm a but beyond that going a little deeper well let's look at the role of self knowledge and self understanding or in this particular situation\nAnd I want to describe our uh define a shelf knowledge and self understanding as the recognition of boundaries and limitations for the sake of your own welfare and and well being\nI don't know how much you believe in the value of self knowledge and self understanding but I've I Believe in it very highly\nAnd I try to uh apply as much self knowledge and self understanding to situations and things that I Do as I possibly can\nBut going back to miss the bends annuity hair what I found ... while I fall into things strange number one he had five children\nFrom two previous relationships uh before\nHe got involved and married and Michelle than ...\nSo we had five children and at with at least two different relationships\nUp to the point where he was about fifty years old and then he decided to get married and have another child\nWell\nMy you know when I look at that I got to say you you've already done that twice you had five children and those situations\nDidn't work out why would you want to involve yourself in another one but he did\nAnd unfortunately and and regrettably it turn tragic and resulted in a murder\nSuicide\nGet my point yeah you you know okay\nA cost you know if you're gonna have self knowledge and self or understand\nOf course you know you're going to have self dollars yourself or understanding you also have to have the self discipline and self control to be able and for us uh what uh what what you know about yourself uh and it's just too bad uh\nFor the three people involved here the mother and the father and now this kid who has been off and that a little more self knowledge and self understanding washing brought to bear and applied in this situation\n\nOK okay thank you All right Bye bye [noise] you're not doing your own ear\nOr good afternoon just a suicide is terrible but any uh living relatives fact what about them committed suicide they they probably should have reached out for help but they didn't because they were the press and anyways\nYou know one of the things we've forgotten that not only do the seven year old was his father and mother but the other children lost her father to yeah\nOK then he had with other other women on no that's good to do with what happened between him and his women connect them all together I don't think it's fair but uh I don't have any any relationship with a woman who had recommended that\nI have to think the Rotary Club or very much because you know I have trouble walking but the Rotary Club has somebody station fight that the editor to where the motor vehicle\nDivision of motor vehicles is um pot straight and there was apple packing their faith in the cab people\nAnd then there was a short walk into the pack and plenty to places that I watch that in there\nAnd to well a pack so you could take a ... now that I think the Rotary Club very much and I agree with your previous caller\nI think sunny day with with some of those that they could have done without them and that somebody like Jeff ... everybody loves Justin ... and the ... the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNah nah nah [noise]\n\n\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nOkay we're back at my special guest that the dare friend of mine for

it in Lincoln anymore there's only one guy down in West Philly that\nThat does and he has everything you can possibly we ain't does everything agency and uh and I just told him I said uh you know put out bringing\nA and put a man with vision 'cause I had at a meeting with him and his son and a and a several years ago he also met with out\nAnd he says he does say how's your project company image so they can't get into the mayor's office and so forth but uh you know you don't\nKnow what's supposed to be a surprise you know we planned it as a surprise South Korea he never knew about it no no it leaked out somehow ...\nChosen restaurants they need to be able to swim in a pool they need to be able to go to an outdoor concert that you need all these things otherwise they're going to go to Providence that are going on and that's where they're going now because so many things in Providence what there's a lot to do right John let's say\nAn across the base headquarters as easy as as we're talking riling so these people are coming in all the time\nExactly and all the money's being spent right down Ninety nine to Providence okay and all the employees\nI would've gone right down the nine to Lincoln CONMEBOL in our borough Smith feel all of all of all the towns around us but one socket and I think that you know when Lincoln office park was built in a hammock corporate one and two\nWe didn't anticipate it being this big\nIn this kind of a micro economy that we have so we have to get that money down into the inner city 'cause if you take a look at the demographics of our inner city is rarely that's why we had the ... of St john's about these as I said in the past John\nWhether by fire or by wrecking ball we have lost three point two million square feet of industrial space that had jobs for in the past thirty five years\nOkay so that took us where\nNo one had the mayor couldn't go to work the woman going to go to work the rubber company closed ... electrical CNC close royal robes close they got that small in about maybe a hundred other smaller businesses okay so now they have no hope in the inner city so we've seen that\nUh our\nSocial flat lands walked into the much needed social service mecca to take on these issues\nOf what despair okay and now we find out of our a diamond hill is a ghost of his former self aware from eight to ... grade and greater downtown was fifty percent plus they can't [noise] so [noise] we have a choice\nWhere is the river\nWhere are we we have historic buildings there one thing that I got to say\nA one small thing that we should do let me tell you something people we talk about economic development less all be real and let's be true\nBecause I was in city hall last week on the third floor I looked out the window and this is exactly what the mayor scenes from the fourth floor when you look out the industrial national bank building John with graffiti in every window hospital trust hospital trust building okay\nThat shouldn't it be you have the most important people walking into the executive\nOffice the tree growing out of the roof a tree growing up with Johnny let me tell you something [laughter]\nBut that building right now she's already spent millions and millions of dollars not now one two and three families right Fifteen to twenty thousand dollars to shrink wrap that whole building to preserve it for development 'cause it water is pouring inside of that building it shouldn't have to go through another\nIn the winter these other things I'll be working with our brain and for\nThe real things that he reality and get somebody in there to go wash those windows and say all those bad words in all the graffiti off so when somebody comes up to the fourth floor they look across the street in his face you know there's a disconnect those are the things that you have to say\nWhen your mayor of the city and it's the people around you that has to be proactive we have to change the addict to\nWe have to be four in the city and let me tell the people something\nThree real estate developer sold me this is Albert\nYou're doing will never come from outside of the city it will come from with in the city people who has been here and people who love the city\n'cause we're the heart and soul of the city it's not outside of the city way here and it has to happen now John 'cause this is the opportunity as we know out of the federal government one thing I didn't even consider\nA year ago two years ago but now is here\nTo layer all the tax credit programs that we have in the highest distress area in the state is downtown when socket okay so\nNow we have the opportunities I'm from the federal government which when the large corporations when they invest over a certain amount of time they don't pay any capital gains less and less and less okay and they just kind of projects that they're going to be looking for [noise]\nSo here we are sitting here in ... it's just I all I Want

any of that that was Saturday afternoon I think that was a great addition or to the to the event uh the uh entertainment balls started off on Saturday my goodness\nThat blues brothers review\nAnd I had never seen them I think uh several years ago they they did play the stadium I missed that show I was deeply interested in it\nBecause the whole time or she's playing her guitar she's singing [noise] the fate of classic [noise] so the ... they're picking up you hear the cliques it's not a click track it's not a drum machine or it's her feet\nI Love to entertainment do up to

I could listen to that music all day long or they were great poke Paul graduations are great set a good form for the ... on a on the afternoon the Saturday the gospel review this year\nAnd a you know it's so funny to see this thing grow\nWas outstanding that\nThe I think it was the cavalry worship center who opened up a the music\nThere was a you know a band and then you had raining Diane in that group using tracks so they could set up\nWell scheduled Bob uh Mike excuse me ... well ... well ... well well scheduled because uh they have to set up a a rather large poker banned uh and it was a very well scheduled there\nThe Calgary worship center musicians and music uh my gosh what a voice first of all great music top shelf top shelf musicians right here in the Blackstone valley er and they pour everything them or they have into their music\nUh and maybe a little more because of the uh the spiritual side of it uh but that cavalry worship room and I don't know if they have an official

worship group\nAnd we're going to get some of that will let you know what the schedule is for replaced down the road also going to say I don't think I've ever seen it look better and I can imagine a the amount of labor\nThat went in to the parents the front end\nOf the stage and you you may see it in some photos are are ah perhaps some ... some video things if they do make it up a\nNever looked better the facade of that stage with the side fills in the over the top framing the stage or so you weren't just seeing Silva pole and I had a\nClose line Mac real to open\nA poll and a and a close line Mac real to open and close the curtain uh Indian and see the the the bars in the empty spaces on the top of the way the stage was framed out\nAh just looks spectacular and I could tell you that were amazing approve men's on the stage itself including a widening and reinforcing the side fills the stage and then a simple thing\nBut I tell you it was sometimes simplicity the brilliance the stairs or on the front end on each side or such easy access on and off the stage\nCut down a tremendous amount of foot traffic backstage when you're trying to get the job done and it was so easy to get on and off the stage or you know the simple things at that stage I don't think ever looked better\nUh and as I was going through the grounds and I'm not sure whether you know who did this work but they were they were more decorative spots\nTo beautify uh as you as you went around a more flowers are put out a festive things I'm more spots of beautiful ... and a\nLaid out around the grounds than

congratulations Mike dubois guy who's been around a long time\nOr you know from the rotary a beer garden and uh in growing that to where it has a you know to the point where you know the the TV's the screens that you you go back to where it started that things advance to\nAdvance quite big and you could certainly see as a knowledge experience from working with stadium theater in entertainment or brought into a a different um take at the artifice stage and\nReally are elevated the stage presentation so it was a good job and look forward to seeing where it's going in the future\nI could talk about um fast all week with you\nOr I just love of the festival so dearly are working on it uh since uh being around the autumn fest since I was a kid I think it is the best thing going in the ocean

like the stage\nOr the people that are on the stage on standing around watching the fireworks there they're getting the work done I was doing that at the end All right booth um but it looked\nLike fun show and I I did I Can't help but turn into finale kicks on it's kind of it has to draw your attention\nOr the you know the other thing I thought was good and and a talking about improvements in stage area made might might dubois a again sometimes as a simple things to chairs\nOr you know that the chairs were were fastened\nAnd it just kept the area neat and tidy a versus you know having to having it ... the old days the chance we did get moved all over the place and you know every morning it'd be rounding them up and lining up again\nTying the kids together simple things this brilliance and simplicity\nFascinating those jazz together so they so they end up you know half way across the park\nA good idea and you know it probably a good safety thing to\nUh you know in the event of anything God Forbid and it seemed like a very peaceful autumn best celebration um you know you don't want things getting a move around and tossed around so you know for ... there was other reasons why it was a good idea\nUm but I could tell you it was always a pain in the Turkish are trying to gather up the chairs and seemed like every day when you line them up there was less chairs time that she has he got was a great idea you know so many so many great improvements in around that stage area I Want to thank Jake video in sound or for the and his team for the hard work\nOr in order to bring this

N. R. I. and when socket Rhode Island\nNinety nine point nine and Ninety five point one FM you have your choice on the FM dial and I am it's Thirteen eighty or just check us out on line at W. N. R. I. dot com\nOr you can friend me on Facebook Joe Luca and you can watch me on Facebook Live or watch me after the fact that saved the videos too\n[noise] so if you're thinking about buying a home and I know we're talking a lot about buying a home or we're going to talk about selling as well [noise]\nYou know just to give you some idea an idea right now if you were to get a mortgage a hundred thousand dollar mortgage and your interest rate where five point seven five percent which is high I mean you could have you know a loaf psycho credit score 'em\nAnd you might get let an interest rates lower than that so we'll use a higher rate of five point seven five hundred thousand bucks your principal and your interest payment\nIs five hundred and eighty three dollars per month\nFive hundred and eighty three dollars so if you buy at the average house is a little under three hundred thousand so let's triple that so if you're buying\nAn average priced house okay you're going to pay your mortgage is going to be about what Seventeen hundred a ... Seventeen hundred and forty dollars\nMany times and that's at the rate that would be like a three bedroom house I mean that's the average house\nPeople are paying that much in rent or close to that much in rent for an apartment\nYou can own a house and that's if you buy an average priced house if you buy a house just press a little bit below average maybe one you want to add value to need some updating you're going to get a house much price much lower [noise] and these are in good neighborhoods to we're not talking the worst neighborhoods man talking tiny houses [noise]\nAll right so that's some perspective five hundred and eighty three dollars a month for every hundred thousand dollars of debt at at a five point seven five to to get it and just again for some perspective I check today you can still get mortgages and the four high for is\nOkay and the high for is\nSo\nWhere are you the number I'm using his five point seven five percent if you can get something any lower than that your mortgage payments are going to be lower\nOkay [noise] so it makes sense if you're in a house and you watch upgraded to a great time to upgrade because it's a seller's market so you'll get a good number for your house and interest rates are low\nSo you'll be able to finance before the rates go up to high now we still have a way to go before they hit the average the historic average were thirty year fixed rate mortgage is eight percent\nAnd again we're not even at six percent we're not we're real barely a five percent okay and this is after we just had a rate increase and work on I'm going to have another rate increase in\nDecember everybody's expecting that\nIt's still a great time even after that rate increase comes it'll still be a great time to buy a house because again we are going to be well below the historic average for a fixed rate thirty year mortgage Iowa State it's all the time when I bought my first house I got a nine point nine interest rate\nAnd everybody else was getting ten eleven and twelve so I thought I was you know\nI was special now people don't want to buy a house because they're saying four point six percent is too high\nYou know you've got to be able to strike rally iron is hot this is a great time to take out a mortgage so it's a great time to buy for your first home or to upgrade to another home to thinking about selling it to a great time to sell because interest actually made a prices\nWere almost at the highest point the prices have ever been in Rhode Island\nIn some parts of the country when you look at nationwide view from ten thousand feet there are certain pockets Boston or\nSan Francisco they're above the pre crashed levels New York city actually that's not the case you know the price of real estate in New York City is very\nActually that's not the case you know the price of real estate in New York City is very high but houses residential properties have not been selling in New York City\nAnd some areas some neighborhoods prices are actually declining because they have a lot of fiscal issues in New York City that are starting to impact the value housing impact the demand which in fact the value All right\nSo if you are in a situation where you own a house and you're trying to determine do the math and see if it makes time to sell it certainly does make time to sell\nAgain basic economics supply and demand\nYou have consistent demand which we do have but there's less supply there are fewer houses on the market that's less competition you're going to be able to sell your home more easily okay and values are still very solid\nSo think about if you have any questions give me a call after the show or text me for one five eight zero nine seven nine seven I'm Joe Luca I'm your host and you're listening to the Joe Luca real estate show okay I Want to thank everyone everyone for tuning up to about twenty five minutes after the hour\nAnd I want to thank our sponsors okay of course we have ...

that how is there any other investment properties give me a call for one five eight zero nine seven nine seven again at the job market for one five eighty Ninety seven Ninety seven and you are listening to the joker real estate show right here on W. N. R. I.\nNinety five point one or Ninety nine point nine FM Thirteen eighty am\nAll right and we are as I said right here in the heart of the Blackstone river valley in one socket Rhode Island okay\nSo let's see what else are we talking about we're talking about ah our sponsors gentry moving and storage John Doe back at first home mortgage we talked about president can caffrey\nDoing a great job as a closing and title attorney you know I Want to talk about that too because sometimes I've had some you know I talk with a lot of people about real estate and there are some investors and they think that\nWell I don't have to get title insurance I'm just going to buy this and then I'm just going to do some work on it and then sell it I don't need title insurance\nNow the cost of title insurance is in the hundreds of dollars usually let's say it's a thousand dollars okay if you have to spend a thousand dollars on something\nIt's an insurance policy and it's a type of thing if you need it you want to have it if you don't have it and you need it you're going to be in a tough situation and it's I guarantee you it's going to cost more than a thousand dollars or five hundred dollars or whatever the policy is\nSo I encourage all of my clients to get title insurance and of course you want to work with a competent qualified title attorney\nWho can help you out and that's just just caffrey over Resnick McCaffrey he can take care of you answer any questions you have\nBefore the closing or during the closing about the purchase contract but ... all the paperwork and if you're buying a house today they're going to have a deck of paperwork it's probably about an inch and a half to two inches thick\nIt's not like five or ten years ago when it was in and out\nEasy ... very different now okay maybe more than five years ago maybe a you know nine years ago or earlier okay\nSo it's important to one when you're looking to buy or sell a home use a fulltime experienced realtor because we help people buy and sell homes every week every month\nTo you want to work with a lender that the realtor will recommend for you for your situation okay what do I mean by your situation well\nYou want to buy a house in a rural area we need to hook you up to the lender who's gonna who's experienced and USDA loans if you're a veteran and we need to hook up with the lender who's experienced with fear loans well like a veteran like John Doe back\n\nIf you are in if you're self employed you may need different types of programs lending programs not everybody has every mortgage program for every situation\nAnd I strongly discouraged from my buyers from working with the big banks because they have very few mortgage options available\nOkay so the first thing you talked to a realtor second thing we recommend who you talk to for a lender\nAnd then you need to call them and get pre approved do everything they ... they require you to get a pre approval letter not a pre qualification I Do not work with people who only do pre qualifications I Want my bias to have a pre approval which means it's a piece of paper\nFrom the lender saying I Will lend money to this fire because they gave me the paperwork their pay stubs their tax returns whatever they need as opposed to just the conversation on the telephone\nSo number one realtor number two lender number three you're going to need a good closing attorney there are a lot of good closing attorneys out there of course we have Jeff caffrey Resnick and caffrey love for him as a sponsor of the Joe look real estate show so we like Jeff caffrey\nBecause he's a good attorney\nAnd he treats all of my clients really well and takes good care of them\nAnd then of course after you clothes on your house where do you need to have any need to move you get all of your belongings gathered up loaded onto a truck taken to the new home and that's why we have ... a giant tree moving and storage\nChristine and Brian crumb they run that business like the family business that it is and they were ... all of their customers and treat their belongings as if they were their own\nAlright their numbers is for one seven eight five one six zero zero\n[noise] even if you're looking to move in office if you're up seizing downsizing they can help you out you know they work especially well with a lot of seniors\nOf course the needs of seniors can be disparate depending upon the situation if there are illnesses you know if you have a chronic disease if um you have a progressive disease where you're going to have to move what a front is you're going to have to take with you what you can't take with you and you need to make other arrangements for you for for it\nGently moving and storage can help you with all of that okay they work\nOr extensively with the senior community as well as on the commercial side too they have all the train experience movers who know how to move file cabinets desks chairs that go from one office to the next\nAnd then of course green home solutions if you want to get your home clean before you sell it do you want to get a clean before you move into the new one green home solutions
