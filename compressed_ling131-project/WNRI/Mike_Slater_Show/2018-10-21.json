in the upcoming lands and I'm trying to figure out what the best the smartest timeline Wendy we are um consider opening up a new business and getting an SBA loan and also purchasing our first home\nAnd I don't know maybe we shouldn't do all of it maybe we should rent [laughter] wow yes [laughter] you do have fired me life or what I what I heard\nAs I heard cash flow knocking out the door starting a business moving buy a house starting a business always in short order\nYeah\nHow and the world would you sleep at night you must they must feel no anxiety out all your life\nComes and goes a specially during the day\nBecause I Would I Will tell you you know I mean if you've ever heard me talk about and I should do the sometime soon talk about my past\nTo where I Am today but when\nWhen I started my own business and I was twenty five at the time I had so much anxiety I Would wake up in the middle of the night just anxious couldn't go back\nTo sleep you know worried about how you were all worried about something went wrong the day before whatever and if I had piled on top of that\nLike a house in the same time I mean I I think my head would've exploded so\nOh my goodness maybe years who I who can handle the dual 'cause you gotta do suck there on cash flow\nBy home and starting a business so which is more important to you right now\nI'm starting a business is is more important if we have to rent temporarily that's okay um\nWe have that that matched me stop shallow breathing hey [laughter] see some kind of entrepreneurial P. T. as they said that I like [laughter]\nOkay okay [noise] um\n'cause you don't know exactly how the business is going to go how how quickly is going to be profitable how much it's going to grow how slow is going to grow and I want you to be careful because you buy a home you got a fixed overhead there you rent you know it gives you more flexibility\nOkay how can a day for the business\nI'm a combination of sun some cash and some some alone um so we wouldn't be in less than a franchise as as they're out we're going to go and then um we have a twenty percent down saved away for the home if we needed a way we can\nYeah I Would really I'm I'm really asking you to put that just on the shelf for now\nBecause when you start a new business you don't know what your cash flow needs are going to be you know you know the franchise people are going to promise you that oh yeah our trend line is you're going to be casual positive and how many months do they tell you\nI promise anything they show is their best guy their worst guy in their average guy in an an even worse guy would be okay with us\nOkay All right well that's good I I and ... either you you say we as you and your husband are going to have either of you worked in the industry before that you're going to have this franchise\nWe have not so\nI'm just all a stop signs and red lights right now I'm\nA big fan of one of you going to work for one of the franchise is doing anything and everything for at least three months mhm\nBecause you got the rest of your life you can own the franchise but I really like for you to uh experience at one or both of you to experience the business before you're all done\nOkay\nAnd I don't know if that's something you've considered but with any business whether it's a franchise or not having some experience when your money's not at risk\nYou there's so much you learn in a relatively short period of time that of lemonade or issues concerns mistakes you might make once you're owning a map parading it\nYeah that makes sense\nSo I put your whole life on hold but you wanted to talk to me about\nOkay well um you know I respect your opinion in a I thank you so much for your advice\nSure and I wanted to ask you one thing before you go the borrowing you're going to do you said SPA maybe\nThat's what we were thinking\nThat he would ... small local bank that you can go talk about your plans with\nFor a local one not yet no cataracts recommendation\nWell that's just what I Want you to be about as I Want you out there talking to the there aren't as many small local banks as they used to be a lot of them look like they're local really are just pretending and there are parts of bigger operations you want to a bank that you can grow with and that specializes\nHas people

Eighteen or more people I find myself buying lots of paper towels and toilet paper\nWhile you have a single rental bit that people use as a party house\nWow you have a single rental bit it that people use as a party house would hold that many people or\nIt can do that it's a collection of story old Florida buildings that lake water make up a waterfront compound\nHow 'bout that it's pretty cool\nThat is neat and so just things like a consumer bowls are eating up into some of your profit\nTo a degree yes and I don't know whether to go to the local big box store or perhaps to an online a purveyor of these paper good\nI Believe you're going to get your best deal over time with the Sam's Club and Costco Wholesale excellent and you know both of them have institutional supplies are you familiar with how Cosco has the business centres\nYes and they approached me as a likely good candidate for their wholesale club and I just did not know what to think of that\nBecause the business centres specifically deal with um a owner operators of small motels they sell 'em you know a facial tissue\nAnd private label and huge box quantities you know where you have the the size of the individual boxes are smaller but they tell you a big quantities one time huge amounts of toilet paper all those kinds of things Sam's Club if you joined their premium membership\nHas a delivery service where you won't won't even have to go get it they deliver for free\nAll right and when they have a periodic sales they will deliver to you\nAnd slams club also has a corporate a sibling cold jet and a lot of people who ran a or B and bees and things like that by their consumer bowls on ... dot com\nOh thank you for that direction I Will look into all of those options\nSo the good thing with jet there is no annual membership fee was sams and Costco both of them you have the membership fee\nSo that's why a lot of people with a\nAir being bees use jak because they get what they feel
