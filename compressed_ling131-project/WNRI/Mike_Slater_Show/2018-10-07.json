can be used not just on a chrome book at home may be used on any computer anywhere even if it's not a crime but so\nThat's why the schools have been adopting that they don't have to I have a an IT department or anything like that since everything on them is Web based and you're right that to make a crumbled useful you have to have\nAn Internet connection for most everything you would do on it
