because they've made it easy John joins us on the Clark Howard show Hello John how you doing\nI'm as to how it should call your claw fleas call Mae Clarke okay claw how are you today wonderful thank you hope you are I'm doing wonderful thank you for taking my call sure\nSo I have a quick question\nProbably not a simple answer the question [noise] I Know that when you have a bank account you have FDIC insurance and credit unions have their own insurance but in the low cost um investors terms\nI Everytime I call and ask I'd get the well we're not going to do ...\n... no answer is\nNo it's not so what kind of protection is out there\nOkay so it depends on what you're actually doing like if you own of a series of funds\nLike you own mutual funds are index funds the value of what you have is controlled by the holdings inside that fine so the value when you invest goes up and down will find itself is not at risk and west the investments in it [noise]\nGo to zero\nSo let's say you buy 'em an index fine\nFrom one of the big discounters from vanguard fidelity Schwab someone like that who you know those three are taking so much market share or you end up owning a ATF from one of the you know one of the black rocky ts those are the the big discounters and the market\nThe money that is in a fund is secure in that find there's never been a situation where a money has been stolen and it's just a well and the money's gone [noise]\nAnd money in a a brokerage does not have as you mentioned FDIC insurance or anything like that the holdings are protected by what's called S. I. P. C. did anybody mentioned SSI PC to you\nI seen it at the bottom of the page when you're looking at the site\nAnd S. I. P. C. as a vastly inferior protection for you than what you have at a credit union through and see you or a or at a bank through FDIC\nSo as I PC is a privatized version of protection and the most contentious cases have involved where a brokerage has been crooked\nAnd S. I. P. C. has not been there to protect people and the event of a brokerage going insolvent CSI PC\nTakes care of people but if it's involved fraud or something like that they don't put your money how is it\nHeld is it in mutual funds or a ...\n... mostly most of it as a mutual funds indexes in and I are a little bit of it is in money market now with money market would be different than the funds\nYes so money market works a little differently and last decade during the ah banking scandals there were I think to money market funds they couldn't pay out\nPeople's accounts and they went at least temporarily and solve it and it was a terrible problem very upsetting to people\nIn a money market situation\nThat brokerage houses offered generally two options you can either have the money and a ... earning FDIC insured a account or you can have it in a money market account where the interest changes each day [noise]\nAnd I have my money and money market\nI'm not particularly worried because even the last decade when we had this this series a banking scandals [noise] you know one of any and there was no significant or meaningful loss for anybody\nFrom any of the money markets even the ones that temporarily went insolvent ultimately paid people the money they owed them almost a hundred percent [noise]\nWonderful thank you very much for that so the question\nThe big risk always is with a smaller brokerage that may be crooked and that's when your money is at greatest risk if that gives you any comfort\nThat does thank you very much our best to you\nThank you Bye bye\nRobert's with us on the Clark Howard show and Robert here with us to talk about your car via experience yet another disruptor I was talking just moments ago about the mattresses razors and [noise] who knows how many other businesses are going to be disrupted car bomb or\nYou buy a car sight unseen for you call me because you were trying to do what with Karl von\n[noise] trying to sell and on my car or on my cars\nAnd the process freaked out\nAnd you wanted to make sure you weren't going to get ripped off\nAnd you called me and we talked through the process that it turned out that you really were dealing with ... and that everything was on the up and up or what ultimately happened 'cause you're going to educate me right now\nAre surprisingly well really well I didn't I didn't want to stay with\nThem calling on another recalling dealership and I didn't know what to think since I was saying it any other calls\nBut a whale it through with it and met Adam ... or ... at a bank and ah and she was a female\nAnd uh and she was ... it was a female truck driver and hours early and she was very pleasant nice\nA bullet that there are a lot and a ... a British looked at the cars but it is okay for work and it was real surprised to\nSee you got real money and you sold your car and you're done\nYeah certified cashier's check my bank and all that said no way or the check clear it up at my son I show\nThat they was it really was there as well as Dr ...\nAnd when you and I talked before we talked about the fact that a cashier's check doesn't necessarily mean anything anymore but\nI thought oh the earth\nBut in this case he really we're dealing with Carmona they really search your car they paid you for it and now you'll be able to go on ... website and find your car up for sale before you know it\nIt was definitely when I look for the call or they feel they're on them\nYeah but see you have real inside information now because you know what car Bonner paid you for your car when you find it on their website you'll have a real sense of what kind of mark up they have from a buying your vehicle to when they re sell it to somebody else\nYes so\nI appreciate you following up with me because when you and I talk I couldn't tell you if the people you were dealing with were really from car bomb if it was really the budget process because you were the car Bonner just as you buy the car\nCompletely on the line when you're buying one from them sight unseen\nWhen they buy your car\nTheir unseen and everything is email or a various forms of digital communication till it comes time that you actually turn the vehicle over and so that's a process where it is possible somebody could get\nRocked and you went through steps to make sure you are dealing with the actual real people and you got the vehicles sold and I really appreciate you sharing the odyssey with us You're listening to the Clark Howard show", "show_name": "Mike Slater Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Woonsocket", "day": "14"}
