running should just after strike is it ready dot com lowered slashed business brought here by the federal emergency management agency the American Red Cross and\nAnd so their perspective I've gotten from physicians is that we're the problem more than anything else and that we're allowing ourselves to be too influenced by these ads running on TV\nYou know I've heard the same but it's\nAlso it's important to remember that at this point\nIn the U.S health care system it's all about turnover or Catholic Haitian in healthcare terms which means they got to get you into the office and out of the office as fast as possible so if a patient is digging in his or her heels and said I Want drug X Y Z and I'm not gonna take no for an answer a lot of doctors\nWill simply write the script just to get things moving along and that's kind\nOf why the drug industry now puts more money into marketing does into research because they know what's affective they don't need to get everybody demanding a prescription med or a brand name it what they need to get it's just a a significant number to make it defensible\nAnd justifiable and keep you in the brand name fold and that's where part of the problem is and let's also underline this point Clark and that is there are only two nations in the entire world that allows so called direct to consumer advertising a prescription drugs and that costs\nAnd New Zealand and that's it\nEvery other country especially developed countries like us have looked at that practice is said and you know we see that as doing more harm than good because let's face it the citizens are meant to be made by ... licensed health care professionals and not\nAmateurs like you and me and everybody listening and therefore it doesn't serve the public interest to do this in fact the American Medical Association has called for an end to this practice because they see it as just inflating drug prices and hearing people into expensive treatment regimens there would be much cheaper alternatives for\nSo is it best what you and I can do is we can't change that a momentum and\nPowerful sorry the change that momentum so we got to go back to basics and that is at the core most of us are going to do just fine when the generic mad that already exists for a condition that ails us\nI think that's absolutely true I think also people need to be more open minded to the idea that their doctor when they come back at you with a idea that\nWell there is a generic or there was an alternative drug you might want to explore the cheaper or covered\nBy your insurance you certainly want to listen because this is somebody who's read all of the academic papers and on all of the research that you haven't done so yeah you want to listen to that person and I would also encourage people to write to their elected representatives\nBecause indeed if we do want to try to bring the drug industry focused once again on carrying ailments as opposed to moving product getting rid\nOf the direct to consumer ads would be a big step in the right direction because that's\nBillions of dollars that would therefore be redirected backing to Laurie useful endeavors such as basic research and wouldn't require me to explain to my son what he is what all watching sports together on TV\n[laughter] fast\nThing you said was that [laughter] was gosh I Can't get past you have a new explain that to your side anyway the best thing\nYou said is that there are now spending more money on this marketing and they're spending on are indeed to actually make drugs that will improve people's lives and that is a real miss direction a national wealth\nTo have all that money go into the ads and so don't buy them change your mind don't like those ads influence what you are going to consult with your doctor about\nIn fact I don't even pay attention to those ads because let's face it they are not imparting sufficient amount of information for you to make an informed decision and therefore they're not worth your time\nFor David Lazarus from the Los Angeles times thank you so much for joining us and you keep that passion and by the way how to explain to your son what he did his family radio\nWell I Would say the things that lasts for four hours probably aren't good under any circumstances\n[laughter] [laughter]\nOkay\nCorey with us on the car [laughter] you know where to show oh Corey how you doing\nA clerk I'm good how are you\nGreat thank you [noise] Corey you've got something that happened in your wife that's not a laughing matter\nIt's a good matter I mean we we were able to acquire are but unfortunately yes those after my wife says uh my wife's dad passed away\nWhile I'm very sorry about her loss\nWell thank you\nHow can I be of service in this situation\nBut cause us to take a look at our a auto insurance because we ah we added another car we had really looked at it in a while it kind of realize we might be paying too much for auto insurance and we started looking at our policy and we're kind of trying to figure out where we can save money with where everything's set out as far as our coverage\nSo are we are going to be adding a six sixteen and Seventeen year old son onto the policy within the next six months\nOh oh oh oh I just am here while I just take that and I even stab your wallet a lot 'cause that's what happens when you get a team driver on your insurance\nYes you know we're lucky enough though that we didn't have to buy a car\nTrue so or saving money there\nAny of the cars you have old enough that you can avoid taking a coalition and comprehensive on that vehicle\nYes and that's a matter of trying to solve it my wife but that was the one of the first thoughts along with um raising our deductibles\nYeah I'm a ... fan and raising the doctor moles okay and try to raise those two thousand that's usually if you're going to have any vehicle and you have has alone that may be the max here allowed to raise it to okay but that helps\nAnd you were a hundred miles so\nYeah it's a raise it to the thousand because you don't want to make a five hundred or claim on something between five hundred thousand dollars anyway now because the insurer will just eat you up on premiums so you want to avoid that and then\nHow old are your vehicles\nOur oldest vehicle is it's just a ... for\nYeah you only want to have liability on that one\nYeah but that's okay I thought so I was thinking to the other two are newer we have a two thousand Fifteen in the car we just got his uh two thousand ... so\nYou're a teenager needs to be driving the oh for if your wife will permit that\nYes I don't know how much longer we're going to have the four but yes that's going to be the one that is going to spend the most timing for sure\nSo sure as you are in this case there may be an advantage and talking with an independent agent\nOkay you know something people really don't do any more but there are agents that are like free agents and they quote various insurance companies and they've been there done that for a long time most of them are older because a lot of young people I have no interest in becoming an insurance\nFor older 'cause a lot of young people have no interest in becoming\nAn insurance agent and oh they're very experienced and can tell you based on how rates are set in your state and situations I'd done with new drivers were teenagers what's going to be the thing that will get you the best overall total premium\nOkay great sometimes depending on the state and our rates tend to be setting a state it may be a\nAdvantageous to have your son is the owner of that vehicle so are there and be on a separate policy and then at other places it may be better for him to only be named an additional driver with no specific vehicle assigned to\nPerfect a bachelor or the independent agent become so valuable because they know\nHow best to quote it and they can quote from many different companies\nThere are some what are known as direct writer companies are ones that you probably see pretty heavily advertised on TV they will not commission and independent nature and so the agent will not be able to quote those but don't have enough different companies that I can quote to you\nThat they'll be able to guide you best\nPerfect perfect yeah we've got some numbers already from friends later on down that path but it seems like it'd be very helpful to help somebody specific style\nAnd you got to make sure they're not what's it called a captive agent for example State Farm and all state the agents that right for them or what a notice captives they only for those companies and independent agent is not assigned to a specific company and they can quote many different ones\nGreat sort of independent agent okay\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show\n[noise] [noise]\nAn official methods for Medicare open enrollment than so now it's time to reopen might look at everything
