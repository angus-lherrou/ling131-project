I Am unable to come up with one person that can back it up\nThere she claims these parties and these gang rapes and the drug in the girls and she herself was pulled into the room and suddenly she was having sex with multiple boys the rural attacking her well\nIf you don't mind Steve this guy Dennis ...\nFormer weeknight meteorologist for channel seven or Washington won an Emmy in Nineteen Ninety five even ran a as a Democrat for Congress he sworn statement to the FBI and see you know what this\nHe sworn statement to the FBI and see you know what this is going to be but I Want everybody to listen to this I first met Julie sweat Nick at a D.C bar Ninety three going away party for a channel seven anchor\nHadn't drunk and the alcohol sat alone she approached it was beautiful well dressed he thought she was like a high in coal girl 'cause he said he weighed three on fifty pounds why would you want someone with me\nThere was no ... there was no conversation one exchange sex for money so he decided to talk with a ... minute never hit honoring the bar didn't leave with her next couple of weeks he would get together with her um\n[noise] so they start having conversations\nAnd I felt she only an interest in my three hundred pounds ... because I was on television was well known so she really likes him because he's a celebrity well here's here's where it starts to really get into the heart of the Marta I Want to remind people this is this guy comes forward sworn statement testimony penalty of perjury to the FBI\nAlthough we were not emotionally involved that was physical contact with sex despite the fact she was very sexually aggressive with me\nLike to talk about sex a lot during a conversation about sexual preferences things got derailed when Julie sweat Nick the third accuser no this is a Ninety three Steve told me she liked to have sex with more than one guy at a time in\nFact sometimes with several at one time she wanted to know if that would be okay in our relationship\nI asked her was this just a fantasy of hers she responded she first tried sex with multiple guys while in high school and still light did from time to time she brought it up because you want to know is this something\nThat he would be incident so he had no interest he also said she never said anything about sexually assaulted raped gang raped nothing never mentioned Brett Kavanaugh is zero so in Ninety six he's going to run for Congress he thought maybe she could help out with the primary campaign\nHe'd lost or number\nCalls her father to get it he talked with the father hey you know this is Dennis I'm going to run for Congress I'm thinking about trying to bring your daughter Julie sweating again the third accuser now help with the campaign the father now\nSays she has psychological and other problems [laughter] when I asked you would not go into detail and said listen you do not want her to work on the campaign and then he hung up\nAnd then he thought that was the end of it so this is her father saying listen my daughter\nHas psychological problems this is not someone you want working on the campaign and hangs up so this is the third accusing out and this guy by the way he is no reason\nTo come forward he is known in the DC area he was a meteorologist he then ran for Congress he's a Democrat\nBut why did he describes she tells him you know I have a lot of experience and again listen Steve you and I know judgment here\nIs that is what floats your boat then as Brett Kavanaugh would they have on hand at it if they if if there were some people that are into that type of thing if there are people into\nWhatever it may be swinging threes not a crowd to one won three of whatever it may be hey let's say twenty Eighteen right be independent and one is an open mind\nBut that paints a very different picture of this woman in the way she was portrayed in that interview with Kate Snow\nUnbelievable ... as I Want to make one comment okay there is one quick that's going around on a on a national TV national news when Jeff Flake was basically cornered in an elevator\nAnd it was being a ...\nBy choice we women okay and I tell you what John did you get that article I sent you maybe about a week ago okay I I don't know if it's\nWell I Know what you're going to say I'm not going to be able to punch line but go ahead because women in the elevator the women that are costing them you tell everyone who have they traced that they worked for\nAnd all three of them now seemingly on liars it undermines and under cuts the credibility ever everybody I think this whole me too movement that they've been charging with\nThey set the whole thing back\nBecause it out now who are you to believe that and but here is the thing women need to call out these women that make up these things and exaggerate these things and play upon and I believe all women I Believe all survivors that that is so dangerous and they have\nAre women I Believe all survivors that that is
