residency Obama residents in Washington\nCNN and also yesterday it had been reported the home of George Soros or actually it was the night before or after\nThe Kavanaugh hearings and what we saw how low they were willing to go it's and with some of the far\nExtreme elements ... let's face it when you're talking about you know in ... in what they're willing to do is I I agree with you this this is where we're on ... it's hard to rule out that somehow they're not\nAgain we're just speculating but somehow the the ... not planting these in order to fire up the left\nJob I I\nLike I get a thing I could still do today okay I'm John there is no new low ever said that ... know that they will try to sway this election and the Turks okay\nI I I've said that before but like I said there is something that's going to come out within the next week I don't know what it is it's almost like it's almost like we're trying to\nDo us any bigger than it bigger than this I mean this\nThis is you know right now I'm just reading will person after person violence is never OK reports of bombs into the homes of Obama ... deeply deeply disturbing America's better than this I'm seeing a lot of Republicans I just saw that was Ted Cruz Marco Rubio\nUm let me see uh\nI don't see anything tweeted out the White House has responded but but we're not wrong is there is going to be innocent Cooper suspicious package send to see in an office in New York tonnes Obama ... they're all being linked in in the same sentence I if\nI again this could be some nut that has done it we don't know we we don't know right now\nWho who is behind this so uh and I'm seeing some of the things have you ever quitting criticism of the media George ... incredibly shameful stop there's um [noise] we we don't know but right now I can tell you\nCNN is certainly all members of the media are very concerned about\nAh people to work at CNN in and just to step back with the human element if you were I had a family member I mean I I Know people that work at CNN I've been on some of the CNN programs are obviously when you hear a story like this\nIt is um you know very concerning and I I really think we have to wait you seem almost convinced so ready to this is just sat plot by the left to try to alter the mid term elections\nAbsolutely John and I'll tell you what I I Will not otherwise because you know what's gonna happen after\nThis well I mean unless they arrest somebody you know somewhere and they are I I mean I I don't know you say otherwise I mean we have to wait and see\nNormally you would think the FBI will be able to track down something like this uh this is all just developing right now as far as this investigation and to be suspicious packages\nBut I think the most important thing to report is that\nNo one has been harmed they're described as explosive devices the one in the scene in a newsroom I Believe or the mail room excuse me\n... they said they were wires attached to it that's something that would kind of jump out um ... you know it needs to be determined where were these truly explosive devices that could have gone off or was this some kind of a hoax\nChoose you know if you take some residue or some explosive powder and put it into a box and put some wires attached to it and then a hoax just designed to draw attention to this but that there was never a potential that anyone was ever going to be harmed that part we don't know\nThat's exactly right John but I'll tell you what is why it's by okay again is\nThat the Democrats ... they're treading water\nAnd they will they will still to new lows in order to sway this that term elections that's [noise]\nThat's again that's just my opinion yeah we've said and in the past we've seen how they will actually ruin the lives of paypal or getting nominated to the Supreme Court okay they will actually done a great point\nOkay they will actually denigrate is the point where it was it was it was almost like whether I mean it was virtually slander John\n... and again it's just oh robots or where John as sure about where the direction of this country is at a ... and you match\nAnd you'll just meant it Nancy Pelosi ... house speaker\nI and we were a little bit away from that\nRight now I mean it could happen if they take the house\nWe need to wait and see exactly where this thing breaks out and again folks the
