I'll give them credit they allow for to be conversational I think there were opportunities\nTo jump in a little bit more and go after White House and some of the things he said and the judge\nWho's used to more maybe the decorum of a traditional debate did not see those opportunities but something very significant came out last night now I like can you see a lot I liked him white a lot I respect them a lot\nBut for the life of me this story\nAnd folks I don't know why it's not being reported more but if you watched it last night this story about White House leaking the story\nAbout the fake raping Newport this is even worse than I thought and if you don't mind the play along I Want to play it is for everyone this came out last night this is so much worse than I thought\nBecause I thought initially the report was that Senator Whitehouse this guy from timber then called his office he said he'd information my judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulting a woman aboard a boat in Newport in Nineteen eighty five White House to pass the inflammation along to the FBI but then he also\nGave the constituent this guy Jeffrey ... from temperate in a reporter's information but what we learned last night\nWas not only did he give\nPass on the information the reporter had the full story and White House feels heated the responsible thing because then the end now we've learned is a journalist by I mean it's a a a print reporter by the way because he said it wasn't published\nBut I Can't get over that White House says well I was responsible because the printed let me play this was White House last night in the debate [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWell the part in that first of all what he was saying was not true because the committee\nAsk judge Kavanaugh about this new port situation 'cause then judge Kavanaugh or even said they had me on boats boats Newport when I cannot believe\nIs number one and I this is constructive criticism I for the life of me to not understand why Kim white intent nice he did not say the White House who was the reporter\nThat you gave that story too in White House is saying the responsible thing was that they didn't run with the story why did they have the story in the first place the there was a great story let me play again this is where they didn't bring up the whole thing again [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] it was only ...\nNever re in with the story this is worse than I thought I thought I mean so so some reported didn't have the story she fed the story tour reporter and\nThen but what an editor who decided to go with it and what about like this is absolutely oh we just said he did this\nDeal I mean that is incredible and again I I I like those guys if I'm sitting there I I think it's a fair question to say senator since you're on the topic who the hell was the reporter that you gave the story to\nJohn ... and a judge splinter this comment on that issue where is that since ... comments from your comments on this why you you're a parish which is a state of Rhode Island\nYou're a parish which is a state of Rhode Island\n[noise] but like I said I'm\nA debate last night it was I think it was you know of it I don't think it changed anyone's mind if you're if you're a shove the White House reporter by all means elect after another six years\nBut I was John as far as I'm sure isn't it bearish state of Rhode Island yeah and I say I they judge whether this will make a like at the center for an eye\nOr a better word out again and it it's hard on they thank you Steve I'm a very very\nGood analysis in your part Sheldon also said he said he wouldn't abolish ice I Would like to have where he feels about sanctuary cities driver's licenses I'm open borders I Would like to have hurt him pin down on that Sheldon Whitehouse also said last night that he um [noise]\nHe also said that he supports the players that don't stand for the flag I thought that was another opening for things that resonate I also think Senator Whitehouse last night portrayed himself\nAs someone who works on both sides of the aisle and I thought judge Flanders did a very good job Bob plan is to me did a very good job pointing out\nThat Sheldon Whitehouse is ranked\nAs one of the top nine most partisan senators that are out there top ten top ten most partisan I'm ... in in defense of judge Flanders and Bob plan to sweat again I like a lot and I support and I will be voting for\nIt's it's not easy um I thought ... that just when they talked about the guy in Newport Tim white and Ted nice immediately pivoted come on and Carolyn\nShe says I Want to know that to I'd like to know um [noise]\nYeah you're right it Chris good question if lenders have done that they were asked to the reporter was also says he works in public safety you're exactly right Fischer\nHe is ... ah that that to me was the most surprising it's not only that he fed distorted the media the reporter actually had\nThe reporter absolutely had it now I've heard it is possibly this woman that works for the New Yorker with Ronan Farrow\nAnd Sheldon Whitehouse the saying the the responsible thing was they didn't run the story why did they even have the story it was a fake story\nI think that was a missed opportunity I thought those guys and again I Can't keep saying I thought it was a little unfair you know do you feel it was wrong for Trump to mock Christie doctor for it at the rally do you think that would like [noise]\nSome of that stuff boy there are a lot of questions about President Trump and there weren't any questions to me about the actions of Dianne Feinstein Cory Booker\nBlumenthal all all those despicable left people a Democrat senators that a despicable that I despise\nThat do ... Sheldon Whitehouse is down in Washington for one reason\nAnd that is to obstruct anything that President Trump wants to do\nAnd I I think he kind of got away last night by portraying himself as like oh well you know I got along with John McCain\nSo I I ... I had a little bit of a ... I did have a problem with that we'll talk about it though I'll play you some more sound\nSeven six six Thirteen eighty Joe ... is going to talk to me coming up folks you can call and you can email me John at ... dot com no I Apologize I did discover I had a minor problem with my email if I were was not responding to the past couple of days it was it was an email problem on my end\nBut it is Jay ... at ... dot com [noise] hey I Want to remind you about Brian's appliance repair center\nA coal mine if your appliances dying Paul Ryan repairs on all makes the models of appliances washers dryers dishwashers stoves refrigerators microwaves garbage disposal they also hook up natural gas in propane appliances if you have an appliance that needs to be converted\nFrom natural gas propane called Bryant's appliance repair\nAt seven one oh Seventy Ninety six seven ten Seventy Ninety six and Ryan is terrific to folks have told the story we had a problem with our dryer just did a wash right closed nice and clean pop 'em in the drier the dry won't stay on [noise]\nA and and what I said was I didn't do it while we're still going to charge we're going to charge you could argue with in court or you can plead no low and if you please no low we will basically hold a file for a year if nothing else happens it'll be totally dismissed\nAnd the ... and and it will be a ... it will\n... with ...\nHold on I have a question so you inadvertently there who say hit him the fourteen year old and then they do on earth in one one one okay like we may be back can't know what I Would swing in my arms around All right but somehow hit them so did he start crying or anything no\nUm so I'm All right but somehow hit them so did he start crying or anything no he didn't he goes home tells the parents are the parents call you or they just called the political\nElites alright though we're not talking at this point because yeah it arguing okay about the kids with the bike\nSure do the police come to your rent so they just call you on the on it called me on the phone\nAnd say well you didn't come down to the principal East Asia are wrecked oh jeez wow that's not pleasant All right so you go to the police station they say the than other families not they are they just called it in the way they must have talked to the police maybe they went to the police station\nWell I'm sure they do they look to the police kind of it's the police that this happened the\nNews saying I didn't do it they say well we have to charge you anyway right ... All right go ahead\nI'm Sorry oh ... well they say there was a simple thing at EPA forty years ago you know I Know in times of hurting them nor did I heard him up and we later became friendly and\nYou know we read Dr and Cranston I mean I grew up in age but but is that we we read is that in the Glenn hill section of Cranston hills okay right which is Illinois section by the way right All right I don't know how did you\nWho move first you move after that enable him I mean who the hell want oh now there is still living there she filling that she's still living there yeah\nWell that didn't help relationships between the two families actually became friendly after that say that you're kidding yes after the press charges yup\nYup so you are to plead no low right jeeze what was your reaction like in the low hustled after that\nIt was no big deal why are you making a big deal out of John Doe no I'm just asking I'm just trying to his asking you're giving me oh that was all\nI think that's unusual at that time simply because I was saying earlier\nThis was the time period where I knew kids to play to the edge when eagles sometimes the coaches would like to rough up the players I went to Catholic school sometimes the nuns would hit someone when I went to ... sometimes the brothers of the teachers would some say how you know crack a kid\nIt to me it it it was on time and at the time that someone actually been filed charges the way their family did that's all I'm pointing right All right okay go ahead ...\nSo my my point here is this is the phone team with the dirty tricks trying to try to hurt me and you know I can deal with it why don't we talk about Allan Fung killed a guy in an accident on Ninety five he shot the body Ninety six feet in the air\nAnd he was charged with killing ... yes\nThat was pleaded down and the file was sealed it just so happens that Alan ... family had a Chinese restaurant across the street from the police department\nIt all the cops and crafts and used to go in there and and he so he was well connected to the craft of police so that he goes out any I is the mafia lawyer John ... to defend them well why don't we talk about that I mean\nTo me why do you what do you want to tell us about that the way I remember that story was four years ago\nHe held a press conference he was very emotional\nAnd the way I heard the story remember it he was Nineteen years old he was a college student driving home it was early on Saturday morning he fell asleep and there was someone changing a tire a Ninety five he ran into the person change the way I remember a changing the higher they were out in the\nFall asleep well if he fell asleep you wouldn't have to seal the file the file is sealed I say he was drunk or on drugs ... and we're not\nGoing to hell proven wrong as your whole unless he agrees to open the file so unsealed a file al and\nI didn't know that nothing of islands sealed or anything but it was early in the morning it was early in the morning like really annoying\nYeah with no traffic on the road\nSo he's claiming a black though once in his life so this is the only time you're black though once you kill somebody\nAnd and you just say well there was are fortunate actually it was I'm not saying it wasn't an eye on right right but many times actions are caused by what people are doing at a given time they read the drinking too much they're on drugs that are on something and that causes them to fall asleep or pass out or whatever\n[noise] All right again I I don't remember anything involving I Know he was happy accident and I don't remember anything about that there was a possibility of drugs or alcohol I thought it was merely he fell asleep at the wheel someone was outside the car changing\nAs a result hired on like Ohio is sealed and he won't release it ...\nThat I don't I did not know the the violence sealed yeah\nAll right so you know you want to talk about me bumping Nick ... yellow I bumped what can I say\nAll right now listen I Want to hear your version of the story let me tell you want to I I Would think that and go on and as soon\nAs the patio toward over the years I had an opportunity to watch him turn into a flying a fine person\nHe you know he turned into a good person and I think it was a bad person but I you know you when you grow up next to somebody and you see this kid grow up in front of your eyes and then he ... he comes into the general assembly and it becomes the speaker of the house I kinda felt a sense of pride about him I got to tell you\nA sense of pride that you had him [laughter] All right let you have a conversation with oh\nCome on let's get back to the race now right now um\nThere's a debate next Monday Night that is not televised right there is I Will be out radio it's going to be on radio and it's going to be at night which is again it would help if it was on television where people can see it but so far as well they're going to stream it live\nStreaming live okay and then it is also there's going to be a channel tend to be I Believe that Governor Mondo has agreed to November for November first alright right now\nDoes the ... adds to the pillow campaign you are Joe ... do you still see a path to victory I do okay I Do and ... ... some point\nI mean obviously you're getting a lot of publicity there's no question about that I've seen the commercials um do you have your here with us but is there some things that have to\nHappen in order for you to get in the position you want to be\nA there are some things that have to have him by going to tell you what they are okay\nBut ... and ... and do you think they're going to happen I think they're going to happen yeah okay now I'm about one more one more question this allegation of but not allegation you say there's no difference between mayor fun in Gina Raimondo correct okay now Mayor Quan\nMayor ... has been a Democrat all his life All right I'm a Republican when he decided to run for the council see look at his history and it talks about how he's changed his mind as he's grown he's introduced a bill introduced gun banning legislation when he was a councilman and Cranston\nHe's against sanctuary cities your against saying he has his actuary\nCities because he knows I'm again\nBecause you are but wouldn't it be fair to say that a nagging\nA sanctuary city his city police department is running with the same rules as the Providence police department which basically is a community policing act which says you can't turn over anybody the ice you can't ask the second person in a car for identification you after for filling\nYou can't ask for a second person in a car for identification you after four fill out a full report every time you talk to somebody or that your question and it's it's all the nonsense that's killing the city of Providence that's what the the craft the police department is operating\nOn governor he's operating a sanctuary city\nNever governor among do is again is in favor of sanctuary cities so on that issue isn't it fair to say the two of you are closer on that issue than him and\nHer no he's with her on the issue I'm telling you he's running a sanctuary city near the chief of police department said we are operating the same way the city of Providence and suffer for free shut it on the radio\nSheet you feel so in your mind Joe and again we're folks that show true low independence\nDay coming about even close to being a conservative he's just I understand that you want to go wherever he thinks the wind is like you feel they're going to give him the most went on to say\nNo no difference between him or Gina Raimondo as governor\nThey're both Democrats either one of them pick your poison\n[laughter] he's a Republican candidate a job\nThat doesn't mean anything to me [laughter] doesn't mean anything to me if you're if you're basically running a criminal enterprise which has been accused of by the state police and it continues to this day he's doing all kinds of other stuff he basically not a good guy you know when you take a wimp\nAnd you give 'em a little bit of power he uses that power because he's used to be in a way of life and he did that with the craft of police departments\nI really want to trust them with Rhode Island state police I don't think ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city":
