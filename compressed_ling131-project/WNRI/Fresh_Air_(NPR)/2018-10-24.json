the former President Bill and Hillary Clinton\nAlso a package center they Time Warner building homes or CNN in New York City that has a building in Manhattan completely evacuated currently and we're

of\nMichigan who is in the I mean John that show the story\nOf how how how I\nFelt good afternoon welcome a month's time we're gonna continue to monitor this ongoing situation and they continue to develop there was a press conference right now have a ... vote for twelve forty five in New York when he carried that\nBut now I Am hearing you just heard now they're saying that a package the suspicious packages found at the office of New York governor Andrew Cuomo I'm also seeing suspicious package found near the offices of representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz in Florida so to date just to bring up just to speed no one has been harmed\nBut suspicious packages had been found versus sorry George Soros residents in New York the Clintons Hillary Clinton's resident in ... she was a whole\nAh that again no one has been harmed but it seems to be similar suspicious packages\nAnd then the the big one that is drawing the most attention is not only that the Obama residents of Washington DC but CNN CNN was aback you waited so we will continue to follow the story the good news right now it's just that no one in back has been harmed\nBut let's talk about the elections that's in two weeks from today folks joining us right now he is the political economy reporter for WPRI dot com and he is the best\nAnd I want to say good afternoon to had nice even after new ten o'clock news on that me on\nBy any or anything you want or at or any thoughts or anything else you've heard on just the national breaking story regarding these these suspicious packages well\nYeah I mean it's obviously I'm alarming anytime you eat it or you know see what happened at the un and on the little or it was about to work or use organization at a time nobody was hurt it sounds like you were right on this uh I always\nCaution people in breaking news situations information comes in so fast from so many places that sometimes the initial report um can have details a little off or wrong I see no court that Andrew Cuomo's office has said he didn't get to know where I look at that and then we're at work I mean when you did that he had\nSo I'm just in time where people don't trust the media is not recorders trying it out I think it's just\nIt's so hectic during breaking news that you always wanna you know listening to the news but a\nSteak cautious about how it every detail of it is true and and the earth\nIs exactly right and the same thing was initially report that one had been delivered to the White House in Annapolis walk that is well let's focus on line and let's start off let's focus on the governor's race relaxed in two weeks to go a governor ... is it really incredible it is it is just\nNon stop bombardment of the airwaves she seems to be in the commanding position there is I Believe just one debate laughed unless something else pops up but just today as we speak\nHow to use return of the three candidates how do you see the um the shape of the ... campaign\n[noise] well I think you're right I mean look we knew the governor would have a lot of money going in the air on writing like crazy and she got it off and she's always had a big network of donors and I think you're seeing now why\nYou know while she's been doing many times for that she got to pay a lot of shifts much money we don't eating it\nWhy she's still in it which is it and let her just absolutely dominate the airwaves um you know one small thing in a campaign about it\nYou know if you have a lot of money like the governor does she can run multiple ads that much so you might see during the news or you're an attack ad against their own and they remember in ... but that positive at it\nAnd that means she can they can put out multiple ... and that some of the like the ... a lot of money you\nThe messages and that's some of the flexibility a lot of money gives you\nUm and I think the other thing is you know their stuff we're not seeing day to day where that money is going to be\nA Democrat historically in Rhode Island know how to run a very solid ground you know get out the vote drives a knocking on doors every Monday and Sheldon Whitehouse of working together on that and so that's a place we won't really see the effects of that ground game until election day but\nWe did it seem to do a lot for her in the primary where she did so well against background so\nI think generally speaking the governors ah seems seems pretty pleased with where they are but\nUh I Would say when I talk to them they're not overconfident because they know she'd never been super popular and uh you know their phone was always seem to them a credible and formidable candidate and his success and Cranston so\nI don't think you're going to see them take their foot off the gas at all because I think they think what helped them as being very very aggressive\nKid when people hear about to get out the vote effort\nAnd they hear the word canvassing I don't think a lot of people fully understand what's involved with that the effort or how effective it can be just last week you know I adore bell rings there's three people standing out there they were with rap\nOr I won't say who it is but they specifically for my Nineteen year old daughter she was home no she's away knowledge was use the mail ballot\nBut what a lot of people don't know is now I Know in me the ... people had he was told me over forty heat canvassers now these people volunteers that came to my home with forty paid canvassers\nOut in the street in may\nIn what they do it in mind saying you can go but they they didn't fight every possible voter they just don't go up to the door they knew we were actually who they're looking for identify them try to make contact with them and then build the voter base my question is\nDo we have an idea is it is it even more at this point with volunteers ... paid staff I Know it's it's it's probably she's probably running the most extensive get off the boat campaign the seat has ever seen\nIt's got to be right up there John I mean I Know there are now also volunteers um ... you have again it's a complex because you're cross over you have the ... campaign itself\nOf voters who in some cases for advocating for the governor and as you say you're you're making a bet yeah if the governor's race was the top story every night and and the ... campaign you know kept hitting home runs with air attacks and whatnot\nMaybe they were you know be able to do that but right now if you say it's getting very by the world even the fact that you know President Trump referred to slaughter Republican uh she likes the spotlight and he makes a lot of news every single day and you know\nThat I think that does have some benefits are Republican than it does\nBenefit president away then certain places but on the other hand it's ... and it like Alan ... who is trying not to be associated with the president it really doesn't help you because he's getting a news attention you're not on the news as much and you don't really want him on the news in a state like Rhode Island where he's not\nHe had that definitely comes into play Ted before we let you go now she's coming back to the governor's race we we don't know where it's going to go uh\nObviously the Raimondo people from day one have taken the funk campaigned very seriously they've had to have guns aimed on him and his incredible in the course of an hour when I'm watching ... news\nI Will see three ... ads and you're right now she they have the resources as a positive one is the one about the guy it's very effective is walking through looks like a factory or a positive\nIf senator from the manufacturing associate\nAnd then boom then the ... next one is a negative in his like double barrels I ... you don't we don't know where things are going to end up with Joe ... but at the very least true law has been a tremendous distraction during the campaign in since the primary for the ... campaign\nI agree with you I think you know first I I was thinking about social kind of the way we thought about Bob ill the last time which was how many votes will you get a ... got ... percent and then twenty fourteen as time has gone on\nYou know I'm not sure I see a path for Joe Torre to build up a lot of votes but that doesn't mean you won't have an effect because as you say John he's\nHe's kind of in the mind of the other campaign you know the time on the campaign spent dealing with and the time he eats up in the ... or even the fact that you know you're if if like a war where you're you have two different armies advancing on your own campaign yet Raimondo attacking you in the east\nAnd then throw it you know what you're trying to react like individual in the western part offend me there but I Need or the real battles in the east you know that it helped her campaign particularly one which in the end fewer resources as the ... campaign it so I think\nThat has ... the trailer challenge has been more about his effect I think in the media and in debates and in that than the actual number of votes I tend to get even the fact that a mere on his new attack ad you know most of it's about the governor and you had\nA mere on his new attack ad you know most of it's about the governor and you have to make sure it started with an attack on jokes furloughs tells me they they can't take for granted still if this late they still need to have a negative message out of our attitude at the end\nIt is and even when you have the you know the bad story of the police report and everything else as much as the ad blitz city you see them eating up oxygen and it's taking away and there's only so many ... minutes in the news cast is only so many pages in the newspaper or they don't it's just it's it's just valuable time\nFinal question before we let you go and again folks who speak with the great kidney see WPRI dot com [noise]\nUm what do you think about turnout though I'm two years ago it was a presidential election\nThere if if if your Republican if they want to make jeans at\nThe general assembly in the state house in the state yeah it is the ... year to kind of do with how do you think's going to turn out for um for for turnout on election day\nYou know I I think I'm a lot more humble John after twenty sixteen between Bernie Sanders from [noise] even if\nYou're married with turnout was higher than I Do I say I really feel that if I was looking at what's happening nationally are looking at all showing very high interest in both political parties and\nI think we're going to be a pretty strong turnout and\nThe Republicans in Rhode Island I think is it a lot of that turnout is people who are frustrated with the president like we've seen a you know in some of the polls are bluer states like Rhode Island and you have this big turnout operation like we were talking about that the governor and Senator Whitehouse or running\nYou know a lot of people don't know the names of their state rep so when they if they come in to vote for governor among though in the White House and they're mad at president or something is going to fill out democratic candidates all the way down the ballot and sometimes a general assembly candidate you thought they could get swamp so I think [noise]\nYou know I think I think it's shaping up in a different way for the [noise] they really need to\nHave a really neat and they're on the flows strong\nSo that you know the stronger the evidence they get along with such planners I think the better off all the other Republicans on the ballot would be um and I think a lot of it will be a turnout game the how much this machine built by room onto and White House\nTurns out the vote that they really hard to know that and help but think I'll be standing there and jump over don't wanting the returns that everybody else\nWho she is a political reporter WPRI dot com it's terrific he's had these he had great to talk to you will talk to you again\nOn our folk\nTheory has had an easy joining us on the John ... show now again we are juggling we're breaking news out of Washington let me just happen here to a Fox News again or\nAs we move on so it's interesting that they are talking of course if we don't know the details of the motivation behind all of this you're you're looking at it with their forensic background\nEither way I Try to get more they have been suspicious packages sent 'em explosive devices I Believe right now there was a tentative press a press conference separate twelve forty five that we will carry but to date suspicious packages sent to\nHillary Clinton to President Obama into CNN in the CNN is the visual that really is dominating the airwaves because they had to evacuate CNN time water officers officers in offices in that is what I'm obviously\nUm [noise]\nNow you know here we go Philippe Reines long time Hillary Clinton side just known MSNBC says we have to ask how responsible President Trump is for these suspicious package of tax because of the rhetoric\nI mean here we go this is where they immediately they we don't know the cause of anything on this or who's behind it\nAnd right now there were already are jumping into the fact\nThat that they're trying to blame 'em\nBlame the president for we just checked return address on least too suspicious devices belong to be in the official Debbie Wasserman Schultz so uh now now there's some copycats or other things San Diego union Tribune evacuated or I don't I don't know what to make of that\nUm the ... thing\n\nLet's see CNN CBS has offered reached out off it helped to CNN dirtier evacuation 'em me also just quiet for folks a check on Twitter\nSarah Sanders suspicious packages so as of now they have these packages were going to have to wait and see no one has been\nUm [noise]\nNo one has been harmed in any of this and the suspicious packages are showing up\nA\nAt those those are the three big name locations the residents of\nPresident Obama Hillary Clinton CNN Debbie Wasserman Schultz Soros by but possible targets a potential explosives that is the latest that we know and already apparently\nOn MSNBC they're already already starting to blame President Trump even though we don't know there's nothing behind the to back it up\nAnd we just see this police investigating suspicious package at the building in San Diego where the San Diego union Tribune is located evacuations underway well there's obviously you know in a situation like this\nThere was either copycats or there are people that have been just afraid of 'em it out of abundance of caution anyone as you can imagine nerves then go on and so we'll follow that will we will see if in fact they did have um\n[noise] let's see\n\nOkay well that that is in fact the latest justice packages no one has been harmed it's obviously gaining a getting tremendous attention and specifically because of the evacuation of CNN [noise] that is getting the biggest so I Believe there's still a press\nConference coming up a twelve forty five but we'll try to carry that for you in the meantime seven six six Thirteen eighty seven six six Thirteen eighty you can email me John at ... dot com John at ... dot com he folks I Would remind you if you're having a problem\nSo what they want that that's why they asked the NFL back legislation on it it's all about race and it's all about your sentences for drug dealing\nWith your right on the money about Joe is you know it it's incredible\nThat more and more and\nI don't know if we want to blame President Obama for this but everything is becoming so divided in the form of if there is a candidate of color\nThen all the ... the voters of color vote for that person if there are a Latino candidate than all the Latino vote for that and you're also now starting to see in gender where all these female candidates\nI think it was do you remember the uh um it was Nancy Pelosi are dying and find sign that said there's a special place in hell for any woman that didn't vote for Hillary Clinton\nAll of these women candidates they automatically expect all women to just vote for them there there's where it's it's amazing ... we're moving beyond\nWho's the best possible person for the job everything is becoming a if you're a woman you're supposed to vote for a woman if you are\nA a person of color will then you're automatically supposed to vote for the person of color\nI I don't see any diversity with that you know they they criticize women that don't vote for the women they quoted criticize people I ended up when I was in Washington I interviewed diamond in silk and they're criticizing the black community 'cause they support President Trump\nAnd there's definitely a feeling in Providence that if you don't support Nelly go be a mayor lords it's like you know what's wrong with you how you're a Latino that's who you should be voting for you're exactly right on the money trail\nThat you're John ... and that's why I wanted to call and ask you about the debate because you educate me oh every day\nI light duty Whitman alive she's trying I I ... thank you for the call Joe ... seven six six Thirteen eighty I just don't know if she's going to have enough time it's less than two weeks to go name recognition is big I know they're trying\nAnd they're trying tremendously to get her out around the city\nIt's almost a shame that she doesn't have the election is November sex that's not changing if the election was December sex she her chances might be better\nPeople are already voting by the way emergency voting is underway now they call it emergency boating I call it early voting but the voting is already underway so as we speak there are people that are already voted\nAnd one of the dangers of that is they could be something major that happens and\nIt's too late people have already voted and remember when you go and vote emergency boat you don't have to have a doctors do you really don't have an excuse you could just go to your town hall Monday through friday tell them a yeah I Need an emergency ballot and you don't have to show ID\nNow
