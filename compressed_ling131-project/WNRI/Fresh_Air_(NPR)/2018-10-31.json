were ... people giving to the ... campaign now that that should be a surprise don't tell me that that's not a surprise because that is unprecedented that it's never happened before as a matter of fact there's never been anything close to ... remotely close to that\nAnd anyone that wants to say well you know that's just the way it is and to do that that that that is wrong\nThat is not in the um\n[noise] that is not an element of that's the way it works and there's no surprise or excuse me I completely disagree with that and Carolyn ... business how to stay works no surprise blatantly violating finance laws\nThat's what it is but folks this is also part of the problem so Carol or a Carolyn material you can call in when someone says this is how it works do surprise well then let's\nLet's let's go in and and I also folks I asked the question I had posted on my Facebook page do you trust Gina Raimondo\nAnd it was overwhelming the amount of people in fact I Love to find that that said no they don't trust Gina Raimondo so don't ... well no surprise there that's the way the state works that that's incorrect\nThat deal because she's got to do this for about ... you say John if we're just going to let it out a letter to fly a ... right and we're going to make sure that we get it done [noise]\nMan phone again folks were speaking with Chris me around and found were going to let him go and just a moment but Mr Mayor again this is um I Want everyone listening to understand that this is unprecedented territory worried we knew she had a lot of money we know you know to run for office you need to raise money to fund campaign have done that\nThere's been this whole way there's no way also to dispute the whole furlough situation has been a disruption if this was a one on one race I think that would have shown polls showing us had a or would have been too close to call without question regardless of motive he in fact\nHas been a distraction but but Gina Raimondo to give Joe ... a gift of one hundred thousand\nThat Tim ... is corruption that the average Rhode Island or can understand they may not understand all the ins and outs of D.C why apple this and that but they can understand that she gave him one hundred thousand dollars ... or to help his campaign\nRight and what a a everyone knows that joke\nEver win this race is just a spoiler vote for him is going to be a vote for as those cop ask her dishonesty and that's what we can't afford it and I'm going to show that night I went to college in the last debate our channels are\nEmerging all your listeners to tune in because I'm going to take it to her John this is that you know we've got to take our state back save our stay on the only one that's been a big no real change that's\nTo shake it up cut taxes cuts jeeze cut through the regulation just like what I've done it creates it\nAnd make our state or the best places to live in America\nAnd Mr Mayor before we let you go again you know this time comes down to trust I posted a question\nDo you trust Gina Raimondo and it was overwhelmingly I'll have to try to find it but it was over four hundred comments if you want to hold those votes are people saying no people don't trust her in this to me becomes the issue now to me this is what the debate is all about tomorrow night and this is\nCan she be trusted people don't trust her\nThey know she has her eye on the national stage but for her to give a gift\nOf one hundred thousand dollars may have fun ... the number of people that they spend money to try to win that through the lottery or you know save money and everything else and she she ... I just found it do you trust Gina Raimondo three hundred and sixty comments\nForty three years and they're all saying no people don't trust her and now we learn\nGave Joe blow one hundred [laughter] dollars man I just I Can't get past it to me that just\nTen dollars man fucking I just I Can't get past it to me that jumps out more than anything else on I'll give\nYou the final word on of all the things that have happened this one is uh this one I've never seen before where I mean she did she gave him an illegal gift of one hundred thousand ... hearing there's even more to come out with where he's been getting some of his money in the trailer campaign but this one she can't run away from and\nYou're saying you're not going to ask you're you're you're not going to ask her if there's some kind of a deal\nYou know I'm going to call out on it\nJust put it because quite honestly she's going to lie about it really shows like she can't be trusted in either\nA kid jokes fall short hair and trust that as well as Trader Joe's which showed that he's got a thousand dollars a mailer off it ...\nThe number one million bucks you and I both come from groups that I read that\nThat is how to use that I'm all the different people that she could give this to other people like you don't get people do get that money inherited people don't get jobs that pay that and she just handed it over to him that is corruption she might as well uh put it in a brown paper bag for crying out loud\nOn I don't even make that much in myself\nRight that's right most people don't want hundred thousand but\nI Would like to hear her I'm just telling and I'm going to go as a voter\nAs a resident of the state as a taxpayer I Would like to hear her on the record say\nThat in the next twelve months or twenty four months or four years in office that where there's not going to be any type of pay off that we can connect to her I Know you're saying that she's going to lie about it but I still like to hear her say that because then at least the ... can be played back\nAnd then we would have her on the record end it could come back to haunt her with her presidential run that she wants to jump she's got a jump out of the state anyway some air on its tomorrow night I commend you and your team for putting out this release because like I said I was riding along it was at a red light I saw it\nI heard it said one hundred dollars and I thought it said ten thousand and then try self I thought there's no way it's ... it's actually one hundred thousand that they filed that is illegal is against the law\nOne hundred thousand dollar gift for crying out loud maybe I should have run for governor against you if she was going to hit it on a hundred jeeze for crying\nOut loud I may not joking around\nIdaho that two\nHundred percent ...\nI'll tell you one last thing this is the momentum ... do you need a going into the final weekend this isn't\nBecause I'm already getting emails from people that were independent voters saying that they were for different reasons leaning towards her saying well you know a ... mixed up in the mud and that's part of the problem though you know if if a pig grabs you impose you know you're going to fight and defend yourself so you're trying to fight that off\nBut I Am independent voters women emailing me saying\nThat if this is the ... case they're not voting for Gina Raimondo because this is Corey let's call it for what it has been your phone and you're being a gentleman but business corruption at the highest levels I mean she might as well we might as well go back\nTo one hundred thousand dollars in a brown paper bag dropped off and that's what it comes out I mean that's what it is and it was a my words aren't yours but this is absolutely unprecedented is slimy it's illegal and she needs to be held accountable for and I'll give you the final word\nShouted that I work in a way to work at our big show that you know everyone I trusted elders to sit through the garbage you know maybe it does it but I you know of course there is there a mascot a political\nOne last say tomorrow night the debate listen this is it ignored Gilbert in North Carolina and she didn't want her\nJust go at it you know balance anti you know I Know gee you know he ... he'll give you a room just keep going back and it's got to come back to this this is it did this to me is the debate it comes down to trust people don't trust her and these moves may get us a question of trust and that's what people have\nTo ask themselves do they really trust Gina Raimondo\nAs governor for the next four years and the answer is ... you know the one person that can beat her the one person that can rescue us from his reign of error is is ... you ... you have our support Mr Mayor go get him tomorrow night All right this job\nFor various Cranston mayor Allen Fung bell and I needed right now at twelve twenty seven uh I did posted do you trust Gina Raimondo look at a three hundred and sixty comments and all of them basically saying no I mean that is absolutely outrageous um\n[noise] boy I like some of the comments being posted Republicans who stay home elect Democrats and that is funny about the one million dollars that is incredible and or good afternoon to everybody tuning in on a F. B. live a law says she should have given the money to the veterans why not sit there and we need one to shed light on the truth is incredible\nUm when you fight with page you're going to get money that is true David Hopkins that is what happens ah Rachel Green day she needs to be asked she she has to be asked she has to be asked\nUm I don't know about rock it's definitely illegal you know what's amazing is this is the sitting governor thumbing her nose right ad campaign finance you you can't make these type or expenditures and ... just tuning in folks it is now they have to fill out these different reports\nAnd there were ... people in the Democrat Party have filed the report and they gave a gift of one hundred thousand dollars to independent candidates Joe trouble\nWhy how many people's let me again asked the crowd and if you live give me a thumbs up if you would like to see Gina Raimondo show up at lane gene as evil also Shia\nHow many people an FBI let's say a thumbs up would like to see Raimondo shows up at your doorstep you know like ed McMahon would do a publishers clearinghouse and hand you a check for one hundred thousand dollars\nI'll be first of the list\nI wasn't kidding by you know they were given out a hundred genes I Would have run for governor this Janet ... you can't do you believe this\nIn ... and I'm getting email about this Dr ... how about that\nHow about that Dr Lisa hey you go here's one hundred thousand\nYou know these stories have you read the prince of Providence\nA fiancee is to get huge amounts of money right the felon fifty thousand brown and the envelopes of cash one hundred thousand of cash when he um\nIf you read the prince of Providence\nUm you'll find the whole reason fancy got rid of the ...\nWas because in fact that he wanted to put it out to a bit because the private contractors would pay him off and in the book the prince of Providence by Mike stay in that I I'll I'll bring it and read it tomorrow but anyhow they talk about\nAnd when I have spoken up and I get it on social media like you can't even imagine ... so but that's just you know I that's okay I can take it but that's the way they come after you I'll posts on social media I don't think\nThat these Caribbean people should be allowed where they're talking about they're going to rush the gates that is why President Trump has to send the troops down to the border and stop them from coming in and people are putting\nThat's because you're a racist has nothing to do with it I Would say that about anything I Would say that about I should say anyone from another country that is not the right way that is not the right way to try to enter into our country\nWrong and I'm not going to be intimidated by that and the progressives and they're out there in the name calling is insane\nAnd the remarks they make and uh you know just the other day you're you know Europe beget why what am I a big ... well the comment you made about the caravan\nListen there there is a procedure to follow okay if you have a group of people and they want to rush the gates to get into Fenway Park\nAnd the security stopping them because they don't have tickets does that make the security guards bigots and racist no there was law and order awards last night all we are a city a melting pot and we welcome them all in and my message to the Caribbean people Romano\n... by the way she wants to send mail ballots to the people in the caravan [laughter]\nBecause she knows that they want to come to an island\nIs it they should be allowed to vote I Want to be very clear it doesn't make you a racist there's nothing wrong to not be intimidated by that someone sent me a post or that they put on Facebook\nOr one of our listeners I won't say who it is and she said something about or shared I don't think these Caribbean people should be allowed into the country and then all these comments that's 'cause you're a racist that's because you're a big it\nAh oh I didn't know that you know your such a hateful person that you know look at the name calling that goes on that is that is asinine\nThat is absolutely no your someone that believes in following the rule of law these people need asylum Mexico was offered him asylum they don't want it because they keep saying no I Want to come to America and his Fifteen thousand of them and they want to you know bum rush or bull rush through the gates\nThat that we are not a third world nation we are not a mob that then we just allow people to infiltrate liked that\nWrong but what I Want you to know is if you feel that way to not be intimidated by that crowd they're nasty and mean they are the most vicious people look at last night\nJeff deal did great in that debate last night against Elizabeth Warren and she keeps bringing it back to Trump She is such a fraud he had her on her heels Jeff deal that we've had on the program I've had him on over Fifteen to twenty times he did great last night\nAt every what the deal campaign trivial terrific about it and it's up to the voters of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren she's not even going to serve it out she's not going to serve outer term\nSo I'm looking at the channel ten website and what do they have fun campaign staffer resigns over tweets All right so a guy working at a campaign put some inappropriate things on Twitter\nIn twenty eleven so we had to step down they're running with that story and they're not even running on the story in the one hundred thousand ...\nI mean give me a break and it's the same way I just put out on Twitter Sheldon Whitehouse is sending out a fundraising email a fundraising email I put it out on Twitter Sheldon Whitehouse Senator Whitehouse is putting out a fundraising email to try to raise money off the shooting in Pittsburgh in the Senate got that is wrong\nI Am a board member of the Rhode Island coalition Israel that is wrong and we're gonna have a guest sound tomorrow to talk about it no one calls them out on this stuff\nThat is absolutely pathetic\nA sitting US Senator\nWrong Sheldon Whitehouse running ads frightening the elderly and the poor and the indigent Donald Trump's going to take away your Medicare Donald Trump's going to cut you your Social Security an absolute blatant lie\nAnd Maureen vocally professor political science professor your I went on lively experiment and when asked about it said well that's politics that's politics that's politics according to Maureen vocally\nThe the political science professor at your rye politics for a sitting US Senator\nTo go to a nursing home and get a group of elderly people that they had no real in and veterans and tell people in light of him\nAnd say vote for me otherwise President Trump is going to take away your Social Security and Medicaid you're all going to be tossed out of here on the street\nA blatant mean cruel why I received emails from children whose parents were getting these lies from Sheldon Whitehouse what kind of individual\nWhat kind of sick individual goes into a nursing home an elderly nursing home he's a sitting US Senator for crying out loud and blatantly lies to frighten them I received an email\nFrom one of our listeners I think her name was\nGene or Janine off to find her mother called her\nAs gene or Janine off to find that her mother called her in tears this was over a month ago\nAnd his mom what is wrong oh my God Christ Sheldon Whitehouse was just here that was one of the places they're building the commercial and they will them in and he stands there sitting US Senator and lied he Trump's take it away your Social Security you're going to lose your Medicaid you're all going to be out on the street\nMother crying and everything else the daughters like what are you talking about had to call the nursing home\nOh well some of the White House was here he wanted to film the commercial and what is Maureen vocally say well that's that is not politics that goes beyond politics you want to do a comparison ad that's one thing you want us a highlight your record against your opponent that's fine you want to highlight something wrong your opponent did that's fine\nBut Sheldon Whitehouse sitting senator I have no respect for that guy at all he didn't do it with a room full of a able bodied men he took advantage and frightened the most\nYou know there are segments of our society\nThat are the most vulnerable one is the unborn and the other are those that are sick\nAnd also those that are elderly and that's who he decided to prey on and he didn't even care he walked out with such a smart and laughed about it in judge Flanders to his credit brought it up in the debate and shelter just waved off than across the media just like let it go it took the Washington Post\nTo write about it a static absolutely pathetic and what is Maureen vocally political science you All right well you know that's ... that is not politics that is not politics frightening people in that way we're there than calling their a grown children\nSaying I Am ... I Am petrified in tears and then the nursing home told this woman that emailed me and there were several people actually emailed me that they were getting all these calls from children relatives they were then going there that day\nHe blatantly lied just to get their reaction for the commercial and if you see the commercials is tears they're horrified he walked out of their Senator Sheldon Whitehouse walked out of that nursing center\nLaughing and smirking I find each other he had frightened elderly people disabled elderly totally dependent on their Social Security Medicaid\nAnd totally lied to them just so he could get what he considered an effective television commercial I thought judge Flanders was too polite\nI thought judge Flanders should've slug them on the stage\nAnd frankly the local media should are really going after him on that that is not you know I'm going to disagree with Maureen vocally professor your eye political science that it's not politics now that that is mean\nThat is inhumane that it's unseemly that is on a that his behavior that is unacceptable of a sitting US Senator\nTo lie to frighten people just to get their vote and also see they all want he wants to sixty percent heated he feels he's already winning he wants to sixty percent it's all ego it's all greed I don't care what I have to say or do I want the sixty percent and the same thing with ... do\nI Want the fifty percent I Need the fifty percent when I go out and campaign for president I can say I am fifty percent and they don't care and they're violating campaign finance you have no idea about the mail ballot fraud that's about to be unveiled at some point hopefully\nFolks these are people they they're so blinded by their own greed that it doesn't even matter who gets in the way\n[noise] but this selection of twenty eight team to me will be absolutely that to me is the headline that Governor Gina Raimondo gave Joe ... one hundred thousand dollars knew when she was breaking the law didn't care\nThumbing her nose at it and now it's going to be up to the voters\nNow you know these people are like ... people I don't know what to tell you I mean there's always people like there was some people that will forgive the Dodgers believe in Brooklyn for crying out loud", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Woonsocket", "day": "31"}
