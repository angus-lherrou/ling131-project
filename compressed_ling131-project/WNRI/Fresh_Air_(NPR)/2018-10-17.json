will continue to talk about the governor's race and I am encouraging people everyone listening right now I encourage you I think it's a fair question to ask members of the media and people that talk about politics who are they voting for for governor\nI think in a very clear you can ignore the race the way it is right now and people have to decide do they really want another four years of governor Gina Raimondo I Do not\nI think she's been an atrocious governor she doesn't care about you should only cares about herself there've been so much mismanagement I don't agree with her political agenda and the next four years the next four years it's going to get more extreme more progressive she is setting a platform for herself\nTo run for president she is so therefore she's going to an act of very progressive agenda so if you want to go along with that than vote for her but it is time to hold people accountable and there are people that have been what I Would call ... enablers\nThere Joe ... Joe ... is not leaving the race and I laugh when I hear about people I didn't hear but people telling me like people like Arlene Violet asked you know Joe ... says I'm just running I don't care if I get to ... percent\nAs long as I take that away and block Alan ... that is not someone running to win\nAnd I was there Monday Night at the debate and their last debate of the three of them I Believe is going to be the Thursday before the election which channel ten Gina Raimondo wants to just stay below the radar continue to unleash bombs on ... Alan ...\nWho were with Matt Brown who don't like governor among do\nAnd they plan to kind of sit this out and they're not going to support her that's one thing\nBut I Want to remind you in twenty sixteen\nTed Cruz lost in the primary\nTo Donald Trump and they work crews supporters right the never Trump or Glenn back some of these other people they were telling cruised Ron independent if he had done that Hillary Clinton would be the president right now there's just no other way to look at it folks\nI'm not saying this is the first time it's ever happened in Al Gore has a reason to be upset with Ralph Nader Ralph Nader did very well in Wisconsin He did very well in the state of Washington he hurt Al Gore he did and that helped President Bush Ross Perot\nRan in Nineteen Ninety two although in both instances Ralph Nader was running on principle\nAnd Ross Perot really thought he had a chance I think into the kind of a weird way it was like a protest vote but he helped Bill Clinton become the president that has happened before\nFour years ago ... loose rest in peace he got twenty two percent of the boat and Gina Raimondo became the uh the governor\nAnd then you go back to twenty ten can block wonders tablets to moderate party he got six percent of the vote John Roberts Hi last like two points and we got stuck with link chase the this is different because Trump has said\n... said I don't care if I get two percent of the boat I'm running to make sure Allan Fung doesn't win that is not someone with a path\nTo victory that's where it's different and I think many of the ... enablers need to be held accountable\nAfter the election if Gina Raimondo wins this election and I'm Still not convinced that she's going to cause I think the tide is shifting I think the momentum is shifting you can peek too early\nThere was a lot of support out there for Cranston mayor Allen Fung and when people realized this is it it is phone or among do don't let anyone tell you anything differently folks\nHold the members of the media accountable call them on the air say are you voting for gene or a phone\nDon't let them say well I haven't decided what do you mean haven't decided does that mean you're going to vote for a ... I Can't even imagine I Would never vote for Gina Raimondo never never much like I Would never vote for Elizabeth Warren I Would never vote for Hillary Clinton I Would never vote for Sheldon Whitehouse I Would never vote for David Sicily and he's got a gender thing\nNever never I Would never\nNever never I Would never vote for David ... I Would never vote for war so is there a chance of that\nBut put them on the spot this is a two person race anyone that tells you that is working to elect Gina Raimondo there's no other way to look at it\nAnd then after the election those that have helped Raimondo like Patricia Morgan ... the trailer radio station people hold them accountable folks\nPut them on the spot\nWe have one chance here and as I said to mayor phone yesterday I I didn't say it's fair but he is our shot this is this is going to be you don't you have no idea what Rhode Island it's going to look like after four more years of Gina Raimondo it's got to be the third world\nEverybody's better start taking Spanish lessons and get ready for higher taxes and everything else they are going to make this progressive habit\nThey're going to end small businesses you're going to be crushed you're going to be put out of business Fifteen dollar minimum wage land justice redistribution of wealth more welfare benefits more illegals\nI eat if you're a business person voting for Gina Raimondo you're absolutely lost your mind period there's no other way to look at it\nMayor Fong was a no candidate is perfect\nHe is our best chance that is it ended up story no one is going to convince the otherwise if Joe blow had thirty percent thirty five percent it's a completely different story but it's not happening and it's not going to happen\nCertainly not the reports that have been come out\nIt's it's I I don't know what else to say that but there are people are vote which they go ahead but if President Trump was Rhode Island resident he would vote for Republican governor period there's no other way to explain it [noise]\nIt folks at ...

through Washington park um again that it it depends and it's turned over um ... we're ... who who is winning kind of a sign battle in the Washington park section of the city\nI think ... do is to say that all that you know there there are I Will say Washington park is where Louis upon to represent he is no big\nA fan of the mayors and so you know there I don't know that the mayor has a a ton of support over there um I don't know that is necessarily made the inroads that she needs to make either\nYou know it's funny you mentioned the ... thing is when the ride through Cranston obviously are different sections of war working so but I see a lot of bunk signs but boy Dan when you go through provenance provenance is ... that is the hill she is going to live or die on\nThat's exactly right and remember one big difference this time the last time\nA marathon or when he ran and twenty fourteen had a small but very vocal um crowd of folks on the south side who are with him he was hit a presence on the outside even though Gina\nA really clean the floor with him in Providence he did have a presence this time around not nearly as much and and that shows you a gene is certainly you know riding Providence as hard as she kept\nHe also had um you know he and it was no secret teenage ultra Barris the outgoing mayor they were very high school friends that's right he had a she defeated\nA angel in the primary ... pounds so she didn't have the advantage the way she does and I think it is interesting that early on was that story or ... and the Democrats city committee and then I took the boat and everything Raimondo recognizes without question her path to victory is the run up\nThe are the votes in Providence and I think I\nI think a fear that she may have a little bit is remember last time that that there was that just such a big turnout especially on the east side because of the anti buddy Jay and yet what\nGina was able to do is actually win against Allen Fung on the east side and even a bigger margin than uh lords it'd be buddy and so I think what she she's hoping that happens again but are you going to get people out the door\n[noise] ... what is and again folks we stayed within a gallon of WPRI dot com economy in the city of Providence like no one else what is the big issues I mean people there's a difference between the people on the outside and then the people that actually live in the city now I mean prominence for crying out loud the buses were set on fire ... fire last week\nTax is a very high you've the state that wants to take control the one Ninety five land away from them or you know these still of the panhandling problem obviously you know um business owners are very upset you still have a number of businesses that are going out nordstroms leaving prominence baseball\nBut for Providence residence if I go to the east side or are they voting on issues of the city or is it all just general like philosophy basic policy type of quite a lot like they like the lawyers the because he's so progressive\nI think it's a ... a hundred percent trying to say I think it's very much philosophy I think they like a mayor who you know a a picture of himself as someone who stands up to President Trump things like that I Do think across the city though and I I live in Mount pleasant I Know you went to ... and you know that area don't\nWell I went to I had written by at one point I Lived off Trump's own avenue that what it was I ... as a write a actually I don't know if you ... you really actually should apologize accusing me to go without\nEither go no go ahead oh and I I think in that age I think in that neighborhood and ... it's more um quality of life type issues I think you know crime is always something that that the mayor and the mayor has to encounter I think things like potholes are\nBut the the the one challenge is I don't know that anyone is rising up and saying you know this one issue is the thing I'm going to vote on it and and that's one of the things that are ms Whitman kind of needs to\nMaybe grab the mantle on finding issue that really strikes a chord so that people say oh yeah I'm with her on this and so I'm voting for her\nYou know it's funny I Am hearing and I spoke to someone yesterday again a big political Maine who you would know\nBut said something that his surprised the Whitman people is now they're going door to door in Providence and in Providence obviously this is on the east side now that would make people going door to door including bin ... yourself but some people and they can to sing and they're talking about\nThe problems with the schools they're talking about crime they're talking about panhandlers they're talking about some of the empty storefronts in just things like that and they're being asked about the cabinet working rings I Wonder how much of that that anti Trump and almost like a Lourdes\nHates Trump more than duty Whitman\nHow am I I'm starting to think that that is like more important to some of the people on Blackstone boulevard than the fact that you know the ... the numbers that have come out about the mount pleasant school there was prominence schools themselves are just\nAbsolutely horrific probably some of the worst in the country actually but that it it doesn't seem to matter to many of those voters that just the basic taxes I I Know a business owner that has just a regular he operates has been sort of a house on Waterman street his taxes Seventy thousand gallons\nA year and I know that there's so many but but you bring up north from leaving crying or some of the home invasions on but it doesn't seem to matter to those people well\nYou nailed it I mean whether it's the where they stand on the cabin are hearing or you know I'll tell you I've been in a couple of forums I moderated one with them and the question of even just who are you voting for for governor I'm you know it puts ms women in a tough spot because she fundraiser for Allan Fung but she knows it's not exactly the most popular thing\nSwimming in a tough spot because she fundraiser for Allan Fung but she knows it's not exactly the most popular thing to say in Providence right and and the campaign I think on the other side the mayor's campaign and the mayor you know he he's never been a bigger cheerleaders for general ... right\nAnd so I think that's one of those things that uh it it puts her in a tough box because you know she she doesn't want to see the paper today the you know ... inside of the Providence Journal there's a story about how she admits she she supported buddy in the last election\nNow does that have anything to do with this race no of course not but does that matter to folks am I going to get sent to me a lot yeah absolutely\nYeah that that is really incredible and what about up in in your section Smith hill Mount Pleasant\nNow again I'm not saying it decides the race but is that the territory where's that lowers the territory and also Dan\nBy all accounts everyone you know do they they seems to be in somebody even mention it like where is the Lord's the he's certainly\nDoes not in any way seem to be worried about this sometimes even want to run up to ... to ... you know to scare off another challenge or in another election he he is basically like totally below the radar\nYeah well that's definitely true I one of the things that strategy that they thought I was surprised by was they did not take their Democratic primary opponent seriously they knew they were going to win\nA running away just based on name recognition and money and so they really didn't have a a very strong organization that helps some counselors that they wanted to help things like that they did little things um and then coming into this I think they got caught a little complacent 'cause I think they said they kept on convincing themselves\nWell duty with it hasn't done anything all summer she's not serious and they got kind of slap in the face of this week with a commercial\nAnd seeing her money um and then you asked about the mount Pleasant Hill area you know that's an area that if she wants to be close and this race she needs to not just do well she needs to win\nUm that's that's that you know so called fertile crescent devotes a lot of white middle class of votes are over there and uh and so she needs to do very well I'm not seeing a lot of her sons but I keep being told oh there's going to be a push there's going to be a push I just haven't seen it yet\nIs there any polling on this race folks and again we're speaking with Ian MacDonald regarding the mayoral race in prominent any polls on this at all\nNo we're in this blind so Josh what I Want to split it maybe we can do something\n[laughter] yeah well I I I mean I gotta thank the lord of the lord of the people they are they doing internal polls or\nI'm aware of a couple of polls that they did over the last let's say two or three years I don't know when the last time that they most recently pulled that I Know remember John Bardeen wants to derive he pulled the race I think\nJoe pay Leno had pulled at one point just to see where the lay of the land was but I think a lot I think we're in the media side we're going into this blind and honestly I think a lot of the campaigns are really blind about uh two\nBefore I let you go what's so interesting about\nProvidence mayor Jorge ... is he's not\nAnd I don't mean this against him but I don't see I talk with all the different camps and you don't I don't see anyone fully embrace him if he would go back to when the ... people were whining and dining GE trying to get them we can they they just allowed him to stop by the desert you know even allowed to attend the dinner\nI'm I I was at the peak packed a event on Saturday Night it was the private thing that they had to celebrate the ninth anniversary there were a lot of high profile people that he came in he gave a speech but he certainly didn't stick around and there were some high profile people down and see them gravitate towards him he to me\nAs much as and you're right he's a huge cheerleader for Gina Raimondo and he also he did not endorse lieutenant governor Dan ... Aaron Rosenberg\nBoy one thing I'll say about a ... he he knows his base he does not follow the party he does what he has to do and he doesn't seem to hear that a lot of the other Democrats you just don't vote or over all over him\nYeah I think one of the most common criticisms that I hear of him is just the the\nUm you know the lack of attention that the state especially at the state house that they pay towards him so it used to be if you think about a buddy fancier given Davis is leaning a lot of ways", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Woonsocket", "day": "17"}
