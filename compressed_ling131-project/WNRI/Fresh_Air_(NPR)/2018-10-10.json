phone is blowing up a people emailing that it's not true that is not what happened that's not true that's true uh well we do know\nIs that Joe ... did it did as you heard that during the\nNo is that joke pillow did admit as you heard that during the seventies when we do know is during the seventies that when he was approximately thirty four years old he lived next door\nTo a Thirteen year old Nick Maddie yellow who's now speaker of the house there was some kind of disturbance in the neighborhood troll oh ...\n... ... hid even though he says is unintentional but hid Nick met a yellow was neighborhood kid so much that his parents met a yellow parents called the police\nJoke solo was called down to the police station charged with assault on a minor and then pled no contest he then went into he has admitted all of that\nOr he claims he was a than trying to save our help some young girl is someone that was in distress and then he went on to a litany of attacks against Cranston mayor Allen ... will joining us right now on the line is the mayor Cranston\nAnd that is ... good ... a good afternoon as the mayor hey good afternoon John\n... um the facts that I have just based on this story\nThe way I see this in what basically I even though we did put out a statement or the facts that can't be disputed are that there was some kind of an incident he was thirty four years old Nick Betty yellow was approximately Thirteen or fourteen years old\nA ... at the time the thirty year old man did strike\nYoung Thirteen fourteen year old neighborhood kid so much that his parents contacted the ... the police ... had to go down to the police station was charged with assault on a minor and then pled no contest to the charge so\nThat that much we do know and then it seemingly spiraled out with him making all these allegations about you\nWrite at all I can say is no matter what you know Joe is becoming more and more on ... and she's out of control during this campaign you know he wants to flak from you know always brought up this morning was kind of surprising and a little ironic ah Rhode Island it can only happen in Rhode Island but the next door neighbor\nThat Joe hey it turns out to be the ... or ... you know the current speaker of the house but the fact that no matter remains regardless of that fact you know he hit\nOh yeah big time and not only that I think the news of yesterday governor Mondo can't skate that\nStarted with ... it led to the paw socks and I'm ... now Nordstrom and the north Korean people will time they'd never heard anything from the ... in Providence Place mall is becoming prominence space small uh in in the only place I think the Nordstrom would end up going\nWould in fact be the way that a Garden City or chapel chapel view that\nIs becoming the shopping hub of Rhode Island\nIt really it was just so Rhode Island job but off New England yeah got a lot of a Massachusetts Connecticut\nPlates coming down here and I love to have nordstroms in that the only tough part is in Garden City stop what ...\nIs not enough space there is\nThat I was so fully you know we'll see if chapel view can reach out to them and see if we might be you know a convenient location because it can certainly tell\nIf you don't have to pay for parking you know we're growing as a city that is a great target demographics and you're right cringe donations are proud of the city they can't ferry Bryant stand are among those negative ads\nTerrible trying to treat a city that way and I even know you know there was a great story that last week guys that I knew growing up\nA ... boots she David kept I knew them I went to Hendrik in but I had friends that played hockey with them a Korean studies and they took the train down and they went to a David Quinn is the new head coach of the rangers and took the train down there\nThere is just so much pride in Cranston right now in governor Mondo\nWho lives in Providence who hasn't incompetent mayor you of the bus strike that's going on you have retailers and streams fleeing the city and in she stands by I Would be willing to bet than if we get a governor fun you would\nBe in touch with the Providence mayor in like hey we got to get the city in line here because this is ridiculous Providence is literally falling apart at the seams\nYeah and a lot of it is because if a man's policies and the governor and letting them go ... for those that are here illegally sanctuary cities stuff or do you think is going to happen to you know you're going to have enough say city and and you got to have a unstable economy and that's why nordstroms leaving\nAnd you know under governor Fong we're going to hold people accountable if we have to freeze funds or you know on the state side to uh Providence because there is actually say unwilling to cooperate with the feds all\nDo it yeah it's a tough stand\nNow folks were speaking with ... misdemeanor or two things before we let you go number one I Do want to give you a chance to reach out how people can get in touch with the ... campaign or this is going to be a very close\nCan get in touch with the ... campaign or this is going to be a very close election it is literally going to go down to the final weekend but you know it's funny I um I Know everyone gives when you're running people don't realize when provoked when people running for office everyone in every way they go\nThey people are giving them advice you go to the grocery store peoples in his would you do you stop the gas whatever it may be but Mr Mayor I Do\nOr someone that is a business person in the city of Cranston said\nI here's what she said I Wish I could do a commercial where I say to the people of Cumberland Smithfield Lincoln like hey he's a great mayor ... he's going to be a great governor for you\nI Would love to see a commercial where the business so did you have a residence\nShout out to the different thirty nine cities and towns like hey east prominence he's been a great mayor ... going to be a great governor few people perk up when they hear the town I get the feeling people Cranston won and spread the word about how what a great marry you been and they want to spread the word that you'd be a great governor\nAbsolutely John and that's yeah that's part of that new commercial that change color yes\nBecause the change that we put forward in this uh creating a better small business environment for all the same type of attitude all take and change the state house and bring it back for all of us the little guys yeah and you know people can get more information a look at the new ads on WWW Allan Fung dot com that's two hours to raise\nA obviously you know we're going up against a well funded governor you know a negative ads so\nClearly shows I'm not allowing wine if the lawyers will join his spending\nLike crazy people can donate to help you know get our message out and like you said I don't Christian residents are talking with a lot of pride they are off about these negative ads that are not true\nThat's right and not only that I get a times to mandate that\n... I mean the white noise at this point I mean three an hour\nI can [laughter] I'm like in the kitchen I can recite them as soon as I start to hear them it and it's ridiculous and I just don't think the resonating in any way if that's all they got in there just it's one bomb after another um I think as we get closer and we saw in the long way to go here that uh you're on the right path\nHow can people get involved again with the ... campaign\nAgain you know they can or we need people that are knocking on doors\nA you know making phone calls that get stopped by headquarters on credit driving you in war we're right next to a ... and the lows plaza across the street from the crown plaza so stop on in their\nGo to our website they can sign up uh but you know I Want everyone to know as we close out that ah look I'm the only one that can bring effective change just like I've done and crashed into the state house on the one resolving message out here is she has got to go but most importantly vote for Joe is got to help re election you know we have that happen\nA and we've seen Joe is just becoming unhinged um another way to sample of him becoming and shit dates back to the seventies I guess\nYeah I didn't realize that I'm looking at the headline on the channel from ... Iowa unintentionally shrunk young Nicholas ... yellow I just never thought I'd see something like that thirty four year old man hitting a Thirteen year old kid in the neighborhood that is I just I've never heard of anything like that\nAnd if you did that then if it was unintentional why'd you play into it then you\nKnow that's a that's a very good point yeah especially coming from someone that says he's the fighter so when he says he's the fighter I didn't realize he meant that it was with a Thirteen year old boys in the neighborhood\n[laughter] I Know they really are going to wind up and a half of the taxpayers actually you know if that's what most politicians yeah\nAnd most of the public are expected on hitting a Thirteen year old\nBoy oh I didn't think so so at least like the father for Christ's sake\nMissionaries [laughter]\nAre I feel he's ... by Mr Mayor good to talk to you good luck on the campaign trail okay thank you\nAri folks there and his Cranston mayor Allen Fung right here on the John to Pico show you can relax or react seven six six Thirteen eighty within it is um [noise] it's a bizarre story it is and I don't buy this thing of as someone was trying to say wow this is like habit or they know it's it's not like capital capital a\n... it's not even remote remotely close to judge capital that was a smear attack orchestrated by the left we're this is entirely different where'd they there there is a record there were charges um\nTruckload did I'm reading right off of the channel twelve website or he struck a teenager and it happened to it just happened to be I'm Nick Matty yellow but it could have been any of those teenagers as a matter of fact\nSo I'm trying to low the family press charges and ... pled no contest and eventually the assault charge was expunged so I eat it it's not it's not even remotely close to the cabinet or situation is\nThis is not a he said he said this is this happened there was a minor the parents press charges\nOr he pled no contest and that then to the assault charge so that's that's how it went down I don't see that remotely close to being called the ... cabinet situation was an incident\nThat Dr Ford was cleaning happen that no one no one could back it up confirm recall I think one of the most one of the strongest arguments and the cabinet situation with Dr Ford\nThe woman and besides President Trump although people say he was mocking her very ... you know pointing out\nYou know I don't remember when it happened I don't remember where it happened these people at the party they all say it never happened was I thought one of the most effective\nUm arguments discussing that was Maine Senator Susan Collins that said what struck out to her stuck out to her was that after all this time no one came forward to say I drove her home that night\nBecause if it did happen where she said it happened somehow at night a Fifteen year old go girl when seven miles\nThat's uncommon doesn't remember how she got to the party how she got home from the party upstairs downstairs but I had one beer I mean these people were at the party none of them remember it the next day and senator Collins said\nHer friend didn't call and say hey what happened to you last night suddenly you disappeared\nUm\nThe like that happen well he is the point I mean why why I say it again he is the worst since he went into it for a walk in\nOregon herself she wouldn't have done what you get but I'm calling about ... okay\nA lot I you know what here's something to you know I Want to hear\nA base on this latest revelation is Arlene violence still stays in the race and it stays endorsing she's part of the ... team\nSo I Want to hear based on this uh Detroit low arrested for assault on a minor I Want to hear now assist Darlene still stays in the well I'm running my\nMy opinion of Arlene Violet she's probably still a very nice person\nA couple of words on her number one close bond below with the ah let go or is he still in jail\nI heard he got off on to her or well the other two other words on Arlene violent you already do you remember the Ralph Richards case no I Do you do know that case well\nI only I was a hurry general there was a a little baby that was missing in but\nTalking uh I'll think of the name murdered then found three days later murdered Ralph Richard in the white for the girlfriend whatever was\nDrug abusers clearly on drugs murdered that little child and Arlene violent and her attorney general's office blew the route for its case\nOkay maybe I Do recall\nThat a member of that my thing and then they found the little ... on the alley Lou ... very good memory\nOn stuff like that I Do and I also remember when bond you'll lose found guilty and then he got re tried and under Arlene violets two year term as attorney general ...\nWhy do people quote still call her general please\nI didn't know the whole idea unreal but I think\nWhat happened to her musical by the way she was also putting out a musical what happened with that\nYet or no she's um she I used for her and she's\nA prison why voted for Hillary he's in favor of the jury cities she hates Trump and she says she's endorsing Joe ... say well I Know now you kidding me\nYeah well that's there's there's all kinds of hypocrisy hiring them all its self serving\nIt is all about then you're exactly right I mean how desperate of some of these people to be relevant again my God I remember a Ralph Richard and then also um clubhouse bond you know both of those cases were blown I'm darleen violent\nWell look at it in Oregon each DJ people used to go up in the Iowa lean\n[laughter] [laughter] well I'm calling\nI'm lucky I don't think they and they are I\nGo ahead okay All right so lonely whack the kid one
