person they're called in with the false accusation against judge cabinet Brett Kavanaugh referred him to a reporter so far White Houses are dodging that we're going to talk to Bob planned is judge

mentioned I for the life of me that is incredible to me there's White House yesterday\nAt the Rhode Island convention center\nAnd um [noise] you have the media is right there in that one I Would have gone it was by a my little one Jacqueline player it was her birthday weekend she turned sixteen\nShe's a little gift of God my youngest and I I Would have gone to ask\nBut I thought you know I was talking to a friend of mine said uh you know\n... do you think you can head over I said I you know it's we have a birthday party going for her I said I'm sure someone and local media will ask White House about it right I mean the FBI is questioning why did you tell this guy or a he calls your office why did you tell them to call the meteor on this year didn't set it judiciary\nI thought you know somebody's going to ask no one has to know what\nSorry I thought you know somebody's got to ask no one asked to know them at all unbelievable bloodstream on its political Monday and right now is our friend from ocean state contact\nManaging Aaron Justin cats can afternoon just a good afternoon job\nIt or just an I Want to start off that I'm really just a week ago a candidly when you look at the timeline last Thursday not this past Thursday but the Thursday before that channel twelve came out with their poll and they showed according to the ... poll\nSheldon Whitehouse at fifty four percent\nBob planters at thirty five percent and then the rest of undecided now as much as he's up was Nineteen points in that poll that still is you know that that's not great for someone that's been there for twelve years\nAnd to me\nWhat is unfortunate here ah for I'm going to say unfortunate for mayor Fung is there\nMean your eye or in the media there was no bonds afterwards there was no talk about it um I've friday I got one phone call of anyone one asks about a new one is asked me about the debate\nOn so much the cable I headlines and that that was also the same day the White House had question Kavanaugh so that was lighting up I think one of those things you can't predict an election but to me the debate\nIn some ways was almost it's like if a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it what was it really a debate if not enough people watched it\nWell yeah that is that is a problem and I I think it was criminal have other debates about ... this was the first one you're kind of got a taste of of certain things and and as we were watching\nCertain things chose reaction for example I think a lot of he was getting kind of too nervous sent me aggressive at points and that sort of thing he might get under control and and it'll affect later as you said it's unfortunate for America and I thought he did it pretty well in this one um [noise] yeah it definitely I Know from\nWorking in a policy area you'd be a plan all this\n... a roll out to try to get some information out there and then something like this happened at the national level and suddenly nobody cares about you know it's really important at a local level\nIt is and there's nothing you can do about it you know you mentioned um I did not watch it and I keep it I always like to watch it live and then I tape and watch it again thriller interrupted punk six times drill all made some noises um\nSeems kinda the court jester you know I talk to different people the word familiar with them they said he just seem like he wasn't taking it very\nSeriously and if you really watch some of the different elements of St Joe Fleming afterwards that said you know governor Mondo basically what you stand back\nQuiet looking down as low as in attacking punk he interrupted mayor punk six times he was mocking near Fong odd to me it seems very although it's well it's interesting little also was attacking Raimondo\nWhich makes me think she's also trying to grab onto that entire Raimondo does against paint a crowd but I'll tell you jumped in at a guy sitting at six or seven percent it it is\nAnd and ensure low shrugs off the notion of being the spoiler it's\nIt's hard to take any of these seriously and now the problem with the young people that they have is the next debate which I Believe is happening and you are right now the moderate party candidate is going to be on stage for people on stage and the more people on stage and just everybody gets equal time it just gets tougher to get the oxygen\nIt does although it does it can might present an opportunity for a marathon and also for dinner I'm honored to be the ... to to set up a contrast this is me this is\nA um you know I'll do my adult jobs like pond got in a job about a kindergarten a third grade reading so that joke to three and a campaign finance reports you know it was kind of an adult ... job at him as opposed to you know just screaming and the football guys\nUm but I ... it was conspicuous that you're in the midst of saying I'm not a spoiler he chose never interrupted governor am I only interrupted on ... constantly so many one are taught once or twice would have gotten the point across but it was every opportunity you could hear him talking over him on a on a microphone uh one thing I Do think\nMight be significant in that says that show didn't make a big deal about leaving the Republican Party\nIn the book may or may not catch my ear was Patricia market has been out there saying I might enjoy the show you know he's he's really a Republican so I thought that\nMoment might make that little bit harder for her um other than that I thought it was about as as one would've expected I did not expect a judge or to become quite beach to remind me of Johnny procedure you almost so oh I'm I'm the guy I can build everything in this auditorium better than the people who built it it was\nAlmost so over the top you wondered puts this guy really going after\nI I agree with you and um [noise] I you know the next to me is now coming up I Believe it's a I think it's ... so uh but if you're a Gina Raimondo all you want to do is just being neutral\nAnd then to her she doesn't even if it were up to her she doesn't want the debates right she just is what can you just maintain and knock you fall and I think they are fun\nRight she just is looking to just maintain and knock you ... I think they are on did actually very well in the debate but the problem was six times that the distracts to drill oh or if they want to move ahead and defeat her which they could can still do and I'm I'm seeing a Twitter they're getting huge infusions of cash now\nBecause this is seen as a winnable seat for the Republicans\nAnd Raimondo is without question tapped out at at forty three percent with all the money she spent\nBut they need to figure out the troll situation I also think it's interesting though just an on duty Whitman is depressing a lot of people she just analogy is going to be running independent but what I like is she just last week she opened up her campaign headquarters in Providence\nAnd had a big thing what I like about it is as much as everyone else has been in motion for so long duty Whitman is approaching it like listen a lot of people have not been paying attention it's really just between me\nAnd I'm and Merrill lords and so you know I'm just this is a ... weeks Britain right now and she got Kobe Dennis To endorse her\nI see the prominence police her door sing her I see Great Britain is endorsing her she has money she certainly has well over\nSix hundred seven hundred thousand dollars of people\nI think she could end up being in this year the woman right in this year the woman mayor laws that does not have tremendous support within the Democratic party interesting yesterday when I looked at the picture he was not on stage with Biden when you look at a picture it's it's the usual Armando White House\nA system rainy land you been a ... a lawyer is not part of that circle duty Whitman I think could could surprised a lot of people I think that it's a race that is very very winnable her\nOh it certainly is a nice and I think mainly it's a negative reaction to a large uh where you know the police union coming out that's that's not a vote of\nConfidence and and the mayor or or his two Democrat I think the Romeo also I'm indoors Whitman has to do was to Democrat competitors in the\nIn the primary going for the independent candidate a that that's all of a sign that he's he's just not doing something right and you know I'm I noted when he first ran for the ratio haven't\nDone a whole lot I have this problem in another country but in Rhode Island especially where we seem to elect people who whether you agree or not with their politics it's\nWhere's the executive experience coming from an espresso I just don't see it and I I I'm not sure women has all that much as a I think she was mainly professional fundraisers and uh but but he certainly didn't and that\nWhat you get is it somebody who's not really comfortable running things gets in these weird fights with with the unions that don't really have a purpose because he's not sure where he wants to go and you just end up with opposition and an ... sort of an anyone but added atmosphere and so if somebody credible and so that's going to be women's passed\nOver the next few weeks is to prove I can credibly claim that I can run in a city that's if she can make that case I think it's going to really\nBe something to be afraid\nI agree with you I'm going to hold that short they are simply because I Need to be speaking with judge ... uh\nAny I I Want to give you any thoughts on or anything else politically that uh catches your attention Matty yellow certainly is under fire in in France but any other thought I Know a pack caught a lot to the debate belly go be hopefully there'll be another debate on that but any other ... just political thought you want to leave us with Justin\n[noise] well it's hard it's hard to overcome the ah the ... and counter radiation yeah that was a religious and stole enough from everything jak which I thought it was interesting and it hasn't gotten a whole lot of attention was was Mike Riley running for a treasure or didn't quit but he says Arab all this this is the games are rigged against the yeah\nThe army going well for reasons not Rhode Island's doing and so don't give me money oh my God you handled it\nSo ... a barrel that if you agree to run as you just run you don't have to have I agree with you will see just the cat made you get an approach should say current dot com that was embarrassing Justin grey capital talk to you again because you're ...\nPope spirit is jumping cats managing editor\nFor ocean the current dot com we're going to be talking with judge Flanders cutting up momentarily in the meantime I Want to remind folks right now maybe you're looking to get some uh

stopping to see them they are the best and again they also have as I said we do see the slush and they kept on pumpkins and corn stalks and straw introduce islands number one\nAnd I'm just curious if someone calls him with a serious allegation like this and his response is to refer the person to have the media investigated\nWas that something that he did when he when he was the Rhode Island attorney general if someone contacted him or his office [noise] regarding something a crime of this nature would when he was her them\nSpeak to the Providence Journal channel twelve uh channel ten so they could investigate the manner judge doesn't\nWhen I hear you it's attorney or you're an attorney general when when you have investigative a purposes or at your disposal that you could then investigate to send your own if you've ever heard of something like that\nOf course not completely are appropriate [noise] ah [noise] [noise]\nSo what was so I Can't imagine he would have done anything like this and we we don't know but or God Forbid this was his MO\nWhen he was serving in those positions so yeah it is it's as soon as ... to me that he would have done such things and and so that's why it makes it a typically agreed to this this wouldn't have been an innocent mistake this was a\nFellow who knows what the proper procedure is 'cause he's held offices where you you and properly investigate these types of charges you don't send\nAn accuser off to the U.S\nOr in the hopes that the media will just do whatever they do to attack this man's reputation by publishing it before it's been vetted and to see whether there's any merit to the allegations so as a you know it raises all sorts of questions about how this man operated when he held office before\nA hoax good afternoon a chunk of patrons being with judge planned this judge I have spoken to people that I Know in Washington and what I have been told is when the FBI individual why did he contact the reporter he is the one that told them that Senator Whitehouse uh\nReferred him and told him to contact the reporter uh you really want to you know you got to kind of in a way celibate so to speak you got to really add to me to judge your being diplomatic but to me\nSenator Whitehouse knew he was going to be questioning judge Kavanaugh he knew he was going to be in in in questioning up there's no way to interpret that as\nThere is a pattern here were dying fine line has the ladder\nAnd about this woman initially Dr Ford and what does she do it that fed to the Washington Post and its attempt to kind of you know blow up the confirmation and now you have a situation with the White House\nGets a call regarding allegations he has no idea whether or not it's true it's true he does put it to the FBI because Kavanaugh was actually been asked about it and they were investigating this\nPattern only asked about this on a phone call he completely denying it but what I I truly believe judge plant is\nSenator Whitehouse today needs couldn't name\nThe reporter in the news organization that he instructed that man to contact and this happened before and did he do this as attorney general did he do this as us attorney what what is so appalling to me and I want to get your thought but what really sticks out to me is [noise]\nThis judiciary hearing as long as you know it's all on their own they talk about potential perjury Senator Whitehouse knew he was going to be questioning judge Kavanaugh\nFits with not Congress since ... telling this man to contact the media is was not lantern this wasn't even Harry Reid never would do something like that he instructed this individual\nWho completely ... this allegation\nWhite House instructed that guy to call a reporter so they could investigate it knowing that he was going to question Kavanaugh\nI I'm Sorry judge I I think that is just beyond the bounds and I'm not trying to challenge you as a judge when you're on the Supreme Court but I I Would be hard pressed to get you could come up with an example\nThat if someone contacted Peter Till Martin for example is the attorney general that would contact headed to Rhode Island police not struck the person\nTo contact him light on the eye team or the Providence Journal bend to investigate it catch is there's no other way to take take out of this other than that or the White House his goal was to have this thing blow up into the media and as I was watching CNN Tuesday night they said boom headline accuser comes forward\nCabinet or rape in Newport Rhode Island a boat completely fabricated and White House behind the scenes with work and one plane that story\nYeah it's just\nTotally reprehensible in my opinion and [noise] or at least fortunately fortunately uh this man recanted\nSoon enough but is not enough to prevent that from getting out there or a limited period of time that there was a fifth rape allegation here in New Orleans center the White House was all involved in it [noise] ah so you know look I this is where does this judge go to get his reputation\nBack to the point where where does it go how does he\nDo that because even courts or this is going to try\nTo him or for the rest of his life and this man is on trial for his life that's the way you have to look at this and you have to remember that in law a burden of proof is always on the accuser\nI'm someone who's being charged with a criminal offense and and and so one has to be the only person proven guilty under America\nEven at this\nThis is out of a judicial proceeding in an enormous sense or or a trial but still those are fundamental principles that people need to remember a newsletter exemplary lives on an entire adult existence\nAnd and so to dredge up stuff for\nThirty six years ago oh my God a high school kid\nTalking about flatulence and other uh soccer more references and his year book or you know this is another thing I fear most of all as as as bad as I go to this man and his family is how this will be a deterrent\nOr other people's rights so people who have a lead model alive you are to come forward and say do I really want to put myself my family to Scott ... of what the face alive so Senator Whitehouse a new drilling down into my ...\nMy God you know I like my diaries\nWhen I was in junior high school or whatever else they can find a trial clear my reputation and a lot of people think that I'm a bad guy and all of that and this has nothing to do with gender it has to do with human decency and integrity caster\n... equally happened to a woman that was some things compose or a man and this is up to cast aspersions on on a a doctor for she seems to believe whatever reason that happened\nTo her look there's just been no proof today no cooperation whatsoever\nBut look there's just no proof that they are no cooperation whatsoever of what she's saying an actual other folks have come forward to refute what she's saying so uh so far the if\nThe principle that person is innocent until proven guilty and let the burden of proof is always on accuser so far that has he met and so uh for other reasons if I was voted to confirm them\nBut on the other hand I think it was probably good for the\nNation's or at least another week so high up any loose and let's see where this ends up with this new information on movie evaluated but so far Senator Whitehouse or some himself no favors and certainly done Rhode Island was by the way you have and I hope people hold them accountable to account for\n[noise] I agree with you judge him before I let you go on that process everyone listening we're speaking with Dr Bob landers he is challenging Senator Sheldon Whitehouse for the Senate seat\nThere's five weeks to go to the election judge a bit this is supposed to be at the very least a fair process\nA Senate Senator Whitehouse sits on the Senate Judiciary is obviously to me very clear that this is not a situation in a position that he takes seriously because he announced in August\nThat he was going to vote no on Capitol before any type of hearing before you spoke to him they had these Feinstein Cory Booker Kamala Harris\nSenator Sheldon Whitehouse they have said plane and clear\nWe will fight and stop any judge that President Trump puts forward judge top lenders they meant it I didn't realize\nAnd maybe I'm naive I didn't know the extent that they would go in order to block that but if Clarence Darrow can't was was being brought up one of the most brilliant judge scholar Albert put forward is very clear Senator Whitehouse he is one thing he means what he says he said\nWe will do what ever possible to block any Trump judge and now we've learned it even even if it means\nBeating up fake account to the press and then the owners becomes on judge Kavanaugh to defend himself and try to prove that it did not happen and that is not the way the courtroom is supposed to uh\nTo happen judge before I let you
