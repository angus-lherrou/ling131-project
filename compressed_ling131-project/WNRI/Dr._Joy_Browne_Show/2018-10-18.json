University of Penn all of a sudden in the eighties she started to as they call checked the box where she was cleaning she was a Native American industry it seems that the average American person actually has more Native American blood than she does\nIs this something that she we know she's actually or I Would call or any way of fake and fraud or Indian and so forth a Native American but he says something to that\nIn the workplace if someone winning in ... you know Joe Smith tomorrow went into a company and checked on that they were on a certain um minority status and then they found out the company found out that they were not\nBecause many times that the people like it or not there are certain guidelines in and they have to hire and certain people get hired to build certain a risk you know I'm a levels that they have to attain until the but\nShe actually I mean not that hard it's going to be ... be charged with fraud active trying to pass the rump this way\n[noise] [noise] well I Would presume that when she filed her applications for jobs on the other um positions\nWhen she checked off a box as Native American unless she's doing it under the pains of penalties or perjury um she kinda Dodgers that bullet and she would always maintained that she had a good faith belief that she had native\nBlood based upon what her mother and her paw paw off these other people allegedly told her about her heritage so she would say I had a good faith belief\nUm that I had this um genetic lineage\nAnd I said when she was applying for these positions or we didn't have ancestry dot com and twenty three it may have all these other companies that could sort of do genetic testing based upon a saliva sample so how\nTesting based upon a saliva sample\nSo how would she approved or disapproved at back when she was applying for these positions for these tests are available um ditch shame knowingly fraud um University of Pennsylvania did she knowingly the fraud Harvard\nDid she knowingly obtained money and positions based upon ally\nI'm sure she did well she ever admit it and could you prove it it would be very difficult to do so um you know she has basically shown that she has one one thousand Peruvian um it's it's it's an embarrassment to the whole system\nThat someone like her credit so flagrantly\nTake advantage of rights and benefits that ship truly be there for legitimate Native Americans who have many times got the short end of the stick in this country and she just saw an opportunity and ran with it\nAnd she took every advantage she could without any justification as it's the speck of all\nWhat about the uh and it was I'll give them credit highly card discovered that she had done this how cooked a cookbook with different recipes and in Cherokee and so forth and she says oh this was the old Indian recipe or near Bailey passed down\nAnd then if you Google it it is a an old French ... be regarded regarding omelets and crap\nNow I I don't know if you get sued for that but that certainly would seem to be a form of plagiarism\n[noise] well [noise] my ... my understanding is that she plagiarized a a recipe\nBy the personal chef for the to conduct yourself when was\nThe word which was published in the New York times Nineteen Seventy nine so I'm not sure if that's still a statute of limitations on plagiarism plagiarism of that particular\nRecipe but you know she I guess she'll have to consult with Joe Biden as to the ... defense for for um [noise]\n... shows an expert at it but that aside it's certainly an embarrassment and I know highly cars been talking about it and certain media outlets have been talking\nAbout are crowded into the big segment on as well if\nIt has been a deafening silence and other segments of it is yeah find that to be curious by its mission\nNo I never did I'm not normally what they would do is circled believe of all let let's jump to um the properties journal it a big story with the war firefighters to this is something that can block on his own with this um\nThis community activists Rob ... started to go through in poor through some of the records um the more fire department and as it stands now the current mayor\nMayor Solomon who's taken over because ... um [noise] he stepped down to ... take a job with ripped the ... I Believe we're trying to say oh no no this was this idea we had\nWith me around the DC and that's why it doesn't appear in the contract Solomon will comment but it it certainly gives off the bee or I believed him that there there could be some ah you know it's being investigated and it could certainly people being charged in this um\nI don't know what to call it scheme or just the way that they would determine hours worked in overtime and ... back in India it it just obviously it's so foreign to anything that would go on in the private sector\n[noise] well and typically all of these municipalities have a\nHard fought negotiated contracts betraying the governmental authority city or the town and the young yet you know teachers are cops or firemen so to say that as a side deal with the um [noise] ...\nI think mayor Solomon is well within his rights to say we're not doing this anymore if it's not a contract rain the contract um is there an ability now for the city of war to go back and what we would call claw back money from the recipients of this money who received at\nUm outside of the purview of the contract\nAnd what Solomon administration have an appetite to go after these union members to try to get money back from them I'm\nJust so clearly wind up in court um it might be Arbor trouble under the union contract but if it's not in the contract I'm not sure any um arbitration provisions were binding but\nClearly this will be litigated and it sounds like Joe Solomon has called um\nThe fire department and its union for an improper practice I think he's right on\nAnd if I'm understanding this correctly but I'm reading right on a minute so there was this element of this monthly credit that was established Pacific time but it did the monthly credit was outside the terms of the contact in Warwick firefighters took sick time based on such credits while receiving payments on you sick time\nI I mean unless I'm reading this incredibly it almost sounds like they were collecting collecting twice\nYeah the double dipping exactly yeah I\nDo believe that it is and I had this whole business of what I was a separate deal outside of the contract we have a ... and I use that to take the thing that could could that could hold up in court\nYes what do you mean hold up at the site agreements enforceable ... no not not being forced or most of these contracts for cops firemen et cetera have provisions that if you retire there's ways for you to collect unused vacation time and ... years sick time\nBut this is a clear double dip yeah there's no other way to look at it\nAnd finally the um the mayor of full rubber Tim I'm\nYou know we've seen at one point as a rising star this petition calling him for him to step down he's a young guy I Believe he attended Providence College certainly has been in the news quite a bit\nVery serious ah investigation what what can you tell us the current status in just the basic scheme of the charges

there's no other way to interpret that\nOther than he is working Joe ... to get Gina Raimondo reelected it doesn't matter motive\nPeople make allegations about a deal will never well we won't know but now we will now between now and the election people say why does he hate him so much I don't know who knows if there's a reason that doesn't have to be a reason I don't think there is a reason\nAll you have to know is if someone is running to win and that's why you know that\nArlene Violet hey everyone he's entitled to right it's not a matter no one's talking about\nShould he run or not he and Patricia Morgan were members of the Republican Party and they bailed out and they're now helping Gina Raimondo get another four years in office and that's what you have to decide this is a two person race\nBetween governor ... do ... do ...\nAnd also Cranston mayor Allen Fung our guy period\nPeriod end of story and I know trail of has his own radio station he's either been on or he's coming on nonstop old Joe what are they now call the Cranston situation that was the ... that incident they don't mention that he lied when he talked about it\nAbsolutely disgraceful\nI Wish him know will will

very well go right ahead\nSummer in a narrative that said I was just some comments saying what you're saying right or\nWrong or to have a summer of that\nUm it was a man with a governor among though\nI don't know but it seems to me that ... game in politics these days so when I was just destroy somebody down\nAnd watch it for him that try when you're just sat and that's why you're just you just said you know I didn't quite hear everything in a manner of speaking and then you're going to get out of it are\nWatching it for him and I thought you know like\nI Can't let that go without saying I'm sitting with very knowledgeable on I'll tell you off you know it is a firm and over the radio station and the St James he might know a fish and shellfish saying Scott I'm always raining or amount of\nMoney you can kind of money into jak let's just say I'm going to take your theory All right I'm going to take your theory I ... and we're going to play it out I I don't believe that there was ever\nA meeting between governor in ... I'm not I'm not saying that they couldn't have been some coordination\nBut the two of them are too smart to ever the two of them ever personally meet now that doesn't rule out that that could be a go between person\nBut if you were to tell me that the two of them actually sent in a room and came to a deal I don't believe that I Believe I got a hold on I but I Do the governor Amano\nWould see something like this as mere politics as horse trading and therefore\nMaking some promise of a deal with someone in exchange for them doing it I think she would see that no differently and justified as a way or many times when they're trying to get boats you have to make\nBy it as a way or many times when they're trying to get boats you have to make concessions I I also think\nThat the person to focus on is her chief of staff brats Brett smiley\nI could see him being authorized to make a promise to a a go between right someone that's a third party that would in order to coordinate the deal but here's where people need to know and I do know I Know both of them there is no legitimate reason\nFor Joe ... to hate Allan Fung none of this and I've said this to none of his campaign makes sense at all if he felt this strongly and he felt he has got resources and I'm going to put it in a time in the up and everything else\nThan he had every possibility to defeat him in a Republican primary how can you say I Can't beat the guy in a primary but I'm going to beat him and the general election it ... it makes their own sense at all and Allen wrong Alan ... his not\nI Know the two of them ... backed human twenty fourteen\nIn twenty sixteen joke trailer was involved with the Trump campaign is an honorary co chair he didn't run for reelection\nDuring that time\nAllan Fung has not done anything to Joe ... the the bee venom that he gives\nIn no way to make sense it it just doesn't so you know but I I hate to hear that people are saying boy you know what to do to I I don't that bomb didn't do anything to him I mean if you're walking down the street and some guy comes up in October that it doesn't mean you did something to annoy the mugger fungus trying to win an election and he's got a guy going after him\nOverturned it for me was trouble on friday saying\nI don't care if I get to ... percent as long as I help her and\nThat's what you just said today that got triggered me and I and I will say that you know if I'll tell you I'm a junior at first it out on the on your station at our eyes and I will tell your fast someday or it was and I know saying you know make some credibility I can never give the presidents\nDon't give the name and I I I Know on on the show tell when someone says that that that to me it was a game changer because that is not someone that is running to win you know when I interview these people and I've interviewed Joe we talk on a\nPath to victory right path to victory if his path to victory\nHis idea of victory is two percent to get ... there's no other way to interpret it that he's working to get Gina Raimondo reelected because if you say all I Want to do is prevent Allen Fong from becoming governor in essence then you're helping Raimondo become the governor\nRight and he died in that job [noise] let me be very clear Joe ... he is Seventy five years old\nHe is of means\nHe is he inherited a great wealth his father was very successful real estate he bought himself and there's nothing wrong with it I've sailed on it Joe ... two million dollars a yacht I sailed on it's beautiful two years ago during the Trump campaign he is a beautiful condo in Florida\nHe is a beautiful home here in Rhode Island ... somebody\nSays oh he he doesn't want a job for me you know he wants to work on a job\nAnd Alan ... is a need a job let me ask you something if you went ten million dollars right and you were Seventy five years old and you were to two million dollar yacht and you would a condo in Florida in a home in Rhode Island when you're when you're sitting someone up to get a job off that person", "station": "WNRI", "city": "Woonsocket"}
