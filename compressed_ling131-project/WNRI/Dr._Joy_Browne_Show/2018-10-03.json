about this and I said\nOn both occasions we are going to cut taxes were going to make sure that we've created a healthy economy and we're going to make sure that kids are ready with a good school system once they're done you know they're going to have jobs and if they're going to leave it's going to be a choice between two competing good paying job offers hair in this state and honesty\nFolks good afternoon ... speak with ... mayor Allen fun lobby see right now locked in the battle with Governor ... to be the next governor this man I Want to go back to the beach\nAnd you may or may not know but I for many years been very friendly with ... family uh recently passed away and I want you to know and many\nPeople didn't see the debate because of some of the Kavanaugh hearings but I Know for a fact it was highly inappropriate within two minutes of the debate governor Gina Raimondo with the family of pretty cop you know still mourning\nDecides to try to drag him into the mind he was buried less than a month ago does she have one out of class was she and her body I Know for a fact\nThe family was greatly insulted and athletes down did did she would use that opportunity to pound on someone like a pretty ... was a friend of mine and on top of that\nHow do you hope you don't need more money to governor Raimondo than anyone else in office you were obviously a gentleman about it but it had to surprise you did she would be so highly insensitive inappropriate about a man who is not even this morning is dead hadn't been dead for a month\nYou know John it doesn't surprise me nothing that the government does like say anything and\nYou know God rest his soul because Mr coffee has done so much for granted before that he has\nNot only in the developments clashed developments poached by the way John that a single tax dollar has he asked from uh me and Cranston\nEarned a shot him like that I mean you're a better man than I Am is to me because I Would and then you know what governor why don't you borrow a buck and go buy yourself some class I Know back in ... family could not believe all were appalled\nAnd how generous their father wants to her and within five minutes of that debate starting boom she starts blaming the late friday copy and on and we just passed away a month ago that\nThat was a new low in Rhode Island politics\nOh absolutely because you know that's a that's our governor she uses people for her own personal gain we see it all the time it's for her it's about the dollars that's how our decisions are made you know and that's what's got to change she's an insider all the way they do worse\n... inside of the picture pocket that's right it's a lighter campaign coffers and not only issue satisfied\nWith just you know picking pockets of Rhode islanders she goes out of state that's right the playboy mansion at a fundraiser New York City California Silicon Valley Texas with the Enron guys you know this has got to stop you know I'm running because I care about what's going on in our backyards John\nYou know what else ... in in ... it's ... I Know she asked you about going to the presidents\nSo it's a ... I Know she asked you about going to the presidential inauguration and those have missed the mayor hunger rides you there might train somebody actually worked to an island that hey it's gonna be cold tosses ... says hey why don't you grab a Trump pat\nWell okay I'll tell you what Mr Mayor many people let's talk about Congress insist saline went to that al ... congressman Landrieu and went to that a presidential inauguration I Believe that even when socket nearly a ... ... ... governor among do when you are the governor\nUn an obligation to go in represent the people of the state and she has no problem earphones flying all over the country to try to pick the pockets grabbed as much money she can she couldn't spend one day down in DC you fly in your polite you mean do you network in boom she\nI I was not living up to her\nDuties as governor by not being there in representing us that you know why because she was pounding 'cause she thought he was going to win that\nIs the real story on the inauguration not that it was cold out and someone toss you a Trump pat but then you ... I went to D.C and it was freezing and I went to prison Obama's in our region someone I wouldn't put on Obama had I mean the whole thing is ridiculous\nIt is and you had a great point John because that is in about a Democrat\nRepublican or an hour ago and it's about\nBeing an American an inauguration and it was the one time in my life and my wife's a life that we were attending an inauguration\nYes and you know on the hit the nail on the head had so many Democrats that paid respect or to you know the inaugural process\nYou know the Democratic process of our country unlike our governor and look as governor whether it's you know President Trump whether it's a Democrat in office or any other party you pay respect and a ten you know the ratio\nYes on behalf of the people of Rhode Island she represents us you know through a temper tantrum and just see behind me also and again folks were speaking with ... and ... I Am an Italian and I want to tell you I was speaking with some members of the sons of Italy last night\nAnd I will be the first one on record is offensive or it is absolutely embarrassing for her to be running commercials and taking one quote that somebody compared oh what was going on and ... it was like the mafia\nThat is absolutely offensive she wouldn't do that with any other group and even as a matter of fact\nA colonel O'Donnell who she removed because he wouldn't be a puppet for her and when you've been to the no bid contract\nThat colonel Issam has gone into even colonel Donald ... just because somebody mentioned that in a report doesn't make a true I Am calling a governor among do that is offensive to all Italians there was no other group that she would ever throw that into a campaign commercial on\nOh yeah yeah absolutely right John and you know I'm Glad colonel a former criminal that'll stepped up\nThat yeah it does look it's not that way at all John you know we had some problems in that apartment you straighten him out\nOn like when there are who we do a lot of problems with all the things that she screwed on right\nJohn when you think about it how unconscionable it hypocritical she is you know we're in a situation where I fix the problems she\nStill has that ongoing problem and you have nots ranks\nHundred forty eight million jobs I was just calculating not cause when you take a look at thirty eight studios that is seven ten times what everyone is paid for thirty eight studios\nRight it's crazy times\nMore and there's still no end in sight and never mind the kids at the Y. F. that have been hurt or you know that are up sadly dead\nIt's not right and you know I'm going to fix that from day one and you know my plan is like I said during the debate fire\nDo Lloyd yeah look who jumped on the ... the former head\nAt D.C why you shouldn't have been there anyways Jamie McDonald's is now working in a cushy job in the oil yeah but this little conspiracy of ... you know when I was a criminal prosecutor you know they torture Rico\nChickens fares little triangle but build that triangle that financial try and go for the governor yeah that's where the corruption is that's where the unethical a underpinnings of our government is its\nStops on her and we got to shake up that state house from day one\nSo to speak with ... to be around bond and Mr Mayor again you were very diplomatic you a hint of yourself tremendous you won the debate by the way that I've been saying everyone anyone to watch it you clearly won the debate when I was also struck by your calm demeanor\nIndependent candidate Mr six percent Joe ... interrupted you know less than six times governor ... would stand Nick ... almost like she was ... church I get a million man if I didn't need if I didn't know any better\nAnd I hate to be a conspiracy person boy if I didn't know any better I don't think the two of them were conspiring against you\nKnow I felt that way and I can tell you I went to overcome it yet I'm going to let it bother me at least another four to five\nDebates left people going to say the ... how we act because how he acts that polish behavior\nIs not appropriate\nFor the governor's office is going to be what I'm going to have to expect\nAnd deal with but the bottom line is my focus is on the governor and her reckless spending the people that she's hurt in my class attorney stayed around through tax cuts through make a show we put even stronger climate still welfare you know I talk about real issues\nThat into you know cutting I'm a budget you know putting in a specter general or even making sure that there's a photo ID just like a ... a photo ID on T. cards talking about this for wait too long\nThat's right I Will act on all of these plans to make sure that you know we stop stop what's going on at the state house right now\n[noise] and also before we let them go I Want people to understand that when you have three people on stage and one person he's truly trying to improve the state the other person is strictly can well she hears about is using this as a political stepping stone and then a third person at six percent\nIn the midst of the the president has taken this president has taken this long\nNot all of these allegations that he is taking choosing\nAnd he has made Bill Clinton\nHe decided to change his mind\nInteresting you bring up Bill Clinton nobody wants to hear those accusers voices be heard that you're certainly happy to hear all the other day they\nI said I don't have any say so I don't mind to them\nServe several times in the last week the president has\nI think it's a sign that the president wants to protect people with preexisting health conditions [laughter] I think it's pretty simple he said that he supports that he wants to make sure that that's not something that gets a chance\nStates mocking somebody to social circle your soul seemed\nTo me that he was stating facts that Dr Ford herself a laid out in her testimony once again a every single word that judge Kavanaugh has said has been looked at examine picked apart by most of you in this room but not no one is looking at a\nNot the accusations made her corroborated whether or not there's evidence to support them every person that she names I\nHas come out and said either they didn't call it or didn't happen or they weren't there every single bit of evidence and facts that we've seen in this moment have supported judge Kavanaugh's case and the president simply pointing out the facts of the matter and that is what the Senate will have to use to determine whether or not they vote to support him or not or saying I\nI think both Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh ah or victims I've always felt\nThat that is just a sample of what Sarah Huckabee Sanders is dealing with the White House press corps good afternoon it's down to ... ah let's go to the phones good afternoon your next hello\nHello John how you doing very well guarded had\nHey I Want to make a point where uh the media is saying and some of the west wing Democrats saying that you always have to believe the victim All right well no I Will say that you should believe the victim when they make that claim but\nIf you have no corroborating evidence and the material witness to that are alleged to have been there completely ... taking place I mean what what do you watch you know what I'm saying\nI mean how much more proof can you go fishing for now they want to leave the witnesses I mean the victims but these people we're with the when one Roderick quality shows Jennifer Flowers and Monica Lewinsky world all making allegations against Bill Clinton them under the bus\nAnd completely assassinating their character\nNot only that they they are inventing\nAlmost on a new form of justice in the country which is\nWhen anyone makes an accusation that it should automatically be believed then that's not the way our system is set up I mean the way our system is set up regardless of the allegations of the crime but he's you know it is a you know it's it's innocent until proven guilty\nSo if I you know this is a good example dismayed on meet the press if I say the new stole my car\nThat doesn't mean that I go to the police and they automatically but I I have to show some kind of evidence so the police investigate to find out whether or not in fact you sold my car no one's automatically believe like that this business of\nYou know ... I Believe women I Believe survivors whoever comes forward with an accusation should be believed\nThat that is absolutely insanity ... these no dynamic like that they they are literally making this up as they go along\nWith other thing I noticed too in her testimony is this is what they say you know what do you remember most okay she remembers the stairway she remembers the layout of the room she remembers the laughing but she never said she remembers seeing judge Kavanaugh during this\nOnly when she was asked if there was any uncertainty about who did that she was Brett Kavanaugh that's when you were saying all the things that she remembered she never said that he was the one that absolutely\nThat is exactly right and you know there's also the human dynamic that sometimes people either exaggerate or lie and then they're put into a box and they feel they have to continue\nWith the lie and then they just cemented into they put themselves into that in\nA lot of people may not be familiar with it but it was the case to put Al Sharpton on the map and it was from the eighties and it was a twang Brawley case where these allegations were so hideous initial story was that this young girl\nA was missing for the weekend and that these white cops are kidnapped her took her upstate and that they raped her in basically held her kidnapped there was a huge story in New York cause protest that everything else\nWell when the real story came out\nIt turned out that twang Brawley who is this girl she had a boyfriend and she took off from them for the weekend and she didn't want to get in trouble\nSo she told her mother that's what happened and the people like Al Sharpton got involved and then even when the whole story was proven to be for\nPeople like Al Sharpton another they they just continued this drumbeat that that was actually what happened when it didn't happen and so something to pay attention with this whole Dr Ford store and some of these other stories\nDr Ford to me was set up because she was promised initially by Dianne Feinstein and others don't worry we're going to keep you anonymous you'll never have to come forward and testimony that if the track they sat\nKeep you anonymous you'll never have to come forward and testimony that is the trap they set for them now once they get them in it's kind of a thing of like in for a penny you're in for a penny earned for a pound now Dr Ford\nHas to continue the charade of saying that all of this stuff happened otherwise she's she's a liar so unfortunately\nUnless something changes to her grave she'll continue to insist that that this story happened but this you know this happens with police all the time where people they steal from work\nRight this after work and they pretend and they come up with a story that someone came in and robbed them\nAnd the police are going on it\nAnd their boxed in and then finally sometimes after a while when they finally break them they say are and I made it up\nI made it up and sometimes you may notice in the news how about sometimes it's like a runaway bride you know the day before the wedding the woman disappears and then she says oh I was kidnapped and data and then it turned out that she didn't want to get married\nShe panicked and and you know the whole story falls apart and she wasn't kidnapped and she wasn't held\nShe just didn't know what to do she got an itself in a situation and she felt boxing on the story\nSo to make on the small wage I just recently a Cessna one easy and I don't want my\nChild a lovely oh my God you know Audubon oddity of green sometimes some of these flights like they have tape air like those they call them the puddle jumpers holy moly that's where they take your weight and ah there was only like eight people in the plane it's unbelievably loud now if you can fly on that you do not have a fear of flying\nThat's right [laughter] so but what I Believe now is they kind of tricked her because I Do believe they told her all along\nDon't worry you're never gonna have to you know you're always going to remain anonymous or them where they tricked her is Dianne Feinstein and probably Senator Sheldon Whitehouse they leak turn named to the Washington Post so now she's stuck\nNow she's in California now they start making up things she's afraid to fly or she needs more time all these delay tactics\nThen they got her you know I I Believe this woman never did want to come forward but that is the low level gutter politics that Dianne Feinstein and Sheldon Whitehouse play\nWhich is that you know and this is the last thing that the people need them said they don't care about her they don't care about Brett Kavanaugh day that to in their mind they're sick demented evil mind it has all collateral damage they don't\nShare in the lead us to find the means ends\nJustify the means ... percent notice Dr Ford\nThat woman Rachel Mitchell who is question are you know she ended up being actually excellent because when she asked her about have you have any knowledge about a polygraph and\nIn and then you know have you ever given tips on this so people are wondering where is this going well she and her pocket has a sworn statement from the ex boyfriend saying that he witnessed her giving tips to a friend of hers hot to beat a polygraph test so she's asking her questions that she knew the answers to\nIt that's really good lawyers and you just never ask questions I don't know the answer", "city": "Woonsocket"}
