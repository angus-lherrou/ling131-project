I. dot com and lead lead wireless R. I. dot com let's bring 'em out books he is our legal expert good afternoon to him down highway doing Tim dot\nVery good job good afternoon to you\nTim I went to uh start off with um obviously yes it will started actually a Monday Night there was a report that some package had been hand delivered\nTo George Soros says residents and then yesterday it was obviously the big huge news of the day and some of these envelopes were being sent apparently to I'm President Obama's D.C address\nHillary Clinton's addressing chapel Guam CNN got the biggest news because then they cleared out the whole newsroom um I'd like it if you could address\nSome of the legal implications the FBI is investigating right now now this morning also apparently one was mailed to Robert Deniro actor Robert Deniro restaurant down in Tribeca but what what type of consequences legal consequences fall into play on something like this\n... this is many many very serious consequences um if there is a person out there who is orchestrating this entire episode\nUm fortunately under these bombs exploded or cause any injury to anyone at this point in time [noise]\nUm [noise] I'm hearing reports that these bombs were all on stable and could have gone off of sharing the fuse bombs were all very rudimentary and design and um\n[noise] weren't very sophisticated if the bomb maker whoever did this didn't have a lot of sophistication that at least they were willing to show maybe they have more sophistication maybe not on the legal side um\n[noise] this would be seen as terrorism so you're at a federal charges for terrorism I'm clearly it's a threat to um in some cases um\nWell shore us as a private citizen and the uh two former presidents have specific statutory federal protections I'm not a a\nTo correct me if I'm wrong I don't think any up and said to sitting congressional or Senate personnel and no I don't believe so\nSo that would be a different crime if they start showing up I'm In the in the offices of sitting federal officials that would be most serious so\nDon't know who to visceral why or if this is a legitimate threat from right wing people\nTo intimidate the left or this is a plant from the left to make it look like it's from the right to stir up the left space it's too soon to know what the answer is\nI'm I'm not that familiar with the right wing groups or you know supporters of the president being um\nFolks are set up bombs I mean you have a Unabomber years ago the Oklahoma bombing years ago um those are the only things\nThat we're not ... I think specifically from a left wing perspective on like um\n[noise] assassination attempt on the congressional baseball game last year et cetera so the federal charges if they find the perpetrator will be extensive and that person is found in if convicted as looking at a long long time a president this is extremely serious you don't fool around with this stuff\nLong time a president is is extremely serious you know for all of this stuff\nTim what about the fact I I was reading this morning that apparently whatever was sent\nTo CNN it basically there was no I'm reading some headlines FBI accept the high profile and says there's an arrogance to coordinate is Trina packages could offer clues but one of the things that was sent to CNN apparently was not\nEver going to have the possibility of being detonated a pipe bomb powder delivered to CNN will harmless but still the it's got to be you know again just it doesn't matter whether included or I'm asking does it matter where they could have been detonated or just the fact that someone sent this\nSeemingly as a prank or the penalties are going to be very severe should they catch this individual individuals\n[noise] well it would still be akin to terrorism by doing this even fell off fake bombs or bombs or could never have detonated there would be federal charges stemming from at um let's assume they were all phony bombs but the sender simply wanted to intimidate\nFolks on the left or because the person doesn't like the left wing progressive agenda and it was a message being sent to careful what you're doing because next time they could be a real or explosives that could be the case\nI'm there could be a significant lawsuit filed for these firefighters to disc gorge\nOr give back yeah money wrongfully\nObtained and that would be hundreds of thousands of dollars now does some air in the city council have an appetite to go after what's typically one of the strongest unions at any minute ... right that remains to be seen but there's clearly 'em away here for the city to get that money back\n[laughter] well same thing east Greenwich they were tossing around this\nIdea that it was I Love this idea of decide agreement as you said it's actually a secret agreement and it is then simply does make sense because none of the numbers are rounding up\nAnd they try to do and on and on and as soon as they get up and then they realize like well that's because things were being prices will not approved ratified but ... they are saying that these these individuals should have to pay the money back\nOh absolutely yeah no brainer that\nThat's a completely that it's not contractual there's no legal basis for if there's no agreement from the city or the town to make these payments um I'm not sure why it never showed up\nIn any audits or how it could have remained um invisible to council members or other you know the financial officers of Warwick or you scratch\nOr were they looking the other way or is that just buried and so much paper that say never quite saw it I mean go for Ken Block and Mr Cody for figuring this all out\nCan could this end up resulting in some kind of ... criminal charges against those those individuals\nIt it's not criminal it's just that they had no legal authority to do it I mean it's\nNeither have the ability to bind to the other end neither have the ability to bind uh especially the police I mean excuse me the fire chief didn't have the um authority independently to bind to the city without getting approval from the city council right or at least some form of counseling the bare it's crazy\nIt's not it's not possible to do that\nAre you I'm just like ... ... it is remarkable that\nThe um if if they had not filed a grievance against ... interim mayor Solomon then this whole thing kind of could of gone on to the reader and no one would've known but deep down so\nWhenever you want to thank confident about it or did they actually found agreements when he stopped the program\n[noise] well yes a mayor Solomon\nDid the right thing and he stopped it and I'm not specifically familiar with the Warwick firefighters union but typically is firefighter unions\nHave um a lot of hubris and I'm sure that they thought they were entitled to it right or maybe maybe it in and check with their legal counsel as to the legality are armed forces ability of this but I think that\nThere becomes almost an institutional a feeling of entitlement to these benefits whether they're legitimate or not and filing a grievance sort of\nShows that up to this is just to feel like we're entitled to this give it to us um I think they're going to lose\nYeah a good afternoon ... speaking with Rhode Island top attorney Tim dot hate Tim I'm seeing this just come over the wire right now\nReuters is reporting Reuters news service investigators believe most suspicious packages sent a prominent Democrats went through U.S Postal service investigation is focusing on\nFlorida so it certainly helps\nLearn so it certainly helps seemingly that it it they all went through the U.S postal service and the fact that they're focusing on Florida that would lead me to believe that you know just again through surveillance or they start\nTo go in if they can narrowed down in the area I I don't know when exactly but I Would I'd be very surprised if they don't have someone in custody I'm at some point over the next couple of days\n[noise] yeah I Would think by the end of the week I you'll have you'll have your your person um\nThat helps a lot but it went through the normal males and it helps if they've already um identified it as Florida [laughter] it is kind of interesting but it's a Floridian who I guess mailed his packages from ... Florida they all have the return a mailing address of Debbie Wasserman\nHeavy ... Florida yes [laughter] that's what leads me to believe this to me who I we had no idea who it is but I think it's it's some kind of been not who's doing this as a prank and not\nA demented killer thank God like a Unabomber Ted Kaczynski or Timothy McVeigh\nI think when they find this person or you know each probably beat him the usual nine you know it was quiet kind of keep to himself pay the rent on time either battery so it was going to turn his life around but one of those he just like a basement dweller not\nDid somehow came up with this and thought it would be some kind of a bunny prank that again we don't know but I mean the fact that none of them detonated him anything it seemed a lot of them were never going to be able to detonate\nSeems to be more someone ... ... ... ... ... you know it'd be a twisted mind and there's going to be a heavy penalty for even pulling this kind of ... but it seems to be more in line and that\nIs opposed to someone who is truly serious about trying to have a situation where someone opens the package and then it didn't need to the mail room\nYeah but if you look at last year when we had the um baseball for a congressional baseball attempted assassination the shooter in that case was a volunteer Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign\nThat's right he was\nHe was a well known leftist she fit the profile and your hair virtually nothing about that Association He was painted in the mainstream media is just sort of ... with a gun nothing about his affiliation on the on the left\nWhereas when this these packages came out it's like the left have talking points pre packaged typed up and ready to\nGo it's right because they're trying to save this type of activity as all caused by the Trump rallies Braley is\nAnd the the the vibe that he was giving off of the country which has claws and conflict and\nIt's just interesting how one report when ... feathers the left to say that this is all Trump's falls gets widely disseminated and when somebody on the left as drawing the bad deeds it's not reported you got to go looking for it\nYeah hate him before we let you go finally I sent you a the email a secretaries Deepak ...\nExcuse me ... secretary said Packwood less Republican running it's been only going to be a he had a press conference the other day any or someone come forward\nAnd basically present evidence that his son\nWent to where the secretaries he'd had this if you need a free voter ID card and this individual was able to go when they ask for no proof of any identity so we could have gone and said my name is John to be true I'm such a ... or anything\nAnd just filled it out in a\nSeemingly Packwood Linda had a press conference talking about that this seemingly completely violates the letter of the lore of how someone is supposed to be able to obtain\nThe voter id so I said to be pressed material from ... and then also a statute that has to do with it and I am curious to hear your your legal opinion on this\nI think pat is certainly on to something of the statute regarding um [noise] absentee ballots and voter identification as specific and I think\nHad does cited in his a press release and I heard a little of his discussion with your last hour\nBut we're island since two thousand twelve has had a voter identification law and I know when I voted in the primary um a couple of months ago you have to show your driver's license and then you're allowed to vote they've put your license and some little\n\nDevice that looks at it confirms that which is all fine I'm happy to do it [noise] um\nThere is a provision for um provisional ballots and the same stature to if you show up to vote and you don't have id\nThan you are given a provisional ballot\nAnd your complete information where your certifying\nUm who you are and where you live and then you're allowed to vote those provisional ballots get segregated and you know if it's a close election they have in um well they all had open no matter what uh before the board of elections and they try to confirm and match up\nThis provisional ballot which you filled out and assigned to see if your signature matches the signature they have on file\nSo there is a methodology to it there's nothing in the statute about a quote unquote emergency ballot there is something about an absentee ballot there is something about a provisional ballot valley or B is talking about emergency ballots all the time and I don't see it in the statutes specifically um\nI think pat has a legitimate issue there\nThe other point of this and it's not\nPart of what pat brought to the table but you and I talked about it and the last presidential election cycle I myself could not vote on Tuesday I didn't know it was going to be out of town I didn't get it at an absentee ballot way and it fast so I went to the city hall and got a provisional ballot\nTemple of desserts are made fresh in house whether it's tearing me sue or key line pie stopping and see them at ... wine bar in Tuscan grill nine Seventy Douglas Pike route seven ... seven six six Thirteen eighty seven six six Thirteen able to go back to the\nPhones good afternoon you're next on the on the beach or show hello\nGreetings John how are you\nVery well go right ahead\nGo ahead or I or I happened to be listening today can always listen to you but when I Do I find it the most interesting and I heard the other woman call I forget her name but I just heard or make a reference to history\nAnd she referred back to ancient Rome and the parallels of moderate America yes and\nYou know I sent you an email um that would cap socialize they report ears or go down on a TV network colder than smoke report and it was the ah writing in Nineteen fifty nine of one or one of the great golfers Taylor called well I'm sure you're familiar with her very much so\n[noise] the captains and the kings TV miniseries and so forth well she wrote this story and has a capsized audio version as well as visual which are detailed the incredible\nSaga of the beginnings and the fall of Rome and was one of the empire that felt it was the republic that changed to a democracy and then that became um a box\nOf course see and then that changed or an empire once in a nation becomes an empire as we did and tore wars then it must declined from within it must Adel itself\nFor the burdens of the whole world and this is what is happening to America today our borders do not exist anymore on the ...\nSo you have to we listen do you want to have a country or not we cannot allow that Caribbean to come into the United states I agree\nWith you I'm just saying that they do not exist today and whether it's the Democrats primarily and many Republicans who have gone along to get along you know they've just uh they obviously want free labor and they want or they want their votes this is what it's all about registering illegals to vote\nAnd calling them legal and I don't trust the voting machines in Rhode Island under Nelly gourmet or do you\nAbsolutely not no no no way\nSo anyway my my point is you know not to believe or a bus these issues transcend politics in my opinion they just go beyond just a you know political kingdom and America is going to be restored again these are moral issue these are socially\nMore of a moral reprehensible issues where we have thrown God out of this country ...\nHow about um let me let me interject you familiar with the story that Governor among does husband were for him to she's gotten sixty thousand a donations there's did work for Saudi Arabia they fingered quote dissidents in the country as a result of the work\nOf governor among those husband Andy ...\nThat's why that journalists worked most who worked for the Washington Post was basically murdered in Saudi Arabia I don't know how they were paid handsome only by the Saudi Arabian government by the king them I don't know how you call that blood money within sixty thousand dollars went into her campaign from that\nWhile you know I Would say that's the only one little begun a boat compared to what he and she\nHave invested in what they have done over the years Iran will treasure\nThe hour she became general treasure she was all straight broker or Wall Street investor it up now with all the Bernie made off so all of the criminal elitist right back to\nThe mafia those ins mafia and what she does what she does this represent them Ruth Simmons was a good example of that at Brown university [noise] she was denouncing racism every single day of the week and then all of a sudden shed investments and Goldman Sachs very quiet\nAnd when I came to Israel or came to Saudi Arabia she didn't want to talk about that\nMoney speaks John it's all about money\n... unfortunately the budget does business with Ramon does husband we think about that for instance and I live right now President Trump under attack in these saying well he's the cause for\nYou know people calling CNN the news in these fake by the way through new explosives nothing is that needed these high then like a mock repairing but they're blaming President Trump for inflaming people against the ... the first gentleman\nGovernment does has been well the first murder as we may call okay now do you think President Trump inflamed to billions of media Wendy ... governor mom does has been the first gentleman he a dentist fight a journalist in Saudi Arabia who then what's an act murdered\nAnd that's just one that we know about so as much as they can say that when President Trump cents at a rally CNN and the news ... let's let's be very clear about this no one loses their life the work on ... and his company McKinsey they do in fact have\nOn their hands but the death of Batman and Saudi Arabia and thank you for the call and a dentist by him to the Saudi Arabian government as a dissident folks that cannot be ignored good afternoon it's John ... it is the John ...
