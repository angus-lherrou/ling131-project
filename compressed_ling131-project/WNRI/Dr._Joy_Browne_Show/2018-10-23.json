backlog keeps growing all these people from all the projected cost almost a hundred and fifty million dollars\nIn a bad decision I made a bad to have an event\nYou know when people see that folks that is the new commercial by the phone campaign number one it's right on the money it's very emotional when you see that but what I Want people sort of ... her phone is wild this was going on and those women that you hear and the other voices governor Monday which crisscrossing the country fund raising\nDid you hear on the other voices governor Monday was crisscrossing the country fund raising raising money\nShe didn't care about it and now we found out you expose last week there was even fraud as far as just put in these Social Security numbers\nWe've still never got an accurate information she launched that with her cronies that had no business with that you know it's so interesting to take away it against those good afternoon it's down to ... France may around phone inside in Studio with me\nWhen it comes to her campaign\nGovernor ... when it comes to her\nShe hires without question some of the most expensive uh professionals available when it came to you can't see what it's about her she spends don't cost when it came to you'll hit\nHe threw it to just some ... said you had no knowledge what they were doing because she really didn't care the ramifications now that\nIs selfish and that is self absorbed if that had been if the people they cheat fired for her campaign for the polling for the fundraising mechanism if she had been running you hip I'm sure it would have been a completely different story\nIt's unconscionable and I keep saying that word because it really is John when you talk about who was put in charge of that program\nThe former executive director of the Democratic party a woman with no experience at ... or even ... you gotta be kidding and what's most you know disturbing about the whole incident is the federal government told the governor don't go you're not ready internally told her\nDon't go yes but not only does she go hit that go beyond she basically\nEliminates all these front line workers yeah that would have been there to answer the phone ... to take you know my dad's applications shark it on when it was last not once but twice yet you know for a long term care benefits this is the stuff that's got to stop\nAnd I'm not just raising this John you know I've talked about this issue this personal to me I put together a plan to fix this then make sure that you're not the ... number one they got to go yet how you signed back a contract with the same manner that put us in this mess in the first place a trait second of all\nBringing some legitimate IT outside experts get fresh cut her by Ken this system work as it was originally designed implant and if not let's scrap it\nBecause six hundred you know we were talking about six forty eight\nYou know we found during a press conference with the to whistle blowers another documented shows it probably was another twelve million more because of our design changes and today on the general assemblies website we saw a possibly another six million dollars more keeps going up and up and I'm a truck from point in time\nWe've got to cut our losses say enough is enough I don't want to see this go through that one billion dollar you know Russia because this is already crossing there's too much\nYou know we're going to be sitting in November voting on two hundred and fifty million dollars for school bonds\nHow many schools can we have done without you know over six hundred million\nRight that is exactly right folks Cranston mayor Allen song us in Studio folks ah Mr Mayor\nOr the election now is just two weeks away four years ago Gina Raimondo sit on a stage with Angel Harris and play pal and talked about\nEmpty Superman building economic malaise and instead what we find has pro slashing jobs lost applause socks last pennies I still don't see economic development Providence is a full mess and as we look south\nTo the Caribbean making their way towards us border keep in mind governor Mondale and ... you're the only one\nThat says I Would not allow sanctuary cities and I would not get driver's licenses to illegal governor I'm ondo has already told people for first started getting reelected executive order your driver's license for illegal aliens\nAnd that's not going to happen on the phone and say I can't afford it and is the mayor you know it's interesting you missed out one other one Nordstrom is losing its right leaning ... that should be a way that is\nYou know it's all into her she can't disown that absolutely he lives in Providence and also what do we see a city completely run amok now they say when you run a sanctuary city you can't control is coming in and then they're surprised when Richard Gardner the U.S child rape is a molester\nHe wants to shut up said a set up shop and proud of of course he does because that's who goes to a sanctuary city ... illegals\nThat maybe have criminal records or our child molesters ... a set up in Providence and there's no mechanism to find out who exactly these people are\nTrying to serve our number one safety in the community that's right and I can't understand why well as Merrill laws are him this governor can understand the one principle that we should all be in agreement is if you're a criminal and you ... you gotta go that's right\nYou know we're not talking about everyone else we're not talking about our law enforcement actions I didn't know it but if your criminal we have you with the tension yes\nWe are going to cooperate with federal law enforcement and say look it up to them to come and get them\nSure their decision but if you're not cooperating with them\nOr it's ridiculous and that's what got to change because that's why Providence is the mess that it is right now people don't feel safe up there you know\nI I went with my wife or the other night the beautiful Barbara and sent me a for a you know dinner up on the hill yeah but you see that it was unbelievable terrible after a certain time people start leaving I said you're not the hill that it's\nNot ... ... people used to have dinner one spot\nMaybe go get a a desert somewhere else walk around have a drink restaurant owners tell me they don't feel safe they get in the car and then they just go home I Am so glad and again folks could afternoon it's they're trying to picture show Institute with the Cranston mayor Allen Fung I Am so glad during that debate you brought up\nRamon dealer Santos and people in this area should know\nHe was living right on the bubble in Central Falls border governor of on do completely misrepresented I won't say lie I'll just say misrepresented she blamed ice this guy was being it was that the CIA under her direction it started with chase the they did not notify ice\nThat this dangerous illegal\nDrug kingpin was about to be released government do stood on that debate stage you are and said well why should have been in the parking lot to pick them up well I Can't be everywhere and they didn't know that he's about to be released governor phone you would change the permission so ice in fact this guy never would have been released\nCorrect ... we were at\nThe very least John picked up the phone and saying this guy's got to be coming out [laughter] yeah you guys have a painter on him a letter you know get them out of here and that's a big part of from the governor was being so disingenuous because one federal law enforcement want someone like that\nYou think they're going to wait until it comes in the parking lot said there are a lot of families other people didn't know that that are not you could have a dangerous situation is what ... what is supposed to happen is once entertainers large you know I says we are going to come down in picking them up they hold them aside and Sally port in an area that's different from where\nYou know other civilians so that you don't have that you know our confrontation possibly that could happen yes that's what's supposed to happen Jon\nYeah you know what else again folks Cranston mayor Allen Fung is in Studio and miss mayor I Want to go back you know governor among do she lives in Providence but she lives in little bubble in Providence you know Richard Gardner isn't living on her street\nA lot of the crime she drives around with twenty four hour protection she doesn't have to deal with that a city of Providence there's room for\nFor our protection she doesn't have to deal with that a city of Providence there's room for growth in the city needs to come back but it needs a governor who's going to hold that mayor accountable instead she obviously has no control over mayor Lois or\nWhen we're talking about municipal IDs for those Frank\nIndividuals that Harold hey that's if you kill us so ridiculous concept Roger in shock and also so they can go to the public library that's sort of it's about it's so illegal aliens have some form of id in case they stopped by police correct and\nThat's exactly it has has one of the things that you know and I want to jump back I had learned to because the governor has been so dishonest about this yes even in this is where you know I feel bad uh with who she told us to\nThe Latino community and yeah I remember in two thousand fourteen I Want to go there John I sat in the road on Latino political action committee this was their main issue\nShe told him I was going to do this by executive order right and then what happens you get to the office and say oh no it's got to be done by the general assembly and the flex on them punted over to them now of a sudden you know another election cycle it's going to be a tough election where maybe what you know she's running back to them to panic around us that if they\nIf they believe her shame on everyone that's right because quite honestly I won't lie I wouldn't lie for them men not lying to now and I wouldn't lie to Rhode Island just because one of my main problem is the main problem is\nA real ID on that real driver's license violates the federal real idea yes so in twenty Twenty one that law comes effect into Rhode Island\nOne of her max out donors relatives up John that it I Can't I in the score how important and twenty\nFive thousand dollar no big contract that studied diversity training and the troopers that I talked to say\nMorale is down some go skipped over six people\nSaid nothing against her but there is a chain of command there were men and women that worked very hard to be in that position governor among do like everything else she wanted a puppet that she could control and it was about that no big contract or that happened in Chicago governor Fong you I Believe\nWould boost up spirits I Know that ... what would the troopers you or someone they could rally behind because you believe in law and order\nAbsolutely John you know it's so frustrating as you know when I was a criminal prosecutor I used to do a lot of work with uh the state police particularly the organized crime you know the hours in the narcotics and organized crime you know the attorney general's office you know they were always always the pride and joy of Rhode Island younger when they used to be on the tonight\nShow you know as you know in their brand new ... on the show with David Letterman and he was not like that or not like that at home when have you seen\nJohn troopers going to other jobs were up for it yet but I also think that that happens\nWhen you have a government of and I try to understand what's going on in a comic let me tell you a little a crazy story and land range or because you know the troopers they do this great community event um where they give a give out I'm back to school supplies for a lot of the kids and they chose one of the schools and Cranston\nSo obviously you know I was invited and I'm happy to go whether it's them or any outside organization that comes in absolutely happy to have them in their\nForm of a sudden a there are one of our schools glad sorcery school which you know a lot of 'em are low income is twenty two language spoken a lot of kids in need shark\nNow we're going to do a little pressure yup that's\nWhat I found out happened I wasn't even supposed to speak\nI'm sitting here on what's this about you know you're\nYou're in ... and I wanted to welcome you guys thank you guys like that and so all of a sudden it worked its way off because colonel Sumpter wasn't even supposed to be there oh wow they found out that I'm like wait a minute I mean there's got to be on the calendar agenda just the dirt you know think every one of the air and stuff\nIt costs such a world when that the governor\nA colonel was supposed to be out of like out on a day off or something called her back so that she had to come there and introduce and deal with that I could just so I can say\nWelcome back you write wasn't anything no ethical that visit how political yeah this administration is and that's how a political they made that state police yep disturbing it shouldn't happen morale should be higher it\nShould be made and you should know and I want everyone to know the the troopers adored island state police there behind ... Morales has never been lower\nWith Rhode Island state police under colonel innocent Gulf and to me it is the enemy of and they call it the Peter principle someone is good at one level and then governor among do to make a political statement I Want to point the first female head of the state police instead of the best qualified person puts her in the top job\nClearly in over her head and mayor ... another element now\nJob clearly in over her head and mayor ... another element now governor ... goes after you and did during the debate why you went down to the inauguration thank you for doing that a President Trump and as you're there it's freezing out you don't ever had\nA guy from Rhode Island tosses you here's a winter had to wear warm and it's a Trump that they they try to do a commercial is if you've committed a federal crime let's talk about President Trump and number one governor ... did not even go\nTo the inauguration she was supposed to be there to represent the people of Rhode Island you don't\nTake the oath to represent some of the people you go to represent everyone she was the only governor\nTo boycott like a spoiled child that integration because Hillary Clinton\nDid not win dust it prevented ... from getting a job within the Clinton Administration cushy job cushy job that's right she had an absolute obligation\nJack Reed went to that Sheldon Whitehouse went to that facility lands but everyone you went there a couple of the mayor's I think Charlie Lombardi went she had every obligation to go\nYou know what you did ample one day you're polite you fly down in the morning comeback she didn't even go well let me talk about President Trump just for a minute latest approval rating forty seven percent higher than President Obama in his first term that term much higher than governor Gina Raimondo okay so people don't like some of the tweeting\nAnd some people do like some of the other ethics but let's talk about the fact the economy is roaring right so he has in fact bought spirit to the party he stayed and ran\nIn the Republican Party rats when Trump did even bail out like a coward Robert and run against Ted Cruz at independent he stayed and won\nThe election fair and square he is improving trade deals\nThey can knock 'em all they want but they don't like the tweeting well guess what I don't like her Criss crossing a nonstop fundraising that she does bacon not President Trump but he is delivering for the American people there's no way about that and he is building his way mayor ... he's going to have a second term as president\nAnd I wish they knew by the way thank you for attending the you know aggression and it was cold out and I would have thrown a Trump pet to what's the big deal\nAnd when you look at some of the even the Democratic mirror up here ... we had was that was down there he was down there on the same time so there were a lot of people\nAs Americans coming together for a celebration a transition of power and yet in Washington DC first time they are you selling way my God and there was an area anything if Hillary had one I Would expect if you're the governor that you would have gone as well after I could receive\nAn obligation respect for honey events do you have to go to maybe not thrilled about it but you got to go and you're polite and you just make an appearance you do what you have to do and then you go but it's a lot of the\nJob it's part of the job they do it and that's how I act as governor the tree people were ... or you might not agree with them but the bottom line is you're they're representing you represent you know I've done that for nine and a half years and create fake time I'm going to do that during my eight years at it as\nAn outright island the folks he is ... you were peaking at the right time us pulled the curtain down actually ... did it for you with the hair I just want to present to be Bobby only two percent so I could help Gita when\nYou were peaking at the right time people are seeing through the secret deal that is they're all the momentum is going your way and not again to put extra pressure but you are our last hope as I tell people if Gina Raimondo is given four more years\nAs governor number one you didn't get a fear because she's going to New Hampshire in February to start her bid to try to run for president that's what she's going to do she's going to be absent from the state but and we will recognize the state of Rhode Island if she's given four more years she had already bought online you she has\nThe wave is happening at the right time and the phone momentum is building all across Rhode Island feel good\nYou have the right team in place I Am a huge fan of be a your going to take it right across the finish line and I'm going to crown plaza to celebrate with you on November\nSex you and your family or walking back and forth to celebrate and with you and all of Rhode Island this date back on November sex from

thirty nine months with Nineteen eighty\nSelection that service and the lowest like only at\nFolks I'm telling you you can feel the momentum it's an exciting time I mean that if someone if you want to waste your vote I Can't stop people from waste and they'll vote if you want to help Gina Raimondo get four more years than you do that but not me I don't believe in wasting my vote\n\nThere is no way I'm going to vote waste by boat and give her ... four more years started happening right people on Facebook Live agree with me that's exactly right vote fun vote fun\nI'm Frank Ritchie turn up the space but my that's my fault they should have had the special Mike out a that is exactly right All right well we'll turn it up sorry about that guys are on Facebook everyone could hear him clearly on the radio but I Am telling you and this new commercial it exposes exactly what it is [noise]\nWhite House officials were unable to provide an explanation for the president's threats which reflected both his apparent frustration with the Caribbean and its determination to transform into Republican election gains down taking us out of the Providence Journal but I just had a bit of Washington Post story\nWhy are they passing through all of these countries\nIf you and I are in a dangerous situation we're trying to run out of it you just run into the first I think it's like when it's pouring rain out right if it's pouring rain out that you like you're walking along and suddenly\nYou the ... the skies are just opening up and you're just going to run in somewhere so you don't get absolutely soaked or\nYou see on the footage of September eleventh\nWhen the buildings were collapsing and the people just were running a diving to get in some way those are people trying to escape a dangerous situation these people are just marching along gets a parade on their merry way and in that are gang members cartel members terrorists\nMembers of ISIS people that want to do us harm there are murderers there are criminals\nThere are illegal so we've already deported that then jumping in on the bandwagon marching along\nJust like in um the movie the fugitive right when Harrison Ford is running away from Tommy Lee Jones what does he do it just jumps and hides under the parade that's what they're doing\nPresident Trump tweeted sadly it looks like Mexico's police and military owner able to stop the caravan heading to the southern border of the United states he had it without evidence that criminals and unknown Middle East there's a mixed in\nI've alerted border patrol and military this is a national emergency we must change the laws folks they are totally manipulating and taking advantage and I say no way Guatemala hold up ...\nHonduras El Salvador\nWhy are these people coming here why do they think they just get to come in why is this happening then we have have you heard the story about ... does husband by the way\nThey see the first gentleman or\nIs his first term really maybe you should be referred to as the first murderer [laughter]\nRomano's husband concerned about the Saudi report have you heard about this\nThrough spokesman governor I'm under and her husband Andy ... the first gentleman voice their concerns about a news report his employer isn't the Providence Journal McKinsey and company produced or report identifying critics of Saudi Arabia policies on Twitter\nWho went to a reporter cases were later arrested or had their account shut down or in this case possibly murdered\nIn response initial question is about the news report in the New York times Raimondo spokesman Michael ...\nAt first said questions about McKinsey a better directed to McKinsey even walk it back well like everyone the governor in the first gentleman are concerned by the news McKinsey global from thousands employees response to the New York times\nMcKinsey issued its own statement over the weekend said it was horrified a report that are prepared to measure public perception of Saudi Arabia policies may have been used by the kingdom of Saudi Arabia to silence dissidents so governor among does husband\nWorking hand in hand\nWith Saudi Arabia to find out who journalists that are criticizing the policies now as you know a very high profile one was murdered\nAnd Andy Moffett governor among those husband works hand in hand with the Saudi Arabian government to identify those of speaking out in just sent\nThe report came to light at a time Saudi Arabia is facing intense intern international criticism connected to the killing a contributing writer for the Washington Post\nInside the Saudi conflict and then stop all\nWhere he'd gone to obtain a document and he needed to marry as Turkish fiance or they didn't set another guy out there wearing as close to try to throw people off but you can tell it's not the reporter Moffett it worked for McKinsey and company for more than Eighteen years this current title\nSenior solutions leader McKinsey academy McKinsey and company according to his linked in page\nSo the first gentleman just to break this down the new\nGovernor among those husband now they they have two different names right big progressive he's Andy Moffett she's Gina Raimondo they get married she keeps her maiden name so they're like one of those people she's not Gina mop that\nShe's Gina Raimondo he's Andy Moffett I don't know what the kids last names are\nBut he works for this company McKinsey now McKinsey was hired by the Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabian government\n[noise] to find out to measure public perception\nAnd now they're saying that they were working in tandem so they're hired you know measure public perception see who's been speaking out against us\nSo Andy Moffitt and McKinsey and his company the first gentleman governor bundles husband they prepared this report well bits unfortunately was like a death report for the poor guy and the journalists there\nBecause in Saudi Arabia wanted to know who is speaking out against them I mean this is absolutely horrific and they can try to run from it but he's involved with that from identifying outspoken individuals\nAnd now you have this journalists who was murdered ... missing him was murdered but he did that he did that\nThe first gentleman seven six six Thirteen eighty but just to be very clear there's no way I Want the Caribbean coming into this country no way good afternoon Europe on the John ... show hello\nJohn ... air I Am good afternoon Frank\nI just want to make two points to one of offers second wave of journalists first part of that character\nOne of off the ... second wave of a journalist first about the caravan where a lot of people are realizing it reminds me of that line from the forest Gump most illegals then all of a sudden people just decided to walk and that's obviously orchestrated by Charles and company\nBut the real thing that gets me about that is what people don't realize\nWhat was going on or stop making\nA deliberate loophole for the cartel smuggled logs and human trafficking and everything else so while the Dems are like oh let's see if she rented or anything of this a smokescreen for the cartels to do their business\nA trial that first people\nDon't realize that that's that's the danger Libyan what and then the second thing now all we get some a lot of us but you know journalists you know everybody is sorting out terribly this gray and they killed him\nA lot of people don't know if the guy was a journalist who was an arms deal or no pictures of him holding a rocket grenade launcher here was ... to this guy I don't know if you have Jewish citizenship on earth as he is not as pure as the driven snow so all getting the less the Democrats\nAre by hold on let's not take ... does has been off the hook here Frank he could have blood on his dad's how pointing this guy out\nI mean romano's husband prepares report that this guy's been critical of Saudi Arabian government the kingdom as they called and then suddenly he's murdered so that's that tiny Andy ... he's the first gentleman\nAnd maybe the first pitch maybe I mean think of that think of this regime and they hire any Martha ... whose husband prepare apart but who's been critical about us he prepares the report gives a woman and suddenly this guy is murdered\nI mean the guy we don't leave them right ... ... that's another thing I don't think the people in the state realized that he has one of the biggest marijuana grow facilities are ... are you\nGoing to you know hold on hold on let me ask this question how do you know that\nMore than more than ... showing me where I can read that nope not be careful here because I like you and I respect you when you show me where I can read that that\nAnd I'll tell you why because that is a rumor\nAnd I as you know I Am no fan of Romano why that is a rumor that's been going on for over two years first it was on jumpers in boulevard then somebody had it in ... I heard this rumor\nBut again I'm not trying to put you on the spot but are you sure you rented somewhere or\nAnd I don't mean somebody posted on Facebook or you've just heard that rumor\nI'm my name's Frank and I'm going to be Frank with you I Know someone that has a medical marijuana card and when they go to\nThat that's not what I mean come on ... you said you rented somewhere now that would mean it's gotta be some credible news source that is done it not somebody with a medical marijuana card or somewhere growers something like that\nSo I'm I'm just I again I give people a lot of leeway but I heard that rumor and I haven't heard one I haven't seen one credible source that can prove that it's true that is on I think", "city": "Woonsocket"}
