that\nIt may a press conference in New York again the latest so the suspicious packages delivered and no one harm vary from one of them I just saw a report very feet thick very ...\nThey saw a report very basic very they're saying or nothing extraordinary about these packages\nBut I'm now they're checking to see if there's any other city so suspicious packages containing possible devices that were disrupted in any type of or anywhere else whether it be Congress or anything else\nLaw enforcement sources say US Capitol police investigating one package containing possible device and deceptive congressional male sorting world in ... in Maryland\nSo we don't know\n[noise] uh it was interesting to hear\nThat a immediately New York city mayor de Blasio said um you know that that listen they're trying to basically say that this is happening because of President Trump that that's that that's what it is I mean there's no other way to\nGo through any of this I don't know we don't know who's behind it what I Want you to know right now on this um it's one oh nine on this Wednesday is they a big part of this story was watching the evacuation of CNN\nAnd the devices that they are saying a device was said to Cuomo's office first she said they was and now they're saying it was so now they're saying he also was targeted\nHis office initially more than an hour ago said they were not now they are so I'm saying to Blasio slamming Trump without naming and blaming the president for an atmosphere of hatred\nAnd then we start to wonder about it and say could be true where I really learned and again\nWhat I meant to say is I I Am not ruling anything out I mean I I don't know\nIf that is in fact whoever's behind this needs to be held responsible that much we know and I hope that there is um [noise]\nYou know every time you try to pull off a crime of this nature this fifty ways you can screw it up if you're going to think of twenty five you're a genius so that's a great line other movie body heat with Mickey Rourke\n[noise] but this number of envelopes the FBI either so sophisticated they may have someone or they may get who's responsible I don't know we don't know uh but they're certainly going to try to find out with this many envelopes it would lead you to believe that maybe they could in fact um\nBe able to track down who's responsible I don't know but what I meant to say was years ago it was Twenty years ago\nAnd people used to call and say about Waco and you know Janet Reno and they denied everything and then when they had the investigation into Waco what happened with Waco and David crash it turned out that many of the people that were screaming up and down about it they proved to be right\nSo now I Do withhold judgment I don't know there are a lot of whack\nIndividuals on the left there's a lot of liberal crazy progress is that you see attack people and if someone ... it it does seem a little suspicious right out of the box de Blasio\nSays that he blames Trump for this\nSomehow responsible that Cuomo does it ever talking points right first he says he didn't get a package and he's like oh wait I did get a package so I I don't know what to make of that alright seven six six Thirteen eight what I Want to tell you is I Will not shut off the discussion\nWhat the good news is that no one has been harmed they are investigating and this is without

like Obama and Clinton ask or anything like that\nWith the number one the other thing is an insult and number two the Trump be a thing as a real insult what does that mean\nStarted yelling I Am not yelling in any way so you can disagree but you don't have to insult we did that come from oh he's Trump being by the way a Sheldon Whitehouse as I mentioned totally called out or by and I'll give\nIt credit my sister ... lively experiment on lively experiment to show that humble host\nMy sister ... who is filled in for me here called out Sheldon Whitehouse with this fake ad you've seen the TV ad\nWhere he scares senior citizens and says the Trump Administration wants to take away your Medicaid and they want to take away your social Social Security so my sister went on lively experiment and said I think it's appalling\nAnd Maureen ... who ... political science professor at you are I said oh that's just politics in her world Sheldon can do no wrong in her world governor among do can do no no Ron\nMaureen vocally a liberal progressive in her rural ... did no wrong\nEverything thing Trump does this negative so my sister said well he's a sitting US Senator he's lying to people and more and more because it that's politics that's just the ads will the Washington Post said is a complete fabricated lie that's what they do they lie\nThey absolutely lie and it's inexcusable there was no reason for that to run and I'm Glad that the Flanders camp\nHas in fact I'm called called them out on it and he should be called out on it for crying out loud because of the whole thing\nSo I mean but to me Senator Whitehouse is the type Bob plan to send out a press release Senator Whitehouse ads fact checked by the Washington Post\nThe post ... usual scare tactics actually unusual scare tactics Riddick no evidence to support his campaign Republicans want to eliminate these programs Medicare Medicaid Social security\nComplete lie and then he even said at the debate Saturday Night ... Saturday no you're right\nThere was a protest on television stop lying about it\nAnd then the Washington Post came out for putting Okemos which means it's a complete lie like a liar liar pants on fire type a moment blatantly false attacks\nBut the real a method behind this to me is just the fact that\nSheldon he he is he's insulted that he has to go through this campaign he is he doesn't like that\nA new image shows device shown to CNN that's going to carry it we're going to wait and see will they be able to conclude and arrest someone between now and election day\nI I don't know the FBI doesn't work at a very fast paced we don't know how sophisticated it is we don't know is this the deep state planting something like that\nTo try to make it look bad for the Trump Administration we don't know\nBut it is incredible in record time now Democrats immediately are blaming President Trump\nFor these actions and without one shred of evidence or without knowing anything about who possibly could be behind these packages that have been sent out folks seven six six Thirteen eighty you know the big story again no one it's been harmed\nYou're going to hear more about it and the two o'clock news but these packages had been sent out\nIn one was sent to the home of the Clintons in ... one was sent to the Obama residents where they now live in Washington DC and then the thing that got the most news was one was sent apparently to Time Warner\nCNN and as a result of that\nThey had to um\nEmpty out CNN and so they are broadcasting from the street and that obviously has become a huge huge story so the New York times is reporting that this so called pipe bomb was likely hand delivered to George Soros home we don't know\nSo ah but let's let's wait and see how this comes out but that of course envelopes of white powder found a package potential explosive but CNN New York offices\nLet's have Governor Cuomo let's have political differences with civility\nYou know they're doing everything they can to try to point this right in direction of President Trump and we don't know anything about who is responsible [noise] now I Do know folks who is responsible good afternoon is John
