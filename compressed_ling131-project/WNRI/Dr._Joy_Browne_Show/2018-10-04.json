Amri ad is assaulting ... upon the schools about the police one thing after another Cranston depressed city she knows who were ...\nIt's one thing after another Cranston depressed city she knows who her opponent is and I I'm also Mike I I got to tell you I I was\nVery disappointed with the media yesterday of like let's put this in perspective Trump has seven percent of the boat this earth and he was going to make the landscape and announcing it was going to change the landscape I had to say I'm speaking last night with someone who I Do respect\nAnd does annoy about politics and\nThey said you know well I I hear he's bringing Trump in print endorsement and Mike I said\nPresident Trump between Kavanaugh the midterms with other states between the Russian investigation the President Trump is going to come in here for a guy that left\nThe party and it's seven percent of the boat that his lawyer Chris like them never happening yeah never happening I was in the west\nWing a month ago I Am telling you I said the name Joe ... they had no idea what I was talking about of course of\nCourse three names they knew they asked me my bomb they ask you about landers and they had a lot of questions about Charlie Baker those were the three names they asked me about\nI said what are you guys anything on the ... they had no idea when I mentioned Joe ... but there are men are actually bind it's like ... what was going to announce President Trump is coming into endorsed me at the Dunkin' Donuts than I mean it's ...\nWell this this is the ... the the little boy who cried out the sky is falling or did you get one shot at this so you know whatever whatever legitimacy Joe had it's gone now president going to bite on this the second time\nYou know our late in the game it's October it is that thirty thirty days left yeah so I I'm Glad you know and there's going to be a series of announcements you know I I don't care a gang carnage door says I'm now ... where it shot yellow it's done now what about you get to the Republicans and the Democrats and let's have this contest\nAnd ... all the money she wants it's the same old same old yeah well and has to do was done whatever money has got to remind the people that she lost hundreds of millions of dollars out of the ... that's ...\n... to me there should be no discussion it never mind that you have which affected thousands of people negatively and they were the people that were them in the most me the people that\nYou don't have to families with children ... and ... staff money and and support and that whole mess was just handled without any leadership and without any like care it was just nothing for the people\nIn my journal politics do you think is there a way that this could backfire that people would say that now this is real sour grapes with Morgan ...\nWell it it it resonated with me and I am a postal stuff on line and say this is just bad it is it's\nBad it's bad bad politics and I cannot understand the motivation of either of these to find people I mean I like them both yeah like I Know for a long time I don't know where you get off just saying the hell with the party that I really loyal to forever what is the party do to them\nExcept support them I don't I I just you know\n... people laughing and might limit let's also pokes again with speak with a Mike here when I talked to him Dodd coming up and just a couple of minutes who am I what some people don't realize Mike is the former head of the Republican Party in Rhode Island and some people do know that\nHe knows politics inside and out and Mike I again I'd known Joe we both know him and Patricia so I you know I I don't\nI feel uncomfortable even discussing them in a negative light to be honest she probably just like you but let's let's just be honest and look at the numbers\n... if you're running a race it is October ... tripled where he is in the polls right now tripled he would be a Twenty one percent yes if he tripled his numbers if the triple digit numbers he'd be Twenty one percent\nI mean this is ... ... but the media when foreign hook line and sinker with the big thing it's be it pd bond that would be very proud of Joe ... right\nNow it's ... it was a slow news day yesterday but I mean that's what I was oh my God\nBut then he said hey there all day and what they think president and I found it somewhere in the first of all he's he's not dropping out of the race and also you know I I also have this business out of the team building Patricia Morgan roll this out during the primary\nAnd that was Arlene's going to be an inspector general and robot ties gonna come in and can blocks going to work with them and now now all three of them apparently committed\nTo Joe ... that they're going to work in his administration they there isn't going to be a trailer with ministry should is going to be your mom do administrator knows what it's going to be\nYeah I I you know that they that say saying that uh Arlene has gone um inspector general which doesn't exist um you know like like you can stop the fingers or that can block or ... or ... or John ... rubber tires moved out of state\nI'm In the valley Carolina\nAre I mean I mean it's nothing it's nothing short it's not nothing more than ... saying these people endorsement yeah say they're going to do a certain job is you know just to ... frankly that just embarrassing I'm\nActually in a lot of elected first I Know I'm actually surprised that they would eat even agree to have the name attached to something like that I I yeah I mean we both know Arlene a long time I don't want to put your not uncomfortable situation here but I I was actually their\nTheir friends I I don't know that she had given her permission and certainly\n... do\nYou well you know certainly she was titled just say should accept a job and if you're a tremendous ration but doing so with somebody who is calling at seven percent just to me it was like oh come on late night lightning strike ten times in a row in the same spot for Joe to even get over ten percent of the vote\nWell Mike I Want to here I'm going to happen I\nWant to share something with you I I'm I'm actually very proud because early this morning I did speak with someone and they were asking me and I I just said I'll tell you exactly what it's going to be I said coming up at twelve noon\nShrill oh it's going to announce that Patricia Morgan is endorsing him and she's going to be part of the campaign and they're going to have this team building thing with these other three people and I said that at nine thirty this morning\nAnd this person that I started to who you would know just to me if you said you were exactly right on the money ... this but I might yesterday it was one of the most uncomfortable days because people who I Know and respect\nWere calling me saying you know it is it true that Trump is coming into the dumped to hold a rally patrol oh someone else said he's leaving the race I said he's not leaving the race someone else said you know do you think Bella chicken breeding you're going to come in and indoor [laughter]\nWhat are we ... I think they saw how how is this going to go to the people maybe the pope's gonna fly it like you we losing your mind you know like I guess Reagan could come back from the dead in the door some like what are you talking about\nRepeat after me he's seven percent of the boat with an office across from the old Rhode Island more it's Patricia more again that's all it is and they're working to defeat\nAlan ... that's what it is let's call it where it is\nI I Would look at it differently they're they're working to re elect Gina Raimondo you're right that that's the net effect you're right because what would that seven percent and let's let's\nI bet that's the net effect you're right because what would that seven percent and let's just let's let's be honest the only seven percent that would vote for Joe ... would be pretty solid hardcore Republican conservative types that would be hit\nThose votes are not coming out and Gina's pocket they're coming out of Alan's pocket and you're right so so you are the facto working for and less and less you can argue that you can get anywhere close to ... percent and a three way race\nA with a plus or minus factor of five and any kind of poll anywhere you're ... you're you're simply\nRight now you are working to re elect Gina Raimondo and if you can look the public on the face and say that's a good thing and that's what you're doing if that's your if that's your purpose great 'cause you're really trying to tell me that you're you're you're\nCampaigning on the ideals of the Republican Party and fiscal conservatism then great um but you know and I and you know you're just being disingenuous began 'til you can't get there at some point you throw the towel and and that\nI got my ... another agenda\nWell may agenda is it the agenda clearly isn't to help Allen phone now it's clearly not gonna help it's ... it is clearly going to help or among do what is the other agenda I mean you know people speculate about all kinds of things right position in the administration oh but\nYeah I get told you he Seventy five years old yeah trial the Seventy\nFive years old he has he has a lot of money Joe is done very well for himself he's got a two million dollars a yacht he's got a condo in Florida he's got a beautiful home someone said to me do you think ... is doing this because he wants to run the DMV for fun I said you're not paying attention to what I'm telling you\nIs it would seem now that in a very smooth manner\nRachel Mitchell knew exactly what she was doing and\nHad that letter from the ex boyfriend from the FBI who had submitted to the FBI by the way when her name's surfaced in ... when she was asking her about that polygraph tests and on top of that Rachel Mitchell did some research for the G O P Tim said\nThat any skilled polygraph person that does that type of test would never conducted when someone is in the grieving process and Dr Ford by her own words said that she uh took the test after she had just attended her grandmother's funeral\n[noise] yes and you know at this point that I'm Rachel Mitchell had to have had insider information about the polygraph I'm a story from the the a boyfriend\nSo I think that that's a question that a doctor for they could not a ... for that I'm sure her attorneys never considered it it's kinda like Bill Clinton when he was going to sandbag with Monica Lewinsky stuff I'm sure that Dr\nFord baritone or council that she had toned up someone years ago\nYeah to beat a polygraph test\nMaybe should remember but that's exactly right and for those that don't forget that Bill Clinton when he went to the polling Jones depositions attorney Bennett\nSuddenly or the Ken Starr people know the excuse to pull a Jones attorney started seeing him a hasn't been alone with an intern ... anything of that nature and\nBill Bennett had no idea if they were talking about Bill Clinton knew exactly what they were talking about when you watch that exchange Ford puts a head down\nShe starts to go into the different kind of high pitched voice and I was watching last time the Ingram angle there was a body language expert that these anytime and saying\nYou know that's usually someone looking down or going into the little girl's voice is almost a form this again this was the body language expert saying it's it's someone that they go into a little girl voice homeless because then their line so they're trying to seem like I don't know and that that type of thing but that was very skilled by Rachel Mitchell\nYes she did a good job but it is and I we talked about last week I thought she had done a good job when the rest of the experts were saying that she was blowing around [noise]\nYou know she she called out the information at a very respectful way about the flying at about the vacations at about um the other things that she did get she was able to\nPick off all of the central inconsistencies at a very respectful way without the media being able to say that she was you know attacking her hostile disrespectful she did it the right way um\nIt's it's interesting that every whisper and then your window no matter how wrong there's a screaming headlines of the New York times but I don't think the times even reported on both the ex boyfriend and the polygraph Fisher you didn't see that on the front page\nYou know I did not around I didn't see that [laughter]\nI'll do it in the I don't know if you saw in again post good afternoon boy that third accuser now I don't know I was tweeting this out and do put her down on Facebook by the FBI also did receive a very credible sworn statement\nFrom a former boyfriend um that Julie sweat Nick ... who did that I I've never seen it it'd be like that before on the Internet on MSNBC even though the snow is a reporter for NBC News if this was he a truly credible interviewed him it would have been in either ...\nIf this was a a truly credible interviewed him and would have been in either the today show or NBC nightly news with lots of home or if it was really blockbuster they would've beard at nine o'clock and Rachel Maddow our eight eight o'clock on not all in with Chris Hayes instead a year to seven o'clock\nAnd they kept saying almost every two minutes we have been unable to verify anything that this woman is saying but this man step forward and said he dated her and she said\nYou know I Hope in our relationship this isn't a problem but I actually really a choice I'm not laughing but joy sex with multiple men and this was the woman that talked about these parties\nThese gang rape drug fueled parties in Washington I'm which Michael ... her attorney who represents ... Daniel Tim ... unable to find one person to back up that women story\nI I I mean I thought of a sweat and that was just laugh a boy and one of them not credible but I was more taken aback by Kate Snow who I Am not that familiar with a sweat mixed telling stories and getting our facts wrong or Kate Snow or chopping to say well don't you really mean ...\nTo correct her say what are you doing I mean are you an advocate enter an excellent point even the simple fact of the first question when you decided to come forward and Julie sweating said well six weeks ago when when Dr Ford\nF ... and then she said well actually that and I know that was September fifteenth and the Washington Post and the taping that September thirtieth\nSo that was really two weeks ago that that was that that interview never should have taken place you know what I wanted to actually go ahead actually\nDoes if if the lest anyone doubt what's going on that interview really showed I mean ... cave snows trying to coach this person be interviewed to get her ...\nIs yes it was astonishing and that was an edited interview by the way I'd love to see the raw footage of exactly what we think of this brought footage which NBC\nDid not MSNBC NBC did not feel comfortable airing I'm In an even though they kept running that we've been unable to corroborate any this many times him in court\nYou or your in court and people will hear the term the judge will it allows something had been admissible because something is here say and I think this is a good example to point that out you have these people coming forward now you have the accusation\nThat happened to Gail and I'm Talking about the second accused of not the throwing up the ice with ... ... and the\nGenerals in the face okay so there is supposedly these twenty people\nAnd they're demanding the FBI talk to them\nAnd they don't see they were the party they don't say they knew anything about this happening at the party they're demanding the FBI talk to them because they claim they knew this second accuser and they knew Brett Kavanaugh Gail\nNow you tell me but the FBI ... they're not\nInterested in people who well yeah I knew Brett Kavanaugh to class with them the question is where you were you not at that party\nYes there were the FBI assignment was to see if there was credible corroborating evidence regarding even known incidences that have complained of and that's what they did\nThis would have been talking to all those people would have been a potentially a wild goose chase and it's a story that you don't know and I don't know the five extra people the Facebook drove by to ban all those folks might about amongst the extra five that they did reach out to me that's right oh yeah\nAnd also Tim this business of you know her doctor for words quote beach friends a Dr Ford was upset that the FBI didn't come to talk to her even though she testified they even said you're a doctor board is there anything else you want to tell us about this anything out the Democrats they all chose to\nUse their time to\nPortray her as a hero she had an opening statement I'm Yvonne the FBI I she basically told is everything as you said why I don't know why we let her correct or back filler story but um but just coming back to this whole thing the FBI ... they were to investigate that\nThe beach friends for these quote beach friends in California to step forward saying oh yeah I remember we were sitting in the sand and uh she blurted out the judge a brick cabin or had sexually assaulted her Tim in court we wouldn't that be considered here say\n[noise] if if the trend a came into court and said I was present when Dr Snow said I Want to start to shore up I'm Sorry I misspoke um that would be admissible\nIf somebody said my friend told me that Dr Ford said acts that with ... because that's your say okay so if somebody came in and said yes I heard it she said it to me that would be a vegetable\nOkay in this old also the business of do you feel based on what you've heard\nThat the FBI they they know who they're looking to talk to this was not\nYou know there were people that are seeing I saw him I like this quote I saw Brett Kavanaugh one time drunk at Yale any look so drunk he looked like he may pass out where he looked like he might fall over and and the FBI isn't even reached out to me Tim did this was not\nAllegations were there the FBI supposed to be investigating Brett Kavanaugh got drunk when he was a college student at Yale this was supposed to be and started with Dr Ford emerged into the second accusation regarding this woman Gail that says that she was admittedly drunk\nShe even was saying she wasn't initially positive news even him does anyone remember this I don't remember I was foggy I was drunk and done it I Know this other stuff and then it emerged in this ... third accuser to to me had does have zero credibility this is not about throwing ice cubes this is not about\nIf he drank a gale this whole focus was supposed to be centered around the doctor for an allegation\nYes yes\nAny credible known credible allegations are let's say a sweat Nick was not credible and I think the ... and the face and so that was\nIs brought to buy pleasant view orchards one forty one pleasant view avenue in Springfield it's Tony good afternoon Tony you can call them two three one
