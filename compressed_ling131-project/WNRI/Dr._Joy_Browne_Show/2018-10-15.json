I think you put out some very good posts on not Twitter and on your Twitter feed in obviously it wasn't lost on me yesterday\nThe news that came out last week about Joe ... that was broken on Wednesday he then did a series of interviews where he seemed to have a very good recollection very thing that happened he\nCame up with this story that he was almost ... you know trying to portray himself as a hero there was this eleven year old girl and she was in distress and blah blah blah and and that are these kids their parents run home and and he's making the rounds in trying to say you know what happened and I was when you my arms well\nThe police report comes out on friday and it is completely contradicts what ... said in fact ... been close the wasn't\nSwinging his arms he actually was in fact um had a a ... gun in his hand he struck one of the teenagers they who I the fact that he happened to be the speaker I think is irrelevant but when the police arrived Matty yellows father in ... a heated argument industry\nArrived Matty Alou his father in troll over in a heated argument in the street and the other kids that they are and they started giving statements in it and then portrays the story by the way there's no mention in any way\nOf an eleven year old girl or anything like that wasn't swinging hands it was a ... gun did he apparently hit Matty yellow three times in the head he then as the kids are making statements and these are twelve and Thirteen year old kid saying you know this is the guy that\nAh he feels they play football they make noise um that they say that sometimes even threatens to run them over the he even use language or using the N. word and other F bombs at them and I'm\nCompletely completely different story than what he had told and he ... even said that he had pled no contest and that wasn't it but then on friday afternoon when the journal Kathy Greg talked to him and asked me getting out of the race he then are updated and said I don't care if I get\nTo present as long as I prevent Allen bond from being the next governor and when you say something like that it's very obvious that that would mean the Gina Raimondo would get reelected and yet you have\nPatricia Morgan that has some kind of a packed obviously she endorsed him but this pact with ... with the trying to continue to go down this\nI I ... I don't know I'm trying to be kind delusional rude like Baghdad Bob that tend to split screen where he's saying you know the Iraqi forces are in control is then the split screen you know the American forces come into the city of\nOr even an F maybe as they there is some of that on the other side there are some extreme liberal progressive left his socialist almost who are part of the Bernie Sanders movement that\nThat are still you know I'm I'm not saying I'm not voting for an election day I'm not going to vote for her but this this they're not as loud and getting as much support and attention I should say from the media is that the pillow situation\nBut just that also what do you make of some of the comments and again if I Do watch it it was widely experiment I thought the panel was very very tilted\nThey'd Scott McKay from Rhode Island public radio Republican or whatever they call themselves who's very he was the last defender of KP very openly liberal and progressive and Democrat you'd former Democrat Bob weak and and then you'd Wendy Schiller at Brown university that to me just seems clearly in the tank of of June Armando\nBut it was being depicted as well do you go ... rolling around in the mud withdrawal oh I I don't know what mayor punk can do when you have a guy who's out there\nAnd from day one I mean he is attacking fun\nThere's no rational reason why he would be against him I mean I have known both of them\nFor very long time and I I remember meeting Allen fun when he was forced to counseling and Cranston in ... he was the mayor was the first time I met him um I've known pillow since he entered the general assembly even before then\nThere's no rational reason here they they just isn't and if anybody really decked sex and what little tries to say or even Patricia Morgan just in that I I don't know how else to I just think he kind of\nYou know we they call a political gap in Washington is when a politician accidently tells the truth and I think that's what happened on friday he basically let the cat out of the bag which is\nI Am not running to win I Am running to help Gina Raimondo get reelected to prevent them from winning you you can't say you're running to prevent fun from winning and then say has Patricia Morgan was trying to say but we're not\nWe're not trying to you know we don't want you to remind do to win I mean one of those two people are going to win it's either going to be wrong or it's gonna be\nIt's gonna be Raimondo right so I mean you go to a wedding and they say you know would you like salmon or would you like chicken ...\nIt it's one of the other to to try to pull it off that well you know it's not that we want Raimondo to when we really just don't want ... when I mean no matter how they try to thread that that's that's the reality that we're dealing with right now just than\nIt is I Do want to go back to a moment ago but you were talking about um\n[noise] don't forget I mean is this idea of reminder of the Republican drawing around in the mud and remodel as soon as the first thing she did after the primary was put out an attack ad against a phone and she was one of the reasons she has trouble actually and the latest in a WPRI fall right after the primary lost ground with Democrats\nIs because she went so negative in her primary that's right so it's not as if there's no contact her she's just rising above everything just hasn't been dragged into the mud yet um but I think that the I Do kind of see a distinction between opposing song and supporting reminded but I think to me that's\nOne of the intriguing open questions here and we still don't really know what is it show has against Alan on or\nWhat do they expect to get out of helping to spoil the race and yeah\nWhat are they expecting to get out of helping to spoil the race and yet or if they monitor that's going to be the open question or speculation now and that's that's the main distinction it's not much of it either either you're on a taker you're petty but I think that there is some distinction to be made there that's going to at least be\nSome food for rumor and fire until somebody finds something out and uh probably only a fair amount of wins or we won't get much of an answer\nAnd it's very recent by the way because I find four years ago Joe hello fully supported fun\nAnd uh you know donated to them and so forth and all that stuff about the police department ticket gate and all that other stuff that that was certainly you know floating around so it is very recent I I just don't think\nIt's anything that has rational it's anything legitimate there isn't anything\nThat they did there was definitely you know there there was bad blood between Gina Raimondo when governor ... and even during the transition period\nWhen the fact you know I remember you know a Raimondo went to visit with him he didn't even offer a drink you water ski jacket of the inauguration he had really nothing positive to say about him um and then we you know later learned where when those um records came out\nWith thirty eight studios that there was that incident that Raimondo\nAccidently dialed cheat the as she was meeting with someone from DC and he sat\nGp sat and listen for twenty minutes as Raimondo was making fun of ... with some person from me D. C. and and then keep stokes even send this testimony that for two weeks he had to deal with the ... on that because\n... was still a lot of his mind so that was when we really learned afterwards or that that was bad blood because shape you heard of ... are reportedly according to keep stokes\nOn this conversation that ... and this other person they will make mocking him and he's an idiot and all this other stuff and and she ... she accidently dialed them she or maybe she called them and thought she'd hung up or phone but anyway he sat there for twenty minutes and listen to her and someone from ... see a mocking him in mocking making fun of them and then\nThat made sense as to why he you know micro so much but um but this one I I just I I don't\nSee what it is and when there's such an anti Raimondo feeling out there why trailer with just grab on to this whole thing of you know he he's really become anybody but bomb I mean I I think he's may know pretense let me ask you adjusting with three weeks ago\nAnd now the race does seem to slim down to ... which is why she was afraid of in the first place [noise] what do you think the phone people have to do in these last few weeks and I think people should realize that many times\nAs much as we follow it there's a lot of people that don't follow it a lot of elections are literally one on the last weekend the election you go back to two thousand was when you know the Gore people broke that George W. Bush had gotten a DUI in Nineteen Seventy six that broke and\nThat ... throughout the vote a little bit the final weekend\nOf twenty sixteen but when the Trump people realize\nThat they needed to double down in Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin ... and um Minnesota and they suddenly the last couple of days uprooted and just started bonds showing that like crazy realizing that they could\nStimulate the boat so I I think this vote in this election literally could come down to the last weekend and then there is the gentle tend to beat the Thursday night before but what do you think the ... people need to do\nTo close the margin because I still think this is more of a five to six point race with ... ... not really going below five percent\nBut I think they the phone came just they've mainly the first thing they have to do is\nPresent him as as an alternative for people who are unhappy with the way things are dying in Rhode Island [noise] a a little bit too much negativity and you can spoil out but you have to point out you know when when the governor picks a\n... out of out of all of these statistics you could pick your economy she's very very careful about what she picks that show actual unproven because it's not in the apartment just hasn't been there so\nSome of that can come out but I think he has to be a credible reasonable alternative um is going to have to try to find some way to draw back into the frustrated and now kind of a an R. Rated and and\nFeeling some element of here we go again with a third or anything although as conservatives and Republicans are going to have to find somebody to get them energized\nA I think that's going to be the easiest stay focused and and on being positive as an alternative I think one thing he's probably starting to do and I suspect we'll see tonight because they just announced the\nThe police union from crashing endorsed uh um so I I think it ... should make some\nAttempt to to win over the union vote\nA whereas whereas available are they the national Education Association of Rhode Island\nOr said he reluctantly I've now endorsed Jerry mine do and and you can guarantee that a lot of\nTheir members are are not terribly happy about that so he doesn't need a whole lot of that support to to erode her or base or people who are just even if they just stay at home instead of voting as they were all develop either unions are I think that that's all they really can do unless there's some\nSome surprise out there I think this week\nThis past week we saw um avoid or get out of the fire with ... I think that's probably generally resolved at this point and more of an annoyance that are real threat and if he if he's got something in store regarding the the police report\nOr an endorsement of the labor union there that would get them over that I'm a I'm I'd be surprised if reminded us and have it all the money and research for research she as she doesn't have some other stuff is going to try that some flashes going to try to shoot into the air um but I think it from here on it and it's you know campaigning\nPositively and and just giving people the all the opportunity for an alternative\nI agree with you and I think also if the ... circus kind of really starts just become noise in the background he's almost turning into like a crush young\nA voted for southern White House over like in ... partly because I didn't like safety but also because I ... if you look at White House you know if there's ever going to reclaim that seat for somebody other than a Democrat he's the guy you want to have to go against because he just I mean these debates e books ... ... words\nUm at one point he he was trying to talk about how much how many people of legislation is passed in the past thirty date and had to pull a cart out of his pocket to to find out it was ten\nI mean and he put a cough drop and it made a speech impediment worse I mean he's a terrible candidate and than it is doing there very well or as an opponent I just wanted I\nJust tend to doubt that these debates have much much for each\nAnd I think a lot of people are just going to be with US Senate they almost don't even know if they're voting for White House or jak greed just okay are are they coming guys I guess they're okay so it's going to be a question of whether of lenders can in three weeks\nClosed the gap that we've seen in recent polls and it's doable but he's got to find ways to reach people and I I don't know if he's doing that I I Know I've seen a lot of the signs around so clearly here as people are going out\nAnd and looking to talk to people in the in the neighborhoods and got signed going so I think it can make the case studies hit an acceptable alternative and I haven't seen White House has actually been surprised at\nHow kind of passive White House is very much\nI'm so especially versus the\n... it's almost like a skittish having having really burned a lot of his political capital with years of being the fire left by a breather with the you know a calling tea parties KKK members and and that kind of thing I oh yeah he's skittish to be aggressive or so that there is an opportunity here it's just a matter of whether Flanders can\nCan get that where it out and get people to reconsider the sort of checking off the income and box as they would be if it's related to do\n[noise] I agree with you and also it's it's tough because\nAre coming off that debate last week of Flanders in a White House that was here the next day was when the ... story hit about the police report so they washed out there\nThey're definitely was a window during the Kavanaugh hearings and then we'll find out I I don't know if the Flanders people were able to fully capitalize on that window\nI mean when you're Perry on Sunday Night Live and even I saw South Park was making fun of Sheldon Whitehouse um we'll we'll see if when it finally comes down their final debate is going to be this Saturday Night and you are I again it's not going to be televised it's very safe territory but something also that struck me was\nThere is a little bit of a disconnect within the Republican Party even just in Washington because White House who judge Flanders pointed out is on the list to one of the top ten most aggressive partisan only goes Democrat in the entire Senate top he's in the top ten number nine\nThat White House had a picture of himself there were some piece of legislation that President Trump signed that had to do with the cleaning up the ocean and White House did make his way into the oval office when I saw the picture Justin on White Houses Twitter page he was almost smirking because to me\nWithout knowing it somebody kind of screwed up because if they really had their act together\nMeaning somehow in Washington the Republican Party kinda screwed up because\nThat is certainly legislation that could have waited\nUntil after the election but White House was smirking and the photo almost like you can call me partisan here I Am I'm standing here in the background and he's standing there is Trump President Trump at the death signing it in White Houses there I think in the states where they're paying more attention and some of the races\nSomebody said like whoa whoa whoa we can't have that guy in the oval office because then he's going to use that for face time but White House kinda pulled a fast one on by getting in there to his credit to his credit he did it um I don't know uh\nI I Know that people\nWere almost uniformly feeling the White House embarrassed is I think he somehow pulled a fast one by getting away with leaking that information to the reporter\nAh during the Capitol hearing I\nI don't know I think the judge bland is when you listen to him he certainly knows the issues he certainly has the resume it is very difficult if you keep getting wrapped in with the Trump stuff and then to take out a sitting\nDemocrat Senator right now when you have a a president you know ... with um with with President or with President Trump an office in the White House just continues to\nYou know you're hearing that from both him and Raimondo Europe Trump than boy and you're just with Trump and blah blah blah it's like one thing after another I'm very interested to see what's gonna happen with um with Jeff Dylan was was with Warren now that we've learned she's won\nFive hundred and Seventy fifth part Indian so I guess she has\nNo no no no they they are I saw somewhere or a professor corrected the map of the Boston Globe is actually I think is one one thousand the Ninety seven\nOkay you know are so it's actually it's actually less less than that as an American and they hadn't been oppressed white no wonder [laughter] no one\nDoes she was checking off boxes she's an oppressed minority well listen uh we'll watch the debate on I'll I'll talk to you I'm a\n... ... if you'd like to tomorrow come on and weigh in on the debate tonight it's going to take place of your rights host he's managing editor ocean say current dot com it's just the cat just an excellent as always we'll talk to you again it's a\nR I folks there it is it's a ... a on this Monday and again tonight is the debate um\nLet me find that we had a caller earlier but folks because of the nature and the pace of the program I had been unable to pull that off but er John I'm Glad Justin said that and I will um pull it up on a let me see if I can find that on Twitter that someone's actually corrected the math and soul Elizabeth Warren\nIs even a less\nPart Indian than initially\nSaid it could take me I'm\nA little bit to ah find that I'll have to I don't know if I'm going to be able to find but will open up the phone lines to seven six six Thirteen eighty here it is a but she must\nPhone lines to seven six six Thirteen eighty here it is [noise] um but she must ... blah blah blah and a woman\nNo that's not that I'm a law I don't know if I'm going to be able to find that I'm usually pretty good at finding things pretty quick ah well\nShe's definitely running for president you know it's interesting in mass as much as now in in Rhode Island I haven't heard anyone really get into the fact\nThat well I'm not finding the I don't believe that either that she she totally got at the whole thing because of um\nThat she claimed she was that she was a Native American that's why she she got that but I left a\nI'll have to pull that out but what I was going to say was in Massachusetts they're actually used to people candidates oh OK Boston Globe issues correction center Elizabeth Warren result she could be one thirty second to one to one thousand twenty four Native American\nThere we go wow that's incredible\nZero percent actual Sarah ... percent it is a fake I knew it was a fake so hopefully this whole thing will blow up but what I wanted to mention was you know what's interesting is um\n[noise] they you know they had Mitt Romney run for president they had John Kerry run for president bad Mike Dukakis run for president\nDeval Patrick is going to run for president the fact that she's running for the Senate for reelection against our guide Jeff deal who I Am totally behind and that people are saying that should hurt her in mass part of the problem is there unfortunately they used to\nUh people holding office and then fill running for president and that's why it doesn't seem to be in any way um bothering her\nChances in in any way in running for president folks that John ... on this Monday and again tonight I Am going to go to the debate I'll give you a full recap tomorrow but I Want to remind you you're looking for a great place to eat remember our friends at ... ... wine bar ...\nNine Seventy Douglas bike route seven it's
