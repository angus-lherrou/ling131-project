Kennedy and the Kennedy family came along that's what I Believe Democrats will go I was born and raised up a duck it I've been in this building protect since Nineteen fifty seven so I also always voted Democrat\n'cause back then I Believe the Democrats did work and help the middle class and poor however I Believe those Democrats died unfortunate said this way but died with the Kennedys\nNow they are just like the Republicans all they care about is the next election and how much money\nThe Republicans all they care about is the next election and how much money they can raise in a while what jobs they can create for their family and what not [noise] I was told that that the minorities don't even apply I don't think that is true I think that uh most of the reason is because\nWe're so program and uh we believe that if you don't know somebody you're not going to get the job and if you again with the population of the jobs being Ninety five percent white and the leaders being Ninety seven percent white male which is almost a hundred percent um that\nKeep given that those jobs and reserved those jobs for their families and friends and not for us we're not going to get them anyway I Need to change that you need to change that in order to change that you need to change your way of voting\nI Am running in my race against three endorsed Democrats I'd run as an independent now because I Am a fighter in later I'm not a flower and when you see\nEndorsed that automatically should tell you that they are going to be puppets for the potty they will do as the potty tells in the potty is giving them money and a lot of votes\nSo they're going to be beholden to that party and that's what has been with for us in decades that is why your city looks the way it is\nAnd one major thing of course is the Memorial Hospital [noise]\nI was on Ninety five yesterday during rush hour\nI was coming home but the traffic going to Providence towards Merriam hospital in Rhode Island hospital there was the name of the traffic was completely stopped and there was an ambulance from Lincoln trying to get through\nThree hundred yards down there was another ham and it's from Cumberland trying to get to ... traffic so my worry might wonder was what is going to happen to these people in the ambulance or they dined\nHad they been able to get off an exit earlier ... Memorial Day would have already been at the hospital but they were looking at another ten minutes I mean let's face it um if you're dying you know two minutes two seconds could mean life or death\nI Will work and I will get Memorial Hospital emergency reopen\nHow\nThe Rhode Island department of health took that away from us for some crazy reason the department of health allowed the new owners of the Memorial Hospital to change their license in move\nWell I Hope they realize now that I'm sure I've spoken to a couple of five and in fact I spoke to a fireman from duck it right after\nI witnessed that and I asked my said jeez you know they've got to be people dying because of this and he said yes\nThat's got to change its gotta stop we got to reopen Memorial Hospital so look I'm asking for your vote November sex in the city council at large race I M registered as an independent 'cause I Will not bow down to any potty\nI Am looking to help protect I've been here since Nineteen fifty seven my son is in high school", "city": "Woonsocket"}
