it it you know it's even worse than that you'll be too hard on yourself he he is he is running Providence into the ground\nAnd you know if he remains four more years in a row Mondo remains four more years I I don't think people even fully understand how ... like it hasn't even bottomed out yet\nSo it is not bottomed out and I'll tell you one of the first things that you would do or anyone would do\nIs you need more police and he refuses to hire police handcuffed the police he's put in motion police can't ask people for id he's also giving out those municipal id ... illegals feel comfortable having a form of identification\nHe is running a sanctuary city and he is encouraging more able to come in\nThere you go and I appreciate you taking the time how to help your voice of enough that's got to say well what am I doing you know\nI don't think it is and they are right that people on the east side I mean it it's unimaginable to me the amount of taxes they pay and everything else but that is what I'm hearing the going door to door\nAnd then when people canvassing and they're saying you know are you and you go through a list of issues are you concerned about the potholes are you concerned about\nThe uh the the the panhandlers are you concerned about the homeless you concerned about Iraq is the crime the home invasions are incredible it's going on in Providence right now and instead they say\nWhat was her take on the cabinet or hearing that that's a that's that's what I look out or is that is you have to laugh and then I'm like well duty women wasn't she raising money for a long and and he had a Trump\nPat on a hat on like you know like you say one more thing but I don't go ahead go ahead a\nBig shot at it you agree ... thousand dollar that hasn't give that that's got to show something\nHassan filled is such a quality guy he is their men do uh he he moved to headquarters into Providence that shows out as a major statement and there are other people that are stepping forward but in these last there is time\nBut it is a law there is time there certainly are a time and she could totally tuned him up but what the what what ... said that I Am fearful of his\nSeat he basically has handed the city of prominence over to the ... people and so there is some kind of a deal that whole business it goes back to January February when she took over the Democrats city committee\nShe is scouring every boat out of Providence and they're going to be is helping her and just this is this is my last they just ... yeah that's what the ... do people do\nIs they go down a street in Providence like off ... street near the armory now let's just say you have I'm just going to use it like you say your ten houses on the street they're all triple decker is right now none of them speak English and none of them actually should be boating they also play the thing\nThat if you're if you are from the Dominican Republic you still supposed to live in the United states more than you lived there but anyhow they had these Dominican and not supposed to vote and they get them but anyhow they go\nAnd in these triple decker ... near the armory off ... shots fired the shots fired known even calls the place of\nHers floor you're ten people living there okay two or three bedroom apartment second floor you're twelve people living there all illegal third floor\nYou have ten people living there in that one triple decker right hand ... you have close to twenty five votes just that John household on ... street they get every single person\nSo on an ad street they get every single person registered illegally by the way illegally they registered illegally these people are not supposed to be voting illegally so\nIn that one street ... houses in this one is ten houses they grab two hundred and fifty votes\nAnd that's what kills me joined the way they deal with the Kobe and and this is what's so called Mayor John spot on actually what I ate above it yeah it does it do do I I Love this program or quite All right thank you very\nMuch for the call folks seven six six Thirteen eighty keep in mind that and I said this back in may governor among do she has spent you know just and cats and I talk about this\nOn a Monday it's with political Monday she spends a fortune on the get off the boat a fortune on people what they called canvassing you go door to door you'd done a fire voter they register them to vote they find out who lives here they get them a ballot they get the emergency ah balloting they notarized the ballots it's disgraceful\nI'm Chris Murray and writes the ... the police union endorsed fun that is exactly right hello this is my friend Debra or the people [noise] yeah that's right Chris call up pork boy\nAnd ask them who he's voting for why not see I think people need to be proactive that way I won't be offended call you just call and you say oh I just want to call and I want to agree with what you know they're saying but then you get them on the air and say All right I'm just curious who voted for vulgar Gina\nGrey striped park by you must be voting Virginia gates Trump only eight of Trump 'cause I was behind the Trump I'm\nVincent bright howdy Shelley get away with lying on his new t._v. at\nAll he does his lie good afternoon Brian excuse me I'm\nRob says seems like the Providence voters were all brain dead you know it goes beyond that hello to fill us thank you he is a terrific fundraiser tonight that's rightly so folks you can weigh in on Facebook Live um [noise]\nBut to answer Christmas early question mayor Fung I'm telling you right now I I I've known mayor ... since he was a councilman Allan Fung and his wife barber in or two of the nicest most decent people you'd ever meet\nHe is a running for the right reasons\nAnd it is shameful what is going on in this election but again I Want to reach out to you hello this is Suzanne I'd a nice time of poll on Saturday thank you Deborah vote vote but on top of that call up\nCall up some of these so called taco why not put them on the record I don't shy away I'll tell you I Am voting Bob planners I'm voting for mayor Fong I'm voting for the gentleman that I've met that's running against land jamon on voting Anthony gee roost so\nUm I Would vote against is selenium to live in that district I I'll tell you and it's very simple just ask them and put them on record are you voting for long are you voting for Gina don't allow them to say well it's still early ah what do you mean it's early it's very clear\nEnd in ... and again I I'm not Joe ... is not leaving the race someone post John you need to talk to I I I've said on he's not leaving the race\nNo Monday Night in the debate mayor Fung said a deal is been made the die is cast and that's why Monday Night at that debate it you are right\n[noise] and honest and I give him credit said about a two person race and ... has been saying this is now a two person race\nAnd Gina Raimondo was asked and she said oh no no no I I I Need to low in the race I Want ... on this stage Gina Raimondo will not be\nAlan fun you know one on one setting because she would lose and she's always known she would lose\nIn what turned it for me I was going to remain neutral on this I was because I've known Joe ... a long time\nAnd I was going to remain neutral but the actions of Patricia Morgan ... over the past month or not [noise] the same actions of people that I repeatedly would support and have on the radio all the time all the time\nSo I'm I don't understand any of it\nThere is no legitimate reason for a vendetta not this is this is ridiculous and even you know within the Providence Journal ... a joke kilo when he was asked about the craft a police report is a very carelessly or casually or an sent in an instant ... insensitive way\nWas throwing out well you know he was involved with that accident with the guy in the highway and was never asked about it on the debate\nAnd he was asked to apologize won't apologize I I I just ... this is too serious look at the numbers I'll go to Joe Fleming who said trailer is pulling from ... supporters if ... out of the race ... wins he's not leaving\nAnd ... do knows that\n[noise] but folks you need to hold people accountable and there's a somewhat on social media who's been very outspoken\nAnd has been saying you know when this races is over and done with there are people they're gonna have to be held accountable in in ... gets re elected and it's Patricia Morgan and Joe blow in Arlene Violet\nAnd these other people that jumped on board with this foolish this and I would also say the ... radio station that broke the record the most free appearances ever by a candidate\nAnd all elections shallow broke that record I give him credit for that\nI give him credit I saw Joe the other night he gave me a quick tap to say hello and I'm I'm actually um [noise] I'm Upset about the whole thing I Am because there's there's no reason for this venom\n... so I Know that Joe ... had said ... percent okay that he claims that he has a chance at winning because they had in his mind he's gonna win by the Trump factor\nI just want to get your opinion on this because I told them I don't agree with that that the Trump factor vote alone is never going to propel him into the lead to get the majority of the vote what do you think about\nThis John well I'm Glad you asked me that and I am going to actually write a piece of this on my website well I think and I think you're back me up on this I think I have some Trump credentials right I was the emcee if the rally\nI met President Trump I interviewed President Trump I've appeared on national television several times national TV defending President Trump anyone listens knows that I have a relationship with Sean Spicer\nAnd as I revealed last week I had the privilege once in a lifetime opportunity of being in the west wing of the White House with President Trump over the weekend\nI also was the keynote speaker at the march for Trump last march in Providence so over the weekend\nI was at a gathering with one thirty Trump supporters these the people that voted for President Trump support President Trump there's someone that's in the mix the kind of keeps everybody together it's not a regular thing and so forth\nEvery Trump voter that I Know is voting for a long\nDrive me to repeat that\nYou want me to work it out these you\nKnow can I chime in\nYeah of course you can try and and I'm going to be very clear and very early Trump supporter I Know is voting for Cranston mayor Allen ... end if someone is a Trump supporter they would be voting for Chris Mayer Ellen ... the president of the United states Joe ... left\nThe Republican Party mhm and by his presence in the race\nIs enabling Democrat Gina Raimondo\nWho boycotted the Trump inauguration Germany governors didn't go to the ... one\nI can tell you in the White House\nThey know Romano is they would love to see Allen fun when they would love to see there was a story Republican governors taking over the guy kinetic could could when Charlie Baker and math are here in Rhode Island and so forth there is no way this business of Trump supporters\nObsolete balls not to not want these uh thirty people\nThat I Know all Trump supporters now not one is voting patrol oh\nI see the same thing John and for and for those people that don't know okay I myself was eight Trump delegate alternate okay I was on the RMC [noise]\nThere is no bigger probably next to you there is no bigger supporter of President Trump a grade than I Am and I wholeheartedly support Allen Fung hung up\nBecause Trump supporters were educated people despite what you're going to hear from from the other side on the left where a very smart educated people and what is the bottom line but it's\nImportant to Trump supporters is that we did not\nTell the liberal agenda do not allow the liberal and gender to continue in a sanctuary city of Providence and what's going on with\nWith Gina remind out that's the last thing that we watch so we're going to rise above all of this the the fray okay that's going on here the division and smart people I going to do the right thing and vote correctly\nAs to what's in the best interest of Rhode Island jail trouble is not working for the people of Rhode Island he's only working for himself and his ego and his hate for Alan ... that is the bottom line\nIs exactly right they said nothing would make President Trump happier than to see Gina Raimondo defeated nothing he would love they would absolutely love it and I want to leave you with this\nI actually got a call from someone that said oh they were speaking to a member of the media that works in another radio station that said ... going to have a rally with President Trump Pacific center\nI I stopped a person and said listen [laughter]\nIt was just in the news but when Joe Louis thirty four years old he beat a twelve year old child with a cork on he's he's polling at five percent of the vote you think the president of United States is coming in Rhode Island\nTo support a guy with five percent of the boat to defeat the Republicans ... it's never\nHappening there either lying or the delusional and neither one is a good option station\nExactly both have your drink they should keep doing any time you got ...\nSeven six six Thirteen aid that is laughable to me laughable and I don't you know I don't like this I don't like I'm not trying to bash your pillow but I also don't want to have to deal [noise]\nWith four more years of governor among do\nSo folks put the pressure on the media get off the fence who you're voting for bone or Raimondo period [noise]\nI agree with ... ... it's a two
