governor Gina Raimondo loves the most in Rhode Island Barrett is Joe ... and Patricia Morgan\nWow I mean and the knives us a deep it's it's still hard it's still hard for me to believe why they would do that and then the rest of us are just a [noise]\nAbsolutely screwed um let me just a a hold on let me send a quick message before we um\nA hold of them you know a no\nAir with me folks seven six six Thirteen eighty\nA highlight okay\n\nI'm like OK okay\nLet me just I I Do want to see or if the the media again felt for Troy was having a press conference today at one o'clock\nI don't I don't see anything posted but it was supposed to be I Believe Frank today October nineteenth one o'clock joked fellow to hold his first press conference to announce first executive order as governor\nOne o'clock today again right near the headquarters or he doesn't leave the Rhode Island ah ... first executive order as governor\nI I don't know what the what the\nAh the announcement is let me just quickly um check and see if anyone went to cover this first executive order I said the person with five percent I don't see he got a lot of press the other day\nI don't know why hold on a\nBoat he's no oh okay oh God is this today\nTrailer takes aim at Raimondo pension reform from his time as treasurer standing along Spencer Dickerson\nAnd also that guy ah Joel ... that's right so I think okay so that just happened let me tell you what this is about folks and this is very clever\nUm icy\nWho she yeah okay\nUh let me just quickly explained so Joe ... what I'm seeing is had a press conference well the good news is I only see one microphone there isn't that funny take a guess at the one microphone who's that is that amazing or to actually\nChannel twelve and then the ... radio station two microphones but let me explain something [noise] uh this is the tweet sent out ... takes aim at Raimondo pension reform from her time as treasure now\nWhy that does not hurt her is because again he is tapping into people who would never going to vote for Gina Raimondo if joke trailer with serious if Joe trailer were serious candidate he'd be trying to get ... voters\nNow for him to take the mid pension reform part time as treasure those people are never voting for her but those people maybe we're going to vote for fun\nSo do you see what he's doing I Want you to understand that so yesterday ... held a press conference and in the press conference he said he was going after ice and criticizing governor him onto a nice but he's really not criticizing governor Mondo with ice he's really trying to solidify\nThe illegal alien vote Suzanne ... get out of the race he's ever going to get out of the race so I Want you to understand\nThat what he's actually doing\nI just want you guys to understand that so what is she is trying to do is he still is not touching her base she's in the lead a Raimondo right she's the leader so yesterday or two days ago two days ago it was a press conference it'd be the eye\nAnd says he wants to work more with ... well that doesn't hurt Raimondo what that hurts is the conservative wing that might vote for phone\nOkay now so but he's disingenuous because I'm going to hit Gina Raimondo now the people that he's attacking you know he's attacking Raimondo a nice then never voting for anyway so he's not hurting her\nSo look at today in fact just in the past half hour it started gets a one o'clock now he's going after pension reform so what is he doing again the people that are upset with Gina Raimondo on pension reform then never voting for anyway so again\nHe's having a press conference to try to draw more votes away from a ... but the good news is today it seems like the only people that win\nAre in fact uh the ... radio station in channel twelve of which there is actually almost like a little bit of a connection there but and then I get to see someone say well we don't want to miss anything because who knows maybe he kills over and has a heart attack\nBut it's all disingenuous he's not going after the leader he's not taking aim at anything Joe ... is not doing anything to peel away any Raimondo voters zero none in the things he had he criticizes her on\nHe's not peeling any of her voters away the only one again second time this week\nIt's it's it's fake and I want you to see through it to be transparent right when he says we go to crack down on immigration you know I'm ... I'm calling out governor ... do well he's not calling Raimondo\nBecause the only person that's hurting\nPeople that don't pay attention who would then vote for him over phone in today when he goes after the oh I'm In a you know go after the pension thing\nThat doesn't hurt her because they're never voting per anyway the only one that hurts our people that are against her that we're going to vote for ... so two times this week and I hope the media I'm not going to hold my breath realized that coal I'm Out on it\nThat that is deployed and that is the only play as a matter of fact\nThat is um I mean it's so clear folks and I know they think they're so slick the people that are running the campaign he has a lot of people in the background behind him and he said it himself yesterday\nOr excuse me last friday he set it when he said\nThat I don't care if I just get two percent as long as I defeat mayor ... so now they're trying to learn some people are like let me just play a this is tomorrow night this is the Bob Flanders a spot about Senator Sheldon Whitehouse let me just quickly [noise]\nThere's also another pending deadline ah which may have just passed for another two fifty\nA hundred two hundred and fifty thousand justice system for ... for fiscal year two thousand and Eighteen oh\nMy goodness All right now they're also in danger of losing an additional hundred and fifty thousand something from something called project safe neighborhood grant from the U.S attorney's office for the same reason so this these totals represent just about half\nThe overtime that the police\nHave for the budget because breakdown so many officers\nAre not only that is actually told the police\nAnd here's another example of lack of leadership about the big wrench in downtown a trained he absolutely has refused to allow the police to arrest they Grinch who has a\nA warrant on them yeah for drinking and public attorney so I just simply don't quite understand it I don't get\nWhy he is allowing our city to become a lawless environment and you talk about the the mall on the third floor it it's like the wild wild west yeah many women will simply not go down there to shop that's right that is a guarantee right\nAnd this has just stop I don't believe that I Am the perfect person at the right time I had no ambition other than to put all my energy into making Providence better for all its residents I Can't say it any clearer than\nThat yeah and ... and you do I have the gumption\nObsolete one hundred percent\nUnbelievable this is a gift to the city that you are willing to take this on books were speaking with Dee Dee Whitman independent candidate for mayor the city of prominence in also as you know the prominence of the city prominence is under staffed with police when you compare it to Worcester and compared to other cities that size\nProminence is one of the few cities is actually more firefighters and police prominence does not have a fire problem Providence has a police wacko please crime problem I Lived in New York City when Rudy Giuliani ... turned around the city with Bill Bratton the key is more police more of a presence of police\nThis form of the police were always in a no win situation and it can't be that way and if I can be improved now my question is to be with you how\nCan we help you how can anyone listing help you I Love the fact could be done is is a new commercial I Love the ... how can we help you cross the finish line\nEverybody in Providence needs to tell their friends and families\nTo go out and vote you need to vote or it's under the ballot as Diane ... men I'm independent everybody needs to come out and vote and you can go on my website\nWhere men for mayor without an age and a Facebook\nAnd sign up volunteer we need a\nTremendous amount of volunteers for election day and we would be grateful and appreciative to anyone who wants to step up the plate and say it's simply not working under this current administration\nThan I Do me a long time I do I was gonna say someone that I Know I have great admiration for a she and I read so much the and I figured out\nAllen Hassan told them myself when I used to raise money for has proved children's hospital radios on Alan would come on with me he was always so generous use match donations you know we we raised over one million dollars the two of us and\nI Want people to understand Allen has been filled who I Love and it was so much respect for she step forward and he said I Am behind the women and was very generous with the donation\nI look at the quality of the type of individuals' you're attracting that\nHas all the makings of a real leader\nHas every neighborhood involved in the campaign and that's what tells me something every where I go from the south side of the west and east side to uh only square everybody receives me warmly I Love the fact that a\nHoagie is involved I Love the fact that the police endorsed me they were brave soldier to do that\nWere uh absolutely I sure hope the other unions endorsed me and again how do you let your teachers go for a contract with out two years and he actually said something the other day that he was going to help\nKids were going to make up a school that French the days they lost\nBut oh my God that's where's he going to go from from the teachers that oh yeah\nYou don't see
