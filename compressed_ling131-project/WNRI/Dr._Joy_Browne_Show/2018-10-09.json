T. Barnum said you know soccer born every minute people saying to me you know is it are you seeing someone said to me I just heard on the the my sister's brother works at um ... green airport in air force one is flying in and all this other\nUnbelievable nonsense said that we were hearing or that dot Tom Brady and ballot check we're going to show up at ... headquarters to endorse him and then it turned out to be Patricia Morgan who sat in the studio\nOn August twenty ninth and said she would never endorse an independent candidate or a Democrat and then I even said hello and more and I'm\nSheena and she said no I never would and she was with him and said she's joining the true low camp\nAnd part of the team and he's gonna win he's the only one that can defeat a Gina Raimondo\nTo run this ah philanthropy good government operation and as a result of her with the trailer situation they are completely withdrawn not that they offered it to a ... it's completely out of consideration\nSo I think the blowback on her is very substantial and you know just in the last time I uh Joe ... which was\nJust in the past two or three weeks [noise]\nThere's several arguments of his that I just don't understand and one is that by that\nI I just don't there's no logic to I had to run as an independent because the party in the primary was ranked will you and I both know the Republican Party certainly doesn't have that kind of power\nThere are many people that Rhode Island is not a closed primary so there's many people that can cross over I remember to eat or in April of twenty sixteen there were a lot of people that wanted to vote for Donald Trump in a primary but they were registered Democrat\nThere were plenty of people that are unaffiliated who could have voted for Joe ... in a primary but what does it make sense is\nJoe trailer basically saying I I couldn't be Alan ... in a Republican primary so I had to run against him in a general went out Gina Raimondo is also in the race I I don't none of that\nYou and I you and I both know none of that makes sense and I also\nYou talk about credibility I I just what is the goal because I'm hearing more and more people even saying is the goal for the ... campaign to be Gina Raimondo where's the goal is to beat mayor fun because even on TALK radio not myself but others so saying well you know ... a good shot\nTo get up the way he really was a twenty two percent\nThat's fine if your goal was to just get twenty three percent beat the late Bob he'll eat but I Want to remind people Bob heat only lost\n... just been so ... this business um he is a really good shot to get when he got ... I I still don't get how does that help you with any way other than just as you said it it's really seems to be nothing more than playing the role of the spoiler\nYeah and and as you chose that is internal also put them up near that amount than his vote total and I you know I just don't buy it really was a a quantity in Rhode Island\nYou know one of the Enron but it's the talk with Governor and run for lieutenant governor but finished that is the ... and we asked him where did you come up with that number how come there's no expenditure reset blighted volunteers to the poll no joke shallow slammed the the the Joe climbing poll in June he slammed the Joel Fleming polling September\nNow suddenly he's he doesn't believe polls but he believes ... and his polls done by I it's it's just becoming less credible to me by the day here Justin\nRight certainly and and are they are adding to that in my view is this idea that they've got this a team you mentioned is earlier other they've got a kind of a John Robert Hi and earning violets signed up to be part of the administration and\nI've spoken with\nA John overtime and Ken Buck and both of them say absolutely is on the phone that I Would participate there in administration to ah and I guess I've gotten the same central Marlene alive and discuss it with her a and actually I'm fine is already reached out to kind of got\nTo be part of that so the whole idea that there's a scene that's going to come in and make up for whatever it is a joke show accidents administration that two dozen you don't you don't get passed\nA little bit of scratching to see that that's just another talking like and you can only do so much until until you even start to erode whatever support you already have\nA which was brought in the seven percent range\nWas and I'm a couple of the things then we will move on to the Senate race but just sticking with that theme for\nNerve that they have if anything's been I'm On earth in some way and it was Patricia Morgan or credit you did it and that is some former members of the Republican Party that run that obviously feel under appreciated\nAnd in some ways ... want to be part of the conversation and perhaps not to the moon but even be relevant again for instance the Arlene violent writes a column for the belly breeze and as I've said I worked with aren't lean for five years\nI've known I saw this past summer a theater by the sea I'm obviously a you know friendly with her in that respect\nBut her column in the valley breeze I mean Arlene violent\nHates President Trump voted for Hillary Clinton is in favor of sanctuary cities she wrote a column in the valley breeze praising joked furloughs performance in the debates now Joe ... during those to be interrupted fond six times\nHe called Alan ... a wimp\nPrior to that he referred to Fong and Raimondo is pansies\nArlene violent beyond violent than I knew never would have been on board\nWith the candidate that behaves in those ways by the way she never mentioned that in her column which she thought shrill oh stole the show with the debate that he interrupted funk six times and called him a wimp at the debate\nIt just it makes me wonder Justin if them a green to be part of it is more of what they have tapped into some of these form of people that are run\nFeel totally unappreciated by the party and so the at the first phone call like someone you know the day of the prime Nick off the phone rings that they are they haven't been invited there there are so desperate to be part of a conversation\nThat willing ... really willing to jump into to any situation because\nIf you look at the way true lowest comport himself during this campaign and what his views are and where Arlene is\nNormally she never would be on board with Joe terminal but it doesn't seem to matter she's more flattered that he'd been asked her to be part of this you know true load ministry should if there ever is such a thing\nBut I Am not knowing her I I couldn't speak to that but uh it does it does seem strange as she didn't have nice things to say about President Obama and it's just that she would be enamored of Joe true although certain really doesn't make a whole lot of sense and do\nYou do in the valley breeze I mean\nI don't know if you had a chance to read it but you know and they all said you know should someone who's ain't going for a position of him in the administration be writing columns\nAlmost objectively and then never mentioning that she's supposedly part of the ... campaign if he gets elected this whole thing it'd be a team or whatever the hell they're calling it um but go ahead finish the thought on that\nThe the big thing about that I mean I can understand\nShe she advocated for an inspector general for a long time so this she may see this as a I'm trying to put it a good face on his or her but she may be seeing this as an opportunity to get that implemented but but what you just mentioned in a rep trip and knows comment\nPoints to why that's a bad idea the inspector general especially of all the position and she's not going to be up for chief of staff or something so cause a political be\nThe inspector general position should be independent\nSo if you've got somebody coming in and going oh this guy's grace\nI Can't wait to be a part of his administration how much can you trust that inspector general to be objective try in assessing the administration or in a in a matter of corruption and so I there's a lot of just strange\n... has a very Rhode Island feel all of this is a lot of her personality driven or people in relatively small groups going after each other a ... and it just it quickly get beyond rational explanation is just\nPeople fighting because they hold some kind of grudge\nThat's what it seems to be and it's funny you mentioned that and again folks could afternoon it's time to speak with Justin cats managing our ferocious say current dot com I've always believed in it and I don't remember if it was governor ... or ... in the Senate\nBut opposition should be created for the position not you know create a position for person so this whole notion that\nYou know Patricia Morgan was putting it forward that she wants to position which someone disagrees with but then it should be Arlene violent I I think the merits of the position outweigh any\nPotential candidate that me you know fall into that because that's just not the way to design it what do you make of the fact just and now we're waiting I Believe the next debate is next Monday Night\nThe gubernatorial debate with Cranston mayor Allen fund a governor Gina Raimondo and the pillow and then this time though they're also going to be including the moderate party candidate I think is that\nTwo percent this this bill go but but I\nI never remember the onslaught um the guide you put on local TV the negative ads Raimondo\nThe bomb throwing it fun it it it reminds you of ah the bombing of Dresden during World War two I mean everything that I can even recite or the ads that they it is a non stop onslaught towards mayor phone right now to remind do and he is still\nStanding right up there I I like the new ... spot that is out that talks about has small business people from the city of Cranston um through everything they're putting up with with with a month ago the ... campaign they're still holding strong\nBut they're doing what adapt to do and I I think a\nA positive message will help to create that contrast there there is a cost to negative campaigning um and it's it's I'm actually a little surprised that reminder spending so much of her her resources doing that they they must\nAnd then as a result of that the independent was maybe on the verge of running but I Would just look at\nWe're the path has been which is there was one example that we can site\nWhere the president has gone in\nAnd to you know campaign on someone who is independent who is left the party and you're right but the problem with Flanders is the same thing that um [noise]\nYou know in this part of the country I think having a rally with Susan Collins\nWould serve in better or having a rally would Lindsey Graham would serve and better\nThan President Trump or Susan Collins if anything has shown you can be a Republican in New England and be in the Senate\nAnd you know not it just doesn't have to be Elizabeth Warren and also ...
