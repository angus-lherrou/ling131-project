have a birthday party going for her I said I'm sure someone and local media will ask White House about it right I mean the FBI is questioning why did you tell this China\nOr he calls your office why didn't you tell them to call the meteor on this you sit on Senate Judiciary\nI thought you know somebody's got to ask no one asked to no one asked them at all\nUnbelievable but let's bring them on its political Monday\nAnd right now is our friend from ocean state contact on\nManaging Aaron and Justin cats can afternoon just a good afternoon job\nYou're just an I Want to start off that I'm really just a week ago a\nCandidly when you look at the timeline last Thursday not this past Thursday but the Thursday before that channel twelve came out with the poll and they showed according to the channel pope Paul\nYeah you're right there's Supreme Court or no less yeah yeah and that's just that I Want to move on because we are going to talk to I mean I talked to judge slammed his one thirty last Thursday night and this is these are the things that can happen so as soon as we as Wednesday night now you had the gubernatorial debate\nAnd you know what I'm confused was there was a debate last Wednesday no it was Thursday night it was Thursday night was the debate heightened was Thursday night Roger Williams and to me what is unfortunate here\nAh for I'm going to say unfortunate for mayor Fung is there I mean your eye or in the media there was no bonds afterwards there was no talk about it I'm On friday I got one phone call of anyone one asked wanted no one is asked me about the debate\nAre so much the cable uh headlines ... that was also the same day the White House had question Kavanaugh so that was lighting up\nI mean these are one of those things you can't predict an election but\nTo me the debate in some ways was almost it's like it's a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it what was it really a debate if not enough people watched it\nWell yeah that is that is a problem and I I think\nIt was true they'll have other debates by now the this was the first one you're kinda got a taste of certain things and as we were watching certain things Joe ... reaction for example I think a lot of he was\nGetting kind of too nervous simply aggressive at points and that sort of thing he might get under control and and it'll affect later as you said it's unfortunate for mayor of phone I thought he did it pretty well in this one um\nYeah it definitely I Know from working in the policy area you your plan all this a roll out to try to get some information out there and then something like this happened at the national level and suddenly nobody cares about you know it's really important at a local level\nIt is and there's nothing you can do about it you know you mentioned um I did obviously watch it and I take it I always like to watch it live and then I tape and watch it again trailer interrupted punk six times ... made some noises um\nHe was kind of the court jester you know I talk to different people the word familiar with them they said he just seem like he wasn't taking it serious seriously and if you really watch some of the different elements who's even Joe Fleming afterwards that said\nYou know governor Mondo basically would just stand back quiet\nLooking down as low as in attacking funk he interrupted mayor ... six times he was mocking their Fong odd to me it seems very although this was interesting also was attacking Raimondo\nWhich makes me think she's also trying to grab onto that anti Raimondo does against Gina crowd\nBut I'll tell you Justin and a guy sitting at six or seven percent it it is\nAnd and and shallow shrugs off the notion of being the spoiler it's\nIt's hard to take any of these seriously and now the problem with the young people that they had is the next ... which I Believe is happening and you are right now the moderate party candidate is going to be on stage and I grew up poor people on stage and the more people on stage you just everybody get gets equal time it just gets tougher to get the oxygen\nIt does although it does it can it might present an opportunity for for mayor of phone and also for dinner I'm honored to be the ... to to set up a contrast this is me this is\nA um you know I'll do my adult jobs like found\nOut in a job about a kindergarten a third grade reading so that Joe Miller create a campaign finance reports you know it was kind of an adult ... job at him as opposed to you know just to the screaming and the bug eyes um but I ... it was conspicuous that you're in the midst of saying I'm not a spoiler\nBut I ... was conspicuous that you're in the midst of saying I'm not a spoiler he chose never interrupted governor\nAnd my only interrupted Alan ... constantly so many at once or twice once or twice would've gotten a point across but it was every opportunity you could hear him talking over him on a on a microphone of one thing I Do think\nMight be significant in as that showed did make a big deal about leaving the Republican Party in ... but believe me that catch my ear was that Patricia market has been out there saying I might enjoy the job you know he's he's really a Republican so\nI thought that moment might make that a little bit harder for her um other than that I thought of it went about as as one would've expected I did not expect a judge or to become quite be reminded me of Giovanni ferociously almost oh I'm I'm the guy I can build everything in this auditorium better than the people who built it it was\nAlmost so over the top you wonder what's this guy really going after here\nI I agree with you and um [noise]\nI you know the next to beat is now coming up I Believe is that I think it's six week and you are I so uh but if you're a Gina Raimondo all you want to do is just being neutral and then\nTo her she doesn't even if it were up to her she doesn't want the debates right she just is looking to just maintain and not give phone I think they are fun did actually very well in the debate\nBut the problem was six times with the distracts the true low or if they want to move ahead and defeat her which they could can still do and I'm I'm seeing on Twitter they're getting huge infusions of cash now\nBecause this is seen as a winnable seat for the Republicans and ... is without question tapped out at at forty three percent with all the money she spent but they need to figure out the situation\nI also think it's interesting though just an on duty Whitman is impressing a lotta people she just analogy is going to be running independent but what I like is she just last week she opened up her campaign headquarters in Providence and had a big thing what I like about it is as much as everyone else has been in motion for so long\nDuty Whitman is approaching it like listen a lot of people and not been paying attention it's really just between me and I'm\nAnd Merrill lords and so you know I'm just this is a five weeks Britain right now and she got Kobe Dennis To endorse her I see the prominence police are endorsing her I see Great Britain is endorsing her\nShe has money she certainly has well over six hundred seven hundred thousand dollars of people\nI think she could end up being in in this year the woman right in this year the woman mayor laws that does not have tremendous support within the Democratic party interesting yesterday when I looked at the picture he was not on stage with Biden when you look at the picture it's it's the usual Raimondo\nWhite House a Sicily any land you in a ... a a lawyer is not part of that circle duty Whitman I think could could surprise a lot of people I think that is a race that is very very winnable for her\nOh it certainly is and I and I think mainly it's a negative reaction to a large uh where you know the police union coming out that's that's not a vote of confidence and and the mayor or or his two Democrats I think the Romeo also I'm indoors Whitman has treated or just to Democrat come competitors in the\nIn the primary going for the independent candidate a that that's all a sign that he's he's just not doing something right and I noted when he first ran for the race he hasn't done a whole lot I have this problem in another country but in Rhode Island especially where we seemed to elect people who\nWhether you agree or not with their politics it's where's the executive experience coming from an espresso I just don't see it and I I I'm not sure what man has all that much as a I think she was mainly professional fundraisers she is a but but he certainly didn't and that\nWhat you get is somebody who is not really comfortable running things gets in these weird fights with with the unions that don't really have a purpose because he's not sure where he wants to go and you just end up with opposition in an ... sort of an anyone but added atmosphere and so if if somebody credible and so that's going to be women's passed\nOver the next few weeks has to prove I can credibly claim that I can run in a city that's\nIf she can make that case I think it's going to really give orders or something to be afraid of\nWay with you I'm In a while we're going to hold that short they are simply because I Need to be speaking with judge Flanders or\nAny I I Want to give you any thoughts on or anything else politically that uh catches your attention Matty yellow certainly is under fire in in ... any other on the line I Know a pack caught a lesson did debate Nelly go be hopefully there'll be another debate on that but any other ... just political thought you want to leave us with Justin\n[noise] well it's hard it's hard to overcome the or the ... and counter I gradations\nYeah that was interesting stolen from everything\nExactly I I thought it was interesting and it hasn't gotten a whole lot of attention was was Mike Riley running for a treasure or didn't quit but he says heritable this this is the games are rigged against the yeah the economy going well for reasons that Rhode Island's doing and so don't give me money oh my God and all that\nSo ... a barrel said if you agree to ... you just run you don't have to I agree with you folks he's just a cat managing an approach and say current dot com and it was embarrassing Justin great travel talk to you again the photos extra\nAlright folks there it is just in cats managing editor\nFor ocean state current dot com we're going to be talking\nWith judge Flanders coming up momentarily in the meantime I Want to remind you folks right now maybe are looking to get some uh Halloween decorations and especially some pumpkins and corn stalks and straw and gorgeous stop in toured islands number one garden center\nPR landscape materials and gotten set or they're open seven days a week the rope until five o'clock tonight it's it's Steve it's Debbie it's junior it's Byron it's PR landscape materials and garden center\nYou can call them a tune nine five forty three Ninety nine no word islands Des Moines garden centers located thirty six eighty eight Quaker laying in North kings tail and right now at PR landscape materials and garden center fall moms kale ornamental peppers all ready all colors all grown on the premises\nI I have no idea but that's certainly something that should be looked into a let's find out what his end of it if they're going to investigate this they should certainly look into the reporter was when he was contacted if he did anything what\nWhat if anything came of it because uh this ultimately of course did get and we don't know where it came from first\nCame from the Senate or may not necessarily go to um from other sources so lots of find out what ... I asked the question why is the hiding who this person is\nAnd I'm just curious if if if someone calls him with a serious allegation like this in his response is to refer the person to have the media investigated\nWas that something that he did when he when he was the word island attorney general if someone contacted him or his office regarding something a crime of this nature\nWould would he refer them to speak to the Providence Journal channel twelve uh channel ten so they could investigate the manner judge doesn't\n... ... if you're a U.S attorney or you're an attorney general when when you have investigative um purposes or at your disposal that you could then investigate this on your own to have you ever heard of something like that\nOf course la completely ah appropriate [noise] uh\n[noise] show as well so I Can't imagine they would have done anything like this I mean we don't know but or God Forbid this was his MO uh when he was serving in those positions so yeah it it's it's it's inconceivable to me that he would have\nDone such things and and so that's why it makes it particularly egregious this this wouldn't have been an innocent mistake this is a fellow who knows what the proper procedure is 'cause he's held offices where you were properly investigate these types of charges you don't send an accuser often\nOr in the hopes that the media will or just do whatever they do to attack this man's reputation by publishing it before it's been vetted and to see whether there's any merit to the allegations so it's a\nYou know it raises all sorts of questions about how this man operated held office for\nA ... good afternoon ... speaking with George planters judge I have spoken to people that I Know in Washington and when I have been told\nIs when the FBI asked this individual why did he contact the reporter he is the one that told them\nThat Senator Whitehouse uh referred him and told him to contact the reporter uh you really wanna you know you got to kind of in a way celibate so to speak you got a really adds to me to this judge your being diplomatic\nBut to me Senator Whitehouse knew he was going to be questioning judge Kavanaugh he knew he was going to be investing in questioning of there's no way to interpret this as\nThere was a pattern here were Dianne Feinstein has the letter\nAnd about this woman initially Dr Ford and what does she do it said fed to the Washington Post and its attempt to kind of you know blow up the confirmation now you have a situation where Senator Whitehouse gets a call regarding allegations he has no idea whether or not it's true\nIt's true he does put it to the FBI cars in Canada has actually been asked about it and they were investigating this Kavanaugh was asked about this on a phone call he completely denying it\nBut what I I truly believe judge planned is Senator Whitehouse today needs to name the reporter in the news organization that he instructed that man to contact and is this happened before and did he do this as attorney general does he do this as us attorney [noise]\nWhat what is so appalling to me and I want to get your thought but what really sticks out to me is [noise]\nThis judiciary hearing as long as you know it's all under oath they talk about potential perjury\nSenator Whitehouse knew he was going to be questioning judge Kavanaugh this was not Congress since ... telling this man to contact the media this was not Landrieu in this wasn't even Senator Reid never would do something like that [noise]\nHe instructed this individual who completely re chanted this allegation\nWhite House he instructed that guy to call a reporter so they could investigate it knowing that he was going to question Kavanaugh I I'm Sorry judge I I think that is just beyond the bounds and I'm not trying to challenge you as a judge when you were on the Supreme Court but I\nI Would be hard pressed to if you could come up with an example that\nIf someone contacted Peter Till Martin for example is the attorney general\nThat he would contact headed to Rhode Island state police not instruct the person to contact him lightly I team where the Providence Journal for them to investigated judge find is there's no other way to take take out of this other than\nSenator Whitehouse his goal was to have this thing blow up into the media and as I was watching CNN Tuesday night they said boom headline\nThe user comes forward\nCabinet or rape in Newport Rhode Island on a boat completely fabricated and White House behind the scenes was working one plane that story\nYeah it's a is totally reprehensible in my opinion and [noise] ah and fortunately fortunately\nUh this man recanted ... enough but is not enough to prevent that from getting out there or a limited period of time that there was a fifth rape allegations near Newport and center the White House was all involved in it uh so\nYou know look I this where do you what does this judge do to get his reputation back\n... where where does it go how does he\nDo that because even caught\nA this is going to try to him or for the rest of his life and this man is on trial for his life that's the way you have to look at this and you have to remember that and law burden of proof is always on the accuser\nOn someone who is being charged with a criminal offense and and and so one has to be the only person proven guilty under America\nTrial even at this ... this is a ...\nProven guilty under American trial\nEven if this this is out of a judicial proceeding and the normal censored or trial but still those are fundamental principles that people need to remember a\nNewsletter exemplary life some entire adult exist and and so to dredge up stuff for thirty six years ago\nOh my God\nA high school kids talking about flatulence and other a sophomore references in your book uh you know this is ... and the thing I see most of all as as as bad as I feel for this man and his family\nIs how this will be a deterrent or other good people write so people who are a lead model lives even a to come forward and say do I really want to put myself my family\nWas caught up with the face to life so Senator Whitehouse or you're drilling down into my\nHouse my God and ... like\nMy diaries when I was in junior high school or whatever else they can find that try and smear my reputation\nAnd a lot of people think that I'm a bad guy all of that and this has nothing to do with gender has to do with human decency and integrity Jessica ... equally happen to a woman that was of being proposed or a man\nAnd a this is not to cast aspersions on on a a Dr Ford she'd seen some believe for whatever reason that ... or\nLook there's just been no proof that they are no corroboration whatsoever of what she's saying an actual or other folks have come forward to refute what she's saying so\nUh so far the if we're going to honor the principle that person is innocent until proven guilty and let the burden of proof is always honoring accuser so far that hasn't met and so a\nLot of other reasons if I was voting today I Would vote to confirm them but on the other hand um I think it was\nProbably good for the nation's or at least take another week to tie up any loose ends and let's see where this ends up with this new information find what we value it but so far senator White House has done himself no favors and certainly done Rhode Island no favors by the way you have and I hope people hold them accountable to account for\n[noise] I agree with you judge him before I let you go um that process everyone listening we're speaking with judge Bob planned as he is challenging Senator Sheldon Whitehouse through the Senate seat\nThere's five weeks to go to the election judge a ... this is supposed to be at the very least a fair process a Senate Senator Whitehouse sits on the Senate Judiciary it is obviously to me very clear that this is not\nA situation in a position that he takes seriously because he announced in August that he was going to vote no one cabinet before any type of hearing before you spoke to him they Feinstein Cory Booker Kamala Harris Senator Sheldon Whitehouse they have said plane and clear\nWe will fight and stop any judge that President Trump puts forward judge a plan does they meant it I didn't realize\nAnd maybe I'm naive I didn't know the extent that they would go in order to block that", "city": "Woonsocket"}
