I don't want to do that\nBut this this business it it is hard to argue with that if a vote for ... anything short of that\nThat vote for ... is a vote for a month ago and when he said on friday to the Providence Journal\nThat I don't care if I get to ... percent as long as I help her when and falling lose that is a deal breaker for me but folks this has to be spread around you know I have no Patricia Morgan for Fifteen Years since I knew Patricia Morgan when she ran the Republican Party\nBut this business that she continues this\n[noise] Baghdad Bob attitude that somehow her in ... when the dream team\nAre going to take the election is it's it's it's uncomfortable it's embarrassing and the ... radio station that continue to treat it like it's a big joke and all that sold Joe and let's have him into plays musical instruments and\nArlene violent and George Jones drill oh just like guy endorsed got a helmet I don't find any of it funny I'm losing the humor there because every time ma Ali and every time I lean violet does that that's that means she's endorsing ... [noise] I think Arlene Violet\nThat means she's endorsing Raimondo [laughter]\nI think Arlene violent way is voting for a month ago and she is propping up troll oh to help Raimondo wind that is what I think is going on because otherwise they so much of this equation that makes no sense\nAnd I you know Arlene violent people like that should be held accountable I mean that think about that she voted for Hillary Clinton she's in favor of sanctuary cities she despises President Trump\nAnd yet she is endorsing Joe ... I I didn't know what the deduction other than she wants to see Gina Raimondo get reelected so she endorsed Grillo to try to help them\nAnd then to say something idiotic I think everyone should be on this date everyone should be on the stage oh okay yeah let's get Chris and carry young up there for Christ's sake [laughter] everyone should be on the stage it doesn't work that way for crying out loud no\nRaimondo was asked last night at the debate that I went to\nYou know I this this is how pathetic folks and again good afternoon ... drove show you can call in seven six six Thirteen eighties the number\nFour oh one seven six six Thirteen eighty doing at a comment about Elizabeth Warren that's fine and I I think this is great for Jeff deal because this whole thing with Warner DNA is a disaster\nShe I I'm more of a Native American than she is for Christ's sake I'm more of an Indian that she is\nShe has no Indian blood in her at all zero\nZero one one thousand I mean I I'm part Italian so part Italian which also means that you know that makes me basically that I have African American blood in me if you go way back so I guess I should start checking a box that ah that I've been discriminated against I mean is that where we're at\nRidiculous\nBut she has no business\nElizabeth Warren is a fraud she's a complete fraud she took advantage of pretending to be a Native American and has benefited from it drastically\nAnd this whole thing of her unveiling her DNA is blown up at our face they even got the numbers or any of the Boston Globe either due to corrections that it was wrong\nBut that's what you have to ask yourself I'm going to remove ... from this equation is very simple if you want Gina Raimondo been both for Gina Raimondo I don't\nI don't want to live in a sanctuary state I don't want all these progressive agenda is you know what land justices lay injustices that if you want to live somewhere\nAnd you can't afford to live somewhere that that's discrimination so they have to make a portable housing so they you can live wherever the hell you want to live at Fort land justice is called that's what the progressive swan that's all part of a socialist society\nThat's what they want these people are not even Americans anymore their ideas\nSo she wants to go after guns she's in favor of illegal aliens\nAnd governor among do is going to run for president\nIt's a disgrace I have no interest in land justice so you live on a nice street you save your money you move into a nice neighborhood you work hard and then someone says well I think I should be able to live on your street and you say well you can't afford to live on the street and they say well I Walk lay injustice\nSo they're talking about in certain communities you need more low income housing ... trailer parks you can't discriminate from people do want to live in your town well then God Almighty that I Want land\nJustice of the Hollywood Hills [noise] I Want land\nJustice in in Beverly Hills for Christ's sake [laughter]\nInjustice that's where they're these people are coming to\nAnd let's just say listen there are nice communities let's just say you live in a nice section of Cumberland and someone says oh I Want to live in your section of Cumberland will governor among the progressive say no land justice even though that person only has sixty thousand dollars you can't discriminate\nSo we need to find that person with sixty grand would then we're going to put a trailer deliver on your street 'cause you can't discriminate that's land justice [laughter]\nLost your mind they have lost their mind for crying out loud no way a person that can beat Gina Raimondo is mayor\nFor folks that John ... it is the John ... seven six six Thirteen eighty [noise]\nBut I Need to win this election is said and done for Monroe gets re elected\nHas to be accountability for the ... there are 'cause that's what people are doing\nThey're enabling her to win [noise]\nBut I wanted to enable you [noise]\nTo have a delicious lunch [noise] I'm a bolo enabler\n... da da da da da da and Tuscan grill [noise]\nLocated nine Seventy Douglas Pike route seven fifty a fresh seafood delicious stakes authentic\nItalian food to bolo and remember a tumble a T.
