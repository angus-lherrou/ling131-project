retired US Army General Stanley McChrystal he also has a new book out titled leaders Mitt than reality and I asked him about the president's sending troops to the border\nWherever you use the U.S military there was a practical side of it and then there is a symbolic part of it you know they announce we're sending five thousand troops to the border it almost sounds like we're going to relieve the Alamo we're we're going to defend the that the border lied and if that's what we're going to do and we're going to shoot the migrants when they come\nThen that's one sort of mental picture people

Boston mobster Whitey Bolger killed in West Virginia prison\nHe was eighty nine he had just been moved to hazel too high security boy you can tell a good thing it was a high security prison hate to think what could happen if in fact it was it a high security prison for crying out loud [laughter]\nAfter it came out Bolger and fly me they all said it was BS has nothing to do it but the globe ran with the story that they did in fact he was the two of them working for the FBI that proved to be true\nOr John Connelly of course he's behind bars right now on that whole thing they could not real I'm back in they let them do whatever they wanted\nThey were murdering people and they try to they would pepper things that are the police reports undercover reports that saying the bold you gave them information whether you're not giving them information and they you know could not get\nThe genie back in the bottle so to speak and but in Nineteen Ninety five in the nineties Bolger started to realize that maybe as luck Whitey Bolger was going to run out\nStarted to make a lot of trips and we'd go out of town and hide money and safe deposit boxes under different names and aliases and uh\nAnd then eventually then fully went on the run think about that Nineteen Ninety five to twenty eleventh on the run sixteen years most wanted fugitive and they didn't know where to find him and where was the Santa Monica California\nOr where a lot of retirees are living a very simple life but almost like in a prison cell because then after they got bin Laden he then moved up to number one and felt that that it was just going to be a matter of time before they would find him\nSo but apparently again in case you're just saying why is a\nGiant peach are talking about Whitey Bolger he was apparently murdered last night in a federal correctional facility in West Virginia it is odd they kept moving them around or sometimes they do that to shake people up I Know someone that they felt there was an inmate I'd heard in ...\nYears ago who had information and the FBI felt this person has information so what they do is they say you're going on tour\nAnd so they ship this person to a federal facility in Kentucky\nAnd he's there for a month or two weeks and suddenly five o'clock in the morning guards come bowl put them on a bus than a dozen or he's going and they ship them to a federal prison Arizona family doesn't know where the hell he is he doesn't know where he's going he's there for a month\n... suddenly then he's shipped to a federal prison or Oklahoma or Texas and then the FBI agent goes and sees them now is this something you want to tell me they just keep moving around and you never know where you're going\nAnd you never know if you're gonna be protected or anything like that they are a ruthless when they want a break someone down but Whitey Bolger apparently has met his maker\nAnd has been murdered at the age of eighty nine at a federal prison in West Virginia All right when we come back well\nFolks phone lines are open seven six six Thirteen eighty I Do want to talk about President Trump and I support the president with what he's saying which is we have to stop these anchor babies this chain migration of people coming into the country and it really affects us here in Rhode Island\nIs a it's big business for those people it is there are people that take advantage of that and manipulate that we'll talk about that in the race the elections that are one week from today\nBut I Want to remind you again about our friends that Cain our auto

knowledgeable and I've asked them to call in I Want to get where one week away from the election and he has built infamy me kind enough to do that when I've had time off is a former head of the Republican Party in Rhode Island\nAnd it's the great my key ... finally is the Cayman good afternoon my deal\nJohnny good afternoon to you with that time of the season\nThen Israel one week to go now might I'd like you to you are very objective you followed this stuff\nUm I Want to start off with on the latest poll that channel twelve came out with the been very consistent with their polling but according to the Fleming poll compared with some of these other polls that\nI I don't know they just kind of been all over the map where they show these numbers that don't match up anywhere else but has the poll a Raimondo with forty five thrown at thirty four eleven point lead inter low at nine how does my key you see that one week out from the election\nUh well first off let's talk about ... when when no they're not what they used to be their their reliability plus or minus four and five percent is is nonsense uh [noise] uh the the Trump election two years ago just ended the reliability of polls so\nI think you've got to go with your gut and what you see on the street and what you hear on the street [noise]\nUm and and I I ... I should throw at nine percent and and that frankly compounds me just compounds that anybody\nOr from the Republican side with throw their vote away I mean frankly that's what they're doing I mean Joe maybe a serious candidate has credentials\nA bottom line is you know ten percent is an amazing amount of votes to get and I don't see it happening I see and the and a\nHalf of those votes are going to migrate and frankly I think what they're going to do is they're going to migrate knocked Raimondo they none of ... votes you would think logically go that way so I see I see this plus five\nA movement and into Allen's race which makes it a forty five forty race now I you know and the plus or minus is at that point if we believe the polls are you know it's almost a pickle and I always think elections get tighter than not\nYeah I'm a you know so I I I really uh bought bought John in all honesty I don't feel any ground swell for ... alright Dan objective I don't see it I don't feel it don't taste it I'm not seeing the ads are and you know ads are different than they used to be 'cause nobody watches TV anymore\nIt is a major problem came in it is as much as you you can ... people during the news but as we both to get the news different places or the red Sox obviously had been dominating the patriots dominate it's it's ... to reach people because people don't watch television anymore they don't\nNo no no we've been watch we all watch it on Netflix and they were watching Syria's it's all because we've downloaded it and uh I mean I mean look if you saw the world series ratings ... one of the great series of all time in terms of matchup Dodgers and Red Sox\nRatings around the country down ten percent yeah that's right I mean this is this is a title wave of change\nAnd it's going to change elections um both both locally and nationally um and and you know you can say oh social media by how the hell do you tap into social media now everyone on business it's not it's not easy it's not it's not if\nKnowing the Fleming pool he says the true love is taking all of his votes from ... according to Joe plumbing now he's saying none of the drilling supporters were going to vote for among do\nRight by now they're voting control of their old peeking that nine points if way to believe that ... has is in fact\nSong boaters or they would beep on voters and what's also interesting Mike is forty percent of ... supporters say they may still change their mind between now and election day so what you're saying is\nAdvocates closer push comes to shove they used to be a thing of I Know people would say like dated so and so but\nThen married so and so you know ... there were people they they I remember they said like David Howard dean but then married and voted for John Kerry in the Iowa primary in Iowa is\nThat you know maybe the whole trailer during the month but then when you go in as you say are you really willing to throw away your boat because\nExactly and I mean ... and ... and my God I mean never never have I thought\nThe trailer was going to take a single Democrat vote no no I mean he's a long term hardcore Republican Republican a rap Republican National committee man yeah uh you know hard core conservative I mean that's that's to his credit I mean that's the society comes from absolutely\nOne of these other series biggest allies in the general assembly he was so you know question about it here's what's interesting is he's\nFlanders may have actually been better off if not all the little head seat in the race because I Believe now it makes you sharper\nIt gives you some debate you nail your message down a little bit more I Know some people would feel then you they're beating each other up but there is something to be said for you get some of those\nYou know you get some of the you know the dust off because the first debate with the White House was his first debate compared with you know you have that\nWarm up and you do have that and you go through the process and then you really have to say his were were different in his what my messages and I'm In\nThat situation that I Know at the time Bobby not alone a lot of people felt he had done the right thing and bowed out and didn't have a primary\nBut sometimes I have found the primary can make people sharper and it makes him sharper because the competition there's nothing like real deems situations and that again in a primary race\nOr I'll take your point and go back to Nineteen I think it was Ninety to ... race so Michael Vick was the candidate that was endorsed\nUh the three Democrats at the time were running a primary I don't know if it was ... it was true a flower and maybe I'm In one way back real heavyweights they spent a million dollars each in that primary in Nineteen Ninety two on the Democratic side\nAnd on the Republican we had you know twenty thousand votes\nWhile we have this little primary and Elizabeth Leonard Betty landed I yeah I was\nFrom the car dealership pulled off a big upset of my ... ... you know with like Thirteen thousand votes against twelve thousand votes Betty because and the headlines in the journal the next day three Democrats one of them want I don't even remember which one it was spending a million bucks each and the headline was all about\nThat he wanted upsets Michael Vick yeah the primary and you know and now she didn't do a whole lot with that opportunity I yeah I guess it was someone that won that primary I don't I I Am\nAnd why he was he he was Ninety One Ninety two he lost her birth I work in Ninety four\nYeah but by the the big the big headline ... and to your point you know it's all about getting catching lightning in a bottle yeah and and when you've got a primary you know something comes out and you're strike a chord and and ... and ... now and the other hand you know up probably\nShould've pressed for more more debates and more head on his head and more a specific things where ... his differentiating himself\nFrom uh from White House but as I sit here and my easy chair John God it's easy to say and the point is that the ... the political dynamic has just changed so much and people are so apathetic\nYou looked on the future and go something is going to change yeah and the next election or two\nThat that it's going to become the new norm because right now all of the old traditional stuff including polling\nIs absolutely useless yeah we could wake up and find just could win this thing by four or five points and we're all going to go how does that happen right or it will happen because he's done a lot of ground work and he's been out there pressing the flesh and there's an anti incumbent\nUm mentality that we don't poll you know we don't get it um so I you know I'm not I'm certainly looking at this election and go there's room for big surprises left\nAnd then uh you know we know we know that ah Raimondo for example is working to John the get out the vote\nUnbelievable how do they want to get into that I mean I'd well actually it's never been seen it's unprecedented how many ... people she has out they flexed the muscles a little bit\nWith the primary but just her get out the vote emergency boating mailed balance is something to see that never seemed like they had Morty paid people doing it in may I don't know what the number is now with my own tears so her\nMission is very clear she is trying to get to fifty percent what I think and I'll give you the final word on this is in this last week\nMayor fun to me has to make the argument that then he has been trying to me it has been resonating somewhat a vote ... is a ... if you vote for drill oh you're going to get for ... years of Dina if he can do that they have the final debate Thursday night or\nTry to go into the final weekend with some steam\nUsually undecided from what I've read break eighty percent for the challenger certainly have an opportunity to make this very close but she because of the dynamic a pillow he is in a pretty commanding position right now she just didn't I hate to say if that's true\nWell I I run a gray but I'm going to end with I think this things do come so within three points okay I I I I think you know if she is if ... percent she will not crack forty five okay well not crack forty five mile can can can finally get to forty five\nYeah with look like a grand slam right now Hsu but if it grabs to possible in a lot of true and if they get to have her points and he needs to get five patrolling yeah seven to get to forty to forty two that that's where this is yeah and that\nThat that's his lightning in the bottle and you're right you just gotta it's got a primary I'm not a primary but a debate left and um you know God God willing he's got some money to put on that the last forty eight hours of uh advertising which again nobody watches but\nIt's still going to run them folks he's not print and like you can't and I'm going to be the end of the week 'cause I enjoy talking ... you know they will talk Friday after the debate and we'll go from there\nSounds sounds great John right focused great Mike
