All right so this is like three weeks from election day but I Want to start off with your take\nOn the Providence Journal\nI giving their endorsement to house speaker Nick ... hello ah my thought is the one I don't know why they're even giving an endorsement they don't have to do with everything that it's come out about him of just the way he runs the show\nUh the dictatorship the way that still little line item veto the pa socks\nAttacked the whole fiasco with ... just the very structure of how he runs it a witch nothing is done unless he basically signs off on it and then he against someone like see prior swiping makes a very very convinced\nUpon it and then he asked someone like see price who I think makes a very very convincing argument for beating Matty yellow but the Providence Journal going on in their way to give an endorsement in that race is a I I just for the life of me I don't understand\n[noise] [laughter] well the\nThe manner in which speaker ... runs the general assembly or runs his chamber of the general assembly is not new to him um and if in fact I Would actually go so far as I say he's he's ...\nHe's loosen the rain somewhat I mean he he was on board with for example the master of everything which they mentioned removing a master will ever they mentioned that in the article of editorial\nThat sort of thing the if you follow the uh can block and Rhode Island's on every front and prosperity put out every year or two of us she bowl index which is a index of how often a legislators dealt with the leadership and our chamber it's actually gone in fact you've\nHad fewer ... in the house\nIn the last year or two so\nHe's ... to that extent he's actually ... things up a little bit uh so I you know I I kinda have to admit I I Am a little bit torn on this one it is it is not just a I mean I I like street fires I've known for a long time and I it'd be great is representative\nBut the speakership is a a ... that's the problem of its own is that it's so important for this one district who gets elected\nVery worrisome because it didn't raise any negative about the Senate just they're all on board with his his partisanship is left as them all the he's he's their guy and I worry that too many people in Rhode Island think that the same way\nWhich means we need a longer term we need to over the long term begin to persuade them or a candidate like like judge Flanders\nHas to spend more time over a couple of years finding new audiences and persuading people\nThat either White Houses wrong or that they share the same views or something I so I I don't know how much Walsh movement there can be right now but I I I think Leonard has been doing well as far as as far as that goes\nYou know what's interesting about that is is that there were a couple of things that came up I think um and again folks were talking about the Senate race I Do see a lot of Flanders signs no question about that\nA that was the window of opportunity during the Kavanaugh hearings when White House was really on his heels what that embarrassing element made national news was carried on Saturday Night live in a South Park them out of the year book questioning\nAnd and judge Flanders who's kind of has raised I think some weaknesses such as this is a guy that talks nonstop about global warming\nAnd climate change but then when it comes to the situation was ... he doesn't weighed in and has no opinion so we he he'll talk for hours on end which is on in the Senate chamber to an empty something chamber of global warming climate change but then when there's actually a situation with the ... power plant in his own backyard he he won't talk about it\nThe other thing is that ad that he is running right now and Saturday Night Flanders did call him out for it and I think it could have been harder I think the media should have joined more attention to it I think the plan is people should do a press conference about it Sheldon Whitehouse you see him this ad\nWe as a group of and you've probably seen the seniors and he is he is lying to them he is saying\nPresident Trump is going to take away your Social Security and Medicaid and you need me down there to fight that to stop and\nYou and I both know that is that it's a lie is a complete exaggeration is part of a bill of which things could just be watered down a little bit and there is a sitting senator\nTelling these group of elderly\nPresident Trump is going to take away your Social Security and Medicare coverage and I just that is an absolute blatant lie that he's running in that commercial ...\nOh yeah and I mean that's a pretty standard strategy although it's gotten even more of noxious this time around they they keep the spark for all this I was recently or the Senate the leader of the Senate and Congress Mitch McConnell\nSaying essentially he said almost the opposite he's had a ... Republicans maintain control of Congress we will not be able to reform Medicare Medicaid Social security so in other words\nIf Republicans get in we will not do this and it's been spun throughout the news media and among Democrats politicians as saying we will we will go after this but you know this is something we've seen forever the classics is leaning move for example to of course he always used to just from what I understand that show up at\nThe old ... a big uh and Warren ... make the threats in person yeah um but yeah that it's a pretty standard um and it is it really is actually\nA problem because these these programs do need reform and if anybody's going to perform at ... at this point is going to attribute Republican so there's there's this awkward position where they are responding kind of have to hide the responsible position because the opposition is going to take any\nTo hide the responsible position because the opposition is going to take any kind of any kind of suggestion that we need to make changes and run with that as a house on fire threat I'm like I thought I thought judgment has been handling that well I just wish we had news media that would\nBe better informed people about ya ... of these things and that's a that's where another again another the big systemic problems we have especially in Rhode Island we just need people to have access\nTo more of this kind of information so that\n... scrupulous a unscrupulous politicians cat leverage this to make people frightened that if they vote for the better candidate they might end up losing thousands of dollars a month out of their Social Security checks or something like that\nYou know that that brings up a very good point and also there was the attitude in the journal editorial in these others of\nBoy you know we need Sheldon more than ever to to be down there to stop us from Trump he it's just it's such an attitude and it's so short sighted that he's really not working with anyone he was listed in has been listed as one of the most\n... are you know ... they use the word most part is an item I convinced that everyone knows exactly what that word means but to me he is not down they're serving the people of Rhode Island he is down they're representing the interests of dying Feinstein and Chuck Schumer and he basically is an attack dog\nFor the Republican Party and what ever the Republican senators put forward she is there to attack in the end of the journal editorial finally they almost seem to be commended for that as opposed to [noise]\nAnd I agree with judge planned this box planets Rhode Island has always been best served when we've had a Republican senator down there in a Democrat Senator down there\nAnd this does not think he does nothing more than the outside looking in President Trump isn't going anywhere the Senate's going to be controlled by the Republicans boy it'd be nice to have someone with a seat at the table instead of just on the outside looking in\nOh absolutely I mean the editorial I Believe it ended on the note almost as a an added benefit to keeping my doubts that he brings it gets money from the federal government for an eye on well any senators going to be doing that and if you have a split delegation are especially when that split means adding somebody who's\nPart of the party that's in control of the Republicans at this time\nThat only going to increase that kind of access to resources as opposed to when your entire delegation as a heated up opposition to the party in power and so when you get the\nThe whether you think he was doing his job or not when you get White House going after judge Kavanaugh about you know don't turn ... in his high school yearbook\nThat doesn't play well with the explosion power which is the one who controls what sorts of resources the road on an access and you would hope it wouldn't play that much but we know it does and it certainly wouldn't hurt to have a a senator from that party\nAre going after that money so that was I I always think that the kind of a disingenuous talking point for these politicians as if every senator isn't going to go down there and tried to get as much for the state as they pass right on\nYeah no I agree with that ... what is the John defeat your show speak with managing editor for ocean stay current ... just the cats Justin let's talk about the governor's race um\nLast week obviously a well the past two weeks ... his you know there's no other way to look at it he's been a distraction I think the debate it your rye we had some glimpse of what it could be like\nBecause I gave the and honest and and the folks the Providence Journal credit they did it at least have\nMayor ... next to each other while they were next to each other\nWe got some sense of just what it would be like which I think it should just at this point be the final two\nOn the monitor party guy do not add anything trauma was again just kind of distraction not as much as a distraction there were protesters there in that police report he used the N. word and so there were protesters they yelling racist ... which again if you're going to you know you don't hear the governor condemn him for that or anything like that\nBut last week trauma had to press conferences to in both of them\nBasically we're still aimed at taking votes away from their phone now he had the first one in front of the prison and he criticized governor ... policy but to me as much as he's he's not really criticizing governor among do because no one if you're supporting governor among do\nYou agree with her position on nice in in ... you'll never voting patrol on one thing that the joke plumbing polls that showed is true that was not pulling any voters from governor Gina Raimondo any initially said why I'm going to get democratic voters to one isn't shown that\nThat's number one number two the press conference on friday which was even more embarrassing feet should that spent addict is and\nAnd what did they do you know traditional his entire time of the general assembly spin spoke out against the unions and suddenly now executive order is going to restore the coal is well\nAgain you're you're not the people that hate Raimondo\nBecause they called it was taken away\nThey're not voting for her so all you're doing is taking away disgruntled former teachers state employees that would have been inclined to vote for fun and then the same thing with ice\nYou you maybe if you agree with ... you would not voting for Rwanda now you're going to vote for him again both press conferences as much as they seem aimed at Romano\nThey're really aimed at the people that were never voting for Monday when the first place but they might have been inclined does film I vote for ...\nYeah well that's the takeaway I had as well I mean it was the the pension one at a picture of a of the conference with him next to Spencer Dickens and who ran for the Democratic nomination up you know kind of a long shot campaign and sometimes there's going to help the show\nYeah in one last thought on this is the difference is you know Matt Brown initially announced unknown to the ... people that he you know be caught them off guard when he announced he was running as an independent in the way it was explained to me is there were some very influential people that have helped him\nAnd certainly made offers to help him in the future and they weren't going to discourage him from running\nBut we're basically brought him onto the tent a flood noticing you can't run but at the very least you have to run in the Democratic party and they were successful and they did convince some\nWhat I have heard is there had been efforts to try to have reasonable conversations in the past that's what I've been told\n'em with both ... and\nThey just from what I was told again I wasn't there that they just\nOn reasonable people deal with and they just couldn't get anywhere and they just seem to be other\nUnderlying motivations if you will there and if you have someone that has\nA motivation that they're not sharing with you then it doesn't matter what it is that you're proposing you know I'm so anyhow with that we're going to leave the folks he is again managing editor for oh should stay current dot com the great just the cats just great and we'll talk to you
