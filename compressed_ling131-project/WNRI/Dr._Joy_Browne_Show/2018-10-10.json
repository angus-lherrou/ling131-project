illustrated by for the White House's pick on me this race and so it does raise the country\nOr so or as a nice little stores Washington didn't want to continue I shouldn't say Washington or what do

that is the thing that people have to understand is with having two senators down there with White House in with Jack Reed we are absolutely on the outside looking in\nSo but Senator Whitehouse tonight on South Park they do a parody of him\nHe was a parody on Saturday Night live and he is still sticking by that he thinks everything he did was in line and more importantly he thinks the people of Rhode Island are behind them\nAnd I disagree with that [noise] seven six six okay a\n\n... me find this Tim white is now a putting something out\nA\n\nSalt and then we see Tim white on Twitter a cart court archive shows this century print assault charge against\nAnd white on Twitter a cart court archive shows this century for an assault charge against jokes are low which states he was found not guilty of trial Charles said he pled no contest to assault spokesperson says this is the same case just in recall exact outcome it's a huge difference\nBoat\nShrill oh put out a statement saying he pled no contest so now there's a discrepancy was it no contest or not guilty so Troy low assaulting Matty yellow apparently\nUh\nLet's see shrill oh another stayed out incident a former state rep poked him in the eye ... open handily slapped him four or five times\nI don't understand what that means I'm ...\nThat's unusual so we're getting a pattern now\n[noise] uh\nLet's say\nWell we're going to vote I I think now is that we could end up having more people come forward regarding or people that have had incidences with um [noise] he poked him in the eyes and so\n... and slapped him [laughter]\nThat's the first time hearing this so now there's more that it's coming out so now we're going to have maybe all these people coming forward with stories\nThat are somehow they have been either salt in some way or been in some kind of an altercation with Joe ... I don't know\nSo it is a never ending but I think it is interesting folks um what this is going to come down to a couple of things similar one the polls continue to show a huge discrepancy where Joe ... who is in this race for governor\nIn you know does that affect your vote I did post that on Facebook by the way of my Facebook page let me just check some of the comments\nRegarding I did post would this affect your vote the fact that it has now come out the trailer was apparently thirty four years old and beat up good afternoon by the way everybody on Facebook Live a ... a poke vending now apparently it would seem that way um\nFlanders as a man that's right ah yeah I'm not a fan of I'm\nNot a fan of center the White House I think we could do better folks but let me uh let's see drill a part of the state many does not mentioned that he was arrested he just put that it did happen\nAnd then I posted a would this affect your vote the fact that true low was thirty four and was arrested for assault of a teenager [noise]\nUm let's say he seems like he's a little off writes Bob uh David writes touched by kids and you're going to be walking with a permanent hobble he's smiling about\nThis um [noise]\nDavid says swallow some pride drop out you know the state needs to change both of you said over and over again ... is the only one has a chance to beat Gina Edward troll and Morgan made a pact with the Jane of double and we're going to pay for it I'm neither had enough Republican\nWhich happens to be the speaker that's right you are not Eunice right you're not gonna when you're splitting the boat and making it easier for Raimondo\nVirginia right stop the ... the media is going too far to listen anymore\nI'm no more credibility Scott to be drink beer in high school ... this is different when you're ... it's not that he was in high school he was thirty four years old and a salted or a twelve year old\nAnd this is the second time or going to be involved and screwing up an election thanks to her Matty yellow is still the speaker that is true if it were not for her fry is probably would have wanted to be mad at yellow\nA carry writes please drop out Joe I don't know if that's going to happen then it's the story of a he was involved with some kind of out of a dispute at the east ... you're going to be hearing about that\nUm [noise]\nLet's see he needs to lead the rice ... writes Laurie only splitting the conservative vote making hotter ... do you know there are people do out there folks that are that do believe that President Trump is going to somehow come endured island indoor rally for Joe ... and so\nI I I don't know what to say to people that believe that um ah\nI I just ... all the only thing I'm going to say about that actually is if if the people that think that would kindly point to me just one other example where President Trump\nHas gone to another state to endorse into a rally for an independent candidate in other words someone who was left the party they answer is not so right now in the latest polls Joe ... is either at six percent or seven percent\nIn so according to the ... people President Trump with everything going on and Washington Nikki Haley's left the un he's got the mid term elections he has uh the whole situation now is over obviously justice capital made it the Supreme Court\nBut he has all these different things percolating and he's going to come into Rhode Island for a guy that left the Republican Party and has either six or seven percent of the vote depending on which poll you're talking about\nI again I'll I'll believe it when I see it but I can tell you that apparently some of the ... supporters they really believe that\nBecause one of them was telling me no other reason I Am giving out signs in aboard the campaign is I Want to meet President Trump\nAnd I think that's great but I think you also need to look at the calendar\nWere Blumenthal of Connecticut he's white there with ... Harris he does justice Kavanaugh an apology but Sheldon Whitehouse is so jealous because Sheldon Whitehouse he fancy themselves that he'd be on the Supreme Court that's what this Israeli about\nDuring the Obama years White House has flowed out as maybe someday he'd be on the Supreme Court he is so jealous said Brett Kavanaugh\nThat should have been brought out what does that mean when we get the gas pedals back we're going to a peach Kavanaugh should have been asked about it have Sheldon who was the reporter that you gave that big story too terrible alright folks let's talk about cell phones let's talk\nTo our friends Sal and metro PCS good afternoon Sal\n... where you are draining good afternoon\nHere I Am go right ahead boy what a big win for the red Sox last night I feel the Yankee fans on their phones they couldn't believe all regained when right down to the end no question about you have a I mean I Know that\nBy the Yankees and so I'm a little depressed today so I'm not feeling so good but it ahead or that but we have I have no late breaking news a new scripted new new news out there for what metro PCS but I'm not sure if you've heard the news because right out metro PCS is now going by metro buy T Mobile\nNow a new play we got to have a high speed data all month long on top of that she's not sure why she was on the team oh we'll networks are going to have access to the most advanced lp network in the United states so when you're ...\nYou're going to enjoy a high speed data all month long on the mobile networks so it's just kind of similar something similar with with natural by the mobile kind of similar Dunkin' Donuts is doing a drop in the dorms when now known as metro by to mobile so\nYou're gonna enjoy the high speed data all month long and ready for this on if you have\nThe sixty dollar plan you're gonna get Amazon Prime included in that sixty dollar plan for free you're not going to have to pay extra for\n... think about all the benefits of Amazon Time that we talk about all the time if you have the sixty dollar plan with metro icy mobile you will have the unlimited access to Amazon the shopping the ...\nThe movie watching the music listening all the stuff that we talk about all the time with Amazon that's going to be included in the ... plan\nWhen you come on board with natural ... mobile so we are now known as the metro by the mobile and we have great offers like I just ... with the Amazon Prime included in the sixty dollar plan that would normally cost you a hundred dollars a year a hundred and twenty eight year is now going to have clothes in the ...\nI Believe ... plants so at some point we're going to get your switch over as well because you'll get the Amazon Prime\nDamn right when I went through many are now not\nThat's right Amazon ... included in the sixty dollar plan\nBy veteran of what's metro might seem oh so this is some great who is going into the holiday season you know we're we're changing our name was still going to the natural but what just changing metro by the mobile we've found that the mobile network for last six years and now there's kind of given up ran refreshed again similar to the Dunkin' Donuts situation with a drop in the building so but the big push right now\nAmazon free with a sixty dollar plan when you sign up with natural buy T Mobile\nHow that is absolutely fantastic now is the time to take advantage of it and how can people let's go to the fore patients that people can stop in", "station": "WNRI", "city": "Woonsocket"}
