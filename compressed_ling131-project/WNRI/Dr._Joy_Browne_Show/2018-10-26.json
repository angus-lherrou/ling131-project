A. G. A. bomb or ... for a make America great again\nGrandmother filed domestic violence charges against him in Nineteen Ninety four and his lengthy wrap sheet includes arrest for drug possession grand theft and making a bomb threat\nSo he immediately as soon as they at Florida they probably had him in a file somewhere\nShe put a restraining order I'm All right I mean if somebody has the grandmother filed a restraining order against them that's usually not a good sign he was picked up in two thousand two for making a bomb threat so someone like that certainly goes on the radar\nOf like where is someone like that and then they're able to track them down they've been watching them for the past twenty four hours from what I understand\n[noise] um I was reading last night though so Megan Kelly is now officially gone she's not returning it's all just a matter\nOf how much a\nMoney let me see let's see uh media organizations reporter range of salaries ranging from Fifteen to twenty five million source who are viewed her contract tells me it's twenty six million here for three years total Seventy eight million but I was reading about the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski last last night\nAnd when we spoke with our legal expert Tim died yesterday\nIt it's such a a difference between the two of them of the Unabomber and then also of this individual that they ended up catching today now if you missed earlier we did speak with this man that worked with Joe ... below\nWe will have that up on the website WN awry later and it will be pod cast in the meantime seven six six Thirteen eighty seven six six Thirteen eighty here's the good news on this Friday in case you're just putting on the radio the good news is none of these devices detonated and the person behind them\nApparently is in custody was acting alone that is the good news and then they can be all this other stuff about you know the president's rhetoric ramp them up and everything else that you're going to hear [noise] All right let's\nGo to the phones good afternoon you're on the ... show hello\nHi this is Russell from Johnston how you doing ...\nI'd like to add something to the conversation remember a thirty some odd years ago when Ronald Reagan was shot by someone who said that he did it because she admired Jodie Foster yes yes I Do\nKnow that was a terrible but we didn't know and if if someone would suggest well we should going Jodie Foster for that that would have been removed ridiculous okay and I think that's the same principle applies here you know\nThat is an excellent point and you did have there were two very very high prime profile shootings first one that was John Hinckley\nThat had done that and then on the other one was if it was ... Chapman the shot and killed John Lennon but you're right it was simply that shot President Reagan and he was doing it to try to impress Jodi foster\nRight so we didn't going Jodie Foster which would have been ridiculous and I think the same principle applies here what are you\n[noise] you know that is a very very good point I agree with that and you know this one case that suddenly carries\nThis over the line and starts sending out all these things of this nature so that's an excellent point Russell thank you for the call folks seven six six Thirteen eighty\nSeven six six Thirteen eight and you can email me John at ... dot com [noise] but I was reading as investigators hunter the culprit behind the explosive devices they um go back to the most prolific bomber the notorious Unabomber\nWho's methodical in his tax went nearly Twenty years without being captured\nThink of this the first device by the Unabomber later revealed to be Ted Kaczynski\nWas primitive homemade exploded at a Chicago University in Nineteen Seventy eight [noise]\nHis bombs as Tim dad said yesterday then became increasingly sophisticated as the males are hand delivered them to random victims\nHe even threatened to bomb planes the FBI formed a task force to investigate the terrifying mystery in Nineteen Seventy nine and they called it the unit bomb you and a B O M which stood for university an airline bombing targets so you a bomb\nHis sixteen bombs Ted Kaczynski the Unabomber\nKilled three people\nInjured two dozen others until his arrest in Nineteen Ninety six\nKaczynski was sold methodical said former FBI agent ABC News contributor of interviewed him before Brad Garrett he was able to build his bombs without leaving any trace of being a here's our fibers he wore gloves\nAnd even vacuum the bombs to eliminate the possibility you could find a trace him on the packaging\nMany of Kaczynski the Unabomber now many of us bonds or handcrafted out of wood\nWell not as powerful as a metal pipe\nThat made his device more difficult to trace since they were homemade instead of purchased he even tried to mislead investigated by writing initials that had no connection himself inside his creations\nThe bombs Kaczynski sent through the mail intricate trip wire types which are not easy to build he was so prolific set an ABC News contributor former FBI agent because when he put bombs in the mail they didn't\nYeah I imagine because when he put bombs in the mail they didn't explode while going through the delivery process the bomb would only go off once the victim open the envelope\nA truly amazing in the eyes of the bomb tech community was very very sophisticated which is why he's viewed as the most prolific bomber in America and that is Ted Kaczynski better known as the Unabomber\nAgain folks seven six six Thirteen eighty his patients in diversity and targets also helped him of aid capture\nKaczynski attack could be months sometimes years apart\nInstilling fear all over again once the News New explosion hit he didn't get in the world and the rush or letters ego getting away and Wally focused on academics research and technology he perceived technology to be the downfall of civilization\nHe had no one specific target he thought modern technology industry where basically destroying society and taking away personal freedoms\nPeople like him there actually paranoid delusional\nYears went by without a solid lead until Nineteen Ninety five when the Unabomber or at least a thirty five thousand word manifesto\nInvestigators worried about giving into his demands but all of me ultimately decided to publish it hoping someone could named the writer David Kaczynski men came forward giving authorities letters written by his brother Ted Kaczynski\nFBI analyst found the writer behind the manifesto on the individual wrote those letters are almost certainly the same\nInvestigators also learn to grow up in Chicago where the first bomb\nWas taught at the University of California Berkeley where two devices were left and he lived in Salt lake which was also a target by that point Kaczynski was living as a recluse in a small cabin in Montana when he was arrested in April of Ninety six\nHis nearest neighbor lived three hundred yards from the cabin and there is the cabin where the Unabomber lift so bizarre he was totally off the grid\nHe was on nobody's radar\nMoved out into a desolate area a live bomb wealth a bomb components were found that the cabin as well as forty thousand had written journal pages that included bomb making experiments and descriptions of Unabomber crimes he pled guilty in January of Nineteen Ninety eight central Colorado prison the manifesto was his undoing\nWithout that manifesto had they not published that\nThey never would have caught him\nNever he had never been arrested no one knew where the hell he was in any way I think about that but today fortunately thanks to law enforcement and the FBI they did capture this dirt bag and Florida seven six six Thirteen eighty\nOr good afternoon you're next on the John ... show hello\nHello Hi John I'm like this quick um what one thing that bothers me is if you look at some of the packages that were up for the north of Florida right the postage stamps for\nThat\n... please repeat that
