I mean it showed them\nThere was one organization that was looking to maybe bring her in some capacity and uh they withdrew it because the job because of her\nNot supporting ... Fong and and not instead go along with ... so I think there is going to be some fall out and even you know Arlene violent the rights of the valley brief she is now stayed away from even writing about the governor's race and\nI don't know if she's now having second thoughts about throwing her name in with the whole thing because the whole thing is kind of exploded but in the final week so the poll is tonight the final debate is going to be Thursday night\nAnd then election day next Tuesday\nThe final element of this campaign Justin seems to be Raimondo\nThe bombing campaign has just been about the Cranston police report and you know showing ... wearing a Trump pat\nAnd creates Maryland phone has been rolling out different things whether it was with the C. Y. F. or one of the ... with you hip or the fact that they arrested her the legal and then they cooperated with ice um he has been very steady and getting his message out and changing commercials um\nI I just think it's going to come down to at the very end after this poll and Thursday night what could affect is is if\nPeople in the final moment be a little bit of a trailer we about is wasted and go with fun I I think that is the only path to victory for ... what do you think\nI think that's that's probably correct I mean we might have had all that money to just keep pouring into\nAnd and and mailers and all the PR people who are getting store is across the country are you talking about what she's done 'em and then you've got the Providence Journal which at this point whether endorsement seems to be pretty comfortable with exactly where Rhode Island is\nA politically and economically so\nThat it's hard to overcome that and Allen phone to his credit has been it seems as they try to do kind of old more old fashioned politics have plenty out problems with the current administration suggesting things held do and you've got\nAs wild card and our of shallow and so far it's been pretty clear that show up as the margin here and a lot of Rhode islanders aren't going to be fooled by the ads but if a photo far uh with ... you know self burnish sharing\nA than the the effect could be the end of it\nYeah and she um last known in that you know I was saying earlier prior to talking to you but if it had just been the two of them this would have been a very different race we would've seen polls with the two of them tied we may have seen a poll with mayor Fung ahead of her\nA which then that certainly has more money flying in to his campaign both locally and nationally and it would have ... to go out or maybe take some chances every time you take chances has a chance you can make a mistake and Harris can happen\nSo that there is definitely um some different scenarios that it would have been a very different race and you can't argue that since the primary ended\nThat be affected by the truckload disruption and distraction it is certainly had an impact on the race\nAnd it has benefited governor ... because she's just kind of been able to stay on message stay in the bunker you she don't see her she doesn't do any campaign events other than just jobs official jobs with being governor and and that's it I Want to move on Justin any feel on the race the speaker Steve Price I thought he's done some very good mailers it's\nTough to tell 'em what's gonna happen in that district they did debate on that one debate on newsmakers on channel ... price did very well Matty yellow was been touting you\nThe debate on newsmakers on channel ... price did very well Matty yellow has been touting you got the endorsement from the Providence Journal on that that is a tough race to call I think there's going to be more eyes on it because of you know we would learn the the mail ballot fiasco I also think you know last time\nThere were a lot of Trump supporters that came out the world so then voting for him at a yellow and you know you're not going to have them this time around because it's an presidential year\nAny thoughts on the um the the speaker's race in ...\nWell the speaker's office is pretty powerful on as as people will note he's brought on more and and legislative grants and any other uh legislator and that does have an effect\nAnd then this you got this weird dynamic of progressive and Republicans going out there to speak or in a relatively Republican district so it is it is kind of a tough one to call although you know ... has done a lot of\nUh like the car tax thing and a short is trying to shore up his right flank after is near last last time to see if I as a witch if if you want to take a positive lesson from the whole thing this is a good reason to have people running for office and challenging incumbents because then they actually do what people\nWould want them to do so I I mean that's a positive take\nOtherwise I don't I'm not sure which way to call it I my feeling is that Mary Elle has done it up in the past couple of years just to shore up where he was weak and I'll probably get over the line and this one\nYou do think he's going to end up winning that that this election\nI I think so I mean I I I ... I Know Steve fries and I very much like him and of course politically a much more in line with him um but I think\nUh just I don't I don't have that same feeling of of rebellion and I think a lot of people have taken that called art look a lot of people who might have voted for Steve fries would have been people who want to say the ... to get the taxpayer are backing for their new stadium so they're going to look at this and say you know what\nNATO has stood in a way of a lot of the progressive initiatives so as the progressive they're out there trying to attack mellow a lot of people who might have dropped out of you know gone and the other direction gone for the fries\nAre being actually reminded of that NATO has been kind of a brick wall somebody's things that we discussed before whether that's his own ... you know kind of corrupt motivation or not but that's I think what's going to stick and voters had so I think it'll be I think I was at a state girls stay and our\nYou know it's interesting er and again folks would speak with Justin cats managing editor for ocean stay current dot com on this political Monday Justin what's also interesting about this as you look at\nSomeone was asking me how come I'm not seeing more debates on television well\nYou look at the governor's race and as much as governor among do she did the channel twelve live one that was Roger Williams the second debate did she agreed to do\nWas not seen a it was live streamed and you are right and that was a ... two weeks ago on a Monday Night that was live streamed through the Providence Journal in Rhode Island public radio\nShe is going to take part in the channel tend to be this Thursday night or an island college that will feature the moderate party candidate Joe ... Maryland song and then do you normally do but the lieutenant governor race that poll Pence I I haven't seen any campaigning from him\nAs far as the general treasure I'm going to skip over the whole Mike Riley thing that I didn't he uh he ran against congressman ranch in several years ago he he was never as easy as he thought it was going to be\nThe Ninety last he got up and gave a very memorable speech at the Mary I might have caught a bad job of been over ... gave this thing of I wasted my money I should've given it to my kids\nThis whole big thing you suddenly\nEmerges and goes on the candidate to run as general treasure about\nSeem to be haphazard approach even you know said I'm a couple of weeks ago don't even bother giving money I'm not going to win this race\nOr so there was no debate with with general treasure there's been no debate with the AMA key in lieutenant governor Pence uh the one Republican before we get into the Senate who who has been in fact trying to engage and only go ... is ...\nThat was a story in the front page of the paper on Saturday he's on the front page today I think he's raised a very valid issue my God with not only going to be ... and just in your someone that follows politics people don't realize we get all these endless ridiculous basically useless press releases over the most\nUm you know mundane things and she seemed really changes something and then the office and doesn't see a peep about it until the journal gets gets into it and then attorney general to Rona is running uncontested so I say might offices\nA gene is not I'm not going to count that guy running against Rona on obviously Riley is not engaged with the general treasure the beat the lieutenant governor\nHas not mounted a big thing like that and then I Do go back several years ago when ... house ran against smallest and then eating Catherine Taylor there was more involved with lieutenant governor race and then quarter lesser\nDid have a forum on ... on a state of the state but no one will be will give him more of a let's say why for him I think she's turned down doing anything like newsmakers or anything else\nAnd then on the ... the uh the Democrat side I Know that was a debate with ... but\nHis challenger again kind\nOf going through the motions nothing against them and then you have ... been challenger who does send out some press releases but I Am on aware of any debate between the two of them were getting in to the Senate race but this is part of the problem\nOf one party rule is the incumbents who I'm going to be Democrats feel no need to debate the Republican challenger\nRight and part of the challenge to exit the local news media isn't quite as\nAs energetic as seems and trying to make these things happen and give competitors microphone or some of that much of the market I Know even on a really a local local races interpreted for example\nThe new ... LA news used to do a film debate of every race and that under their coverage area they don't do that anymore probably 'cause there's just no audience people are paying that much attention to newspapers so we're we're entering a a dangerous phase here I think with where a lot of different angles forces are making\nLet me go back to before I let you go and again folks that Justin cats managing at ... dot com [noise] couple of different questions similar one how do you think turnout is going to be next Tuesday we already have the emergency boating so people are already voting in his presidential year um [noise]\nMost of the time that means turnout is down we're going to have to wait and see but\nI'm going to say this I Am seeing a lot of Flanders science\nI'm anxious to see in this actually been three polls that was the um don't vote people then there was the Rhode Island public radio that pulled excuse me that the punk people saying lean too heavily Democrat and then not we're going to find out that you'll Fleming pulled tonight [noise]\nI I Am seeing a lot of slander signs it's it's tough because Sheldon has partnered himself with remained out by\nI'm going to be curious to see just how that comes out because they're definitely has been more people being outspoken for Bob Flanders certainly than there was six years ago when Barry Hinckley ran against against Sheldon Whitehouse\n\nWrote turnout I'm pretty consistent I mean you get about but I I Know certainly locally sixty percent turnout on a a presidential year forty to fifty percent on a non presidential here so it is a big drop the one place\nThat that did better in a non presidential year was it was the off year election when President Bush was was an office\nAnd also we our governor was a Republican so that probably\nBoth of those gave incentive to Democrats and people on the left to go out and vote\n'em there's a lot of incentive do on the right especially after the Kavanaugh hearings I I think a lot of people and in Rhode Island\nPolitically underwrite are are dissatisfied with very Mondo and and probably maybe ironically the battle with ... either either supporting him are opposing him um and not liking what he said we're going to have another year of a third party candidate a probably helping to elect a governor\nA that might motivate a lot of people on the right to go vote\nSo it it's gonna it's gonna be interesting to see um I I'm not going to hazard a production of oh I agree and\nBefore I let you go on give me just your thought any race around the country that you think is worth watching the Texas Senate race has been incredible with the amount of spending on Ted Cruz and beat Iraq\nAnd then uh there are some other that Arizona Rhode Island or mathematics Sally she's in a very very tight race in Arizona right now the Florida Senate race is too cold too close to call the Florida governor's race is very very tight and um any other race that catches your eye or just in general or even Rhode Island you're going to be curious to watch\n[noise] ... well ... as a\nAs a foreign bread Jersey Boy I'm keeping an eye on New Jersey also I'm curious how just how corrupt and a Democrat can be in for a New Jersey and and still win a ... that's one area I'm a I'm curious about mostly I'm I'm just I think a lot of us are just going to be watching the whole\nThe whole landscape and hoping something turns out okay I mean we we have at every level if he if you're paying attention you have your local level the state level and the national level we're not in\nWhat might have one's been termed ordinary times and so you hope things don't go too crazy across the board a but it's been it's been such a bizarre a couple of years\nIt's just impossible to tell so I think I'm looking more at the total count rather than any particular race and see whether the Republicans keep the Congress and the Senate\nA and whether funk it overcome or in the general ... said house and whether whether one surprise or another comes forward or you know it's probably more stress than I can take at this\nPoint [laughter] gee is the managing Aaron ... should say current dot com we're going to talk to them next Monday one day before on the ... election eve it's just it's just an excellent as always we'll talk to again thanks to the court to\nFolks theory as Justin cats right here on the John ... Rochelle alright seven six six Thirteen eighty seven six six Thirteen eighty I don't know how things are going to uh\nTo swing next Tuesday and even nationwide and we're going to have to wait and see a that is a big question I was at an event yesterday and people were asking me about the um you know who do you think are the Dems going to take the house or the Republicans seemingly are certainly going to hold on to the Senate\nAnd I think this is going to be I Believe\nThis is going to be another election\nThat as much as the progressives make a lot of noise\nAs much as they make a lot of noise the progressives I still rely on the silent majority and I've already seen one of the red Sox players has already said he can't wait we uh pull a pool was he can't wait to go to the White House\nTo celebrate with President Trump\nA heat temporary I Can't wait for the red Sox White House visit\nSo and that's a obviously a as you can imagine I'm playing on a plane on on Twitter a lot so folks good afternoon it's John ... it is the John ... days\nFrom now until two o'clock if you'd like to phone lines are open seven six six Thirteen eighty seven six six Thirteen eighty I think as much as the media is against the president as much as they are trying to tie him in\nWith ... everything negative that happens I think in many ways the media has overplay their hand\nNow what happened with that ... case in ... Florida on friday um yes he was he was a big Trump supporter\nBut the the but the same way with that man that shot the congressman was a Bernie Sanders supporter so I agree with them where they're trying to pin everything on him by the way good afternoon\nIt's a crust of Iran there's that came in my cue checking and we'll talk to the ... ... let's talk tomorrow good afternoon to everybody on Facebook Live brought to buy elite wireless R. I. dot com elite wireless alright I'll come uh I don't know\nElite wireless R. I. dot com elite wireless alright I'll come uh I don't know we're gonna have to wait and see but this is a big week coming up at five o'clock will be\nThe latest poll from channel twelve and folks this is gonna come down to in the next week next eight days the election is next Tuesday even though some people have already voted\nAnd that is going to be when push comes to shove\nIf people say I'm going to go with Joe ... with the protest vote or if they go with mayor ... those are the options so mayor Fung has been saying a vote for ... is a vote for governor among do and it's tough to get away from that\nIt is definitely tough to get away from that I think\nThe ... do people there they are not fully confident they are massive get out the vote you know she has a different set of priority she is trying to get to fifty percent that's what her goal is she feels that would send a strong message she feels government don't feels the election basically is in the back\nShe feels that Joe ... has served its purpose regardless of the motivation maybe he thought he was going to win maybe thought he could mount a campaign to win but there were among do people feel very very confident\nBut the question and we've seen this before at the last minute momentum can shift and that's what people need to realize and you need to tell this to your friends and family and everyone that's going to vote there was no candidate that is perfect\nThere was never a perfect candidate you have to decide do you want four more years of governor among do and if you do then vote for her there are she does have voters obviously she does have supporters\nOr do you want her you can eat a vote for her you can vote for Joe ... but you can't say I don't want Raimondo there from both patrol\nSo and again I I've given Joe more than a fair shake on this show\nBut at this point with the male is that have gone out that is so complimentary to him\nFrom paid for by the Democratic committee I mean give me a break I'll I'll I'll even say this it it's even reached a point where I think it's insulting like I Do they really think with that stupid they think with that stupid that we all would fall for that\nBoy there were ... people they above and the Democrat Party they have a very very low opinion of you and the people at the state there's no question about it seven six six\nThirteen eighty good afternoon you're next on the John ... show hello Richard ...\nOkay if I got to read or under harder my daughter to go to Florida on another matter ... over the place and you know I Can't change our lives but my daughter for there to\nTalk about it because of our Georgia for a paper or there there are in a theater for language\nThat a fight over there\nAnd where was this again proud of you know but we're in Providence prominence is a big city\nRight in the car for God at Cornell\nWon headquarters\nOr headquarters tore for", "station": "WNRI", "city": "Woonsocket"}
