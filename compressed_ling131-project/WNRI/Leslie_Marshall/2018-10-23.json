you are playing that are some audio from night storm what a great story [noise] it's amazing I had a question\nBelieve we have the technology for financial institutions to prevent personal funds from being transferred to the United states to Mexico Honduras Guatemala and I'm Wondering if that doesn't make\nSense of the logical or at least a part of a logical answer to the immigration problem we're happy\nTo stop the remittances from here to Mexico Mexico Honduras Guatemala\nI I Would imagine we do have the technology to do it the question is whether or not or would be effective are these people are already here are and the question is what do we do to prevent more illegal alien from coming here and that's what the president's trying to do or if he\nSomehow try to stop remittances\nBut the president's trying to do or if he were to somehow try to stop remittances or\nAnd or remittances that his money coming from people in this country to Mexico because I Believe they're a second\nLargest source of income I after oil\nUm I don't know it seems to me that doing that would also exacerbate the problem in in Mexico I hear people say that President Trump for example withdraws the aid from Honduras in Guatemala it'll simply make the conditions there even worse or and or would create even more so called migrants\nIt seemed to me the argument against Mexico is that Mexico's economy under developed\nAnd needs to be developed and you stop the remittances if even if you could do it legally\nI'm not sure how that would create conditions that would make it better for Mexicans to stay in Mexico as opposed to coming up here illegally but thanks for the idea of cannot look into it Thai is in San Antonio Texas tiger in the area of the show\nWhere you love your show man so much thank you um go yeah that that all your gentleman a at a record that as a conservative\nOr for now a long long time one\nOf the things I've understood at the Democratic party at an absolute stranglehold\nThe black community now and the mind that uh for about six years and they had no intention of look at it and it's like what you've done among like them to get out of their cells and so\nBut but to my point you you had a caller ask you how many legal\nImmigrants are accepted into this country um and I happen to know living in San Antonio I'm married to a Hispanic woman her family is from Mexico\nWe as a country per year except about one million legal immigrants of which about six hundred thousand\nOr residency changes I don't know maybe they have dual citizenship and they're moving to America I'm not sure what situation it but that leaves you with about four hundred thousand ... so that boils down to almost eleven hundred per day\nOkay legal citizens that we are accepting entered this country and at this point in our history we have the most legal immigrants that we have ever had matched thirty seven probably thirty seven now if you if you estimate on population\nYou know you and do that math that comes up almost ... percent of our population ... legal mhm so you know to make the argument and this is through not only democratic uh you know presidents do for a Republican and trade shows and and this has\nBeen going on for a long long time um but you know I wanted\nTo ask you you mentioned earlier on your show that Mexico has felony policy for anybody who enters the country illegally that's right my my bigger question here my bigger question is if Mexico is\nAnd from what I hear they have a blockbuster and be willing to help you you say that there are pretty much just escorting them and kind of you know I'm just protecting where my whatever they're doing now is that these people are not rounded up by the federal rally immediately or at least\nA medium that they can't go out of the the the integrity of Mexico's all ...\n... ...\nIf they're if they're entering legal you know so why should they why should you know if they're if they're agreeing to help but then we just went into a new trade deal with\nThem it just seems like the third mainly fostering these people to our border and then they're going to see how we handle\nThat's exactly what's going on why do you think Trump is so upset what do you think puppet so angry [noise] because the Mexican government allows the so called caravan from central and South America to come on through their country
