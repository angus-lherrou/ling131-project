Jews\nI Know many people don't realize it but there's a big difference between conservative reform does that don't like Israel and don't like really being Jewish between Orthodox Jews that love Israel and of course all dogs up any persons of common sense knows that Obama is the biggest uh is uh later enjoy it and say you're going to be a fool not to believe that\nAnd went down so there is no president ever ever did and Israel which is why does everybody to bridges and is on the end after Donald Trump even a train station 'cause you know that\nI Do know that but but just at the point is Seventy five percent of American Jews don't like him I absolutely get your point about the uh twenty five percent that do I know a lot of them to do I'm just talking about collectively Seventy five percent can't stand them I don't plan on voting for for him again ... when he runs again and twenty twenty\nThat's because you know trying to tell you what do you think Jews don't you don't really want to be with us from trying to tell you they're going to vote for people that would not want to support Israel as I'm trying to say that surprised him either like that actually makes sense that it that'd be the right dose\nThat's what I'm trying to say it's not surprising why they are like that actually makes sense that fits everything right\nThose are my art here's my question is if they do does not support Donald Trump do you believe that person or that Jewish person who is a shame to being Jewish that's my question to you\nYes with no doubt yes with no ... no that really\nYet I mean you got to be a fool I mean if you really Jewish solid Jewish I mean you've got to be dumb enough to\nKnow I I look look you're preaching to the choir about about the Jewish vote the black vote the Hispanic vote or they are all these people the overwhelming vote for the Democratic party I think the wrong to do so but I think it's another leap to say are you are so self loathing Jew if you're not if you don't support the Republican Party and that seemed to be to be what what you're saying Joe so that's what I'm asking you\nYes yes go down some prevents common sense right now he brought out to the world with common sense between two and false\nAll right so so all the Jews who voted for Obama for example in your opinion are self loathing Jew I'm asking\nOh disgusting that you're crazy you're talking all the time\nNo question felt loading of course there seem to be no question that yes there's no doubt about it\nAre now now you're aware Joseph that that's the same slam it's used against black people like me I'm I'm called self loathing because I'm a Republican\n[laughter] okay so there's two people that work out right now as to what's going on either you're dumb which is unfortunately the truth that we all know that\nAll your personal just evil I mean the people to know what's going on it's still support Hillary and all these people are just pure evil which is why I think Trump is so important that these days in office because he represents the truth\nIt's being Jewish Christian Muslim as fuel fight for the truth you have to go for Chuck otherwise\nI don't know what okay so Joseph how do you feel about people that call people like Kanye West Larry Elder a Candace Owens self loathing black people\nOkay so the black people that make fun of black people are two ways also there's there's many many most I mean I I have a lot of black trench just on the Trump supporters but the one that went to college and are ...
