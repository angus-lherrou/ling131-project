[noise] how about cheating in this case in personal relationships where he said he knew nothing and he paid off a playboy model in a poll dancer\nWhen she told us on air force one he didn't know and then we're supposed to look at this and say hey we tell our kids don't she\nDon't lie don't steal from their bombs first but in this case ... percent of the American people say I'm going to believe his lawyers because despite the fact that the president repeatedly as lie cheat and storm in this case we got to believe them cool not me not me I don't mind the one thing\nIf you have somebody who apparently some blatant hacks pride any of those and not explaining legal all it's an incredible who's the journalism and it is remarkable the level of detail that could be acquired by anyone who doesn't have to pay the power\nThe detail it goes to her and by the way from looks at the power has already said that was after the New York state has indicated justice about location and they want to look into all of this\nI mean the detail and here is really revealing and I mean if you look at for example\nA ... they I think the biggest episode they're discussing is when the father's assets had to be transferred\nTo the children and they talk about it in great specificity two distinct schemes that were used to devalue those assets enough minimize the central estate tax one was to create a sham companies and pay it inflated of doing as a way of kind of blind down the assets of transferring the money that because that way and even more\nExplosively they argue there was systematically a fraudulent ah or at least highly misleading appraisals Donna all not\nTrue yeah see he was his father was paint them money fulltime used three years old I'm\nFirst first mechanism three what time it was three yeah the first mechanism was his father had built a large apartment complexes and he gave the land under those apartment complexes to his children ... the president who is on three and then

read the New York times article very very long article fourteen thousand words did Trump or his father or other members of the family engage in something illegal\n[noise] [noise] well you know what I'm I Can't tell a you know I haven't looked at the water hundred thousand pages of documents that they seemed to provide\n'em you know there's there are a few things in here which is proven to be true that was probably beyond the pale of the law\nUm what what what bothered me about the uh the article is the the authors obviously showed their bias in several places I'm One of which where they say that uh the rich never really pay their full freight\nUm and ah there's a couple of places where they're under explanation allows them to make some rather crucial accusations which\nIf I knew all the facts I might be able to disapprove so I'll give you an example if you if I may sure um suppose that I buy a house for half a million dollars I put twenty percent down and I borrow with a mortgage the remaining four hundred thousand dollars of the purchase price\nNow what is that worth to me what is that included in my network if I if I gave it away at that point what would the value of the gift be one of the value of the gift will be a hundred thousand dollars because it would be subject to that mortgage and\nSo now let's say there's a downturn like there was in the Nineteen nineties or two thousand three or two thousand eight when everybody lost value in real estate and now my real estate is worth only four hundred and twenty thousand dollars\nAnd like a lot of clients of mine decided when the downturn came that was a good time to give away real estate to their children so now it's worth four hundred and twenty thousand dollars I give it to my children what's the gift that I report on my ... tax return\nWatch four hundred and twenty thousand dollars minus a four hundred thousand dollar mortgage that's twenty thousand dollars left that would be the value of the gift\nNow a decade later there's been improvements all around the neighborhood knew Tony retailers developments of of of various sizes and I sell my children's sell that house for seven hundred thousand dollars or have to pay off the mortgage so they keep\nThree hundred thousand dollars I'm not even going to talk about taxes at that point but they kept three hundred thousand dollars and then one could say that they got Fifteen times the valuation of the gift\nBut you see how it was perfectly legal they didn't but the article doesn't explain leverage of real estate so as a result I mean you you can easily said my gosh how could that ever happened how could you ever invest in something and then sell it ten years later for Fifteen times what value was when it was given\nFree of charge recharge is my guest season attacking estate planning lawyer or read you said there are a couple of things that jumped out at you and if they can be proven to be true it would be problematic what what's the most serious one\nAh well the one that I really found to be a very serious is there's there's a there's a statement that when Donald Trump's a casino was in very bad shape a fake you know just ... drowning in debt\nThat apparently his father or sent an emissary to buy three million dollars worth of chip\nBelieve him and put you on hold for for ... for for this we're going to pick out on the other side I remember when that happened some some guy went in there and bought three point five million dollars worth of chips\nAnd from Oklahoma City said this about relief factor\nIt has changed my life is the

think Clinton's ever lost faith do that without any heavy stack\nAnd it's much better that companies engaged in target some kind of like a downside to quite a significant fall back into some constructive proactive that can be unintended consequences of scientists because the problem\nIs you select one taking a population in the ... and then it's been said that population they may not appreciate it always has everybody know selected that can be a reaction which is quite make it seem that people have pointed into his mission and the question is only did they get that because the quota or on their own merits and that's a bit of a button for anybody to deal\nWith these ... says I mean what can we say that say how long have we bury a place to play something needs to go down that
