got a question for me that how you doing makes a huge difference potentially to how I answer the question\nThey may help in the long run I was just curious about the\nQuestion concerns about taking Social Security is a sixty two and possibly investing that whole amount as opposed to waiting for the higher amount a later age I feel like what the right of investment you probably wouldn't be\nDoing better off than waiting kills a sixty six and four months\nSo it seems like a whole chunk of change your life and the government and all and you could probably be doing something with it yourself\nWith stun or is it what investments are in today what savings earned today it is nearly impossible\nOr someone to take early Social Security invest that money and out or in what the computer to advantage is to you waiting those extra for years to take your Social Security the reason is is it every year you wait\nYou get a Social Security check roughly eight percent larger and then as the cost of living adjustments occur your cost of living adjustment his base for the rest of your life on a higher initial amount\nSo and also there's no tax you are going to go\nFor waiting to take Social Security versus taking it early investing the money and then if you do well investing you then have to pay tax on the money you earned investing so there are a lot of inherent advantages to wait\nAnd the most common age people take Social Security is what you're new to playing right now at age sixty to write my advice is when you've got to have the money\nIs when you take it and in my case you know what age I'm going to take at\nAge\nSeventy that's the last time you can take it and get all that build up of the eight percent prizes my extra each year\nRight and so I'm going to a hold out till the last minute so that I can end up with a much larger Social Security check at the time I take it\nSo you gave the ah you gave the analogy of sixty two and your retirement age which you say sixty six years four months is that what she said\nYes so if you were still doing okay financially and you didn't even need it then I Would like you to keep kicking the can forward\nA plan on it I'm pretty healthy I'm not going anywhere I'm\nStill feel like I'm Eighteen so I don't think anything's gonna stop me soon so probably a good advice it just seemed like a lot of money left on the table my calculations kept telling me to deliver in years to regain the money that I like to go at sixty two\nThat's completely true but the big problem with um retirement years is later and retirement when we may not be physically able if we needed more money to go back to work\nWe may have more medical bills I mean the fatter check becomes more benefits now let me tell you the risk I'm taking my brother\nIn January my oldest brother it will have live longer than any mail\nIn my entire family tree and as far back as any of us know ever and he will be at that time Seventy two\nSo you know but all we are not a genetically disposed to live long those guys in my family so it can you imagine I'm In a way to late Seventy [laughter] I may have no benefit I ever get out of the system\nOr a mother that's over Ninety and she's still chicken so I\nWill say in your case there is a direct advantage to waiting because what you're really concerned about is way down the road so I Hope that my brother ah who also\nWaited until late Seventy that he ends up women are really really really long time for many reasons not having anything to do with money no but what is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi how you doing\nJust fine and good luck to you don't ... I Am well thank you so much Yes sir\nSo you have had a nasty gram from a credit card company what did they do to you\nSo I opened up a credit card or as a ... I Know you're not a I Know you're not saying I'm a several years ago and I haven't used it in years and it's only got a limit of about a thousand dollars nothing no or anything like that on it but I got an email saying that\nIf I didn't use a cart by the ... that they were going to close the cards and I wanted to see if\nIt would be in my best interests at I guess some of my credits best interests I close the cart\nCorman or if I just let them closer or or or what we'll do that\nThat makes no difference either way but I wanted to ask you a question this store card does it have a visa and MasterCard logo on it or is it just for purchases and that store\nIt looks like it's just for purchases and the store\nThere is no real advantage to you having that if you have you have sufficient credit elsewhere abuses MasterCard's American Express discover\nOut oh yeah it's it's less than two percent or my overall credit\nAnd decide art I Would dump but just to let them just like kick you the curb\nIn December and be done with that because there's no real advantage to having store credit is looked at in the industry is junk credit right and you're not intending to use it again so let it just walk away\nOkay it it did as a either a MasterCard logo uh 'cause\nThen I went to that I'd want you to keep it unless you go keep it some purchase somewhere\nOr whatever you know five dollar purchase somewhere just something that takes it from being an active to an active card okay and then it stays as active and part of your overall credit mix but when it was just a what I think is referred to as a model line where it's just\nFor that particular store right those you don't want to have\nRight well that sounds great I sure do appreciate you taking me on the Golan Heights\nWell

recognize the face\nAnd possibly the voice if you watched movies through the eighties and into the nineties James Cameron was a character actor\nThese through the eighties and into the nineties James Cameron was a character actor he's best known for some notable horror movie appearances he was the boss in over ... the guy who moves the tombstones but not the grade he was also in\nReturn of the living dead part one and two essentially playing the same character for some strange reason they\nEven though those movies aren't directly connected he's in there as as a guy who who basically become zombies and he was also in the film invaders from Mars not the original but the Toby Hooper remake back in the eighties\nHe was just a character actor that showed up in a lot of the genre films that I remember as a kid and I you know it's sort of do this and double actor\nAnd presence on screen that that was never the big starring role but always was kind of fun especially in like return of the living dead he's one of them are entertaining things about that movie and it's sad to see him go yeah he was Ninety four that's a good run but it's always sad to see it go\nThe next season as I Want to talk about really quickly is apparently there's rumors that Warner Brothers is looking to get rid of Ben Affleck and Henry capital they're done with them as Superman and Batman the old Batman the Ben\nAffleck thing has been percolating for a while and then he's like he's going to do another badly and moving that he's not and they're they're deciding what to do and I think Henry capital of the same thing they're trying to figure out what to do with it would be a because the the D.C cinematic universe is in shambles because you had such great hits like Wonder Woman and they're hoping the guys\nThat are common does well this Christmas\nBut we don't know and and everything was such a stumble because I think they were to be holding to a certain style and look that didn't quite fit for an entire\nUniverse of of characters that fit for Batman when they did man of steel and that kind of marginally worked for a man of steel but not really but they had that Batman go our ring depressing look that that no one brought in with the Batman begins in the dark Knight movies\nBut it just doesn't translate to making an entire\nComic book series based on that and then they had such ... such success with television I think they're ready to report this thing again I just hope that they do it with a little more ... and and companies can backhanded ... Khan Wonder Woman and a ... end of this thing because they do it in the comics all the time\nThe next piece of news is another redevelopment news is that\nOn around me middle around for ... could reverse perjuring her car and I'm from ... ... ...\nAnd welcome back to that guy at the movies with Kevin car let's jump right into the movie reviews well at least I'd like to jump right in the movie there's been a couple of snack foods out there\nI think that was the right in terms of you know what is now booming I'll I'll give you the clean version\nAll fouled up to the situation is very normal this happens all the time usually I let the stuff roll off my back I live in Columbus ohio I live in the heartland flyover country I Am not in one of the biggest market out there are not New York or LA or Chicago American Cleveland Cleveland gets more screenings and I do\nIt is not uncommon for studios to\nNot screened everything in my market and little sometimes be huge movie like this I remember the first draft of the world they didn't screening Columbus I had to go to Cincinnati to see it\nFor big movies like that I I Will sometimes do that but it's always irks me if they don't screen and then my local market and we have a big university here there's no reason to not screened things in Columbus there's actually a reason why we're ranked lower and it's sort of\nA stupid mathematical reason but\nThey'll sometimes not screened stuff and I let that go but sometimes there's movies that I ask about and this is what this is one that gets me upset\nAnd why then do the radio rail on this with a movie like hunter killer I couldn't find a screening or I asked the rap I literally emailed the rap and I'm like hey are you screening this and Johnny English\nAnywhere near Columbus and he said no\nSorry we're not well then I found out that they did\nI understand that there is not the budget to scream something I don't think they screen Johnny English anywhere here but they did scream hunter killer\nThe fact that they had a screaming was actually kind of hidden from the press and that really says something to me\nWhen you actually screen a movie you're showing a movie early but you refused to let press in or even let them know about it you are trying to hide something\nThere is something wrong with your movie if you're doing that it just is too suspicious some movie that didn't have the budget or didn't have the interest\nIt just was hidden from its audience and it was him from the press and the critics\nYou're obviously worried about bad reviews you're obviously worried about the thing is in this day and age you know get out\nObviously worried about the thing is in this day and age gets out people know when the movie's\nGarbage they get the sense and the thing is when they show movies that like Thursday night around the country people know by friday morning if it's garbage\nSo you'd not hiding anything so just screen the freaking movie and let let the chips fall where did you made a crappy movie that's on you anyway let's talk about hunter killer really quickly or us submarine commander must award a Russian plan to overthrow the world's governments from under the Arctic ice\n\nA little road minister what difference does it has a car wreck\nThis movie feels like it should have been made in the eighties but they just forgot\nOr got made and they come out and release it until now I just finished the special effects it starts Gerard Butler Gerard Butler about ten years ago had a really big career you know it was coming off the three hundred and he was kind of a big star suddenly a but now he's not and and what his last movie with like geo storm\nAnd look I I Love Gerard Butler I think he's a who I interviewed the guy he's kind of a fun guy but he doesn't quite have the same\nPower that used to this thing looks like he's got stuck and the fact that they didn't screen admitted for press means to me it probably really sucks all\nListed in the fact that the movies with Kevin car let's talk really quickly about Johnny English strikes again bumbling spy Johnny English is brought out of retirement to stop a mastermind hacking\nOff having\nThem pay\nThat makes it really is the [noise]\nHow how\nThis is another one that wasn't screened I don't know if they were screening it for the public but hiding it desperately from the press but I think the reason that this one wasn't screened is because these movies tend to do\nPretty terribly in the U.S the Johnny English movies I think the first one made like twenty five million and the second one didn't even make ten million this one I don't think they're expecting much I was supposed to be a wider release in the theater counts for dwindling down as like five\nHundred now I think they're just releasing it out of courtesy these movies tend to do very well overseas across the pond this has already made like a hundred million dollars is a British movie and it's very dry it's even drier than standard British stuff that Americans like\nI'm curious to see it I kind of like the Johnny English movies I like Rowan Atkinson and I like British humor so hopefully I'll get a chance to see it it's just not\nToday but now it has to get a preemptive stuck ...\nYou're listening to fact guys at the movies with Kevin car let's talk really quickly about the movie mid nineties I Know I said I was going to talk about pre solo in this segment but I'm doing mid nineties because I don't have a trailer for\nA Thirteen year old skateboard or makes friends and gets into trouble while growing up in Nineteen nineties Los Angeles\nNow like I said I don't have a trailer for this and there's a reason for it it's not that they couldn't find one it's just that there's so many swear words in his trailer would sound like a conversation between our Judy ... it's a very foul mouth trailer because it was about Thirteen year old teenage and you know older kids\nWho are just hanging out and being friends and so just lots of F bombs lots of swear words lots of inappropriate language and this was directed by Jonah Hill and written by Jonah Hill\nAnd of course he's best known for being an actor but you know this is him stretching his directorial legs and try to do something different to them and I applaud that any time somebody try something different I applaud that\nThey make movies like this periodically every couple of years you know the all the way going back to like movies like kids or if you remember\nThe spring breakers harmony grade even shows up in this movie where it's like the kids are AQIM appropriate or staying inappropriate things they're doing inappropriate things or doing something that's going to trigger some people and to be like oh that is inappropriate and that's dangerous or whatever\nAnd the response by the filmmakers as well that's what some people do\nWhether you're taking drugs whether you're having sex whether you're swearing whether you're using this sort of language\nThe language that is used even the swearing is a a type of\nSwearing that you know politically incorrect now it was very common back in the nineties overall this movie I respect what it's doing I respect what it's trying to do\nBut it is just these kids flopping around it almost feels like a documentary and while it's somewhat autobiographical it seems to be to properly Jonah Hill's life it also sort of seems like it's a bit of a teenage fantasy there are things that happened\nTo the Thirteen year old kid that you're like yeah and I'm really that wouldn't happen or if it did happen it didn't happen in that context which did give me a couple I roles\nOverall is not my kind of movie it feels a little bit like a Kevin Smith approach to movie where it's like well everybody did this and it's like no not really just a small segment of your generation did this is just all the people you knew the disorder appeared everybody\nDid all this stuff but while this was popular in the nineties is not what everybody did I think calling at mid nineties is a little bit grand trying to capture an entire segment of a decade rather\nThan just as very sort of narrow counter cultural teenage or experience which is really all it it and if you like that sort of thing and it's going to connect with you you're going to love it otherwise\nIt's going to be a chore to watch so it just depends on where your background is I'm going to give it a kind of rocks just cause I respect what they were doing cat rock [noise] that

W an outright win socket\nA thirty eight years since this movie came out so they're uh they're they're giving a re release and you're getting some theatrical play in this so I thought it was a good time to take a look back on John carpenter's the fog this\nNineteen eighty thrillers about that sailors returning to their seaside village a hundred years after they were betrayed and it comes back to the theaters this Halloween\n... a lot no other way around a long one on\nOne hundred years ago between midnight and water something unknown came out of the four\n\nHundred years ago in between midnight and more than something that came out\nThis is one of carpenters movies or that he made in one of his best runs of his career when you look at what he made from Halloween through\nI'm going to stay up 'til the mouth of madness but I talked about that a couple of weeks ago that was a great right now there is some thinkers in there and there are some movies that aren't as good like them or something Invisible Man I also talked about that relatively recently as a John Carpenter look back that was an okay movie it doesn't quite hold up nowadays\nBut for the most part I mean you had you had to Halloween you had the fall you had the thing you had big trouble in little China you had they live you had prince of darkness you had eventually like it's a mountain in the mouth of madness he he really loses theme in the nineties but\nGosh this is really starting his great run I mean this was a follow up the Halloween and you had a fantastic run yet to come because two years later he's going to be doing the thing\nThe other thing I've seen about this is this is relatively early in his career at least as a star director and\nIt has a great cast with like ... and John Houseman Janet Leigh and of course Tom Atkins is in it and had Jamie Lee Curtis and it's a creeping movie but it's a slow burn for carpenter movie it's it's it's not a high actions thrill ride it's only Ninety minutes\nBut it takes us time to get through what it needs to do and that's a great way to follow up Halloween because Halloween was relied a lot of suspense and and you know how to has a lot of connective tissue with a psycho or something like that so the dog also with the special effects using the FARC look really good which\nWas terrible when they re made it back in two thousand five or something like that so this is a this is an indelible movie and even though it's a slower bird and take the time and it has probably more characters than it needs to\nIt it's a great little horror movie and it's it's definitely worth checking out especially if you're a fan of John Carpenter or any of the actors involved someone else to say that the bog totally rocks well\nActually that's a good thing but I mean to go to a break when it come back I'm going to be talking about box office and the home sort of around the tree freak show and maximum overdrive [noise]\n\n... ... you know we do

really quick a little bit early in this segment and\nOf course last week the ... of the weekend was Halloween that's not a big surprise that wasn't a big surprise everyone that expecting it to do well I was seen productions in the sixties millions but it ended up winning the weekend was Seventy six million dollars which is a huge amount of money\nFor a horror movie let alone a movie that's the series that's forty years old right now it stands at number one [laughter] as the highest grossing Halloween movie even topping Halloween\nTwo thousand seven the awful Rob Zombie remake which had are opening of like twenty six million in theaters which was considered spectacular them and if you remember back the original Halloween\nI don't know what the opening of that one was but it was pretty low I mean it's final domestic total was like just under fifty million and that's after being played for forty years so\nHalloween two thousand Eighteen is it was a huge huge huge\nAmounts of money for a horror movie to make and this is of course that opposed it\nConjuring paranormal activity world but there is a cautionary tale to all this as much as it was cool to see a Halloween when of course you had like go down stars born in ... goose bumps to those all you know ratcheted down in terms of top ten\nBut Halloween take was huge here's the problem though\nI Do not expect every slasher movie do not expect every Halloween movie\nTo make Seventy six million dollars it's opening weekend if you do that Europe all said and this is what can cause a series to fall apart and this is what can cause box office to if he chased that box office it can be dangerous for you and here's exactly what will happen\nThey'll make a Halloween too\nAnd it's not going to do as well\nAnd then they'll do another one and it also won't do as well as any other series we'll go except for something like a superhero franchises where you build this complex universe with multiple characters over multiple movies\nThe danger of this is that they're going to expect every Halloween movie to at least make over fifty million dollars another going to pull the plug as quickly as they can't that's what happened to the front of the thirteenth they re booted that and then they thought oh is it dropped so fast\nAnd the second weekend they said well what what the the franchises dead where where you need to go back\nTo what I've said this before the blue mouse model of making these movies are less than ten million dollars and then when it makes thirty million it still it hit the slasher\nCranes in the eighties wasn't that these movies were making as much as the star wars movies were making is that they had a steady consistent audience that always came to the movies and watch them and that's what made those movies do so\nSo that the big caution with just one more caller in on the weekends only going to make money and money and it may run very fast once we get outside of the Halloween frame once we're in the memory and my mom was reading in that I don't expect Halloween may twenty thirty million dollars to\nDo\nIs to be in the fact that the movies with Kevin car that means it's time to roll into the home front I'm Around them [noise] not a whole\nLot of big ones I think I'm Out on me I came out this week or something like that I don't that movie the terrible anyway so let's talk

right so I was getting the media right in the middle of this I suppose because CNN got one of the pipe bomb pay everybody Kate to Laney America Tonight that's where we're at we're talking about pipe bomb the eight of them that went in several different directions the aid package is an American mail bomb or they're looking for that person\nAs they go through a at Quantico every single piece of the bombs and try to place fingerprints or find fingerprints find pieces of evidence totally makes sense\nSo they were intercepted before they reached the target Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder former CIA director John Brennan a prominent Democratic Party donor George Soros two packages were sent to California congresswoman Maxine Waters the VP Joe\nBiden or a\nBrock Obama former press former secretary of State Hillary Clinton all on the list CNN as I mentioned\nThe FBI says this is ... ... ... of course investigating acts of\nTerrorism so what you heard there as you heard the president he was at a political rally in Wisconsin saying that there's going to be an aggressive ... and that any act of threat the political violence or an attack on democracy we decide to come together and peace and harmony\nAnd you heard bill de Blasio before that\nAnd you heard bill de Blasio before that\nThe mayor of New York talking about you know the media that there's no place for for that\nFor sending bombs which I Would agree you can't disagree with media you can have people on TV on radio on whatever think they're lame think they're making things up or love them or whatever but of course bombing they're going to catch you you're going away for life was it worth it I'm going to say it's not worth it so\nThey confirmed that they had the these envelopes they confirmed they were manila envelopes with a bubble wrap interior they had a device Senate they had a computer printed address labels export ever posted stamps that were on the outside\nAnd I'm\nOne bomb was packed with shards of glass\nThat's we do know that that was confirmed then the packages were all intercepted one went to the home of Clinton and New York she wasn't home at the time the former pres was but that doesn't get to them until it's screamed somebody else get the you know whatever\nBut they are definitely ... were people that I'm more on the left that will hurt the intended target so that again the thing all the targets are are usually the ones that you hear repeatedly criticized\n... daddy I think a Humvee has come in and\nThat is that it's just crazy and I saw a picture of it so picture this giant plane cargo open for like a movie like Indiana Jones get an a fist fight with someone who was someone or maybe a Mission Impossible as Tom Cruise gonna fly off the bat that they have a parachute and instead it is a\nHumvee that comes flying out of the back of it but like I said nobody was hurt they had a drag it out\nAnd you can bet they were not thrilled to have to report that\nUh yeah we got a problem here is or it has to do with the Humvee\nWent in the opposite direction of where it was supposed to go\nI those scores are pretty easy but not so easy for the Dodgers the red Sox even with two outs they're driving in runs there ahead to dip in the world series over the Dodgers they won on Wednesday again for to the final score\nIt was a big win for David Price because he was beleaguered a guy who always gets accused of not being able to get it done in the postseason\nBut the less the got it done\nHe pitch six innings he did give up two runs off of three hits but he also struck out five\nAnd um\nThe good news is not a loss pinned on Boston and instead it's it's a good win for the red Sox who would like to be able to bring back the world series trophy to being town but they're going to go to LA and we'll see what happens\nWhen they switch gears in the world series and ended up going to\nEnd up going to a Los Angeles 'cause that's what obviously you do go to LA for a few them back to Boston maybe depending on if it's necessary who knows what if it was a sweep by the way millennia Trump today did a good job she was seen what the president\n[noise] she was um at one point even addressed the media and you know she was there she was\nShe was there for the signing of the opioid bill and the legislation is meant to curb the opioid epidemic\nAnd it's interesting he was reminded to sign it by the first lady ... there was a viral video from the signing of event of the East Room at the White House\nAnd you could see making them to his way out of the room before signing it she'd been directed him to return to the bill\nAnd there was some laughter and then he signed it and she at one point addressed the media to talking about are calling for um peace as far as some of the rhetoric and what happened with the whole because it was in light of what happened with the um\nWith the pipe bombs that were being reported because it just boom fell out there all of a sudden it you know in the afternoon was when the news broke and that became\nBig news and and obviously conversation as to the what the reaction from the White House and reaction from people on the hill Congress folks and senators are as well\nI the caravan the migrant care a ban of arriving at this point in the southern Mexican town ... so in the pre dawn hours of Wednesday\nThe\nThey were inching their way up there\nThe um\nThey were inching their way up there ... along the highway [noise]\nThe migrants and their supporters have said they've been forced to abandon their homeland countries like Guatemala\nBecause of corrupt governments extreme poverty and horrific violence from gangs and other criminals where a lawlessness rules\nThe amount of people in the caravan may have fallen to about thirty six hundred because some people are dropping out or are seeking asylum in Mexico or\nThey're even going home just\nDepending so the numbers seem to have\nDropped most of them are from Honduras Nicaragua er or Guatemala El Salvador and that caravan though is pushing on that or what the numbers are like the numbers I just said\nOr or the numbers increase decreased whatever that is still happening so it has not been called off and dispersed in any way been me make the move 'cause you know the Disney theme parks attract poodles with people from all over the place for weddings birthdays engagement that kind of\nAlways say what the happiest place on earth\nI Can't imagine the happiest places on earth is when there's ten million people pressing against you to get on the line for riders can take an hour and a half to get on but that's why they have a fast path that's all they have off times but what are the off times for Disney World and Disneyland anyway custodians at Disneyland Anaheim and\nAt Walt Disney worlds in Orlando claimed the parks are prefer place for guests to scatter their loved ones ashes to\nThat you know that yeah\nSo people sneaking their families members ashes and plastic bag the pill bottles or or they're heading in person or backpacks when they're inside they spread them throughout the landscape and the park and flower beds and water ride including\nPirates of the Caribbean um other popular areas the haunted mansion in fact they're saying that the hunted mansion probably is so much humid ashes that it's not even funny wow\nUm there was a a woman who was quoted the other day at forty one year old Missouri native is saying that she later father to rest near Disney World gates earlier in the air to memorize there's a to memorialize rather their summer trips together I\nKnow that there's something nice about that right but how about this the Anaheim police department did confirm they've answered calls regarding ashes before Disneyland\nLike yeah you're not really supposed to do that\nBut he said that people sneak they don't better to just do it not ask for permission right I guess that's what the theory is just do it and that's it who's going to know that they're not going to know so we're just do what\nWe think is the ... is what they would want or what we want it or you know whatever it might be I don't know I think there's a there's something I'm\nIt's hard when you lose somebody right so I think there's something about spreading the ashes where you have the memory or what they wanted their wishes\nOr is there something about having a site where you can go to the site and visit and lay flowers and I mean it used to be that there is no way you wouldn't have a headstone or you wouldn't\nGo in and be able to honor them and lay flowers on the grave sites and they even called them blankets related over the whole type so pretty a\nPretty interesting how that's changed I think a little bit more cremation\nAbout Nintendo the video game makers teaming up with a nonprofit is here to play to bring their do it yourself ... cardboard gaming kids to a hundred elementary schools around the

kids everything's going to be about living on the mobile phone so anything they do in that direction it has to be as a classroom experience [noise]\nThere has to be something to that worthwhile coming out of that because it's the principles of science and technology engineering and mathematics\nThat's the goal so that's the goal I say thumbs up to that\nGood luck to the students who get to do it

five\nSo if you if you you know look on the uh at present daily value charred on your foods there should be twenty five things listed there those are non negotiable your body can't function without it so even if you're not thinking about your brain health\nIf you're thinking about the growth could be a child is thinking about your self maintaining your body weight and you're\nPreventing diabetes and heart disease and other things you need that the parliament the brain is very active\nAnd it needs other nutrients that aren't typically found in in the food supply and these are an antioxidant family some of these alpha ... said an NFC do Fifteen these are all long names\nAnd we created a product that brain shake or calling it that not only has everything you need to sustain life all these vitamins and minerals but added in the brain specific nutrients\nCalling it brain care but it's got this bevy of antioxidants plus this\nMagic compound its effect called bustle Tito theory and that's the only compound that the FDA has allowed to have a health claim relating that compound to dementia and Alzheimer's so we've included that at the right amount based on the best\nNutritional science out there so this thing is in this product brain shake his magical and the respect that takes care of your body and then he puts in the extra goodies that your brain needs\n[laughter] yeah so I'm so brain shade tells a little bit more about that because you know we were talking about like I said reading the packaging no artificial colors right that kinda stuff\nLike you know it says it's everything your body and brain needs and nothing it doesn't\nYou know I probably read a hundred and fifty articles on human studies with the brain and it's really clear to me that you got to get the junk out of the foods because even if you're getting your nutrients and think you're eating well once you start layering in those bad fats the trends in saturated fats\nAnd sugars just negates all the benefits you get so creating a product was thinking about your brain of what you're going to eat throughout a lifetime getting those things out they really the primary thing you do so we don't have much of those in any of our products pretty low on sugar and then these spats but we still have\nThat in the died because it turns out that the good fats are actually good for the brain so healthy fats like omega threes that you might have heard about from seafood and from the plants and also making six from all the ah vegetable oils\nYou know corn safflower and sons who are in the like we have those oil in there because it it they're protective and good for the brain cells\nYeah I I got to mention is 'cause uh Dr bell for all the people listening you were on the faculty of the of Harvard Medical school and you did a lot of nutritional research studies there I can just imagine what what that was like of everything that you did when you were doing the studies what blow you away the most what shocked\nPrinted so we did a lot of research studies and and well let me let me start with let me think about the answer is I talk about ... ... we would take patience with a certain condition and I'll talk about what I did for my PHD work we looked at patience with HIV infection aids\nAnd they um had a hype they had an immune system that wasn't working and we had seen in our animal studies that in fact I'm\nGetting a mega threes\nHelp the immune system works better\nAnd that's what we did I made a I had a chocolate cooking made with fish oil in it and then I had another cookie made with safflower oil and we looked at blood parameters of immune function in those aids patients that were taking both cook he said was a randomized study and we were able to see positive changes\nEven in
