[noise] but first President Trump is in Pittsburgh today to honor the victims\nFirst the tree of life synagogue master Trump is strong denounces the shootings\nHer as a tree of life synagogue massacre Trump as strong as announces his shooting stating that quote the vial hate filled poison of anti Semitism must be condemned and confronted everywhere and anywhere happens in the present along with first lady Melania Trump and daughter ... arrived at Pittsburgh today round three forty five PM\nRabbi Jeffrey Myers who was in the sanctuary leading a service for the tree of life congregation during the shootings told CNN on Monday he's my president\nHe certainly welcome but even as president and others more in the victims of Saturday's synagogues shootings we know that other attacks on religious freedom in America occur all over the country but not with bullets with everyday actions workplaces in schools secular forces who's goal is to chip away at the rights of college students for businesses to engage\nIn the culture with their religious beliefs are facing lawsuits and other legal action which need to be definitive court often at the cost of thousands even millions of dollars we talked about the ... ... ... we talked about the pastor who's a fire chief in Atlanta who got fired because of his religious beliefs you talked about the\nFlorists in Washington state who was asked

than anybody else on the impact of\nNew deal policies during the great depression [noise] please welcome Mr\nOn the show is been forever [noise]\nThere it's good to join you\nYeah thank you very much for taking the time professor I was fascinated by your piece that you co wrote on housing here in California is it true that the regulations road restrictions literally added fifty percent to the price of housing here in this state\n[noise] Oh yes absolutely do and in fact fifty percent might be an understatement 'em in there was a there was a report in or out of San Diego\nJust two days ago indicating that building and affordable housing a unit a which is not a large unit is now an al ... up to four hundred and twenty five thousand dollars um which just just seems a beyond the pale\nUm California is just the most expensive state in terms of regulations and it really does affect the price of housing and and the ability to\nPut a new construction and er which would which would bring housing prices at that California right now is forty nights of the country in terms of new housing construction is very expensive to build and it's um [noise]\nAnd it and it takes a long time\nProfessor my next question was going to be why aren't Californians outrage and I recall studying economics in college uh and and recognizing that the price of these regulations to accept that the price of a of housing but I didn't realize it was at that high fifty percent and if I didn't realize that I think a lot of people are unaware of it as well\n[noise] yes um I think people are becoming more aware of that now given just how rapidly prices are rising I'm only about twenty six percent\nOf California households and this includes households with multiple wage earners only about twenty six percent of households can afford the median price Tom in California\nAnd people often think about what about all those people that make those high salaries up in Silicon valley or forty bill is even worse they're only about Fifteen Percent of households in the Silicon Valley area can afford the median price Tom in that location\nSo there's no there's no sense in which um there's ... there's there's absolutely a housing crisis in California and people are becoming very very upset about the ... and they're looking for government ah to put in place policies that will make it easier and less costly to build a an increase supply and bring those prices down\nYou might remember a few years ago professor I got a fact check when I was on CNN when I talked about um the\n... the high cost of a of a of regulations and said that if you add up the taxes and regulations are all those things government takes about fifty percent away from the American people I've got a phone call from from some fact checker and they said how do you know the cost of regulation is what you say it is\nA and I'm a I recommended them to a number of people and I recall you telling me that if anything I'd probably understated the or the number and the argument they gave me was that regulations also have benefits and and you're not taking exhilaration the benefits that these regulations produce what's your reaction to that\n[noise] well regulation exist to provide protection and it's supposed to provide protection to consumers\nRegulations in the housing market [noise] when I look at them I really can't see much a protection for consumers um let's take California's\nLatest folly which is to require by two thousand twenty of virtually every single family home will be required to have solar panels on its roof top\nThis will raise the cost of a building that home a by about thirty thousand dollars [noise]\nAll for the purpose of generating solar power we already have so much solar generation that we are paying Arizona to take solar power offer hands around around noon in one PM [noise] um that type of regulation feeds into [noise]\nA small number of people in the state who think it's just absolutely wonderful if we do everything we can under the sun\nTo be green um but it punishes people who have to pay those housing prices um so the residential housing market in California is not a place regulations ... benefiting the consumers\nI'm Talking to UCLA professor ... teaches economics says peace he co wrote is called California housing policy reforms up on Larry Elder dot com professor going to have a few more minutes of three more seconds in this break we come back I Want to talk to you about a why things\nSubstantially changed in California in Nineteen

have a president who has talked for a couple of years now about imprisoning his political rival and Hillary Clinton who is encouraged violence against the media or just last week talking about the assault on a reporter by congressman in Montana\nAnd saying that he that he is kind of guy that hard to see this outside of the context of the president's hostility hostility towards towards Mrs Clinton who tried to briefly speak towards unity towards Brock Obama towards George Soros\nThe president and his allies they need to dial down the the political rhetoric they are making people less safe they are making journalists less safe and they were making law enforcement officer is less safe but\nWe don't know who did this or we don't know what their motive was right but\nIt's a very obvious thread\nAnd maybe it's meant as a ruse but it's an obvious to read the Obamas acquaintance John Brennan CNN um George Soros these are people and organizations that President Trump continually taxes will demonize is recalls\nBut if you look at who they've targeted so far it's almost like they're following Donald Trump's Twitter feed and starting with Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nNot betray
