again Larry and ah we're a finish it up our bus jar and we're going to get this done we're going to bring health to the people of California\nWhere I heard about this bus tour is calling us on the way tell us about it well\nYou know our position is that the state has just been rendered unaffordable by the political class I mean the highest rate of poverty in the country the highest housing prices gasoline water electricity\nWe've got forest fires threatening our homes we got a rising crime rate we've got the schools that are forty seven of the nation\nOr the political class has driven California end of the ditch we're going to fix California Larry and I think people are ... are ready for it\nThat's we're going to fix California Larry and I think people are ... are ready for it\nJohn Cox the governor of California Jerry Brown says the forest fires or because of climate change\nReally uh that's because they haven't cleaned out a hundred and thirty million dead end diseased trees they haven't cleared out the Raj they haven't\nBuilt fire breaks or roads into the forest you know Larry we're building a train that nowhere out in the Central Valley yet our firefighters are using Nineteen seventies era alec GOP there's a lot of them have bullet holes in 'em from Vietnam I mean\nThis is really obnoxious and people are sick and tired of it\nNow John on your policy agenda your first item is or the repeal of the fifty two billion dollar gas tax increase\nThat would limit it last year and I assume that the repeal of that gas tax increase will be popular the measure uh is called the proposition six uh it's on the ballot to repeal this gas tax but it turns out according to a poll that just came out a couple of days ago\nThe majority of likely voters oppose proposition six they want to keep the the gas tax what's what's what's the deal with that\nOr is this the same polling firm that predicted that we'd have to Democrats in the race for governor\nI'm not sure about that are\nNow I think this repeal is wildly popular Larry it's because the political class has mismanaged Caltrans Caltrans spends twice what Texas does to build a mile a road and you know the the roads in Texas are far better they are that better than they are in California so\nYou know they are the politicians are drafted the pilots summer in a way that is going to make it a little bit tougher but I'm telling ya for anybody paying attention or they're not happy about this gas tax and that's going to be repealed up I promise you that\nMy guess is John Cox she's running for governor in California as a Republican his website is John ... for governor dot com John costs for governor dot com John Cox a a superior court judge recently rules or that charter cities cannot be forced to abide by the sanctuary state law that was signed by Governor Brown explain that to people\n[laughter] well yeah and this is a a monumental decision because the thanks for a state law for basically protects MS Thirteen I mean that's what I was there to do it and Gavin Newsom as all in favor of that but I got to tell you that the mothers and fathers of young or Hispanic kids as well as other kids unless they\nDon't want I must Thirteen and California recruiting their children\nAnd uh it's going to be repealed or when I'm the governor but right now and I met the young uh Huntington Beach or a city attorney who mounted this lawsuit\nAnd very gratified that the courts how that charter cities don't have to comply with the uh sex or a state law and let me tell you it's going to be a non issue after I'm the governor of his ... going to get rid of it\nJohn ... before this happened I didn't know the difference between a general city general lost to the UN Charter city turns out that the largest cities in the in the state\nUh San Francisco or LA San Diego Fresno these are all so pole charter cities which gives them a lot more control over things like I'm a police authority and therefore they can\nUh cooperate with a with the federal immigration authorities they can if they want to uh during routine traffic stops inquiring about the immigration status of people\nUh this is not what the governor wants to happen but apparently if you weren't charter city and there are about a hundred and twenty starter cities in the state coming about two thirds of the population you have all these rights but you don't have as a general varsity\nAnd uh but I wouldn't hold my breath\nWaiting for San Francisco to do anything about this or I mean you\nKnow they're they're in the process of trying to get the state to approve a legal injections sites where addicts and showed up in a nice uh you know clean environment which I think it's it's certainly ridiculous and it's not going to solve the problem of the horrendous drug addiction that's afflicting California\nJohn Cox when you're going to debate your opponent\nNext Monday at ten am on a public radio station he doesn't want to face me across a table on live television Larry I mean he's afraid that my good luck\nSo just in an overwhelming as a yeah\nBut really it's really actually uh he'll look like such a youngster next to
