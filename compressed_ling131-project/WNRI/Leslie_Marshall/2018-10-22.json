company the next level how you were you from originally\nCherry Hill New Jersey and how many brothers and sisters I have three brothers one sister I'm the youngest the fire the youngest of five how

at sixteen ... where you want to go\nWhen Brian each had a lot of jobs when did you get the initiative for ah for being such a young entrepreneur\nIt was really my father or from the time I was a very small child I Would listen to him he was a salesman I listen to him on the phone I'd watch how we dealt with people and I knew that I wanted to help people I knew I wanted to be in business and make money mhm\nRight and you mentioned that your father passed away at a when you were fourteen screws what impact that have on your it had a huge\nImpact because first of all it caused me to grow up even faster and um the money I was making you know it was all about uh being independent\nAnd it sounds like your your father inspired you into hard work\nUm do you think about your dad today still I think of them every day and and what do you hear him like whispering in your ear I'm as you're kind of tasked with making tough decisions he I I always hear him say keep going don't stop Brian what'd you do with all the money that you made I'm working on these jobs well\nThe first thing I was concerned about what's helping mom are particularly after my dad died and she didn't let me give all the money she wanted me to save so the rest was really saved\nFor future endeavors prying you were the youngest in the family and the green room you described you and your sister as the book into the family what did you mean by that\nWell there was a lot going on growing up obviously with a mom really struggling to to make things happen and keep the house so my sister and I were the ones that were sort of a always making things happen that's what I meant by the book and the youngest and the oldest\n... what do you mean by always making things happened what are you talking about\nWell there was a you know as far as helping you know mom out as far as uh doing what needs to be done every body helps but we seem to be the go to people at various times\n\nBack you're listening to executives radio host her co we'd like to introduce Valerie ... founder and CEO of via rebel reward Israel say what are you guys doing\nThe essay is a business to business lead generation farm we deliver qualified leads to medium size and large companies sales forces so that they can reach the next sales level\nThere are ... I have a hundred people ... and where you from originally I'm from Haddonfield New Jersey how many brothers or sisters I'm the oldest of five and what was the effect of you're growing up the oldest of five\nSo as the oldest of five I had to make sure that everyone was um my brothers and sisters we're all getting along I was not the caregiver for them but I did play a role model a role in keeping the family a harmonious\n[noise] some of the green room you described that his family peace keeper what did you mean by that\nWell I don't know that I particularly was the only piece of paper it was really the tell them that was set in my family that everyone would be respected and we would get along and we would understand each other's differences\nAnd how does how does that translate into your work life today\nYou know the work life that I created for a VISA the culture is very similar to the home that I was brought up in we a\nHave a culture of everyone respecting each other and making this a great place to work for employees wanting to come\nAnd and the green room you also said something that struck me as I said you're lucky to have your leaders who did you mean by that\nWell as the company gets bigger I have to play an outsized role just like I'm doing now and I have to trust other people to continue that tone that tone is so important from it that says this if those people are dumped by and then I won't have the company that I have and they do buy in\nA sari dowry when you're younger you liked developing new things that can you tell us about that\nYes and my whole life I I felt a little bit different than other people um I didn't want to run around and play I'd like to build and create and one example that I gave you earlier was this neighborhood club and my role was not as a president but still I was making sure the meetings came and we all\nDo you agree with you and your Letterman's how young were you when you were enjoying\nWent on I Would say that about ten or twelve we started the clubs where did you do I'm like you said that you did some fundraisers for the call we had a rapport we gave money to charities we read his idea was that that was mine and why I don't know I'd like to create and coordinate things and build things and I think like wander Switzerland\nTo do it for the incoming freshmen between starting things building things and creating things with this business\nThat's on I think that everything that's that I'm In charge of the business is thinking about where are we going next and how we're going to get there and how we going to build everything\nWe're doing with the Vikings ... valley what a what a mom and dad do for a living\nSo my dad is a pediatrician in fact three of my siblings are pediatricians and one is a doctor pharmacy\nAnd coincidentally I'm Andrew one of our guests are what is your dad was a pediatrician is that a crisis great\nSound you earlier we were speaking the grammar was pretty obvious to us that you have a great deal of respect for your father and I'm trying to figure out how the influence your business career in your business relationships [noise]\nI Do have a great deal of respect for my father and I think in large way I've modeled the way I run my business after the way that my father created the environment for his pediatric\nWhen you're talking about what do you mean what's the deal pediatric cook I Love him to do it but it's\nIt is more the how the organization Russ how everyone gets along is respected as valued I've ruined place at all\nNo interest in the valley where did loyalty and commitment come into play for you I understand when you started your business you started in your family room with two people and the people that were British with you that are with you\nToday you know the only way that people stay with you for a long time and that is the environment that we had people stay once they come and they say a hot a great place to work\nThe only way they're going to stay as if they feel valued and they feel it feel that they have a place and that's the environment that we've created I think it's the person that I was way back when I was eight years old [noise]\n... so you started your visit each forty six wars the competitive sphere come from\n[noise] so um my mother is a very driven person so the\nShe was a real it's real ... and I had not notice because many years of her life she was actually the caregiver but all of a sudden she becomes Israel at her and she's a driven person I'm saying wow this is my mother and I think as I work for more I'm seeing more and more my mother come out very driven\nTo do you think watching your brother's rational you told us they were wrestlers um what did you learn from that experience\n[noise] just keep on going and get up off the map when you're on the mat and get up off the bat I Do that every day\nYeah I bet and and did they teach you about competition you think\nI think it was really on the perseverance was just instilled from when we were young just just to keep on going and and stay tough\nAnd it it seems like you're in a business it requires that kind of the nation is attitude I mean it's not easy to set appointments or get sales yesterday\nGet rejections all the time every day multiple times a day\nIt's interesting to me and my sense of you is the reason you're doing\nIt's interesting to me I my my sense of you is the reason you're doing this isn't necessarily for the money for some other reasons I write about that you're very astute\nYes it is not at all for the money I Am not driven for the money I we happen to be successful [laughter] I'm I'm thrilled that we're successful but that's not what drove me nuts for tribes and\nI think that Dr is creating building [noise] and like the cost saving the Vikings conflict the Vikings club coordinating and and going always just testing the limits or can we go next and just having a lot of fun doing that and bring a lot of people on the\nWhole or are you for money and this was a lot of work but you said it's a lot of fun I'm trying to figure out is at work or is it fun [noise] I have fun doing a lot of work and what are you talking about can you tell me more about\nThat [noise] you know um what I Love best is looking back and say oh my God that was so hard but look what we got look what we achieve look when we came and every week I communicate with my I'm pleased to say this is what happened this week and this is why\nWe do what we do how do we how young were you when you did something to offer and what was it [noise] how young were you when you accomplished hoping for was it [noise] I\nSuppose I've always been accomplishing something tough but honestly everything seems like fun so um my first job was cleaning houses\nAre how young were you when you were cleaning houses [noise]\nWell actually I started cleaning houses at home at ... my mother for her and um I was actually kind of alters the freshman in college I didn't actually have a ... job until the end and where\nDid you do it through different than anybody else to clean houses I think I really actually cleans houses so you do when you do things you really put your soul your heart and mind body and\nAll the way I think that's what I instill and other people too but how I feel if you're going to do it you're going to do it totally thoroughly\nSo now I think you mentioned an earlier dad's an immigrant from ah from Germany and you said something about ah what do you try to instill in the household can share that with our listening audience and what effect to add on you today\nSo my father is all about keeping peace and harmony and household and that I think was ingrained in all of us when we were young my mother had the same value as well but I remember it mainly for my father and I think that's how I Am was friends with my business\nThat were you described success is bringing a lot of people along tell us what that means you have that feels\nReally important for me that whatever I'm doing and the success that I happened to be having that other people are having a similar success and it can be financial success it can be an emotional success to feel that you're contributing to something\nI Want those other people to feel what I'm telling you think there's a connection between that and why you have zero turnover or blow turn on well absolutely and I think so I mean people want to come to some place where they\nFeel valued and where they have a place and neither can very important to feel valued\nVotes so you're in a very competitive business and I'm just curious when you're on a sales call I'm speaking to a potential new prospect why would why would they hire you like what's the and how do you know there are good for you\nWell there's all sorts of criteria but I won't go into that but really we have to have a\nShared on value system I think the the ability to partner with a client and have and trust us I trust them and as they know that we're going to do the best for them and they have the patience to work with us in a partnership is really important\nTo me so it seems like you have a blend of very competitive people and then also the peaceful side of the family who's the most competitive amongst us your siblings\nAnd their shelves\nSell a wait and everyone is competitive and driven in their own way we did not fight with each other but we were all given this drive on\nI I don't I Can't give an answer to that her\nUm or your siblings or your your brothers and sisters surprise you wouldn't go to a point Chris\n[noise] honestly I don't think that my brothers and sisters really know the success that I've had I I'm not someone who brags about it I we don't really talk about my business and they don't talk about their practice either I I think if they really knew they would be very surprised because they had no idea what I Do every day or\nYou're not a real humble ... so true I think ah I Do have a humble side and that's sometimes kind of catching the way because I think I really shouldn't be at the mall but I asked what's the website address service I Am a prospect dot com\nWhat what what's the one core value that you hope your kids take away every day that you teach them how persistent for sure and and what what what do they teach you every day\nA patient [laughter]\nHow I'm going back to ... when we were talking earlier\nAbout your grandfather's work ethic it so it ... I'm sure that why you are the first ten and a lot to leave a I think so I didn't like what do you hear your grandfather you know like ... what is the one thing that he had to you that you bring to work with every day\nThe one thing that he had to you that you bring to work with you every day\n[noise] um [noise] can you remember all\nThat and not particularly we've always work the same my grandfather me and\nIt's it's a core value and our\nFor sure what's a core value what are you talking about just putting in your head\nIt or is it because of the money now what is it because I don't know ... [laughter]\nIt's just a hard working into right there to drive the fanciest car do I yeah ah\nI guess I Do in the office me while I mean you know do you do have the biggest house do you spend all the money I mean is it for the money not\nMoney for her to get back to the community we do how a\nFor my kids age groups um\nWherever so your commission or why why do you do that I don't\n... for punishment so is this or that you get onto the field and you go to the games as well I Do go to the games I coach as well where did you learn from little league do you run that you are using your ... business monarch brands\nUh is the same ... same skill set women being a little league commissioner as the same thing is running a business for sure what are you talking about we have ten twelve teams where hundreds of parents involved\nProblems you learn how to set up something that should work on paper and\nThrough obstacles so you're telling me that what you went through at sixteen years old setting up the hotdog cart and supervising the kids and what you do with little league is the same thing you do a work [laughter] yeah I guess up which is to figure it out how to you know said the people so it's interesting how through what do you think you'd\nFind out just inspired by your story I mean you're grinder you work hard your whole life and I'm just inspired I my my last question it's just when you were swimming and you're struggling with the doing those sets in those labs what'd you think about\n[noise] uh [noise] how am I going to get to the end of the wall [laughter]\nHe learned a lot about yourself in those moments you do\nA lot of time to think\nI'm Wondering if there's anybody in the shop there were a member of your grandfather would share this a feeling that session about who you are and who he was there there are a couple left that\n... hopefully they'll listen to this interview and a share of that ... had presidents how\nWhat's the um\nWe was what how can they asked the president and CEO of monarch branch what what is the website address stay for a monarch brand dot com how do you spell that I Know\nA.

saying that she had no plans to challenge his reelection however she said I'm not running for twenty twenty and I look forward to supporting the president and the next election\nAnd that was it and he you know he had some good things to say about her and that's it at forty six she definitely has a political brand she has a long political career perhaps in front of her members former South Carolina Governor now the UN position\nWho knows what's next for her so who stepped in in that position there are a couple of people\nWhose names have come up and ... are on the board for it we'll see but it's not Nikki Haley as of the end of the year so she stays through the next couple of months and then somebody else will ultimately step into that a rural so this transition\nI don't think was massively dramatic because it um it was she was nice about it they were there together at a press conference and that was it and um you know Nikki Haley the one thing that she's done\nPretty well as the leaky boat that happened at the White House and with the Republican she kind of kept that plugged up\nShe has only a few close people to her that she talks about anything to do with career move except for just a couple of key advisors so not very much leaks out let's put it that way there must be something I Would think\nIn the future for her because of her profile in her desire but what that is we don't know at this point we also don't know like I mentioned\nHow badly this hurricane is gonna rip through Pensacola\nShould alert every single person listening to the show right now if you're jogging and this morning and you're listening to the replay if you're listening to me live 'cause I Know how the world is sometimes you're on the third shift sometimes you're not\nTelling you if you want to surprise someone and you're renting a limbo limo and a lot of people that do that I mean I've been part of those groups where we say OK nobody's driving so that's great on us\nAnd we get this one\nI think it really brings up the questions of who's driving the limo what is not um you know are they certified ...\n\n... a million different kinds of questions like you know the other said something interesting thing to me said remember limousines are basically welded together think of what\nThe middle of the limousines are think of some of the really super big ones and the one that we're talking about this stretch limo people really jammed end so\nYou've got regular SUVs that have been jacked up and he made that point to me that this is what I'm reading in some of the reports from people a converted two thousand and one Ford Excursion that's what it was\nFor the modifications was that part of the problem was there some other factors that contributed to what to this tragedy\nYou know what is it proceeds limousine chauffeur services what it was a and they're doing a detailed internal investigation to determine the cause of the accident but I think that you got to look at limousines manner we look at regulations and weather\nReally they're good enough would you want to get into a limousine right now realizing\nWhat it's been converted from and yes I mean just because somebody has an accident that the most horrible acts that we've seen him in a very long time do you panic I think it makes you\nTake a closer look at what you're getting into your trusting with your life and\nDoing a little flus things even before the accident some of the people in the limousine we're taxing that they didn't feel safe\nI it was kind of like a foreshadowing moment so this needs to be I think a wakeup call to Amy one who is thinking of renting a limo just be very careful with these converted limos\nBecause a lot of them are converted they're smaller and then they make them big or this is a big thing because of the way they jak them up the way they look\nThey look cool but how are they link sending them how are they raising\nWell but how are they link sending them how are they raising them\nHow are they making the after market adjustments that they make how are they modifying it that's gotta be a very very big concern to anybody who's thinking about this anyway I went off in a tangent but a couple of you sent me notes about this I got this one [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] from Alford who says Kate I've driven limousine I've taken the limousines in my life and I think what's really to blame is the fact that somebody gets a limousine and they do all kinds of adjustments to it and then they take too many people in it\nAnd that's the problem it's human error I mean the driver wasn't even certified for goodness sake of someone who is driven limousine I Know just how risky that can be then I got this one from pat\nWho says boy I'll tell you what a I've written and all kinds of situations have been picked up from parties\nGone down town from further away in big cities I live in a rural area\nAnd often I'd take the whole Hoover lift deal\nBut I don't worry so much about that there's people that I've come to trust to know when I look at their record but that's different than his limousine where they were ... stuffing them in like they were stuffing all of us and obviously there were a lot of problems do you feel really sad when you\nRead the story of the the crash\nAnd um what happened and and\nHow so many of those were family members and no matter what the NTSB says Kate it can't bring back the lives of the people that were lost and they were young there was even some newly wed yeah there is some newly wed that\nUm we're in the limousine is supposed to be a big fun party and I think it was I said this what was that was listening to the first responder\nReally start to cry get choked up saying that people were alive when he was pulling them out and of course none of them live so I Hope that other people take a close look at it I mean look the funded riding a limousine if you were and then on the scene\nBut there's different kinds of limousines so I guess it's good to to really dig into the background um sometimes we get fooled into that security that that sense of security\nAnd we don't poke around enough and I hope this makes people laugh\nSome more questions that's all I Hope I have this one this from Anthony on hurricane Michael okay looking at uh Pensacola scares bejesus out of me I have family members there I heard you talk about Florida State\nAnd the fact that I'm Florida State is basically shutting down and telling people to go home and that's a smart decision because thousands of people would be there on campus and it's right in the eye of what looks to be a horrific\nStorm and who knows what the water is going to just be a wall of water\nAnd trying to escape that would be ridiculous so I Hope people are paying attention or people in their local news et cetera and they are boarding up and getting out and they're gone by the time you possibly read my email\nOr a ...\nAnd seeing the ... the big giant chunk of ... that just scream get out of there and that's what it looks like to me I mean it's you know nasty nasty stuff and then there's this one from Craig is Katie\nAnthony wiener who screwed up a lot of lives is being released from prison early I think it was one of the dumbest moves with Hillary Clinton to stick with\nHis wife who am I a dean when Anthony wiener was so toxic but anyway he's supposed to get out of prison three months earlier than originally was scheduled to what gives with that\nYeah he remembered this was since twenty Seventeen\nHe pled guilty to one in charge of transferring obscene material to a minor in a federal court and there was a Fifteen year old girl and it was and social media site for a couple of months so\nUm they're saying that there for good behavior for whatnot they he gets those um months I guess shaved off he was sentenced to Twenty one months altogether in\nA federal prison so his prison term would have ended in August the twenty ninth team his new release date I guess is is may and it is because of good conduct time earned that kinda thing\nAnd uh that's typical of what could\nHappen which is why you know that's that's why they're saying that\nSo I'm wow hey you know\nHe really did he can do a lot of people I mean ... I think he tagged even more a tank Hillary Clinton's ... remember the whole emails saying the FBI investigation surfacing and the email server on his laptop and uh the former FBI Director James Comey announcing the discovery\n\nAction day and yeah he he he definitely has some serious I going to say it's for not just that but a couple of different things he gets the past the first\nTime around when it happens again something happened and then he has the latest thing\nHappened um was the Fifteen year old girl and twenty six team that was just like I said talk to everyone around him I haven't heard that name a long time and for being\nWith us we jump over the other side and we're going to the man have of course here on American and I [noise] [noise]\nOh I might win do the inventor my jaw and like all year olds are problems would be almost original while I Would flip up all night long I Would wake up with a stronger now maybe or George I needed to know if you've been noise ... when I was very much all I wanted it to where you're coming\nOut in the field to give you the exact support you need is an individual regardless of sleeping in my\nJob will do during the ... the founder and you will stay there longer not about how much time we spend about it's about how much without ... we were just [noise] I Do all my own manufacturing measuring the United states I ever ...

Matt Ryan Aaron Rodgers highest paid quarterback I've paid quarterback highest quarterback\nAnd and uh somebody else Trump's them the key thing is the guaranteed money not the maximum value but the guaranteed money who is that\nAnd I'm Russell Wilson is one of those people\nPretty pretty interesting is that\nThe NFL is all about what's happening in the next week week sick in the NFL\nAnd it features a couple of um interesting games the browns how many overtime games can you play they've played\nThree overtime game\nThey won this last one thank goodness for bigger Mayfield a quarterback and the teams to their two two and one is not a strange line they take on the chargers at home their fans are so energized last time charters are only one point favorite in this game there's something to the magic of Mayfield I'm going to say\nThat I'm a mighty wind another one so then they would pick up their third what the world's going on with the Dallas Cowboys\nA situation where they have to win the game they're they are for ... and one and they don't go for it and even though they've gone for so many other times and they've been Ninety percent successful instead they decide to punch in overtime and they\nLose to the Houston Texans\nOn a Sunday night game now they take on Jacksonville at two and three\nAlthough this is a home game for them at AT and T. stadium you can just see the disgusting even after the game players were talking about not going for it on fourth one so I'm here we go I mean Jason Garrett to me if they continue to play this way\nI Would say his tenure as the coach\nCould uh easily on gravel let's put it that way and I think the um the decision and when you're in overtime when you have to close the deal sometimes you've got to take some risk\nAnd that would have been a well worth it I think risk do I know do I have a crystal ball and I can look into that crystal ball and say for sure of course I Can't say that\nOf course they can I mention the hurricane Michael we've been talking about a lot with a bearing down on Tallahassee and not just Pensacola Tallahassee right in that area Florida State Seminoles practice on Tuesday Morning coach Willie tigers that most of the team was gonna leave town afterwards Florida State\nHas a by this week they play October twentieth against awake at home and we'll see what kind of condition\nThe field is in because the storm is expected to make landfall along the pan holder on a panhandle rather a pen holder pan handle on Wednesday afternoon they got to get\nThe job so that's why they practice in and then we're out of here we're done we have to readjust\nExactly where we are going to do we are re adjusting and then we're back on the flip side driving back into the the nominee washing out of Washington D.

talk about protecting your data Matt welcome to the show first of all how old is a mobile device data security relate to personal finances are we talking about identity theft Iranian thanks for having me on\nTo personal finances are we talking about identity theft\nIranian thanks for having me on yet you know I did it that is certainly part of it\nBut more broadly speaking there's a risk to your credit score and overall personal data that because for a hearing to data security protection protocols that that we're going to talk about today is a clip your listeners with a tool to analyze data a shelter that data from outside and various actors as all the naval the audience they're rapidly adapt to the changes in the mobile computing environment\nGreat well let's start by discussing several a few concepts to keep in mind as released a mobile device security\nGreat too so first and foremost you keep your eyes and your application up to date a select the slick the option to update your applications automatically so they download\nThe latest version of your applications as well as your operating system [noise] I just setting as in different places on every divide but it should be created enable and it's going to allow you to ensure the running software that it's not going to cyber crime or data threat to the best or ability I also\nDon't put off the update the longer you wait the greater the risk that older versions may have old and then\nThat have been asked in more recent version or\nIn some cases your phone is going to ask me plugged in and connected to your your wireless network in order to form this update says set aside some time when your home or sleeping to make sure to download it can be completed\nBefore you need your call also you're going to want to make sure that the download went through a lot of your wife I connection or other connection issues can sometimes caused download the time out and you could get stuck running an older shopper version without even knowing it\nWow that is good stuff makes sense or do you have any helpful advice or in some guidance on best practices as it relates to downloading the apps\nAre already I certainly do um first you want to make sure you only download applications from legitimate ... friends send you an application or you read about something online search the application store on your device they probably have it and in its version is probably less risky\nThan when you download that new application you also want to read the fine print to make sure you understand what they plan to do with your data\nIn many cases you can opt out of features that make use of your personal data\nUnless you really need the additional capabilities associate with that teacher opt out to ensure your data doesn't end up where it shouldn't be included the application being allowed to post on your behalf the social media and had access to date on your phone such as pictures and contact access your camera access your location et cetera also\nUnderstand which of your applications make use of the microphone on your thought if you have one in some cases these applications back they were ... voice without your knowledge well check to see where your applications have this feature and disabled if you're not planning to use it\nWhile you're in that you bring up a good point about permissions especially given the recent press on data usage by some pretty popular social media platforms I mean these are great recommendations well worth the time and investment but if there's one quick thing that our listeners can do today to safeguard our mobile devices to ensure their content as secure what would that be\nThe rainiest there's one thing just make sure you lock your device on screen and you can lock this way to pin code a facial recognition for instance some circumstances um but\nIn addition and making sure that that anybody graduate I guess they don't do that then they can see all the sensitive information available on it or if your phone is a lot it could also allow them to eat Lance all malicious software so\nOn that note your best not to leave your mobile device remote devices outside of your ... outside of your possession addict physical access that device you are going to be accurate strange they don't want to get that opportunity\n[laughter] excellent advice man on a separate topic

[noise]\nOh yeah that's a I got to be honest with you one of the day or something I'll never forget and and and you you you hit on the\nOn the hat is that how active our guys are in the community and how we as to PA are trying to help facilitate those got you know some guys that I Want to help I Want to do something I just don't know how and we try to provide them the resources for doing it but a\n... you know so talking from a guy standpoint than I'll talk a little bit about the u._s. votes or um you know our guys we do\nWe do community envy piece of the week and and there's we we can't do enough of them because there's that many guys every single week I mean we get one off day a week It's Tuesday and it's not really an off one of those non often like yeah you guys are all in the sense I Can't tell you when they come in here but you better be here and the guys come in\nAnd they get their work done but then they go off they don't go home they go off to a school and read the kids they go off and raise money for whatever ah they feel passionate about any cancer research and helping small kids and doing all these wonderful things that are ...\nYou know there's always going to be you know this was some guy than any population that don't do the right thing and and but at the same time I'm proud to say that Ninety nine percent of our guys to do the right thing and I I think that can't be state of the knock them then we started talking about a year or so during the spring of a\nTwo thousand twelve I got to go to ah ah to um Kurdistan so we flew in demand is Airforce base their ... their air tram that they were very specific don't call it a better air transit uh area\nAnd then from there we took to Casey one thirty or some rangers and cheat or ... or ... or drop off if they were happy to Kandahar a from a shutdown we went up and down the west coast of Afghanistan\nI'm seeing ... hanging out a lunch and breakfast dinner is doing the talk of all the guys up and down from ... to get back to shut down enough to think about what's just north of there on the highway there but uh\nIt was a it was fantastic I mean it was just one of those it's one of the things I've always been interested in foreign policy always been interested in things or what we're doing over in the ... outside of America\nI and I don't have any family that I served I I don't come from the era of days so you know my friends' parents or anybody else they don't really serve\nAnd so I didn't I didn't I didn't understand the military culture in a sense of that first hand knowledge but getting the guards were there and getting to um just have like I said just have lunch with a guy who just talk with them it was\nIt was really on on firing a professionalism or that goes into what they do and and how proud they are up and they should be proud because the work they're doing obviously it's under foil conditions\nAnd it's tough work and they do with a smile and it was just such such an odd inspiring trip up seeing really ... and in a large way very eye opening seeing the\nAmount of resources we've put into that country and seeing how big these spaces are and and everything that goes into it and how the interplay of guys you know whether you're working in just six or you're a war fighter or whatever you're doing you have that role and you got to get your role as well as you possibly can and that's\nAgain each are talking about some similarities of teams that it was just\nSeeing again seeing those guys are the professionalism it was just a wonderful trap and I'd go I'd go back over there and do whether it's Afghanistan or even to Germany where we have so many station or Japan were if some of these stations to go see him in a second because just getting a sitting to spend a week where those guys\nJust it just fills me up and fired and that was it was really really cool and I still again I fell I saw pictures on my phone number I tell people about it all the time it was there was one of the best trips I've ever been on\nYou know I'd buy embedded in Iraq in a three times in Afghanistan and that you do know people shoot at you know over there right\nNow I Know about you know where they were but yet you were willing to take that chance and go\nWell you know it was a it was I going to be a really funny story quickly so what do you get over there you got the man is they give you the full kind of battle radical you know you got to get the aren't you got to get some fast you got to get the heart\nHat or any kind of started thinking like this behind them as soon as you are\nThis is this is like a one of those but this these tours this is the real deal I drink given me a full for best for a reason that dot com yeah you have to wear those when you're in these areas graying is lost all okay this is for real now and so\nOn and I can't tell you how Steph my back was\nHave you ever thought about just sitting down and train and come up with some sort of\nA cumulative list if you will um the what the players do hours they uh they contribute to their communities in dollars they contribute a foundation and all that so ... you know\nI'd love to have something like that so we can just put in some people's faces\nThat's a great you know that's a great idea I'm gonna I'll put that down because I think sometimes you see the one off dry you say you

with a special heart condition that his son had\nRaised amazing amounts of money actually as as push legislation\nEven in the north Carolina state house in in in the Senate there to move legislation to help families with similar heart conditions to tell you how much she has done and and the guys you know whether it's\nIn Houston where I was and I mean the amount of money but I think you're right I I think the you know maybe we need to start thinking of instead of just highlighting the individuals which I think needs to be highlighted really started taking I holistic ... and ... and come up with a comprehensive year to year number because I think that will really grabbed\nMaybe the imagination and grab people and the general public a little more of the power of the uh the amount of money that has been raised in is in is currently being raped year after year\nOur the the amount of money that I had been raised in is currently being right year after year\nYeah absolutely a thanks for
