as well as the migrants from Congo has also joined the migraine caravan\nLast month we had a ... migrants from Africa from Central Africa with Ebola type symptoms of eagle pass Texas that was reported out of the Ebola outbreak map dot com website which I Know how to\nHelp people out with these kind of things that happen unless the mainstream news on your listeners probably would take notice of this aspect as well um because the dry buys don't like to talk about that because I think well there's a lot of votes um that migrants talking about diseases coming across the border and ditch and it gave you have you been to that website as well\nI have not actually no I'm not I've I've heard of it I have not visited no sir\nIt's called is caught Ebola outbreak map saw math like a math like it like

resource for everybody that courage to go on there especially I ... I was going to be voting for Trump\nBecause I see this problem in our country with migrants with diseases and things that are doing to our country and it's going our country has it's been so long the wrong way and this is a nationalism everybody even look at Kennedy JFK used to say it was a Democrat\nAnd he said that look into what you said that you should get Kennedy said we need to do with that statement instead of a study care what Americans should care about\nFast not ask not what you you go to your country can do for you ask and said well you can do for your country it was the most famous line\nYeah yeah that's that's what I'm thinking I Wish you all America's care about our country on our borders as not can take a democratic it's just being an American and we as Americans we should care care about our borders and our country\nAnd it was great why is that is a great point because you're right President Kennedy who is a very different kind of Democrat than the than the modern day progressive Democrats but that is very very true I Wonder what they would say about that that is an expression of national nationalism unlike any other isn't it\nAsk not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country what can you do for this nation maybe not for the world not for the United nations not for you know foreigners what can you do for this country that's your job that's your responsibility because it is about a spur of the nation first\nThat's or national doesn't mean that is not a dog whistle it's not some sort of a coded language it is simply a statement of I pledge and that's why I said this before I pledge allegiance to the flag\nOf the United states of America anybody who's ever re sided that pledge is saying\nThis is where my allegiance lies I don't pledge allegiance to the flag of the United nations don't pledge allegiance to the flag of Canada or Mexico where to France or Germany or to uh to uh uh Switzerland or to\nUh to the Dominican Republic or to a Guatemala or anywhere else I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United states of America\nAnd that means I'm a national ... there's no coat in it there's no racism and that there is no bigotry and then we need to stop this nonsense right now stop letting the Democrats define language to us Diane is calling us next from Greenville South Carolina Thank you for joining us now and go right ahead\nHey how are you wonderful day less than a couple of things as a as a trail patriot and a non ... first thing as a last spring getting what happened to a thousand sexual look at look at people Trump is drawing\nTens of thousands of people um the Trump ... the ...
