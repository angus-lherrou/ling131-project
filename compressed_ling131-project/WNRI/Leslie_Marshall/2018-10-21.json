thirty the really bad news is what the crux God is much more thorough than estimated before it's considered to be the worst breach ever\nOf the Facebook social media platform\nAnd the crux have a lot of stuff like\nThey might have your contact information like your phone numbers as they have for\nA many millions of people somewhere Fifteen twenty million they have information on your email address

been searching on on Facebook last physical locations you ban that\nDetailed profile information they did not get\nYour password at least at this time there is no information that they have your password or credit card information but one area where I Do urge real caution with Facebook is that you do in fact change\nWith Facebook where you no longer use Facebook as a way to sign in two other accounts you know how often you don't sign up with somebody and one of the options do offer you\nIs to use Facebook as your sign in putting too many eggs in one basket there and I don't want you to doing that anymore and when you do get involved with social media\nKnow that the information they're creates Boehner abilities that go much deeper than you might imagine including potentially\nRating

you may have pre diabetes and you can do it and do I have pre diabetes that or if you're probably not going to argue kids were listening to the radio you're busy which is great because people can't get pre diabetes or mine I read that wrong\nDo visit and do I have pre diabetes that or do take a short\nAnd the homes are built to withstand a cat five hurricane plots and the windows may not survive they may blow out the home itself is a hundred percent structurally sound\nAnd all that has to be done is that supposed out there is no issue with mold and so the reason I bring this up is we in America face an increasing problem with flooding from population growth um increase rainfall for a cycle of that\nAnd much of the United states and there are so\nAnd much of the United states and there are so many techniques that can be used\nThat will make homes and people in them safer make the structures more solid I went and toured\nA neighborhood in Holland is a an area is subject to flooding a lot of Holland is below sea level and they now have these homes for blood flowing error prone areas that I went to see that the homes rise with the rising water\nAnd the cost of constructing them no higher than normal construction it's just really thinking how you build for circumstance we in the United states tend after a flood or disaster to rebuild exactly as we did before\nAnd a lot of these things if we think about how do we prepare\nFor the unexpected\nA lot of these things don't cost in many cases any more money or just little amount photo incremental amounts to make a structure much more robust make it safer and\nEliminate the thing of wash rents and repeat where property gets destroyed and then you have to rebuild and then another a active nature happens you have to rebuild they can go on and on there's no need for us to be fatalistic about this\nThis is an area we just need to be practical\nRalf ... is with us on the Clark Howard show ... Ralph\nHello Clark thanks for taking my call\nAbsolutely how you doing\nI'm doing great we uh recently moved back for a living overseas for many years and he appreciated older say he said you have to say to make out of the integration love cheese area because so many things have changed and very grateful put all your life to give it a so thanks for that\nWill give a little back story where have you been living in for how long\nA first relief to the u._k. hold about five years in Switzerland for seven and but in Hong Kong for two years\nMy goodness and do you have kids that speak like twelve languages now\nNo kids so\n[laughter] how are you have any language is do you speak at this point\n[laughter] well three fluently and to a little bit so fantastic\n[laughter] and uh I speak\nEnglish and enough Spanish to be able to find the bathroom\n[noise] well see that's all you needed you just need to be able to or the food and drink in line and then you got to go [laughter]\n[laughter] um one thing I'm curious about after\nAll those years away did you have a hard time reestablishing your credit score getting um auto insurance anything like that worry those areas difficult for you when you re integrated metal in the U. S.\nNo because we we have an address ... thanks very good friends of ours and we also had a home outside a plan to on a lake that we ... we never from that point of view we didn't leave [noise]\nWell that's great because you know the financial reintegration can be really difficult for people who are gone for a number of years but how can I be of service you today\n[noise] well the last thing that we wanted to do is we purchased the book and to do our banking and financial as you have supplies [noise] and I did some research on your website on that as well but\nI'm not quite sure whether I Need to set up a new Gmail account all the way that I can use social Jews and access to all to get that going\nWonderful question and when you're starting from scratch using a segregated computer using chrome book for financial it is recommended that you set up a separate Gmail account they would not integrate because you know with Gmail with Google accounts\nWhen you sign into a computer it just kind of automatically populate everything from a prior went on and so having that separate gene male is the best idea you can do to protect yourself and protect what you do elsewhere\nHow much was the chrome book he bought just or financial\n[noise] uh I don't know my life and it's fully or service Salter no\nWell happy anniversary I'm sure she's very little money\nI'm sure she did because she listens to to of course\nA perfect so with the chrome buck the whole idea of a ... where Ralph and I are talking about is they are ultra inexpensive right now routinely available to a hundred bucks for new ones not ... or anything like that\nAnd they are not prone to the same problems with viruses that can happen to a windows computer or a Mac\nAnd so using chrome book for financial only know Web surfing no email not then no social media just\nBuilt pay banking brokerage those kinda things creates an additional protection for you from people who would try to mess up your life\nBy creating financial chaos emptying your accounts or whatever and so chrome books are the safest\nWay I Know to do that stuff and having a separate one just for financial is something I very much want small businesses to do to protect themselves because where we as consumers have a lot of protection under the law if we get hit by a hacker\nBusinesses generally don't have those same legal protections which is why also in addition for businesses I recommend that you get um insurance to protect you from data breaches from hackers\nAnd having this kind of coverage is something very few small businesses have but if you got wiped out of your small business\nBecause of a hacker what would happen next that's why having the insurance is so key\nChris is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Chris\nClark thanks for taking my call\nSure Chris you got to a modern puzzle for me\n[noise] well yeah I saw a lot glad to hear that actually I uh applied for a life insurance and they set up a ... on his ...\nAnd all I ask what does all of our say take your height white blood pressure\nAnd and they take a blood sample of them ... know that that blood sap that'd be used for testing and I actually called a call and your team and your taste fantastic by the way\nOh thank you and power and a a team not Clark Howard at your team but Howard said they're called the state or insurance and I said that's a great idea so I gave them a call\n... after a few departments or later I finally spoke with somebody and and the lady said that she could almost guaranteed that wouldn't happen\nThere's nothing in the law that prohibits said at this time so there was a law passed it\nThere's nothing in the law that prohibits at at this time so there was a law passed a decade ago they were headed your DNA from being used genetic testing or being able to you be used for health insurance but since then as more and more\nInformation has become available through genetic testing and how easy it is for people to do it the law has never been updated to cover\nLife insurance long term care disability insurance and so this is an area that the feds need to be all over in the Congress\nAnd not permit genetic discrimination so I don't know I don't know anybody doing it yet just like you were told by the person at the state insurance department emphasis on yet\n... says that I had actually called the last ... said she said it was a note for a short genetic test for and I think the lab is dating and instructions to do that I Would say they would do a\nBetter they would not do that and you know there's there's a question so many of us like me are done twenty three and me and done ancestry dot com and there's so much information out there and their crimes being solved where people who haven't even participate in genetic testing\nAre being found by other people's results who've done genetic testing so this is a bit of a Pandora's box and the law is behind on it and so far\nSo far don't worry that anybody is doing that diabolical early in the insurance industry\nRecall Pauline herself at seven six nine ball for six nine thanks for your support W. an outright win socket\n\nMatinee

of news that has been sort of like a really kind of hitting might be the most is the one that I think a lot of people are seeing it's much more for the film fan and the horror aficionados like myself\nAnd that is a little bit of a bear trap that Jason Blum has stepped into this week Jason Blum is most famous for running bloom house which is one of the most profitable studios in America\nIt was famous for running bloom house which is one of the most profitable studios in America at\nThis time I mean grant he's not making these three hundred million dollar movies like the Avengers he's making a lot of smaller independent horror films he's basically using the model\nThat was done in the eighties with the slasher movies and that's appropriate because that's what Halloween what that's what the thirteenth was in fact really more than anything else right is is their teams\nPut this formula together whether they spent less than a million dollars or maybe a billion maybe a million and a half dollars to make these small budget horror movies that within twenty thirty million dollars or more in the theaters and that's all you needed to drop profit [noise]\nAnd so he put that model together recently he started with paranormal activity was one that really kinda rocketing bloom house to fame or better and I'm like too many movies are are cheap movies to make their video cameras and they're limited fats limited cast\nAnd that's the formula you don't spend a whole lot of money making the movie and then the movie doesn't have to make two hundred million dollars to be a hit it just has to make twenty thirty million and their mood doing movies like truth or dare\nAnd that's one that came out earlier this year that was kind of garbage but he does a lot of PG Thirteen sort of disposable love horror movies out there that that like I said it's very comparable to the eighties slasher movies and the harm that came out back\nThen so he's a very profitable producer\nHe was in an interview this week and he essentially said I'm going to paraphrase I'm not going to read the exact quote being confided if you really want to his actually said that they don't hire female horror movie director because there aren't very many out there and he basically 'cause there's very few female directors out there and even fewer that want to work in her now he\nMentions some of the female directors that are well known like the woman who directed about a duck or something like that and he's been trying to get her to sign onto a project but scheduling doesn't always work and blue house cranks and stuff out really quickly\nThat of course caused\nA huge firestorm in the horror community because there's a lot of ... women involved in hard there's even a month dedicated to women in horror month and ... there's a lot of guys into horror but there's also a lot of women in the ... and you don't have to get the the big names like Jennifer ... best known for doing the ... you can\nGo after some spellings or even like the Oscars sisters who did American Mary and the remaking of David ... film now so there are women out there that are directing horror\nOn around the middle around ...\nCould reverse perjuring for current I'm from Maryland ... learn more about the ... or ...\n\n\nAnd welcome back to back guys at the movie with Kevin car here we are two weeks before Halloween Halloween falls in the middle of a week so it's really only a week and a half until Halloween [noise]\nSo we only have one more weekend after this to really fully enjoyed Halloween spirit and go do the crazy stuff on friday and Saturday nights\nAnd then we have Halloween which falls on a Wednesday nice kind of like it went Halloween falls in the middle of the week because that's one trick or treaters and it makes a little more easy when Halloween falls on a friday gets really messy we I I was still trick or treat these ten\nBut I I liked what falls in the middle of the week because then you could enjoy up in the middle of the way we can get so busy and crazy and uh you know Halloween on a Saturday as as kind of a nightmare but since we're going back\nTo the Halloween movies and we're looking back at them because we have a new Halloween film it's still third movie\nTitle Halloween you had the original Halloween and Nineteen Seventy eight\nWith John Carpenter directing then you had the awful just truly terrible Rob Zombie remake in two thousand seven I think\nAnd now this was also caught Halloween it's the sequel to Halloween it gets a little confusing and sort of like how when they made a prequel to John carpenter's the thing in two thousand eleven and they just called it the thing so they have the thing which is a pretty cool too\nBut the thing it's it's it's a dumb way of naming things that Hollywood but you know who knows [noise] anyways I wanted to look back at the Halloween franchise because a couple of years ago I went over to a friend's house and we've been watched all the friday the thirteenth movies all in one day\nThen we did that a couple months later with Halloween and we did that with nightmare on elm street and I will say that while Halloween the original Halloween is my favorite\nCreditors are teachers the most consistent through the series Halloween ... it has a great strong start but it it it deteriorates faster and I kinda wanna look back at those Halloween movies\nBut of course you have the original song I got a kind of hard that out on its own no pun intended because it's the one that started at all [noise]\nAmerica [noise]\nYears ago\nA New Years trying to reach\nA level of seven tries to Cape ... because I realized what was living they heighten that boy's eyes was killing simply\nWas the original it's still a scary movie I mean it seems rather tame by today's standards I never saw it in Nineteen Seventy eight because I was like seven what came out that was way too young to go see it\nI should not have seen that movie when I was seven I ended up watching it oh gosh I think I watched it on paid them back at a friend's house when I was probably I don't know eleven or twelve I was pretty young to see it and it was a big deal because it was an R. Rated movie and it had boobs in it\nBut I remember we were watching it on this tiny little TV I mean it was you know nowadays kids don't understand nowadays every even this multi these are big and they watch some other folks but you can put the phone five inches from your face but\nI remember sitting there and my friend's house watching it on this probably twenty inch TV\nAnd his dad came in the room and and start feeling grabbed her legs ... because we were both facing the TV on the screen I mean there's a lot of fun and it was the original slasher the original Halloween is as close as you can get to sort of that perfect movie it has the trappings of its era I mean at the seventies movie\nYou've got the fashions you've got the limitations from the seventies movie but the thing is for a slasher movie which is a fence or just as it started the slasher crazy you don't need\nA whole lot of big special effects so you don't need a big hit for something like this you can do and affect the movie with some camera tricks and it was John Carpenter at the top of his game and yeah he had done some interesting stuff beforehand like assault on precinct Thirteen\nBut this really galvanized him as a heart director and his output from Halloween heart is amazing because you have Halloween and then of course you had the thing in Nineteen eighty two\nAnd you had the fog in Nineteen eighty which was really interesting movie\nAnd you had like prince of darkness later on and they live and big trouble in little China all that out put through the eighties was launched with Halloween and I think it really pushed all the way until you got to in the mouth of madness in the nineties which I talked about a couple of weeks ago when it came out on Blu ray\nBut you can never be the original so that's one of my favorites but then there's sections\nAnd I I don't like to break it down to a movie I like to break down in ... in the first sequels which was Halloween too on Halloween three seasonal which I've talked to great length about how much I Love Halloween three\nHalloween to find that it's an okay sequel it's it's worthy for it it's a successor but it's it's kind of redoing things that just puts them in a hospital instead of out in the trick or treat night\nBut those are the first because they were trying to figure out what to do with the franchise 'cause these horror franchises hadn't really been done before so they had the direct sequel than they did the anthology style one and and that kind of killed the franchise for about five years and you got to realize that\nBack then that was an eternity for a horror movie I mean front of the thirteenth was doing one right after another every year there was a friday the thirteenth movie coming out because they're cheap easy to make and you can do them quickly on a low budget but it wasn't until Nineteen eighty eight that they ... boot of the series with Halloween for\nStarted this three episode run of Halloween four or five and six and\nIt was every ten years this movie gets booted and they got repeated in Nineteen eighty eight and so you had these one where you had the the this new little girl the kids from the original movies where the the two that she was babysitting had grown up in like in part fix your\nPoll run playing an older Tommy oil and this was in the nineties by that point\nAnd those things do fall apart very quickly I mean part for is interesting in part by is\nOkay and parts six is a mess but I I appreciate them trying to do what they tried to do in part fix but part fix is tough to watch\nBut then the next three boot comes in the Nineteen Ninety eight when they did Halloween age too well and here's where it starts to get really confusing because they have Halloween one two three to four or five and six all follow the same story well age to always a sequel to Halloween too and they bring back Jamie Lee Curtis so this was the\nWas the third movie she did but technically she had done\nFor because she shows up as a voice on the phone line and Halloween three\nBut she doesn't have a part of Laurie stroke but this is her coming back is Laurie Strode and I remember being a big deal because those Twenty years later age too well and this is a pretty good solid horror movie it reeks of the nineties and it feels like\nThat sort of dawson's creek car that you got with stuff like the faculty which are fun and and now that we're Twenty years out of those\nThey can work as nostalgia for the nineties but then you know ten years after it was it kind of suffered a bit\nBut it's holding up now in in the style to look at nineties Har so each was actually really pretty good not as good as the original but it still was a good little re boots\nAnd then they did Halloween resurrection which tanked hard that one was terrible that's what Busta Rhymes doing it and this was by this titles I think two thousand two and Jamie Lee Curtis shows up in that movie very briefly but gets killed right away\nAnd that was sunk lower than episodes sex\nAnd then they said what is going to rebuild the whole franchise so in two thousand close to two thousand and it was I think two thousand seven that robs zombie did his categorically terrible films because he completely miss understood\nOr who Michael Meyers was the terror of Michael Meyers was it was this average everyday normal kid\nWho was a psychotic murder and that's what was so terrified he just made Mike Myers into this white trash hobo family that was abusive and mean and and and so the terror of what she becomes isn't that core of evil and\nAnd then and then it goes completely off or elsewhere [laughter] with Halloween to the sequel that Rob Zombie those are terrible I don't know anything that's better than those I think is a step in the right direction [noise]\nSo that brings us to forty years later we get the third time the series has been boosting gets removed and we'll be talking about that at the end of the next break along with the movie the oath on fat guy's among\nIf you're a baby boomer with one hundred thousand or more of an vegetable assets this may be the most

that's not necessary I mean that's what it's about but that's not what the movie become here's the thing about this loyalty oath that people are supposed to signed by the day after Thanksgiving and there's the department of homeland security that are in in vest the gate and and here's the thing\n... at one point this is about politics of Thanksgiving and look in a couple of weeks we're all going to feel this ourselves we're all going to go to banks giving dinner we're all going to do a big political argument or we're going to have the person they're yelling no politics a dinner\nBut what's more interesting about this movie is what happens after the big family fight is one the authorities come in for something and how quickly it escalates\n... and and why it escalate and challenges you if you can get past the politics of challenges you to think what would I Do in the situation what is too far when do they go too far when does it overreaching what would you do and where would you draw the line and it's a good point to ... like you said it's overly political but\nI think of it and this turns even if if if you agree with the politics of the movie find go in and look at it as that but if you disagree with the politics of the movie will get into saying what if there was a loyalty oath for the guy that I didn't like\nAnd just sit there and say oh well then he also sort of thing in the past all never do those that's not that's out of the realm of possibilities there's other things in this movie where they show just nastiness\nOn the streets for people to people and and you and and those are real things that happen you see I'm On Facebook can you see him spread through viral videos the very things that are being shown in this movie and and even though the department of homeland security parts doesn't exist\nYou can see where overreach can happen where things aren't handled properly and when you put somebody in a position of authority over somebody else they have a potential abuse their power and they may not be the best person to handle that and they can escalate\nAnd work and go from there and it can get ugly and all\nThose things exist and you know crime and did it to the Japanese internment camps I there was a loyalty oath going around during McCarthyism and I mean now there's like things in like political rallies here and there that have shown up but I mean\nYou know you may be able to like okay I agree with the guy who was in office but what if the guy is you don't agree with spin off as you want to have a loyalty pledge then and look we are one big terrorist attack away from a something like this\nYou just throw patriot in front of it and that's how we got the Patriot act which has some great things in it but there's some not so great things in the Patriot act and that thing got pushed through after nine eleven\nThat's I think what this is about it's about a bigger picture outside of current partisan politics of today so I'm going to say the oath rock says well well actually\nThat's it but the thing when I Need to go to a break when I come back and what are we talking about an evening with Beverly Laughlin the box office in the

an absurd comedy it's one of those weird quirky things something like that David Lynch would have done only has more of a plot to it then that's dinner David Lynch movie this is\nStrange it feels like one of those things I Would have come from the nineties it reminds me of the stuff that the guy who did a Jared ... the guy who did Napoleon Dynamite would do where people have an odd way of dressing in an odd way of acting and they have obsessions about different things [noise]\nBut this does not exist and pragmatic reality we're version of reality in some ways it feels like it's something that could have been made in the nineties and I say that but there's a lot of independent cinema\nThat was really charged in the nineties and there's some really neat stuff that came out of independence and I'm In the Nineteen nineties\nAnd this feels like it would have been part of that because it kind of has a fashions that go back Twenty years to the seventies now the fashions go back forty years it has a really good cats that has like R B closet and it just got your main Clement it's got Craig Robinson and it's got Matt\nBarry ... that theory was in the IT crowd he played Douglas rental and he was also in Tulsa of London now if you look at the sheep they'll say oh from Christopher Robin and using that Christopher Robin movie but he played like a police officer just what we want a bit\nHe's best known for his work on my toes to one didn't in the IT crowd and he's good in his movies kind of like a grounding forced to Craig Robinson character Beverly ... flip this was weird and quirky it's directed by the guy who did the greasy strangled which I haven't seen but I'm now interested in checking out because it is bizarre enough to like but you gotta like something strange and weird and\nAnd you know something like Napoleon Dynamite or something like uh what was the other one he did not know gentleman Broncos\nWhich apparently nobody likes to accept me\nSo this was a neat movie but you have to be on the right mood and you have to look for something weird quirky and bizarre and if you do like that you can check this out and actually have a lot of fun watching it uh it it it doesn't make a whole lot of sense all the time but it still enjoyable to watch\nSo I'm gonna have to say it kind of rock cat rock [noise] listening to fat guy at the movies with Kevin car let's
