ceases to amaze me how professional an excellent\nOur law enforcement people are they are truly amazing\nAnd and in fact one of the things I said for all the years that you know the top press is not that effective bought the day in and day out people who do the job are terrific and it was good to see by the way the FBI Director make a statement about the effectiveness of his team\nAnd others who helped out\nActually I don't want you but I felt the FBI Director disappeared and he was on the FBI's ten most wanted list you know never hear from him in his life he doesn't exist\nI've not been

not being dismissed by the president is goes all the issues and people you know with the Mueller investigation and everything else that's going on and\nHis next attorney general wouldn't be approved right now when you know what do you want another uh Kavanaugh hearing to take place this is not the time\nBut he's never lived up to the expectations I have for him and I think many others did too and

setting fire to the airwaves it's though Larry Elder show\nMark I'm filling in for Larry Elder of the pain free will eat factor dot com studios and as\nSaid when I get calls at eight eighty nine seven one plane soldier calling about your reaction to everybody in the media seems that way to make a\nCertainly on the left trying to blame President Trump for what this crazy guy did as if this guy did it because of what President Trump says because of course everything that goes wrong is President Trump's fault and everything\nRight like our economy is because of President Obama and if you didn't know that just that person will pop up he he mentions it all the time I was calling me that's because of what I start okay which by the way explains why they were so against now justice Canada it wouldn't have mattered if the president had nominated a left is like the pope\nWhatever the president's for their against remember they were against whoever the nominee was they didn't even know the name it didn't matter they have their son's ready that is their basic platform this November and it doesn't matter if the president has done a great job none of it matters they hate him and they hate him with a passion\nYou know I felt that we reached the uh the top with George W. Bush and their hatred duck this one is being surpass\nThis bumbling fool could never had beaten their candidate and they will never acknowledged the great things that he has done so these\nActs will not long be about this evil did you notice just like it wasn't long about they usually for that didn't last it wasn't about her it was about the Democrats regaining power so she she's like an asterisk now that's what she's gonna probably being history\nSo it'll just be always about ... President Trump and all Republicans because we're evil and they are not you get it\nWhich is even more reason why you have to vote tell me what you think is a set of eight eight eight one eight eight eight nine seven one stage\nIt has also been amazing to see the Democrats in the meeting in action you know the Democrats they're going to use these acts to the partisan advantage but for the media to be so blatant in their advocacy\nDoes all new in the age of Trump they haven't been on partial to their views for many years now with a lot of us know that that's not a secret\nBut they used to pretend here's the difference that they were not by is no more now does out in the open with their advocacy and you can even see it in their questions what's his name Jim Acosta from CNN hardly hiding his disdain for the president I'm telling you you could see that in his questions\nThey're out to get the president and make no mistake about it and the media has an enormous power to influence the debate and our elections and the president is right to call them out on this some of the president has rightly called up a press for who they are and the press cannot deal with it in their righteous indignation\nAnd just today I was watching getting ready for the show there was Shepard Smith on Fox saying that Trump's phrase lock her up and the chance to encourage in that vein and CNN sucks are the kinds of things that ... that people like the suspect on so very was Trump is responsible for it\nBut those of us on the right blame people with bad values for bad acts not those who share their political views but of course that we're on the right blamed Bernie Sanders for his support or remember who shot the seriously injured Congressman Steve Scalise\nThe supporter remember that who shot and seriously injured Congressman Steve skull east and the other cars when he would have wiped the matter of fact what President Trump is responsible no matter what he says even when he tries to unify of seasonal\nCNN is hopeless by the way I I Try to watch what's the other one MSNBC it's it's not easy watching these channels I I live in another planet and there's a real argument to be made for not letting Hillary Clinton be above the law yeah CNN is hopeless that's my point and President Trump is right and\nA lot of supporters are people who are arguing with me when I've done all of the shows\nThey said how could you say you know 'cause my position if Hillary and bill will agree never bother us again and leave the scene which is I Know it was impossible it's not going to happen then I might agree not to indict or if I had any power to say that oh you could imagine the calls I got mark how could she be above the law and they had a great point\nThat it's not inciting people to riot or to physically harm someone that is a legitimate political asked to see\nWhat it's actually see on the right and for the Democrats and the left and now the media that is unacceptable\nSo they're almost all on the left and we're fortunate to have someone like President Trump called them out we've had so many we presidents in the past\nAnd it's absolutely refreshing to see someone to take it back to that even if the media the left the Democrats can't take President Trump is not responsible for the craziness in our country [noise]\nTell me what you think as I said eight eight eight nine seven ones sage and let's try to get a caller to in Houston, Texas let's go to Mark Mark you're on with mark Hi Mark\nHi Mark that Mark I'm what you were bringing up about a media is absolutely true\nThey don't want to report the fact that this is a cycle and he has a psycho prior\nTo threaten to blow up Florida light power and I don't know some other bomb threats to sow what Trump responsible for though no he happens to be just you know the the ... the the course of the ... now and another distinction is the fact that\nYou know Trump literally to not say let's go blow them up or any of the worst you said a few times during his is a a a a not is Canada seat while he was trying for a couple of times he said oh yeah go ahead on the face or something like that that was that\nBut he hasn't done anything like that where the the lab whether it's the actual a political people or the the news\nOr they've all actually said that\nAre going out and confront them and and and and and run them out of the stores all this other stuff so um again that's that's part of the contrast in different\nYeah like Maxine Waters right get in their face wherever you see them you know don't let them leave especially if you know they're in the cabinet ... this is what they do when they do it's OK mark don't you get that\nOh of course it's the the the ultimate double standard that everyone recognizes that accept them well they'll they recognize it but they're not going to say it and even\nMost of the hard core I Would say you know a intelligent Democrats because that's the other thing to what they're doing and the people that are acting out these acts of violence most of these are actually borderline psychotic that are reacting to something there that way\nIf the Trump arrangements so now they could argue that that's the cause of it now too and that makes them psychotic\nYeah it ... you know that's what they would say no question about it breaking ATF news just recently in the U.S department of education announced that acting on a complaint filed by alliance defending freedom against the Decatur, Georgia city schools\nIn his opening an investigation into a
