CEO and founder of assets map\nCarol barber is the president a friend's life care partners and Chris Hanlon is the founder and chief creative officer of handling the creative excellent what's keeping our first guest Kevin ... who is the president and CEO of new pinpoint angel Kevin ... what is new to financial how small how large is more you guys\nYour financial is national mortgage lender located in Plymouth meeting we have about twelve hundred employees and uh right now are making about eight billion dollars worth of mortgage loans a year ... was\nTwelve hundred employees eight billion dollars a year is a large organization and where are you from originally I was born and raised in the little town called Bayonne New Jersey north Jersey and how many brothers and sisters\nHave a four boys and the family a brother to brother who's a year younger and then a a half brother or\n... so Kevin we were talking in the green room to your uh your parents got divorced at a young age how old are you and when that happened I was eight years old when they got divorced and and how did that affect you\nI always liked to say that that the primary way would have affected not just me by my brother's as well is that we were forced to grow up very quickly I look back at that time and say that it's a transition point where I was forced to become an adult in it or a short period of time\nAnd you you you found yourself or who they need to make money at an early age what was what was your first job when you started making money\nMy first I applied for a job at a supermarket it was an acme supermarket [noise] and I saw an opening for a deli clerk and filled out the application did the paperwork got the job offer showed up and when they learn that I was fourteen years old and that I was too young to operate the equipment uh told me that\nI wasn't going to be able to to get the job and I just\nHeard someone you started that job at the acting you how long did you say the act me\nI said at the acme uh all the way through my a first year of college\nThat's an unusual amount of time for\nA kid your age or what what job did you start with and what job did you end up at ...\nAn interesting question I I started it ended in in the same job um but the story doesn't end there it was not long after I started there that I realize that even though I was a stock boy working in the back room solving a bunch of problems every day that the cashiers actually got paid a lot more money than the ... boys\nAnd so within my first couple of years I went to the manager of the store told him I wanted to transfer into a cashier role or so that I could earn more money and he made the decision at that point a to give me the cashier salary but keep me in exactly the same job that I was in a ... what\nDid you learn from that experience used as a CEO of a new Ben financial\nKnow I learned I learned very early on that\nIf you you can identify yourself as a problem solver that you will always have an opportunity invader who is your role model and you know growing up Kevin clearly my role model was my grandfather um when my parents got divorced or my grandpa ... what did you do with her grandfather my grandfather\n[noise]\nWe're back you're listening to executive who this radio show host herb Cohen we'd like to introduce Adam ...\nWho is CEO and founder of asset in that that um what is asset and what are you guys doing fast ... has actually been a really exciting project in my life where it's come out of actually our financial planning company and helps his visualize\nWhat's going on in people's lives we've now actually touched about three hundred thousand households around the world with advisors that are trying to make things some people are right and the larger house Moses organization\nThe organizations growing it's a Fifteen right now I'd expect the double that in the next year I'm find most interesting things that were actually being used by about three thousand advisers around the world are already where you from originally\nOriginally from Brooklyn Heights New York moved to Philadelphia when I was eleven why'd you move to Philadelphia when you were eleven uh that's actually a fun story my mom actually brought us from Philadelphia to Philadelphia a single mom your mind model yeah that's right and\nHow many brothers and sisters do you have um I Would consider myself an only child except my dad had a second family has to do I have two half brothers\nOr you were a Lebanon when you move from Brooklyn Heights with your single mom to Philadelphia and then a dad got remarried and you have a half sibling All right Jeffrey will question what was what was the last like\nIn a in a suburban Philadelphia single mom uh\nI think you have your grandparents where you at ... at some point in time and and you found yourself in a position to really wanted to start to earn money at a young age\nWell yeah it's true I Know there was a it was a bit of a culture shock and we came here to Philadelphia coming from a\nPlayground that was entirely concrete to some grass and that I had an al ... which I didn't know how to do [noise] um but certainly I think the biggest shock was probably the diversity shot so we can a critic grew up in a very uh because I Would say diverse environment a latchkey kid from very early age you\nKnow what happened was so you're you moved here when you were eleven years old and your grandparents came to live with you guys when you were about Thirteen and what happened with your grandparents\nWas shoot my grandparents that actually come to Philadelphia with us I think to the surprise of my mom because they wanted to help and we have and then what happened was your grounding unfortunately two years after they got sick um and it became a what does that do to your mom\nMy mom actually stepped up big time she ah she actually quit her job and to actually took care of them until she was able to share quit her job so what happened to the the income into the house I mean\nIf your mom wasn't working anymore in a single mom and your grandparents or ... or not or ill you know what does that\nDo to you [laughter] well it uh we got really comfortable with a hot dogs and spaghetti a lot um and when you were to make money [noise]\nUh I was actually I started getting jobs as soon as I actually could about the same time I was actually a couple of years that's right you're actually write a ton of what kind of jobs that you get\nMost of the jobs I picked up where they started landscaping then I took a job with a plumber than a pool guy than a roofer um and I actually found myself a learning actually a good amount of had actually build things fix things and what was what where and when you were doing these kids what was different about you than the other kids\nWell number one I had to work in law that was not very common or you'd have to work um we were always a family that actually pushed hard to to grow so uh-huh that was important to me like you were pushing a lot harder I mean you were taking this really seriously well\nI you know I had no friends had no choice right and so the key was either to grow and survive and and and you know learn her very ... found what effect that has her mom had on you know you're here now that you started [noise]\nGuy so I you know my mom has been a great example of of struggle and ... and survival and then of course a success um I think that's one of the things that I've seen from her actually coming from a high school educated person who grew herself into an executive at a very large law firm that affect your ah\nYour outlook on the one hand no question I I mean I think when you grow up with a\nSingle woman and you're an only child I think you get a a a very good appreciation for a a communicating and also um than actually seeing the challenges that I think parents go through trying to raise a child to go through a stage of building your own furniture and stuff like that\nYeah I did I actually there was uh about ten years or where I was committed to building every piece of furniture that I touched one why was that one\nWas or why don't you know I I think it was because I had such a great I had a very specific idea of how it could be and I wanted to try and see if I were to do with starting your own business and I think it's very similar to what are you talking about building furniture starting a business what do you mean\nYou know I think we all the problems in their day to day world than we know we can fix it and sometimes we hope someone who will fix it and other times we step of would actually do it our center\nStill Adam you develop this tension in central responsibility very early but you mentioned in the green room that you're always an artist how did that tell us more\nYou know certainly you know it's funny I'm going back to the early days I can remember I've always been drawing of a doodle or I'd draw I thought I was going to be an architect at some point\nUm because I loved homes [noise] um but the the drawing actually parlayed with very well into asthma so visualizing\nHuh yeah how do your crowd the creativity creates creates this business well interesting the last Twenty years I've been a financial adviser and I'm from\nIn Philadelphia that the challenge of garlic of wealth is that you have to try to communicate more complicated ideas to people on so drawing something we can all relate to so we started by actually drawing out relationships of different financial decisions and all of a sudden people said I I finally get it I feel like if I finally\nTips of different financial decisions and all of a sudden people said I I finally get it I feel like if I finally empowered understand what's going on and that kind of native we just became a viral uh other visors that have the same problem so as it really was born out of a necessity to communicate\nUm feet coming back and when your child and I don't tell me about what it was like to move from from Brooklyn ice to suburban Philadelphia for you\nYeah you know I as I mentioned before it was a bit of a culture shock um\nWhat did he learn having to assimilate was such a culture shock [laughter] assimilate [laughter] um you know I think that the one thing is is that I look back at some of the friends I made there were all the people that were all also relocated by their parents and thinking back about that\nIt was a very diverse group of people and forces to make friends and actually learn how to be relevant to the community that already had ... and ... I Would say clicks if you will also help from our helped him build a business\nUm you know I think it's ... it's really\nForced me to be empathetic to the fact\nYou know people come in that I asked her how to help to build the business what are you talking about empathy how to build wells where are you talking about reality is that all these businesses are teams of people that are as Kevin said that they're spending we're spending so much of our lives together we need to be empathetic to people's journey um and if we're not it's hard to really build the team around that\nAnd why did you learn your and say where did you and I mean your grandparents for tax I must have had a tremendous impact what like that\nYeah that's a great question you know thinking about that in a back to\nI think the empathy actually has to come down to perspective and in when you're when you're willing to take another perspective that's when you can finally be empathetic at any time you know I think back actually to the times and I would have long debates with my mom who comes from a legal background and we would actually would have to debate is until you got your point across that doesn't mean you one [noise]\nUm but we would debate for hours and hours and forced us to really think about what from this perspective from this perspective and so I think it's been engrained\nFound living with my grandparents\nWill certainly I mean there's no question you have to when you when the roles were reversed and all of a sudden you're taking care of someone older [noise] um and you don't necessarily think that that should be a role it forces you to to look at life a little differently I think\nThe line from carrying for\nWhy you know what I think you get you you really get a sense that people haven't journey that happened before you\nAnd I think the interesting thing about that is to be aware of it especially when being part of a team or what I think I learned from my grandparents number one is that they had an extraordinary struggles that\nHappened before I was even thought of bringing in Iraq\nAnd well they told stories right this is I Am from a store and the family um we heard lots of stories of struggle a challenge and\nSo I have an energy level and you Adam that you've had energy even from the very first job that you had a what's a you're building out your creative idea and\nWhat's the most exciting piece of what you do every day\nI think the most exciting thing about it is actually is getting testimonials back from other advisors in people that are saying hey you know this is what I've always wanted but I didn't know how to ask for it\nI'm so I think the empathy and that is actually recognizing that people are needs but they don't know how to go satisfy them so when we get that fulfillment and we get that that that is actually really is awesome I think that's what our team thrives on\nWhat are you looking for in in building your new team members of many are hiring people who are very rapidly and what do you look for in somebody\nOh it's I'm I'm Glad you asked that I mean what what really matters to us is actually that we treat each other well in fact many out very often when people start out with are from we ask what are their core values 'cause we want to understand that for us we showed ours because without it what's the point for your um your\nPeer ... involved from helping individuals now you felt advisors to help a greater audience and people what the next step towards the end game is there a bigger audience\nThere is actually an and I think I think we have an opportunity right now and that the opportunity is actually to empower people to actually have control or at least some better understanding of the financial situation and I think that's where on the fringe of so this is about\nMission about helping a larger number at the end of me like what happened was when I went out and went through in his child who where he didn't have any control you build vulnerable and the you know he was doing forty five different jobs intensely [laughter]\nYou know it was really what he's trying to bring other people now is to give them a sense of what the future really holds here's the asset map of it it out and now you're showing other people I Know what's the website address in this organization\nIs Asif ... let me have that again at that map duck I stole that hey if AT T hyphen M. A. P. dot com we've been speaking with Adam ... CEO and founder of ... executive leaders radio because it was or what\nForce for which the future looks more like for a friend's life partners or their more opportunities in the future where they're more opportunities a few years ago I think\nThere are new opportunities that's actually a very exciting time [noise] um we really have proof of concept of the business model that we've developed that was the it's now the largest in the country are saying how can we take what we've learned a lot of people that really need the\nThe services that we've learned to do and those skills how can we take those and apply them different environments or work on some pilot studies to figure out what what's that next step in\nApply them different environment and so we're working on some pilots studies to figure out what what that next step is going to have you have you met some of the clients that have been benefited from what you do and then and what do they say\nOh I Need them on a on a regular basis and they see the idea of having a piece of line of where to turn to a lot of time to think about people thinking about planning for a long term care is you need to hire you got to pay for a long term care\nProbably the bigger question is where am I going to turn\nGoing to take care of me and so the piece of find that we provide for our members to solve our family is is really very very rewarding when you hear what it means to them very ... Carroll them\nOn and the green room you mentioned to me that you have twin sons what I'm impacted they have on your ah running that does not [noise]\nA ... you know I think having children and it would it is is so important and\nThey you know I think they keep it honest and keep your grounded and a venture off and how they visited you at work is sure they have and um my one of my son's a dish or internship at our office one summer ... emailed me at work they say they don't like it should I say at ... ...\nEmail ... why why why it was it so important to have kids\nThink ... yeah they've really made me grow as a person they may be more flexible more resilient and what did you learn from your kids you're bringing the work every day [noise]\nBut at the ... I think we're resilient faint probably being flexible that you have children you never know what's gonna happen next and you really need to be that way and I bet it's also interesting who's got the next question\nCalif you could paint a picture of what would be most important to your clients can do you describe the scene that you would create for them [noise]\nI think what's it been washed important to our clients is the relationship that we develop with them so that they have a sense of truck and we're going to be there for them [noise]\nUm and through that sense of trucks were able to help Sam I'm open up and were able to identify subtle changes and health and functioning so that we can intervene early and their their trust and that will help them stay in their own home\nOr oh I I thought you were providing some sort of an organization that helps pay for 'em long term care but it sounds to me like you're doing more than\nThat there's a peace obviously that does provide financial protection but I think that what we're really doing it's everything that wrapped around that financial protection of you know where are you going to turn how are you going to say in your own home or how can you keep yourself healthy and and how can you provide peace of mind to your family say you won't be a burden to that what\nIt sounds like a big huge opportunity there to the website address to this organization friend's life care partners\nF.

estimate on line had Lynch bench\nThe oh dot com out she had to leave her post at the at the IRS and that's what she's going to do so then what happens in future for that spot if bonkers name seriously was being um\nThe future for that spot if bonkers name seriously was being\nUm can fit or let's say her name just kept coming up and even her father the president said no it would be nepotism and Ivanka cleared that up before the news jumped all over the news cycle would start\nRight before I'm six o'clock you know when you would hit the evening news so it was abrupt and maybe unexpected\nShe has a rising profile of course of the ambassador of the United nations\nSaying that she had no plans to challenge his reelection however she said I'm not running for twenty twenty and I look forward to supporting the president and the next election\nAnd that was it and he you know he had some good things to say about her and that's it at forty six she definitely has a political brand she has a long political career perhaps in front of her member former South Carolina Governor now the UN position\nWho knows what's next for her so who stepped in\nIn that position there are a couple of people whose names have come up and ... are on the board for it we'll see but it's not Nikki Haley as of the end of the year so she stays\nThrough the next couple of months and then somebody else will ultimately step into that a rural so this transition\nI don't think was massively dramatic because it um it was she was nice about it they were there together at a press conference and that was it and um you know Nikki Haley the one thing that she's done\nPretty well is the leaky boat\nThat happened at the White House and with the Republican she kind of kept that plugged up\nShe has only a few close people to her that she talks about anything to do with ... ... just a couple of key advisors so not very much leaks out let's put it that way there must be something I Would think\nIn the future for her because of her profile and her desire but what that is we don't know at this point we also don't know like I mentioned how badly this hurricane is going to rip through Pensacola\nShould alert every single person listening to the show right now if you're jogging and this morning and you're listening to the replay if you're listening to me live because I have the world is sometimes you're on the third shift sometimes you're not\nI'm telling you if you want to surprise someone and you're renting a limbo limo and a lot of people that do that I mean I've been part of those groups where we say OK nobody's driving so that's great on us and we get the limo but I think it I think it really brings up the questions of\nWho's driving the limo what is not um you know are they certified\n\nOr a million different kinds of questions like you know the others said something interesting thing to me said remember limousines are basically welded together think of what\nThe middle of the limousines are think of some of the really super big ones and the one that we're talking about the stretch limo people really jammed in so\nYou've got regular SUVs that have been jacked up and he made that point to me and um this is what I'm reading in some of the reports from people a converted two thousand and one Ford Excursion\nThat's what it was the modifications was that part of the problem was there some other factors that contributed to what to this tragedy\nYou know what is it proceeds limousine chauffeur services one it was\nA and they're doing a detailed internal investigation to determine the cause of the accident but I think that you got to look at limousines man and we looked at regulations and weather\nReally they're good enough would you want to get into a limousine right now realizing\nWhat it's been converted from\nAnd yes I mean just because somebody has an accent that that's the most horrible accident we've seen him in a very long time do you panic I think it makes you\nTake a closer look at what you're getting into your trusting with your life\nAnd doing a little flus things even before the accident some of the people in the limousine we're taxing that they didn't feel safe\nI it was kind of like a foreshadowing moment so this needs to be I think a wakeup call to Amy one ... who is thinking of renting a limo just be very careful with these converted limos\nBecause a lot of them are converted they're smaller and then they make them big or this is a big thing because of the way they jak them up the way they look they look old but how are they link sending them how are they raising them out\nIt'll link sending them how are they raising them\nHow are they making the after market adjustments that they make how are they modifying it that's gotta be a very very big concern to anybody who is thinking about this anyway I went off in a tangent but a couple of you sent me notes about this I got this one\n\nFrom Alford who says Kate I've driven limousines I've taken limousines in my life and I think what's really to blame is the fact that somebody gets a limousine and they do all kinds of adjustments to it and then they take too many people in it\nAnd that's the problem it's human error I mean the driver wasn't even certified for goodness sake of someone who's driven limousine I Know just how risky that can be then I got this one from pat\nWho says boy I'll tell you what a I've written and all kinds of situations have been picked up from parties gone down town from further away in big cities I live in a rural area\nAnd often I take the whole over lift deal\nBut I don't worry so much about that there's people that I've come to trust to know when I look at the record but that's different than this limousine where they were stuffing them in like they were stuffing olives and obviously there were a lot of problems do you feel really sad when you\nRead the story of the the crash\nAnd um what happened in and\nHow so many of those were family members and no matter what the NTSB says Kate it can't bring back the lives of the people that were lost and they were young there was even some newlyweds yeah there is some newlyweds that I'm more in the limousine is supposed to be a big fun party and\nI think it was I said this what was that was listening to the first responder\nReally start to cry get choked up saying that people were alive when he's pulling them out and of course none of them lives so I Hope that other people take a close look at it I mean look that funded riding a limousine of you are and then on his name\nBut there's different kinds of limousine so I guess it's good to to really dig into the background um sometimes we get fooled into that\nSecurity that that sense of security and we don't poke around enough and I hope this makes people ask\nSome more questions that's all I Hope I have this one this from Anthony on hurricane Michael okay looking at uh Pensacola scares the bejesus out of me I have family members there I heard you talk about Florida State\nAnd the fact that I'm Florida State is basically shutting down\nAnd telling people to go home and that's a smart decision because thousands of people would be there on campus and it's right in the eye of what looks to be a horrific storm and who knows what the water is going to just be a wall of water\nAnd trying to escape that would be ridiculous so I Hope people are paying attention or people in their local news et cetera and they are boarding up and getting out and they're gone by the time you possibly read my email\n\nAnd seeing the red the big giant chunk of ... that just ... get out of there and that's what it looks like to me I mean it's you know nasty nasty stuff and then there's this one from Craig is Katie\nAnd Anthony wiener who screwed up a lot of lives is being released from prison early I think it was one of the dumbest moves with Hillary Clinton to stick with\nHis wife who am I deem when Anthony wiener was so toxic but anyway he's supposed to get out of prison three months earlier than originally was scheduled to what gives with that\nYeah he remembered this was since twenty seven team he pled guilty to one in charge of transferring obscene material to a minor in a federal court\nAnd there was a Fifteen year old girl and it was in social media site for a couple of months so\nUm they're saying that there for good behavior for what not they he gets those um months I guess shaved off he was sentenced to Twenty one months altogether in\nA federal prison so his prison term would have ended in August twenty Nineteen his new release date I guess is is may and it is because of\nGood conduct time earned that kind of thing and uh that's typical of what could\nHappen which is why you know that's that's why they're saying that\nSo I'm wow hey you know he really did he tagged a lot of people I mean ... I think he tagged even more a tank Hillary Clinton's because remember the whole emails saying the FBI investigation surfacing and the email server on his laptop and\nUh the former FBI Director James Comey announcing the discovery\n\nAction day and yeah he he he definitely has some serious egg on a safe for not just that but a couple of different things it gets the past the first\nTime around and then it happened again something happens and then he has the latest thing that happens I'm with the Fifteen year old girl in twenty six team that was just like I said talk to everyone around him [noise] I haven't heard that name a long time and again\nHang with us over the other side and we're going to demand\nHave traveled more here on American\nMessage a deterrence may apply please don't text while driving if you've been in business more than twenty minutes you've probably printed your logo on all kinds of promotional products are we all know logos work because they're on everything from the top of skyscrapers to the bottom of shoot\nWondered why or how to best use your logo to grow your business ...\nLast show you today for free we're for imprint promotional products experts at your service we're giving away the latest issue of amplify\nThe digital magazine that reveals promotional products success stories absolutely free to everyone who attacked up seven seven to eight eight nine eight eight at Fort imprint ... we make your logo the perfect ... thousands of promotional items whether one hundred percent guarantee it will be right the first time on time every time\nYou're free e magazine will reveal invaluable insights that can attract new customers build your brand and grow your business to\nGet the latest issue of apples I absolutely free by taxing up seven seven to eight nine eight eight that UP seven seven to eight eight nine eight eight ...\nPresident George Herbert Walker Bush\nAnd how long is he around after um after her death but he seems to be okay from some of the latest\nConversations I've had with people who are familiar with who know the bushes and another Bush is um [noise]\nSo that was a mega deal at the time Seventy million but that is a song compared to what the ban on family gets and what the chargers would be evaluated at the the numbers when they look at this the I was just looking at a story about the NFL's next five one hundred million\nMega deal what would the contracts in the NFL look like I mean one hundred million is a crazy number isn't it quarterbacks\nA hundred million looking into the crystal ball who would that be where you'll get Russell Wilson the quarterback for the Seahawks want to know what he gassed for years eighty seven point six million he is a free agent and twenty twenty\nYou look at um [noise]\nWell you gotta think pat ... homes is going to get paid something or something so\nBut he's not anywhere near that the um the salaries and the to salaries for different the different kinds of players but really quarterback is where pops open\nJimmy ...

potential financial advisor or professional first is there a minimum amount of money you need to have work with them\nHow do they charge for example they charge you for every transaction you make or for each service is or does the professional tried one of the ... all transactions in services\nHuh it so it was once the structure better than another\n... not necessarily it really depends again on what you need is an individual but the kids that you should know what it will cost to work with them aside from the fees you should also asked about the range of products and services they offer they only offer their own company's products they offer financial planning or just sends actions\nMake sure they offer the services you currently focused on and if you're looking for a long term

want\nA trained at Brown nose or anything Eric I'm just I'm just talking facts this is this is great stuff and they had soft to you\nThank you so much and I know last time I was on we talked about\nYou know I'll be profound Asian has been focused on housing for veterans um since two thousand eleven\nAnd a few years ago we said you know what we are going well when we started and to have an eleven we said we're going to thirty million dollars into this and we're going to do that over the next three years and I think we hit that goal within a year and a half right then we made it Fifteen and we made at AT and the weight that I you know let's just let's do it if we're going to do it with data\nThat we've had a quarter of a million dollars by twenty twenty and we actually met we hit that quarter of a billion dollar mark a few months ago why only a quarter of a million dollars into housing for veterans\nSo our new commitment will come out on November Nine this year or so we'll have to talk again after that yeah\nMan\nThat's veteran housing there there you know it's all through a nonprofit partners so that includes building homes for veterans have been catastrophic they wanted to in critical home repairs to keep senior veterans and and younger wounded veterans in our homes and then also helping to end veterans homelessness\nUm that are on national and local nonprofit partners are just incredible so we've done all that work through them\nAnd you know of course you know basically the same thing about Home Depot and everybody we talk to and we talk about this before those ... those are your announced goals and the things that you kind of the century sites on but then there's all the other stuff\nIt was only used up every nonprofit we talk to you know whether it's a no matter how\nBig house and home depots\nThird of the team deep all out here is the one stop what was the one in\nIn California are\nTalking about ... oh yeah you guys have done a lot with I mean but but they're just you go down the list and it's all these other things that you're doing as well\nIt wouldn't be hurting you wouldn't be beyond the realm of first do a radio show dog you're nothing but hold on\nWhat happens you know\nYeah they really are they're incredible they're the ones that are on the ground doing that work every single day and so you know I think there's a mutual love the way not that our partners but ... hats off to them I mean they're they're getting it done and we really appreciate it\nAnd every year we get to talk to you or it's about a celebration of service right\nYup yes you do and you're halfway through that now\nWe kicked it off on September twentieth where a couple of weeks into it I think it feels like we're halfway through [laughter] you know it's amazing we're we're doing them different things this year we kick it off on September twentieth and we're going through veterans' day I'm team depot is hard out at the heart and soul of the Home Depot\nI'm only talking about this before that for people who are just hearing the for the first time on the poet founded on a core value to it and two of the values are giving back and doing the right thing and we do that three hundred and sixty five days a year but during celebration of service we really\nUnleash the power of team depot into the into our communities\nAnd we're going to do a hundred thousand volunteer hours this year well between September twentieth and veterans' day so we are we're really excited we're well on our way down that path I wouldn't be surprised that waste their pass it you know our folks love to get out there and and give back so\nWe're doing that we will announce a new commitment on November Nine cents we reached that quarter of a billion dollar two years early well and then\nThe other cool thing that we're doing is you know everybody associates that with the orange right sure okay good I'm Glad you said yesterday\nI watched Joe college they are game day that's right [laughter]\nSo this year we're trading orange for military green so we can support for those who have done so much for it in the military green as well\nThat is that's a good idea that's been great early is we're taught her how to grill here on the national defense\nSenior manager and strategic partnerships with the Home Depot foundation and an or I don't know if I told you the story but this is how easy it is a weird situation come up that was brought to us a\nYoung lady in in our area that needed a a\nHandicap accessible or wheelchair ramp I call the Home Depot and talk to people they got it done when was the jury within a month ago yeah something like that and I mean it was literally that easy to point that out and then they get it done so um if people you know want to\nParticipate it's very easy to do\nIt is we've got team depot captains in every single one of our stores\nOr their job on top of running a multimillionaire multibillion dollar stores to be a good neighbor in the community and again it's something that we we take very seriously so\nIf there's a need in the community our doors definitely want to know about it I you know they try to meet as many of those as possible and um we put our name behind it though they they get out there and they show that that Home Depot passionate not orange but it's clear that we all got\nYou know the only thing I Would like to see a big because of all work you do it and I think it needs to be we we try and help out a tour a radio show and in other ways in social media but however\nI go to a Home Depot
