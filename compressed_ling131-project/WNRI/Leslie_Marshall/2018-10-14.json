Kevin car\nBurgers and this is what's happening in your world\nOnly a couple of pieces of news that I really wanted to focus on this week in the first one is about James Gunn now of course if you remember earlier this year he was on ceremony asleep fired by Disney as\nThe director of guardians of the galaxy three even though he'd already worked on a script and they were in pre production and it was because of these old tweets and they were offensive tweets but they were tweets that he found out as as uh\nThese old tweets and they were offensive tweets but they were twenty seven out as as a you know there are bad taste jokes but they were jokes they were not real tweet of real things he did and it was kind of a hit these because this was picked up by like a conservative blogger who was like I think he was angry at the fact that James Gunn was very\nCritical of President Trump and his policies and then that's his own right to do that but\nThis guy then kind of created this outrage out of nowhere and had people say oh how dare you well you know make is the desired this guy because he directs the movie for kids when somebody talking raccoon in a tree and isn't this terrible that you're putting this person make jokes about pedophilia and rape and you're going to keep him on the project and people overreacted people went after\nHim and then Disney knee jerk fired him which I thought was a huge mistake by Disney mainly because this was behavior that took place almost ten years ago before you wouldn't even affiliated with Disney he has not done it since it's not something he was doing like this weekend it was something he had done in the past\nAnd he has grown as a director and he had to apologize for me actually brought it up back\nWhen he was hired for guardians of the galaxy one what five six years ago\nBut because we live in an outrage culture where everybody wants to be jerk and get offended at everything people are weaponized outrage here that's not a good thing I feel for James Gunn I don't think he should have been fired for that yes it was in bad taste but he apologized any change in behavior it's not like he\nDenied it and deleted it and then said that didn't exist he ... he owned up to what he changed his behavior and he's not doing that anymore\nAnd it was just jokes in the first place says the industry that lets Mike Tyson starring movies a convicted rapist yet James Gunn who make some bad taste and yes there are in bad taste\nAnd I was hoping that Disney would quietly re hire him but I think a lot of eyes are on him and I think they're waiting for a little bit to try and do that but they may not have a chance because rumor has it that your brother's\nIs eyeing James Gunn to write and direct suicide squad to now if you remember suicide squad was Warner brothers' film about these economic anti heroes people like\nDead shot and the joker and Harley Quinn all these people come Arkham Asylum who are put into the mix to try and stop other bad guys who are worse than\nThe first suicide squad was awful the only good thing about it was Margaret Robbie as hardly quick but outside of that it's a terrible movie it did extremely well [noise] but I think that was an aberration I really don't think that that movie would have done as well as it did they had to come out any other time but that\nLook around around the middle around for ... rivers are drove a car and I'm from Maryland\nAnd learn more about the Charles ... how are those are her daughter I put on\n[noise]\n\n\nLooking back to fat guys at the movies with Kevin car let's jump into the movie reviews with our first movie in the first man I'm going to start off by reviewing it\nThen I Want to address the controversy that came earlier this year and I I didn't carry the lead very well with pie complained already last segment you understand why I said the streets of controversy and this goes back to sort of the weaponized the\nOutrage or dumb reasons but it well let's talk about the movie first let's get that out of the way because I think let's talk about the movie as clean as possible and that is first man Oscar winning director Damien ... takes us very intimate look at a Neil Armstrong ... men\nWe've chosen a job so difficult\nSo many technological development\nMeal slices of history\nKind of dog do you have about that are planning on this late beings who've we're\nGoing to work\nFor the record I the huge fan of Damien shows that I thought that whiplash was a fine movie I didn't think it was the greatest movie ever I thought that the J. case them and certainly deserves our support but they're the movie itself wasn't the greatest movie ever although I Know some people who think it was the same thing with la la la la la land had\nIts moments I thought why land was fine\nBut it's certainly absolutely was not the best of beer absolutely was not the best of the year and certainly wasn't the best directing of the year\nI'm Emma Stone quite good in that Ryan Gosling was fine but the the God da ... action to la la land was overblown in my opinion\nSo first man\nI'm not coming at it saying oh I Love his director I Can't wait to see what he does max I kinda was trepidation about seeing this film because I think those are kind of guy who can get over blown and over rated very very fast he sort of like a more intimate version of\nChristopher Nolan who has a couple of good film but some very mediocre and some kind of terrible films as well\n\nI'm not Neil Armstrong's biographer so I Do not know how accurate dishes [noise]\nBut the one thing I really appreciate it about how they made this movie is they approach it differently than everything else\nTreated about how they made this movie is they approach it differently than everything else if you want the right stuff go watch the right stuff if you want Apollo Thirteen go watch Apollo Thirteen there is no shortage of space race movies there's no shortage of astronauts as heroes\nYou want the shots of them walking in slow motion down the tarmac you're going to get that in another movie you don't need that here that's not the purpose of this movie this movie is not to give a hero shots not to say that they're not heroes yes they are heroes and all but the point is this is not set the shy using astronauts\nIt's showing a very visceral look at what it was like to be one now down in the\nKennedy Space center down in Florida where I've been I've set inside a replica of the Gemini probe I've sat inside are barely fit into a mercury capsule and the\nApollo moon at lunch all those things are tiny and they look like tin cans and they look like you're inside of an old fashioned radio they do not look like spaceships they look terrifyingly complex but ready to break any minute and they are very very cramped and the windows aren't very big\nMost of the space shots in this movie and here's where the strength to strength of this movie or when they're doing the NASA stuff when they're doing the space or in the travel and the waiting and and the checking and and the adapting that's the great stuff and what they do they put you in\nRight there with Armstrong or anybody else [noise] the only way to make this any more intimate into Armstrong is to physically have put the camera inside Ryan Gosling face\nBecause he's in there all the time and and all the space shuttle shirt in the capsule with them so you see it shaking you hear the rumbling and you see though might splashing and how confusing you can be ... and how cramped it is and how you how does this tiny little window the size of like a legal pad [noise]\nYeah they have a couple of shots or to the grand shots especially when the Saturn fives going up the Apollo Thirteen type shot of you know it was a rocket Judy off enough exhausted all that kind of suck yeah you have a couple of those shots\nBut by and large this is not shot like a Michael Bay beer commercial it shot mostly in the cockpit in the cabin of these things in the models themselves\nBecause that's what the astronaut saw and experienced and that's the value of this movie because you get a chance to almost experience what it was like I I've not been a big fan of those like like seats that move kinds of sentiments but I think this would be a neat wanted to be in to watch that way\nBut that's what this films about and and it really puts you in the in the moment and and and that's the best part of it and they're also seeing them kind of going through the gritty\nUgly on appealing elements of training which you always on the it's it's sort of\nEven in like the right stuff it was sort of wins like all the way they put it together\nThe rest of the film and this is what kind of bloated into to our twenty minute running time his home stuff and the emotional stuff with the wife and the kids\nUnfortunately when you come to the space race movies you have\nThe experience of the wives because you don't want to Texas nation certainly back in the sixties and the fifties women weren't allowed in capitals they weren't going to send a woman into space back then because that's the way the world was so the only job a woman had assigned from a movie like hidden figures where you could\nTake the human computers to make a film out of them you know and even then that was\nExtremely sexist attitudes that that toppled those women back in the sixties and seventies movie like this\nAll you can do is have the wife kinda wringing our hands are not a whole lot for her to do 'cause it wasn't a whole lot for the wives to do it all and clear for you is good and she acts and she's fine in the movie\nBut there's not much for her to do and they they have to give her due diligence so that I think what blows to the movie and makes it a little boring a lot of the ... personal family stuff\nI mean that that that border lines on just sort of like the misery foreign I was talking about with with the stars born last year of you know fighting and him about wanting to deal with it but it does show the real pragmatic dangers in the real dangers and problems that they were facing and even just\nPublic relation problems that they were facing back in the sixties\nSo overall I'm going to say that the movie it kind of rocks cat rock [noise] now onto the giant controversy that came out earlier this year the fact\nThat they didn't have the planting of the American flag on them and\nAgain that's not what the movie's about true they do not have that scene\nBut if you're looking for American flags you're going to find them everywhere in this movie there on uniforms they're on space suits there on the side of rocket ships they're behind astronauts during a press conference there's even a scene of Neil Armstrong some reason if like and there's a shot up the flag on the moon\nBut you don't have as you don't have them coming down and planting a flag with a choir behind them singing God Bless America because that's not what the movies about the movie is not about fetish rising the hero worship of the space race the movies about what it was like to be there what you went through to get there\nAnd the danger that you are facing in the uncertainty and the claustrophobia and then the best isolation that you felt once you get there spoiler alert they make it to the moon and so when you get to the moon it's bath\nAnd this isolated and the only person for hundreds of thousands of miles so again this was manufactured fake outrage and the fact that they didn't have this big heroic moments that one belong in this movie would have been so out of place again it's not a Michael Bay beer commercial\nFor criticizing movies if you haven't seen them go see the freaking movie and then criticize it as you want to tame inches those you know not a big fan of him he didn't certainly seem rightfully so garbage Mack Swain people were complaining about this because he said that some of the movies about in the blanks\nDial back your rental outrage meters in a ... a piece of art as a piece of art and understand where the directors coming from don't just Bangor chest out of

pulp fiction\nWhere the maturing happened between those two movies somewhere in the middle of that is where you'd find\nBad times of the isle royale now it's got a great cast you got like Jon Hamm you've got Jeff Bridges\nYou've got the code of Johnson who is actually quite good I've become a big fan of her new partly through the fifty shades of gray series as terrible as those films are I I thought to go to Johnson really held around them those so so I I think she's good in this movie you got Chris happens worth it [noise]\nCreepy movie because you know bad things are going to happen partly 'cause it's in the title\nBut it it takes us time to set things up and there and it's one of those ah ... it's like a bottle episode of a of a TV show we're at all most of it takes place in this hotel and they have flashbacks outside of it and and it's told him that parents you know structure works has run into this person's back story than this person's backstory nobody is in there\nWith a story that you would expect except maybe one person who is sort of the average person coming in but still has a little bit of skeletons in her closet [noise] but this is a um\nIt's a slow burn of a movie\nAnd it works quite well\nIn the grand sense now it does run a bit long it's a two hour Twenty one minute running time and I think this would have been observed if it would have been about two hours because there are some of the storylines take a little bit too long to delve into\nSome of the storylines aren't as interesting as others then oddly enough I Want to promote no backstory more on some of the storylines and I got kind of bored with the other story like like one of the characters is a singer she's a lounge singer\nThere's a little bit too much of her singing a little bit too much featuring her songs which feels like I I think God or just doing that not because he's just sort of trying to keep that onto this actress but more that's kind of the way these movies were in the sixties and seventies they had these these musical break now on that\nBut I I got a little bit tired of hearing are saying and there are moments especially in the third act where\nIt's being laid up for suspense but it does need to move a little bit faster so it's not a perfect film and it doesn't want a hundred percent hold together but overall it's different\nIt's a actively done\nAnd I I I liked it a lot more than I expected\nEven though I expected to like it I thought this had disaster potential written all over it and it didn't end up having that it actually turns out to be a pretty good film quite enjoyable and interesting and worth checking out so I'm going to have to say bad times at the isle royale kind of rocks cat rock\nThat segment I Need to go to

mentality in the\n\nHis\n\nWho's going to be in a bloody at\n\nThe turn of the century mentioning here is actually the turn of the nineties to the twentieth century so I think it starts somewhere in the Eighteen nineties\nAnd it ends the film ends in the early Nineteen hundreds so sort of the century it isn't like Twenty years ago it's like a hundred and Twenty years ago and it's a true story about collectors writer who is she married this man and he went by the the named willy which was this sort of pen name and\nIt was a very popular guy but he got people to go straight to his books for him now this was actually not uncommon ghost writing\nIs become less popular now I mean nowadays people tend to get credit for it even if they are clearly writing for somebody else I mean the people most know about it because it's been talked about in the last couple of years is there's the guy who coached wrote\nTrump spoke yard of the deal and you can tell because of the you know by Donald Trump and then the bottom it'll stay with so and so and usually when it's a famous person like that and it says with that means that it's written with somebody\nActually writing the book and they're just basically a lot of times the the person just interviews the famous person and and it's their story and and and how they want the book to be but it's actually written in ... and the words are composed by somebody else this is common that happens with most people are\nThe different says this is more like sort of like a V.C Andrews was a popular writer in the seventies and eighties who wrote like flowers ... died and they started to write new books her state to develop these new books\nThat were from the original ideas and stories that D.C Anders that had but other writers wrote them but it's still got credited as V.C Andrews and I think maybe somewhere in the copyright page and in the front material you'll find the real author's name but back in Paris at this time this guy Willie he was\n... known for these books and get a hose you know guy goes ghost writers\nBut he kinda kept the name for himself and and this is sort of similar connective tissue is something like the white if you've seen that movie we talked about that a couple of weeks ago that's the one with Glenn Close and Jonathan\nPrice he's getting a Nobel Prize and it turns out that she actually broke a bunch of his books for him it's sort of reminds me of big eyes that movie about king the painter the woman who painted all the portraits with the big eyes but that her husband took the credit for it and so that's a theme that we're seeing showing up in a lot of movies which happened people take credit for other people's work\nAll the time and this is a well known story if you understand you know French literature I don't I've never really known anything about Clinton but this is a true story it's well known she eventually gets her own recognition later on I think she ended up winning like somewhere in the forties or something she wins a Nobel Prize for literature as not covered in this movie\n\n\nOr usa radio news when he came in\nAfter Andrew Brunson says President Trump fought hard for his

putting a I'm a foot\nIn the sand again on the cabinet sandbox debate\nAs to what happened and to me that now it's so intriguing\nAnd I said the last couple of days that I thought it was going to be you know sixty forty that he gets confirmed based on my conversations people I Know in Washington DC who are connected who are constantly on the hill who are and who are aids or who know aids or who are\nUm prepping senators and all that kind of stuff really decent sources but even decent sources are not really sure\nBecause they see a step back a step forward at this point I think it's the steps forward\nSo I'm I think it's Seventy five percent that he gets confirmed Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is advancing the nomination Supreme Court he did that by insisting that they're going to get the results of the FBI supplemental background investigation it's going to be finished then of course there was a secret secret room\nIn the capital and senators got to go and look at what was in that report and the um\nLook at what was in that report and the um the diving made public\nBut but the deal was expect some of it to leak in certain areas where there was an evidence that the salt those who have seen it\nSay there's not enough there there's not enough to to say that in this report it doesn't corroborate some of what was being said it's a forty six page report\nOn allegations of

segments\nAnd it was the rotation they kept up all day long on Thursday and you know there were ... there were senators whining about it that it's unusual circumstances in the process is unusual\nAnd the report was laid out in twelve sections they could easily swap them and make the most or they're limited time and there was only one copy\nWhat's going on was Indianapolis if you are a brew crew

but um I I I pick them in the beginning of the year there there that team of not everybody's so famous on the team but they have that whole team attitude\nSo I think that's what it's about I think they've got that common goal and it really is about for the when the when not so much for the me the means to me that I I think it's I think they really have found that crew will they win the world series that they got to get through this and it's one game right\nSo there's a lot left to come\nOut the Dodgers the Dodgers love path to brave and their National League um division series\nThey the Dodgers led the series the one they leave that there is now one nothing they beat the Braves sick nothing and um that a power display I mean that's what it was they were swinging away\nOr whether it
