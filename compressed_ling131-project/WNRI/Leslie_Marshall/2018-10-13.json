acting white and how bomber was criticized for being an elitist because he'd gone to Harvard and taught at University of Chicago\nSpoke standard English got hammered Bobby Rush who still in the house who beat him badly in the house race\nAll but said he's acting white years ago I wrote about a young lady living in Oakland black teenager who wanted to be a doctor into all of her peers you wanted to be a doctor because they thought of her as\nElitist in snooty she was getting death threats\nI find it interesting that I'm watching MSNBC or CNN they're talking about how racist President Trump is because he has so few black people in positions of responsibility in his administration and then he meets with black people and what are they called mediocre negroes by Marc\nLamont hill mediocre negroes or sellouts or in the case of ... of Kanye West he must have some sort of mental disorder\nSo you're a sellout yourself loading your code your assemble and why aren't there are more sellouts and coon skin samples in his administration in this business about race and racism\nWhen Obama was considering running for president according to either time or Newsweek I forget which one\nBig long

amazing\n\nAnd if anybody anybody should understand the importance of getting a good education it ought to be Obama\nObama's mother sent him from Indonesia where he was living to live with his maternal grandparents because she wanted him to get a good education\nSo Obama goes to the finest prep school and the state of Hawaii then goes to a very selective private school called occidental
