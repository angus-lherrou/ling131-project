S. M. C. A. we're not going to call NAFTA any longer but it is a new on North American free trade agreement that will open up orders are between all three countries\nIs modernized to get as America has a better deal and so I look I don't see why anybody would be unhappy with this outcome\nUm my understanding is one of the things that this deal does is put pressure on other countries to pay their workers more money why is that why is it a good thing for consumers\nOkay well I think that's a fair point you know we shouldn't be imposing minimum wage on other countries right and that's one of the things I don't like about this deal so there you got me on that one I'm not you know we would we want Mexico to have a twenty dollar minimum wage that would put a lot of Mexican workers out of\nOut of business so that that's one of the things I think is bad economics in this plan a show I mean I agree with you on that one so\nOn par though this deal lower tariffs and barriers are up for that the candidate has imposed against us and Louis terriers and beer and barriers that Mexico imposed against us in general\nYeah not just in just one quick thing or not just terrorists but also there were a lot of it you know as you know we talked about this on your show before worn work what Americans producers called intellectual property we produce computer software we\nPatton sent copyright said and technologies and when it comes to some of these countries like Canada and some and it's certainly trying on and many other countries in Asian countries they just steal or an electoral property and this new I'm now ... very strongly that this new\nUh I'll call it the U.S ... uh she I make as much better protections for not America's intellectual property so countries are going to use our products they actually pay for them\nEven more is my guest he served as a ton of economic advisor to President Trump in the twin sixteen campaign Steven you recall President Obama famously saying these jobs aren't coming back what magic wand does the president have what do you think people who felt that way feel right now about this deal\nWell first of all you know what what Obama was referring to as you said you know he can't get us to four percent economic growth and they can't bring manufacturing jobs in construction stacked with his country and he kept bring coal jobs back and

of the major um or Amazon I Believe it was they're going to raise their wages to Fifteen dollars an hour I I don't want the government to tell companies to do that\nBut they're doing it because it's a

Moore is my guest he's an economist even take the last minute and talk to us about about debt and about the economists programs even Obama said we're on automatic pilot or this president has done a lot of things we talked about the tax cuts the regulatory relief also spent money especially on defense and so our debt has increased are you worried about that\nWell you should be but I'll tell you one statistic about you know because there is doing so well now I mean you know we've had two straight quarter is now four percent growth and then Obama never got us you know the last year he was present at one point six percent that additional growth\nFor court in the latest congressional budget office for cash has increased the ten year a economic output energy the GDP by ... trillion
