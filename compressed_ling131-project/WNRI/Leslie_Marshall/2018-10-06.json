you care about how she ... got to her position\nShe said she spent more time on this went over hundreds of cases a was a brief to she said I think once a week by some a group of legal experts fussy you understand what this was all about\nAnd she very carefully went over Christine force testimony and very sensitive Lee said as I said before that uh that she believed her she believes something happens before we can assign what happened to her to Kavanaugh there's gotta be fairness\nAnd while this is not a criminal trial and therefore you don't apply to standard of beyond a reasonable doubt
