November\nOh my God well that try to put in Medicare for all and that's scary because they have a hundred and sixty three progressive Democrats that said that's what they want to do and that would be a disaster it may sound good but it would be a total disaster\nI understand I think it was a\nBloomberg estimated the cost of this is something like thirty two trillion dollars over the course of the decade\nAnd so your listeners can make it clear that was ... trillion ... billion right but thirty trillion and I would check our national debt and into oblivion a national that would be so big it will bankrupt or should be a horrible horrible thing\nBut Dan Obamacare solve all our problems remember when Joe Biden said a it's a big deal I thought it solve all our problems\nWell I'll tell you what Obama said you can keep your doctor if you want to and that was a lie this one here\nYou can't keep Medicare Bernays plan replace just Medicare itself with Medicare for all the different kind of policy\nNot only that is twenty two million Americans people who have Medicare Advantage plans which are run by private companies and he would eliminate all of them that would be an increased fishing is this would hurt seniors especially and that's why a Mac is against Medicare for all\nWhen when you want to get a left wing persons drawn to tighten Dan Weber ask him or her who's going to pay for it who's going to pay back but who's going to pay for thirty two trillion dollars over ten years\nYeah that's right and in addition to that you're going to have rationing people say oh well Canada and Great Britain have great plants everyone should keep this number like twenty to wage that's how long it takes for a major surgery and Canada\nAfter they've examined yet I may take months you have been examined\nAnd now after they say yes you need this major surgery twenty two weeks average wage a lot of those people course over the border and they get their operations in America\nThen wherever is

provinces ultimately adopted it he still lives are as far as I Know in his nineties and he's come out and recently said that I was wrong we should have had more competition I should not have outlawed private care and he\nPronounced the healthcare system uh Internet and Canada pretty much a failure\nYeah yeah and well we just got to look at all socialize looking at Cuba they don't even have a aspirin available and the local drugstores look at Venezuela\nThey are socialized the medical care thinking doctors running too much and now the poor people literally dying and it's a shame socialism doesn't work because under socialism the individual mandate nothing\nThen I'm often asked people this question whenever I have a discussion about this Canada Great Britain they have a\nA socialized medicine Canada has the what I think Obama wants to have with just single payer are in Great Britain has something very similar but when you take polls the majority of citizens in both Canada and Great Britain seem to like their system why is that\nBecause if they get a sniffle they can go into a local clinic than they wait in line a long time but to go to a local clinic and I got taken care of and it won't be any money out of their pocket\nUntil they have a serious problem not only that the recovery race after catcher operations after the hot operations because of the way they rush

I think that's one I'm a Roger and\nMe where he should he should he had a downhill from there he should he should have hung up after that\nExactly um diminish um\nThe the other thing I I think is you can turn on MSNBC or CNN or ABC or or or or CBS and watched Trump get ripped for free why go to a theater pay money popcorn in parking and see the same and you can see every night for nothing\n... exactly right there's no the left has been fumbling for the critique of Trump that actually going to work\nAnd they've tried so many different tax and that kind of out of ammunition and of course Trump is the guy to pummeled back I mean he's emotionally incapable of not getting back or even on things like Stormy Daniels and get back on every crime\nBut I think it's it's widely Trump\nBoxing aggression that has surprised his own\nI'm Talking to diminish to sue the birth of a nation or his latest documentaries now available on digital HD Europe\nDocumentary of course ... death of a nation talks a lot about ah the Democrats use of the race card missed manipulation of of race or their racist history do you think the Kanye West Kansas Owens people like that\nAre beginning to get black people to rethink their assumptions\nOr yes absolutely I think that uh what's happening really is um no that was the kind of a black conservative intellectual open this very important in the eighties and nineties\nOr people like Walter Williams Tom solo people like that\nI think what's interesting is that the ideas of now working out a trumpet been a fantastic evangelist and helping with the help and um I think that black people look at Trump and they realize that not a racist bone and this guy's body he's outspoken a and he actually\nMean while he want the country to prosper and he's he's black American no less white Americans Latino Asian American as part of the great American means so when you look at Trump's approval ratings I mean I'm actually a little stunned because\nRepublicans in general it's been hot chocolate breaking ten percent in recent years and ... thirty\nMhm um ... what is your prediction didn't ask about the mid term first tell me about the house\nWell I'm not a not so much of a prognosticators I wouldn't bet the ranch on this one my thought is that the the staple new wave is going to Peter out or that the Republicans will now my prediction is in the public and well narrowly hold the house will make gains in the Senate and poker than men do\nYou know great hope that the Democrats would topple the Republicans into a year which offers a lot of opportunity I think that blown it\nI think didn't ask if that happens or twenty sixteen or I don't think anything could could could match the devastation and uh as far as less concerned about the election of Donald Trump's but this will be close if the Democrats don't get the house it's going to be close to election night back in twenty sixteen\nYes it is and it only will raise the stakes support for twenty twenty but it may very well made the samples safely get at least one more Supreme Court appointment I mean that the Supreme Court and the baggage veteran by Larry we have not had the Supreme Court in our lifetime it's been a carrier fleet balance\nNot going to have a narrow ... already a completely different story to have six three mhm\nOr the house the Senate\nAnd defended I think a number of races that looked to be very close for hanging in the balance of not fit to the rights and people who seemed at one point to be winning Democrats are now in big trouble\nA fall I think that this is actually looking pretty good for a Republican says no reason to be overconfident of course the main thing for the Republicans ... important ...\nI think if the public can turn out it's going to be a very good November\nMy guess is the ... the death of the nation available right now on digital HD didn't ask this may sound like a bizarre question or Donald Trump has called people all sorts of names he's called a Robert De Niro low IQ Maxine Waters low IQ lie in bed\nOr Pocahontas and on and on and on why hasn't the left come up with a name for him\nI think well they have and I think part of the problem with calling him name is that they are awful and I mean I think when the left came up with Stormy Daniels they thought they had a they thought they had him because they thought here's ... he's a Republican the Republican base is never going to put up with anything like this the Republicans are so accustomed\nTo drawing out the last night the sort of ... I think they're all and they were very confident that what happened to truck with them the more they threw out strong Stormy Daniels drop like what else about\nA million Man March forward in the face of the kind of attacks\nThat more and only then Republican occurring for cover it puts them in a category of his own\nBut ...

a number of videos during the twenty sixteen election cycle exposing Democrats not only admitting that voter fraud exist but showing how do they\nHow they committed on what actually to be a massive

graduate Rutgers University please welcome to program\nThank you for having me Larry and we've got the news because Claire McCaskill\nThank you for having me Larry and we've got some news because Claire McCaskill\nJust responded to our hidden cameras ... at a local uh Missouri newscast in the last hour and what did she say\nShe attacked a live video of course she made a false statement in this state than she put out a she said that the Republican candidate for senator Josh Hawley had brought you normally embedded somebody in her campaign that is not correct\nI just had nothing to do with Josh all had never spoken to him he I I was the main investigator involved with this investigation\nAnd just to your listeners know our investigation McCaskill's campaign showed multiple staffers saying that uh that come up and McCaskill on the bottles policies\nAre the same but quote people just can't know that uh other staffers talked about banning semi automatic rifles\nAnd mechanical herself was caught on camera in the office talking to someone she thought worked for her\nSaying that there would be a gun ban some type so the capitals now just respond on local news in Missouri uh is claiming that the Republican Senate candidate had something to do with this which he did not and um but she's definitely on defense if you look at the uh a response that you just put out\nJames O'Keefe I looked at the video not only does the staff or talk about banning semi automatic rifles he talks about banning semi automatic firearms\nThat's right they're talking about handguns\nClara herself talks about um when she gets into the Senate she'll vote with the so called Chuck Schumer wing of the party obviously there's the red state Democrats have to walk a fine line because\nMost of the people there are moderate they're not leftist their their their moderate\nTo pro life pro gun Democrats it's still a thing in Missouri I don't think any swing states so organs investigation exposures that in order to get elected in order to get elected you have to lie to the people and that's what all the staffers are saying this got nixed a rose says\nI'm you know can't let people know that Obama and the last couple of same used another staffer since looking pretty shocking\nI say I provide the name of Glen when free for the McCaskill campaign when asked if\nModerates will be upset once they do a bait and switch and they impeached Trump what the staffer says is quote get over it unquote he's saying the moderates we'll just have to get over being lied to very devastating very powerful\nI mean maybe the most powerful undercover investigation we have ever done because it involves a sitting US Senator has now responded to all of her staffers calling her a liar\nHere is Claire McCaskill response James okay\nWell and some startling that Josh how I Would be part of fraudulently in betting on me and my campaign um he's the attorney general is famous Harry he's supposed to be going after fraud not participating in it [laughter]\nSo um there was nothing there I've been very apply to all my positions\nIn fact now I remember that very individual talking to me trying to get me to say\nTrying to get me to tell him to say something different and then what might the dishes are and I said no you just got to tell people on the doors it is what it is\nI've made no secret that I think we can support the second amendment and universal background checks and banning bump stocks my gun record is out in the open for everyone to see what's really telling about this\nIs how far they're willing to go to ... somebody in my campaign um that startling I've never seen that in a U.S Senate campaign before in the state of Missouri James\nWell first of all it does it mean it's a bold faced lie it's categorically unequivocally falls\nGet Josh Hawley had anything to do with our investigative journalism I've never met him at the for her to come out and say that he is part of Raj slowly embedding somebody vantage balls and she didn't live on local TV and Missouri second of all\nYou saw her waffling and bumbling stumbling and her answer about guns her staff said that she supports a semi automatic rifle there she told us that she supports a ban\nOn a ... those are her words\nSo she found being than you know and and it's a really amazing thing to the heart beyond defense and lie about me and I'm I'm ... I'm certain Larry that what's gonna happen next to this this other Senate candidate John ... and I'll tell you that he had nothing to do with it chicken after respond to that so I think we're\nWe're achieving our goal of holding these people accountable and I think that she's in a lose lose situation because it's not just wants to average ... paid campaign staff saying that she's a liar\nJosh Hawley is her Republican opponent or what are the polls saying right now and you know whether or not your video without any impact and that was early\nWell I I'm not a pollster but I Believe it's tied
