Democrats but in fact where you have people coming out and now there's a woman it basically says that are in a in Nineteen Ninety\nOr you know ... years ago\nNineteen Ninety or you know ... years ago ah or Nineteen years ago that he got very drunk and a ... a her or insurance in Washington DC\n[noise]\nYeah and I'll tell you what what's interesting here is I think first of all you know people are riveted by this they want to know what's going on because of as you just said another accuser if you add it all up there's like now for\nAnd for the Republicans you know you got like Chuck Grassley saying the Kavanaugh hearings going to go on even though there's these allegations\nThat the Republicans are in an interesting position aren't they depending on what the outcome of this is\nWell it's interesting because the fact is is that if Kavanaugh ... for accreditors looking at a woman who is a total right wing I mean she's a very religious right wing person and she would break Kavanaugh look liberal\n[laughter] yes [laughter] there you go that's what would happen by default [laughter] it's\nSo we'll see by the way we had a senator Jill brand let's hear what she had to say Ellen here's what she said earlier today\nFirst of all\nIs not a trial we're not trying to make anyone there's not a standard of innocent\nCredibility judge Kavanaugh and whether he has the integrity whether you want to see whether\nSo there you go and we just talked about it the president defending a cabin on on a on a number of different tangents that he went on it was a crazy press conference we'll talk about that in a minute but he's absolutely right senator Jill a brand and what she's saying it just isn't a trial\n[laughter] well it isn't to trial and the fact is is that he already has a lifetime appointment as a federal judge\nGo or you're talking about of course because this is the highest court in Milan\nAh but yeah the factors that it is not a trial and the the question is if you're if you're telling the truth now of course the Democrats have been putting out a lot of information say that when she was actually question to be a federal judge she did not tell the truth go\nIf a large number of senators do end up leaving her\nOne of the things that will come out of this is one of the questions we'll be what'd you withdraw your nomination and heading into this a few days ago he was not going to do anything like that but would it change depending on what you said there you know what to what Dr Ford says\nI'm as a judge\nSo he you would think does he want to hear testimony from just the named witness and they account\nI'm Mark judge because he could\nTheoretically get him out of that or exonerate him because he would would have been there because clearly she said and what happened that mark judge was there so he is a key cog in in what happens here\nSo I Would think that's exactly what what um cabinet shop with judge Kavanaugh would want because if he was there let's hear what he says and that's part of what her prepared testimony is\nSo she her prepared testimony was released and in the testimony she talks about mark judge\nShe talks about um [noise] you know what she remembers of that night at the at a a day of swimming at the club and going to a small gathering and then she said there were four boys and Brett Kavanaugh mark judge\nThis PJ Smith and some other boy named that she couldn't remember and she said she doesn't remember all the details of\nHow they came up with just impromptu party 'cause that's what you do and that's what happened a lot in the summer which I get and we all get that but it's a typical ... she says people were drinking beer and a small living room on the first floor of the house she said she drank one beer that night then she said Brett mark were drunk\nThey was early in the night they went she when she went up a narrow set of stairs from the living room to the second floor to use the bathroom she got at the top she was pushed into her bedroom and she couldn't see pushed year but she said they both came in lock the door behind the music is playing loud in the room\nSuper super allow 'em\nAnd then she says and that's when she was assaulted and then gave some details so vivid details about that\nAnd then says I'm that mark judge jumped came over and jumped on the bed twice while while that was happening and at the last the last time that happened he toppled over and then Brett Kavanaugh was no longer\nRan out lock yourself in the bathroom you know to the party resumes and that it's done and she gets out of the house so I Would think yeah mark judge would be somebody that they would want\nSo I Would think yeah mark judge would be somebody that they would want to hear from it as far as I Know\nHe is his name has been mentioned as going to be there any of that so you know this is going to be a lot of recall this can be a lot of here's what happen here's what we saw in ... ... it could be what other classmates remembered if you look at classmates it kind of lines up on both\nSides from everything that I've read although I'm not privy to everything of course they have on the hill certainly to that that was released and I got a copy of that\nAlong with some other reporters and people I'm sure other people across the nation when it came out\nSo I'm going through it was very specific some of the details and especially like I mention his name is pretty prominent what does he have to say let's hear what that's about and as far as other people coming forward\nYou you have um people defending him that went to school with him and you have\nOther people that are saying contradictory things I mean men too so it's pretty complex site and at times contradictory\nWhich that's not surprising what will ultimately be is the scrutiny that goes on here and what the decision is in the end\nTo move forward to approve him to go to a different direction\nThere's just gosh I've asked people who really eyeball this kind of stuff meaning they're there in similar not for Supreme Court justice but they are in similar situations and alec when there's allegations and when their suits moving forward\nCetera and I asked a couple of people to do or lawyers specifically\nI'm kind of schools and as if you will to handicap it and their their reluctance do because there's so many on no so I guess\nWhat we'll find out in the hearing is some of those unknowns perhaps and how it you know how it plays out and what it looks like to those that vote and and those that vote\nRealized that this could look really really bad so what they decided to do without a woman who is her name's Rachel Mitchell\nAnd she was tapped by the Republicans to question the Supreme Court nominee and and one of the accusers which is Dr Ford she runs the special victims division in Arizona has never been involved in any kind of a high profile case or\nHad national media attention but this is what she does and because all the senators\nThe senators the Republican senators felt like it was just a ... a white walls senators with um lining up and how would that look and and so just to not get into any trouble with this to bring somebody from the outside in the Republicans\nAre saying this so you can imagine that um I don't know you can imagine how this is going to play out but she she does this for a living she understands the question she knows the directions to go so that could be a super positive thing really honestly\nFor even though it's very strange in a sense when you when you're headed this curve ball but it makes sense the optics of it right and how it'll all play out\nSo the president is standing by I'm Brett Kavanaugh the judge you heard that in the beginning we talked about that he said that I'm leaning did say that there were some uncertainty he did say that he\nUm can be persuaded to believe Brett Kavanaugh's accuser is he did say that that he left the process play out and was open to withdrawing the nomination\nIf they thought if he thought he was guilty and Trump said if I thought he was guilty so ...\nWe'll see this is what happens when it is um played out I mean this is very different the these two wouldn't have seen each other since the eighties when she was Fifteen and he was Seventeen\nAnd you know this is a hearing room and the U.S Senate where our elected officials decide a very important\nPosition a lifetime appointment deciding the future of what happened is a next based on what happened a long time ago by the way in the past\nSo that's what is hanging in the balance a lot is hanging in the balance and a lot of hanging in the balance I think for her and her family for some of what they've had to deal with him in a sense it's like we're going back to high school\nAnd many many decades later many decades later\nAnd mark judge is former girlfriend by the way did say she's\nReady to talk to the FBI and the Judiciary Committee that she you know if that's what it takes that she she'll do it because she's a she's alleged to have been present so what will she have to say is that in fact happened [noise]\nRight we're dip it out I'll meet you on the other side here on America Tonight [noise]\n\n\n\nIt's been said any society is only three meals away from chaos those times may be near think about it\nOur country faces multiple terrorist threat to the Russians from Russia and North Korea social unrest and violence marches you had a good Bailey deluding of stores in cities shutdowns and our crumbling infrastructure at least our power grids vulnerable to long term outages from a single cyberattack\nWhen the chaos from any one of these threats arises the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency\nThat's why you need your own plan for self reliance\nThat's where my patriots supply comes in four weeks for Bible food supplies are only Ninety nine dollars that includes breakfast lunches and dinners order online are prepared with ... dot com Ninety nine bucks for four weeks of survival food tastes like homemade cooking unless up to twenty five years\nFrom my patriots supply get your kids today repair with ... dot com free shipping is included prepared with juicy and dot com\nAnd this was just a little tiny slice and he said it's possible here that oh here's something and be persuaded he said that the president\nAnd he said hey I'll change my mind I Can't tell you I have to watch and see what happens\nIn the meantime a couple of um a couple of other things that are happening in the world believe it or not this is some pretty wild you know the whole papa John's\nUm fallout that's happened the papa John's international is not say anything but there was a report that popped out on Wednesday saying they set out information about an auction to sell itself to other companies\nReuters actually broke the story I was I saw when I broke\nAnd what they're saying is they're denying this report\nThat they're just saying they're denying the report that the chairman John ... who is papa John's face\nUm reached out to an inequity for her private equity firm to help and trying to buy this the pizza chain bright so um I don't know it seems strange because he owns thirty percent of the company and he was out to the chairman in July\nAfter ... to ... to use the N word during a media training and then that just shifted things and they lost the stock lost a chunk um\nSo it would it be so far fetched that that would be shopped around I Would say no it's not he's got to lawsuits against the company in Delaware words incorporated and then another sticking his removal\nAnd vantage men from the Louisville headquarters or what does that mean you know papa John's has a lot of chains got about a hundred and twenty thousand workers worldwide\nIncluding a franchise stores and about twelve hundred in Louisville where they're from the stock price has dumped about thirty two percent over the past year but I'm edged up a little bit on Wednesday so we took a hit after this\nAfter this happened and like I said it wouldn't be shocking to me if they were trying to kind of shopping around because of that but just denying it anyway not wanting that's necessarily get out this is a big deal how 'bout Hoover Hooper agreed to pay a hundred and forty eight million over\nA data breach that they had and um to keep quiet basically they agreed to pay that to settle cases and fifty states related to what happened and twenty sixteen is affected fifty million\nGlobal customers and seven million drivers can you know this is this is like all to normal right we wake up were under the covers and who knows who stole in our information\nSo but over really stood out because of um that CEO who was the c._e._o. then and the fact that they paid the hackers responsible for that breach boy hundred thousand to keep quiet and destroyed the data the data that they had\nAnd then they waited a year before publicly saying it so you didn't know it was like okay we'll give you the money just destroy it and then up I guess we're going to tell everyone that that there was this exposure there\nSo that was bad Jew Jew on their part of course they're going to get sued for that and they did get sued or because it's a cover up as you're violating the public's trust come on I mean that's pretty clear when you see that\nSo it was part of the terms of the settlement overs agreed to maintain\nBetter security practices led by a security officer who reports the board of directors comply with state laws when you're talking about safeguarding consumer information and disclosing any data security incidents quarterly for two years\nAnd have this corporate integrity program with a hotline to report misconduct and instituted an annual code of conduct training wow like this they just totally ripped it up and had to do that because of the fact that they had to settle this\nAnd it was that bad I mean a hundred and forty million but think of the information that would have been disclosed because you've got a credit card in there with everything in it that's the whole idea you flip open the phone you hit the uber you're off a plane you're running around you're getting a new or somewhere\nAnd there's no money exchanged because your information is already

about\nAnd of course it starts with confronting the unexpected and thinking about who you want to protect when you're no longer around the next step is really to figure out how much life insurance you need and finally what kind of life insurance will meet your needs\nNo that's right that's right so how do you figure out how much you need\nThe simplest way is how much do you weren't each year after taxes you could try to add up based they allowances duty big cetera sometimes it's just easier to take a look at how much you account each month ... if you have twenty five hundred dollars going into your town each month then you may need to replace about thirty thousand dollars a year\nAnd I'm assuming it's best just one year than the total amount you may need to replace is higher right\nThat's right you need to decide how many years you're replacing that income for maybe ten years is the right number ... time to transition and replace that income now because thirty thousand dollars a year for ten years we're talking about replacing three hundred thousand dollars total\nWell three hundred thousand for ten years okay so now we have an amount what kind of life insurance ... look at\nThe main concern is protecting your family really against the loss of income in term insurance is worth taking a look at\nIt as one type of life insurance policy to provide coverage for a certain period of time or specify term of years if the insurance died during that time period specified in the policy in the policy is active than a death benefit will be paid\nOkay so if I buy a twenty year term policy for three hundred thousand in coverage as long as I pay the premiums each year and I die within a twenty year term my family would get the three hundred thousand\nYou got it you help protect your family from a potential catastrophic event and keep in mind this is just one scenario in one type of life insurance or many tests out there\nWell Brent walking through an example like that as a great way to get to to think through this kind of decision especially for our listeners who may shy away from a complex subject like life insurance\nI'm Glad to hear that all your listeners Nader on number three step process first ask yourself what are you even need insurance and the first place I think about who is counting on your financially second figure out how much income you need to replace a third decide what type of insurance you need\n... you make it sound so easy but that last decision point doesn't seem so easy\nEnough and then having to remind your listeners to do some homework on different types of life insurance out there and more importantly\nA trust a financial advisor to work with everyone needs are different so it's helpful to have a professional help you walk through your life insurance option\nYeah Brent that's a great reminder Brent thanks for being here will be back here next week with another Morgan Stanley money brief right here on the national

patriotism and it harms that donors because they're good intentions are frustrated it harms legitimate charities because the donors only have so much money to give and they've already given it to the bad guy\nAnd it harms the veterans who were supposed to be receiving that help right\nYeah yeah I mean that that's a problem that are absolutely needs attention and uh it's great that the FCC is
