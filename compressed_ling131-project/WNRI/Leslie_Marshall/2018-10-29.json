first generation American my parents emigrated from Poland and early sixties they first escaped\nFascism and then communism how does that impact do at the way they ratio instilled in me a deep love of country and patriotism\nWas it like growing up in the middle of Montana [noise]\nProbably the only place on an Indian reservation speak polish in the house of being a Jewish heritage as a young man it was probably the best place I could imagine to grow up I\nWas fishing and camping and hiking and enjoying the outdoors a\nWas probably the only Jewish kid that I knew a in that area um\nProbably the only poll skip do\nMentioned earlier Jeff that you watch people reinvent themselves on the on the reservation can you tell us about that what effect that\n[noise] yeah they used to be a a miss about\nA drunken Native Americans and then at some point the trial was able to get control of water rights over if I had like and it changed the tribes fortunes they also did a casino gambling and it really changed the the tribes futures and that it really taught me that one could reinvent themselves if he looked deep within yourself [noise] speaking\nAbout reinvent yourself you mentioned as a youngster you were a a weakling or Ninety pounds ... there was bullied often uh what do you recall from that experience [noise]\nYeah unfortunately I was a a social misfits misfits I was uh maladjusted I\nLike to play dungeons and dragons and comic books and computer games which didn't make me the most popular kid in school uh but it did ah\nConnect me to a group of friends\nThere was a

is a nonprofit organization is preparing the next generation of tech leaders served four hundred and fifty kids a week in Philadelphia alone\nWere in Pennsylvania New Jersey and Delaware alright Mr witty\nSo tell us about\nWhat you learn where you learned your technology skills I got into tech when I went into the Air National guard and then after you got out of the service and you served in multiple services what\nExperience to do you have that led you to want to have an impact on the community [noise]\nWorking in tech I realized that people of color concentrated in to the lowest paying jobs in tech when you get into the highest paying jobs in tech like software development data science user experience it's designed\nThere's almost new diversity and that the space I was working in so over and over I was managing teams in working on team Dr is the only black guy on the team felt like that was that was a huge gap\nSo much can you tell us a little about your mom and dad and what they did for a living to my mom's an aspirin or my dad was a doctor\nAnd um you told us a little bit about you know working with your mom can you tell the listening audience um what you did and I had that experience was like I had the fortune of being my mom's labor um so it it wasn't wasn't pleasure boy I didn't enjoy it I did learn a\nBusiness and a lot about the process of taking something from what is your mom do\nShe was an entrepreneur who focused on customer upholstery and in ... when you were her labor ... what do you mean you were a labor doing what were you were young we all we did or installation who's we\nI have when you say you did or installations how young were you when you were carrying furniture\nOr at least seven eight years old seven eight years old drew get taken back in ... besides process did you learn anything about customer service are dealing with people during that I did I did I I\nInteracting with customers how you treat customers and how about your father can you tell us what what he did he was\nDirector of pediatric intensive care Jefferson and you tell us you used to go to the hospital with him sometimes right\nAll the time I'm ... because he was busy as he was he also taught at the medical school there his way of spending time with me with taking me to work with so I spent a lot of my free time with him at work\nAnd what do you remember about that I mean what was your key takeaway from all those times together to hospital is a key takeaway for me was I didn't want to be a doctor [noise] uh\nWhat else did you learn what what did you learn hanging out with your debt to the hospital they use in business nowadays I'm One of the things he told me as being a doctor's like being an auto mechanic or there's a there's a process to how you sort through and problem solving and what do you mean by that there's a process and ... and how does that correlate to to coding [noise]\nAs a developer a lot of what you're doing is developing logic you know it's logical would algebra Nick thinking some\nDo the exact same thing they're trying to figure out what the problem is and what the solution to the problem is\nIs important that you instill in these students\nTo make sure every one of our young people understand that they have a an obligation they have a response responsibility and once you identify a problem you're responsible for addressing their profit and you told us a little story about Evan who sort of expressed this out can you tell us that story so after\nGraduating from high school Evan is now\nAt the University of Pennsylvania at Wharton who\nI really appreciate everything you did an because as being an organization I now want to come back and volunteer and house that make you feel to see that happen to signal to me that we're doing our job you know I'm doing the right thing every time\nOne of our kids does something like that than I Know we're on the right track and and what do you see next for the student like what do you think will happen next red and when she graduates\nWe are working to make sure that people like Evan are prepared to be the next generation is PTOs and CEOs [noise]\nWhen you left the service you get into prison construction outta that job shape you and it didn't guide you to start coated bike it's\nOf the things I've learned in prison construction is that\nStates like Pennsylvania for investing more money and building prisons and building schools um I felt like\nLike that in itself is a huge problem in that pushing you don't want to have an impact in education [noise]\nSylvester your dad's not with us today but what what do you think he would\nSay to you and and I think it'd be proud of what you've accomplished I think he I think he would be um [noise] he you know things my dad said to me growing up I I still replay over and over and you know what what what did they say what he said\nHe taught me a lot about being very realistic you can have dreams but my dad was a person who is rooted in reality so I came to him and said I wanted to be an astronaut he would say okay that's fine this is what you need to do can be an astronaut come up with a plan and figure out how you're going to execute the planting\nSo so how do you correlate that to what you're doing today [laughter] so we do a lot of things that turn it on\nYou're doing today we do a lot of things that turn it on and I just like his father did with his father told me telling these kids he's saying he's helping these kids are appreciate they can be whatever they want to being given them a truck to get there isn't it true\nThat is correct we provide the support the networks the resources and what we ask them is figure out what you want to do and we're going to we're going to get behind you so those are you married or single or married you have any kids three similarity between being a died and being the says here you're the founder and CEO of coded by kids what's a similarity [noise]\nUm one of the similarities is instead of having one teenager or two teenagers in my household I have\nTeenagers oldest city who you ask as a paint them up a high so basically your dad ended up being a dark as kids until the year the DACA kids also Peter\nI just want to expand on that a\nSo your father she'll many children in his career and you're you're actively working with four hundred and fifty kids just here in Philadelphia are you are you in a way healing them like her father did\nI Hope that what I'm doing is preparing them for for\nBetter future I you know\nWe started his own money these ... are you that they appreciate you\nI see kids coming back where do they say to you\nWe want to remain as a apart organization we swallowed the right to that you make them feel like family\nWe're community first so if we make our kids to like or if we feel like they're part of a community that's what they are always you're also told us earlier that one of the reasons you didn't think he wanted to be a doc is because your dad worked long hours are you working long\nHours unfortunately I Am uh-huh sex question you\nYou've been giving back a lot you know and the one place you gave back to the country um when you served in Iraq what what what ... what positive take away to\n... from that experience [noise]\nAnd I look at the same way if you're able to keep moving forward from one day the next and outlast and eventually you can make it to the end\nYou resist that as a kid where you are a workhorse as a kid going in with your mom and you hated it already embrace it I was entrepreneurial addict as a kid a difference um instead of getting my first job\nMy mom would make me sandwiches for lunch and I was selling those damages to my sixth grade teacher\nBut what if your mother was making use humor to watch and what would you do when I was selling the same just to my sixth grade teacher you you understood something about commerce as a kid correct also it just it just occurs to me I could be mistaken about this year all about the heart am I correct about that\nDark yeah yeah [noise] so I'm trying to figure out how heart fits in the business\nTo care like you have to one care about what you're doing but you also have to care about the society that Dr breeding it if you don't care about what you're doing do you have a hard time getting motivated and doing the job I Do [noise] so what do you care about\n[noise] I hear about our kids and I care about the future that relieving to them [noise]\nIsn't that what your father did is so you're really a combination of your mother and father [noise] your father was carrying your mother was the entrepreneurial you're doing the same stuff while many of us don't want to ever admit that yes through what else do you pick it up [noise]\nVery young listening audience what lessons would share with them especially those that want to go out and learn how to code [noise]\nIt's work every day it's work there there are no easy days [noise]\nSheer you mentioned that are preparing the kids is what it's all about and and coating is not everybody's cup of tea right then the kids go away do other things as thought of coding or how are they prepared\nSome of our kids to\nOf what they do whether it's ... I Want to be a lawyer I Want to be a doctor learning to think logically he's going to help them wherever they are\nAnd you are sharing earlier with with us that uh you don't just teach the kids had a code you teach them other things like how to how to operate in business and and cetera correct we ... we teach started focused aspirin worship along with the technical skills\nSo really it sounds like these that the benefit these kids are paid or not but it's a it's a community and oh by the way the benefit of the community as there's a lot of different stuff she can learn\nI don't [noise] what's it what's the website address this organization those coated\nBy his coated by kids dot com and they had a second coded by kids dot com secret speed was first moved there we see of coded bike is yours executives rate\nTo relate an end to be humble and to lead so every level so\nAs opposed to a as opposed to ... walking around thinking he's a hotdog and treating everybody like trash that's the opposite of who he is isn't it exactly right hundred percent on\nYou you're in charge of building ... the culture and the core values around pepper Hamilton and I'm just curious if time is is playing

a hundred percent I\nWhen or how how does the clients benefit from\nInfluence on the team I'm trying to figure that out [noise] toms\nLead is what makes everyone at the firm want to do their best\nBecause our clients are in a sometimes in customs some positions and I think their ability to relate to their their attorney that are working with is a great way to kind of seems to be clear they would go directly to the upside of column is one of the reasons that these quality folks want to work and stay with\nPepper Hamilton is because of the time and then the benefit of clients are they good quality people\nThat are that are sticking around for the long term how how long have you been with pepper Hamilton at twelve years that's exceptional to hear that you know especially with marketing people tend to stick with jobs two or three years to what was the U.S military questions yeah the way the only person that we believe this will be my mother\nIn between being a community leader and then leading a significantly large law firm you served in the navy talk about as a as a surface warfare officer talk about what lessons in leadership you learn there and how you've been able to apply them at ... so I showed up\nOn a navy destroyer in\nPascagoula, Mississippi\nHaving grown up in Philadelphia and I was in charge of a communications division [noise]\nTwenty seven people three of those individuals for younger than me so here's a Twenty one year old nobody\nAnd uh just the ability to learn from them and and work with them effectively a was maybe the most pivotal moment in my life as a leader ...\nTell me more about that and was or something you learn in the neighborhood where you grow up in that helped us out or ... what was that all\n[noise] I don't know about the neighborhood that I Will\nSay that when I'm On a ship and I'm a meeting people for the first time from literally all over the country was special skills it was impactful uh\nI I remember one particular individual who had\nBrilliant technical skills and was able to even in charge of certain communications equipment and could fix anything\nSo as opposed to moving him aside you're able to

like they hadn't been mailed that they were delivered what's your take on all this\nOr you know I mean we don't know yet the theories are running wild from both political spectrum is in a sense and CNN CEO came out and said the president should realize his\nWords have consequences he in a press secretary which basically a CNN saying that because of the president they got the bomb you know sent them which we don't know um and then other people have had a speculative theories that this is\nSomebody from uh the left and side that want sympathy for the Democrats I mean I've heard of all today\nAnd the bottom line remains we you know we don't know who did it I Would I Would assume that someone or some group is behind all of it because we know from the reports that they will be a similarity you know of the devices that they're they're the chicken type of devices\nYeah scary stuff in a obviously we'll see I I think we've seen a chronic ... they're going painstakingly in what they do for a living but they're taking apart all of the pipe bombs and looking at the materials and where they were purchased and my ... my guess is I think they're going to catch the the person is\nAll I think they are you know first of all from what I what I understand you know what our research today and heard from friends up on the hill\nIt listed all kinds of comments than as Bob Ney said the former congressman from Ohio if you missed him he was talking about that his his people on the hill we're talking about everybody was talking with these manila envelopes the first package turned up a was addressed to Soros for billionaire\nFinance payer a left wing heavy donors have the Democratic party and the male envelopes were\nRerouted to a return address on the packages and it was at least that one was written Debbie Wasserman Schultz the who the woman who formerly chaired the Democratic National Committee\nSo how 'bout that with the Florida office of us representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz the FBI said that if confirmed to other uh packages which I mention was waters and they think there could be some others out there too\nSo and the CNN bureau in New York on a package you dress to breath and there's a lotta times can be an analyst frequently they're so he's seen in the building\nThat would be the reason that it would have gone there is now it's the searches on for who could that you know who is it not it could be but who is it the American male bomber\nThat's what they're looking for and I bet you they find that person per the easily because of pulling everything a partner or stay\nUp somehow became like a needle in a haystack and disappeared deep deep deep\nUh into the recesses of the earth somewhere we 'cause I I think there'll be able to turn them over\nBecause of the clues they may have left how long it takes or what happens from here who knows but it is a big deal obviously and bombs than white powder scares and everything else is\nIt is absolutely frightening there certainly were other things that happened on the day\nThe caravan is on everybody's mind that something about you know something that so many of you were talking about I always say that\nAmerica Tonight is about the buzz in your backyard and mind and that is one of the things that are causing what's gonna happen with this caravan but because of the packages that were found and who could it be and then the\n... you know the last ... from some about it and um [noise] what some are saying about you know the angry rhetoric can that's firing this stuff but that's why the president obviously was trying to say\nYou know that doesn't get us anywhere and I it's been fodder all day long so while that's happening the caravan is still full steam ahead\nThat's happening the caravan is still full steam ahead but\nVia these caravans what happens ultimately when you get to the doorstep of the U.S the idea is well\nWe're going to be turned away that hasn't happened yet but we're not there yet and they are our troops that will be on the border so what that's going to look like\nIt's going to be interesting to see if we're going to have some kind of clash or people let through what what is it you know ultimately what is it oh by the way I Want to remind everyone we've got nail the score coming up nailed the scores coming up\nIt takes the place of invade demand came 'cause we're nailing the score in the man cave that\nHappens at the tail end of this hour if you're listening to us\nSomewhere and play back to our and you missed it that's why you got to tune in the mail the score is where I picked the game of the week in the NFL you call don't have to know football you just pick a team gimme a score and some buddy is going to win\nLast week we had the coal from Sarasota, Florida we've got a big affiliate there who was listening and\nAsked her boyfriend for gas and she did not nail it but I said every week because I was celebrating ten years of America Tonight we would send\nGift certificates little gift certificate for something so buffalo wild wings went in that direction so now in the score but at some buffalo wild wings cannot beat that right\nOr the mega millions ... brings you want it in the world if he won the mega millions in South Carolina\nYou don't have to tell people who you are if you win the lottery and somebody very near Greenville went into a store got a ticket and they wanted the single ticket\nSo the mega millions tickets sold for that jackpot just\nShy of the lottery record oh who was the person they can be listening to us because we have a great affiliate right there\nSo the ticket was sold the Casey Martin Simpson ville just about Ninety miles North West of Columbia there was a banner at the convenience store that red rock\nToday luck struck here\nThat is big luck I mean that is crazy\nThat is so crazy that somebody one that that they went into the store ... down a few dollars walked out and what are the chances we hear the ridiculous chances and their chances were right on cars they hit it\nI I mean what is that like what does that feeling like\nGetting all those numbers and do they even know they might not know so we've got a great affiliate there are one hundred point seven ... and ... in Columbia South Carolina\nThey may listen to us there or just the the Columbia Lexington area fourteen eighty am I Know there's people they're listening to I got some calls from people in South Carolina\nAnd a or we have gotten some calls and I got an email the other day from somebody [noise]\nMaybe they're listening if you're listening and you won the lottery I promise call us we won't tell anyone who you are you could be listening right now\nCheck your ticket if you're listening to us and South Carolina especially if you went to that convenience store [noise] oh\nWow\nIt's still a staggering to me staggering one point\nOne point five and change\nTake out the taxes it is so much money oh my gosh and the friends he was on forty four states have mega millions or they're not to worry about this car payment whatever else you live in is paid off debt\n\nWhat are you going to do with all the money and just a little bit of that money you could live on the interest of course forever and your family and your grandkids near great grandkids and so on and so forth down\nIt is insane speaking of insane we're talking about checking a lottery ticket is without checking your seatbelt vi I'm\nPilots have the passengers so picture this year on the plane the pilots says we're turning around because our planes too big so United flight to Chattanooga\nTo Thirteen to Thirteen PM delay because of unforeseen circumstances it was an unusual situation it was a text alert from United Airlines that sounds crazy if you get that text alert right\nAnd it and it went on to say we're working hard to solve it we value your time we're sorry for the inconvenience what does that mean so it's not news to the Fifteen people on the flight fifty to Seventy seven they got that alert after that problem happened after the Chicago to Chattanooga flight returned to O'Hare mid flight\nOf\nThe planes too big [laughter] within the planes too big we're turning around so that's exactly what happened um they had to go back to O'Hare\nAnd it was too large to land\nIt was a seven it was Seventy six feet amber warrior one Seventy five was too big to land in Chattanooga\nI mean that doesn't make sense I've flown on those planes are flown to Philadelphia from Dallas on those planes I don't get that I don't believe I'll have to ask the other but I don't believe those planes are that\nDo give the people that had to be re route and you know get on another plane cheeses pretzels and water\nHang with a mailbag neck so they can\n\nBags under the guise crow speed firearms and ... are booms adults complained about as low wage now there's instantly ageless worked for ... and it was great for them\nBut here's a clip from a ritual ratio testing the results of storage lists\nOr certify dermatologist Dr ... made about\nShe went off to try a product called instantly age with yeah instantly you could say a different saving the camera like wow look at the difference yeah that is probably\n\nActually a very traumatic\n... or ... or ... see him life dot com but gee see life dot com for the money back guarantee the preferred priceless couch object him life dot com that's Jason\nWhat a problem to have let me get beat that\nI'm Tennessee\nI Love what I Do I've sacrificed a lot to do this in fact I have a book coming out called deal your own destiny and it comes out it's produced by Forbes did it published it\nAnd it's I'm coming out on November ninth boom it drops on a friday and ironically on friday I Will be that friday I Will be in Washington DC you're flying to Washington DC and I talk about in the book you know a radio it's a very strange but wonderful industry\nAnd if I Want a huge lottery I Would probably um\nI probably you know and it probably first I could do I would do a Little America tonight tour for the tour I keep threatening I wouldn't be worried about getting sponsors 'cause I Would just do it I just get a bunch of uh the guys from DC and get a cruel\nTripped out bus figure it out go on\nRoad to a couple of couple of places do a little tour could be a lot of fun\nSo I'd probably do that do something to do something and radio can continue to do the show just do it on a bigger scale because I'd have more resources or resources behind it I have more resources that would that would be the answer\nAll right ah how about this one [laughter] what a thing to think about this from a cow and his cane of emailed the show before\nI listen all the time even if I have to download and I heard you talk about tuned in radio others and said that thank you for that\nAnd for your people for putting it on there because I just get the app you said something about the app and I just want someone I'm working out the next day if I'm not up or do you make of the markets plunging and plunging again where you get used to those numbers being high it's kind of a false sense of security a\nIt is a false sense of security that's why I say it's like being at the crops table any investing let's face it but it has been a slew of tech stocks boom they they were performing pretty good at the beginning of the year they have been the biggest decline ers\nAnd so much of that I'm sure has to do with a series of the economy in earnings and that's part of what rocks that you look at what what numbers are so like week subscriber numbers\nUm like a can tell you that would be the reason that fell ... bond prices are rising but their yields for sending emails lower\nAnd there's Jerry ... generators out there over\nCorporate money corporate profits and the interest rates and disappointing results always result in that or bad news super bad news will tank the market as we all know it's such a good question and if I could look in my\nCrystal ball and tell you the exact reasons I Would tell tell you the Dow tumbled on Wednesday six hundred and eight points that's like two point four percent that's a that's a lot that's out as we say who not good\nAnd it's a correction really if I if I were in the business I Would say and we have that on the show and we've had people on the show we did a lot of financial I almost had to take a break from the financial side because we had a lot of different people on the show for a long\nTime even Kelly was one of them make fun of course they all loved those guys but then you take a break from it you know because people get weary of hearing about I think about some of the news but they were too great guys that had really interesting perspective on what\nWe see happen with our money and if you are lucky enough to have a four O. one K. what are you writing in and what are you you know\nWhat the result what happens with the results so what could go up um you know it's interesting 'cause Netflix is having some problems and\nI think I Would think that health stocks could bounce back up it just depends on the company you have to go company by company but it was a very rough day gains for twenty Eighteen on the Dow and it's a pay five hundred have been just wiped out\nAnd that's how it is right that one more that's due to this one this one I'm going to go back to watery this one is from an case if you had won the lottery and you got a chance to take many trips what is the first trip you would take ...\nYou know what ballet I've always wanted to go to valley so I could just go to valley or lay on the beach and relax [noise] hey do show from the beach that's

protecting your personal data Matt welcome\nThe Iranian state can be back\nHey listen ah last week we discuss several steps listeners can take to safeguard personal and financial information on our mobile devices what's on tap this week\nThat the rainy thanks for having me out again this week we want to go deeper and discuss best practices in authentication and medication is simply how your group\nWho you are a when you present yourself on line of education is central to making sure that you can protect your your personal privacy you're the security and uh and they really have your data\nSo all those annoying passwords I have to remember right\nBrandy or Jack Lew right and they are there are more ways to get yourself that just to ... ah in particularly there are three that I Want to highlight they really are what you know\nWhat you have and who you are at first it what you know you mentioned at worst but they can also be dancer choice Trey question like your best friend was in college or you met your spouse or background information like your mother's maiden name or your ZIP Code the easiest thing for a cyber actor actor dedicated you\nWhen you're stuck using that ...\nYou always try to put as many layers of places to walk to add layers of protection you want to choose the more obscure questions when you answer questions and a in a given the chance always rotate your ... and you want to make them as long as complex as possible\nAlso always be mindful of what you have posted on social media to security question like what is the name of your dog when every one of your Instagram post has your dog's name will make it easier for a hacker to gain access to your ...\n... yeah and also the names of parents siblings addresses et cetera that's a great reminder in general to be aware of the information we're voluntarily sharing what the world especially since some people may be looking to use that information against us on\nThe way that we are the next layer is really what you have this could be an artist a token or in case there's a lot of government employees a\nCard or small cart a little harder than personal but it's on ... especially if

particularly the facial recognition that I've seen them really cutting edge what's the best way to leverage these new technologies\nAlready when you combine evoked forms of authentication and what we call multi factor authentication and you always want to enable more accurate than occasion when it's an option\nA little bit of extra work hard to accept an application on a piece of data is worth the additional protection it really gives you a peace of mind remember Richard factor actually locked in a case that needs to be different so user name and at or security question would not count as an actor because those are both something you\nUnderstood okay let's get back to passwords then what are some best practices when it comes to creating them I mean for me it can be kind of a tedious exercise\nFor you and everybody else around but when you\nAsk for complexity is going to be important as well as regular rotating changing passwords easiest way to keep track of the the the the awkward manager asked for a while it became medicated Jerry complex aspect on your the\nIf you do you want to be services make sure only you have to\nAsk for it and he something unique and complex
