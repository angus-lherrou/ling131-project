Schiff on CNN's State of the union\nNo one's sets the tone more than president United States\nAnd the tone that he sets as one of division off in one of hatred\nAnd this has now become a struggle about\nThe United states is evil\nHoward Dean really\nThis man was flames hatred where fans by a president who kept talking about this caravan of ... favorite Harris\nI'm this is a um [noise] this is a triangulation a lot of people are making this this is\nSort of doubling down on not just intellectual dishonesty but but just disgusting levels of scapegoating that the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter was somehow ... bird to action\nBy the president of warnings\nAbout the Caribbean\nThe thousands of people who are headed our way in order to intentionally violate\nThat a president who is vigilant about that\nYou somehow set the stage for this kind of a reaction I mean how low will these folks go and and and I think the answer is in why is he out there\nVery first\nThing that the president and Britain First can barely attacks in Pittsburgh and in the pipe bombs the very first thing the media did was blamed the president and make him responsible for these ridiculous\nActs you can't start cutting the responsibility of individual on anybody but the individual who carries out the crime is delivered on the promises he snakes and if anything I think it's sad I\nN device it the way that

dragged out as you hear\nWord for word and page after page and speech after speech about how our our ability to get along is kind of been thrown into the toilet about our level of discourse in civility is all kind of dashed against Iraq's an observation that you certainly can make is it because Trump won\nOr because of a Trump tweet or because of some sharp elbows and a\nSalty thing that he might have said it some rally\nOr are you kidding me is everybody that stupid\nAnd the reason our discourse has been dragged into the muck\nIs the reaction of people who hate him the reaction of people who cannot handle that he won the media have been biased for as long as many of us have been alive and this this is nothing new\nBut the level of hatred\nThat's how you know the change is real by the way\nThe level of vitriol the level of bend them when you have an entire dominant media culture walked around saying the president is racist the president is a hater I was out in the world is

is happening\nWhen something just horrible like this has occurred um ... it's tempting to ask where was God as those bullets were flying where how how can a loving God allows things like this to happen\nIt is it's very counterintuitive but so is the whole concept of God's sending his son to live and die and rise from the dead so that our sons can be forgiven that's not exactly you know practical real world and in front of your face tangible realism\nOf faith itself is counter intuitive our intuition is to believe only that which we can see our intuition is to understand believing except only those things that make sense to our little\nTeeny human much that's why it's really really important\nTo understand that a loving God will oversee a human history that contains things like the Holocaust\nThat contains war and disease and famine in pedestal and some shuttle explosions and and plane crashes those folks in Indonesia how many ... just under a couple of hundred people on

things happen no but overseeing\nHuman race in which people will make choices\nThey will choose evil and he will be there to guide us through the dispatch of that evil to comfort the bereaved to lift up the downtrodden to be there\nFor us as we seek to understand but the most important thing that you need to understand is that there will be no explanation given given to you given to me in this life of why things like that happened\nThere there there'll be no handy tidy memo from God saying oh by the way here's here's either the Holocaust thing lizard credibly tough to withstand here's here's here's why that happened it's not going to happen\nWe're cold to be obedient anyway we're cold to be faithful anyway we're we're cold to to to rely on him\nAnyway and if we do that will be the
