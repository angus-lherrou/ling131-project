from your hair or for all of us um what kind of a political community do and and we the electorate due\nTo kind of get a political community\nThe polarized and and back to science of respect for a loyal opposition I think that's been lost\nIn has a ... let me suggest the following and see what you think\nOf people use the term polarization and what I think they really mean is people being nasty to each other we're always going to be polarize the actual almost scientific definition of some people over here and some people over there that's fine that's all you that's the only searches for unity and common ground garbage\nYou know what people mean when they talk about unity and common ground that means conservatives caving on core values that's what they want so let us be where we are at stake out our turf in and fight proudly yet civil Ian smartly let the left bring its best ideas but but don't call us\nStupid names and suggest that we're racists don't be ugly doping nasty we won't be uglier nasty to you let us fight hard fight smart and fight clean so we're not look into deep polarized so much um\nWe're we're looking to simply return to some semblance of human decency in manners good luck you know\nAnd and yeah but you know that sounds like a that seems like a pat answer let me add one tiny sentence\nI there's no way we can wander there is no longer we can wave to sort of way we can what there is no legislation we can pass but we you know we can do the examples in our own lives\nOf before if we are conservatives and for the leftist around us let us never say anything worse about them than we think you're mistaken and explain why and invite conversation invite dialogue and bring some some some biblical love to it some some godly affinity for your fellow
