insiders that have been published recently the ticket master is playing dirty pool with your wallet\n\n[noise]\nSo courageous moment [noise]\nI have always despised ticket master\nBecause you go to buy a ticket to something and there's this outrageous fee added to it if you're not aware how that all came about ticket master a very cleverly but very diabolical he\nWent to promoters and Venus around the country and offered them\nPretty much whatever they wanted to become the exclusive seller of tickets\nAnd hit a point of critical mass where when you wanted to buy tickets to most anything in the United states you have to go through the ticket master monopoly and with the added on has no relationship at all to the cost of the infrastructure\nIs all a basically a monopoly passed through and it's why I despise monopolies so much and you think that that would be enough\nFor ticket master and a rake off out of your wallet but there's a long form story in Rolling Stone you may have heard about it insiders\nAt ticket master have\nSpill the beans to ticket master has a system operating where they manipulate the sale of tickets to get them into the hands of their own scalpers\nSo that they're making money both on the fees up front bend the fees when the tickets are resold plus the profits now ticket master denies it we'll see what goes on with that but I Want to tell you the whole system is rotten\nWe're getting rocked and it stinks\nAnd when there's a time that I can go to a box office\nAnd buy tickets directed not pay the fee I Do that but there are times I Will not go to an event because I Will not pay the ticket master rip off the the good news for you and me\nIs that a lot of events\nDon't sell out anymore that used to people or so distracted there's so much going on in our lives sports events or even if they are nominally a sellout they're soft sell out there are so many empty seats\nAt sports events now you can buy tickets if you're willing to\nAt the last

know that it's not it is that is that it's their network and so it's at forty the wind gotcha would therefore to your mind\nIs that these speeds but you'll have when you're on high speed data will not be as fast as they are I'm parent barrage\nThat is true I ... I've been reading some accounts from people on line they say that it hasn't been too much of an issue for them they're still able to watch Youtube videos without suffering and still able to get around the Internet pretty quickly\nBut there is that is a a compromise with this plan and also with some of the other ones you might be slowed down a little bit so you want to read through the fine print to know that you are paying less but you may be getting a little bit slower service\nAnd the biggest difference between the horizon visible and cricket and\nBiggest difference between the horizon visible and cricket and um metro buy T Mobile and the boost is how many stores as the invisible I go in\nAnd all they really are invisible there's no stores it's all done through an app\nThat's right you download the app you sign up for the service there you pay through that everything and that's really much more how cell phone service of done elsewhere in the world\nWithout a relying on a big network or stores or cricket is suddenly a Eighteen tease second tier brand has now been exposed that they weren't up to the standards of the others so they made some changes\nYeah uh what cricket did cricket has to unlimited plans\nAnd there really hasn't been much of a change to the cheaper one it does restrict your speeds and that's a compromise that I think a lot of people might not be comfortable with but it's a really great type price point a fifty dollars a month for one line but for for lines it's a hundred dollars a month so that's still a really good deal and it was you know drunk the itself it's all included\nA now they're more expensive plan they used to have a limitation on speed as well but that's now been removed so four fifty five dollars a month with auto pay you're getting really fast unlimited plan on Eighteen T's network\nAnd the reason it's fifty five is there is a grudge match of hate between eighty and see and John ledger the guy from T Mobile\nBay hate each other Eighteen he tried to have him arrested in Las Vegas a few years ago at CBS they I mean it is like a blood feud like Hatfield McCoys so\nThe mobile came out with the metro buy T Mobile at sixty so then cricket said well we're going to go fifty five exactly so the competition is great and you've got all this explained were charts and all that\nWe've got it all laid out so all the all these plans you can read side by side and then you can go and also compare them to the big four forest plans to see if saving that extra twenty dollars a month or so is going to be worth it for you and you can deal with some of the the gotcha says that come with all of these unlimited plant\nAnd now we moved to a marketplace where there are now three tiers of service\nThere's the second tier companies we've talked about and now there's a third tier of ultra cheap companies that come with a lot of things you've got to be willing to live with and we have those laid out for you at Clark dot com as well with those plans starting at as little as ten dollars a month\nFor bona fide real cell phone service with\nI'm not a huge amount of data but\nSome data yeah well thank you and I appreciate how you stay on top of this because is there ever a week that goes by that cell phone rape plans don't change\nNo they're changing multiple times a week and we're staying on top of it all its own car dot com\nThank you very much John joins us on the Clark Howard show Hi John\nThat color [laughter] how're you doing I talked to you great to have you\nKnow I'm doing well I'm an avid listener and glad to be on um had a question for you though which is it seems like you're favoring one of your children are banned guard you continue to call them the the lowest cost provider the low cost provider um\nWell actually I have a favorite children\nAnd so it's hard to pick you know it's like a parent's arrest you know you got you got these these four kids which is really your favorite why don't have any favors are all [laughter] so now you're you're doing that to me with investing so tell me who it is you feel like I'm dissing\nFidelity you've mentioned on your show they have to you know widely diversified funds mutual funds that have come out of a ton of really low cost no transaction fee each yes\nOr no minimum ... minimum wage to start um they've really kind of blazed the trail of lowest cost in my opinion\nYeah zeroes there is such a brilliant marketing campaign around the fatalities zeroes which have no commission and no ongoing fees that they absorb all the fees\nI I think this is absolutely great what fidelity is done fidelity let me tell you why this came about fidelity had found itself steadily losing market share\nTo a nachos vanguard but also to the bigger player out there that most of the United states don't pay a lot of attention to black rock\nAnd so the two of them were taking all the market share and there was out there so fidelity\nComing up with the new product development zero\nHas set down a marker that no one can say they're not the cheapest because obviously fidelity at no cost is offering a better deal than anybody else and so they have the total stock market index which is thousands of U.S companies\nAll in one investment at no fees at all and then the international index fund which just thousands of international stocks of free so\nA fidelity is in the game solid you know what else they've done\nWhat's that\nSo fidelity used to have relatively high cost target retirement funds\nAnd now they have two flavors up them they have an extremely low cost series\nOf a target retirement funds and then they have their old one that still has very high costs will not high costs but a higher than a low cost companies should be offering so they have become much more aggressive on the front\nAnd so do you invest with fidelity and you wonder why always talked about\nVanguard or were you trying to figure between the two\nSo I've invested with fidelity and just kind of comparing costs and I also kind of was invested in their ecosystems thirty two percent cash card\nGood for you explain that because a lot of people don't know that fidelity offers one of the two best credit cards in America\nAre they two percent cash back on every every purchase you run through and I think it's underwritten by a separate bank but um you get two percent cash back deposited into any of your fertility account\nSo that he has managed to account or they're going to be an IRA or write or or college savings plans\nExactly yeah so\nSo you want to know why do I always talk vanguard vanguard vanguard when Fidel that he's doing all this good stuff\nExactly on a number of calls it seemed like people were you know asking which way to go and you kind of lean towards telling them vanguard and I was just struck by that\nAnd so uh I should not be offending finality 'cause they do a great job a Schwab does a great job I mean these companies are huge companies and they've\nSwab does a great job I mean these companies are huge companies and they've all become lower costs but vanguard really set the pattern and set the tone and took the market share\nAnd that's why they are the ones that created the pressure in the marketplace for a lower cost and maybe that's a sentimental thing\nBut I ... you're probably right I should be talking about that Fidel what he is well now offers a series of\nUltra cheap choices for investing thanks for bringing it to my attention you're listening to about Clark Howard show\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nVideo

come back to that guy at the movies with Kevin car I'm going to jump into the movie reviews and do the stuff I Love doing at Halloween and that is talking about horror movie [noise]\nI Know if I'm bugging people start talking about horror movies also talking about bad movies in November cars or turkeys I'll start talking about Christmas movies at Christmas Time and then I'll be of course talking about a war movies\nThe beginning of the year so I have different things that happened throughout the year so it's not always going to be horror movies but I Love to just dive in at Halloween time\nAnd some people do I like to watch a horror movie a day around Halloween and a lot of times it's old standbys like I watch the other night I watched the major the body Snatchers from Nineteen Seventy eight with my son who's ten who'd never seen it before and I lost sleep over that movie when I was ten I think he handled it a little differently than I did but he kind of got sucked in it was funny watching them he\nHe was into that movie that is a great movie is one of my favorite of all times and and it's the best version about I think I Love the original with Kevin McCarthy but the one in Nineteen Seventy eight with Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams is so visceral\nAnd pragmatic and realistic and and and the tops the other remake that they did like in Nineteen Ninety three they did one with Gabrielle Anwar and they did a remake\nIn two thousand seven I think with a Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig that one's kind of a mess\nNineteen Seventy eight to really good one but the other thing I Do with my kids every year and this goes back to me when I was in high school there was a theater in town called Drexel north than it was this big eight hundred feet theater that is now a fitness center which is sad and it's All right\nBut it was this big eight hundred and the theater and they do twenty four hour marathons where they'd show\nTwelve or Thirteen horror movies all night long and they'd have trailers and cartoons and a short films and little bits and theater bumpers that that's always made it very special that experience now I was in high school in the eighties so that was your only option to see some of these movies yeah should be a chest but you're also looking at it on a Nineteen inch TV\nIn your parents' basement and you weren't watching them on the big screen so I Would go to these all night movie marathons and I loved it there was a huge deal for me in the late eighties and early nineties now they still do them\nBecause the scheduling and some other things happening my life I'm not able to go to them all the time but it's a little easier to do them at home you know because we have better TV's we have Blu ray and and and what I also do is I I Do a mini marathon now\nEvery year for my family of horror movies they used to be twenty four hours but I just don't have the strength for that anymore I Do like a twelve or Thirteen hour fourteen hour horror movie marathon and you know I had like my dad come over and my kids were there and my wife was doing concussions\nAnd I put together trailer blocks and are we watch cartoons like looney tunes and so it's a lot of fun and I make it as much like a theatrical experiences possible\nThis year to the movies that we watched I wanted to review on this show and I might drop a couple of later on because they're classics and one of the things that I've done as a parent and a movie lover is I have\nMade a point to expose my kids not just to the movies that are out there in the theaters right now those are great you know I Love taking my kids are the marvel movies of the star wars movies and all that good stuff\nBut I also like them to the older films and I'm not just talking about ... stuff that I saw when I was a kid or like I mentioned I watched the Beijing the body Snatchers Nineteen Seventy eight version with my son the other day those are stuff that I saw I was a kid but even older ones I like to during these marathons I pick stuff out of the\nDifferent areas I I like showing them the old monster movies from the forties I think it's it's worth something cinematic linked to expose children to the black and white movies the movies that were made long before digital technologies long before any sort of modern filmmaking techniques stuff that was\nMade long before I was even a line\nLike the wolf man and Frankenstein and Dracula those are worse will show you know not just in the horror genre I mean it's worth showing them stuff like Citizen Kane and classic movies because not everything has happened in your lifetime and you need to have a sense of history not just for history\nOf the history of the world in the country and the people but of cinema\nOne of them that we did this weekend was return of the vampire Bela Lugosi surgeons of empire who writes us from London grave during the bombing of World War two\nThe\n[noise]\nThis is considered sort of an on official sequel to Dracula it was made by Columbia Pictures universal of course the Dracula they held the right so Columbia couldn't do\nAnother Dracula movie ... those the only play Dracula twice in his entire lifetime he played him in Dracula and then he played him in ... Frankenstein he played vampires though like you said it's an unofficial sequel to Dracula course Dracula starter and then some Dracula revoke their and while Bela Lugosi showed up and all these other\nUniverses a horror movies like the man he played Baylor the gypsy and he played ego or the Frankenstein it's a little fan or a ghost Frankenstein he played various characters\nBut this is a fun little it's very much cut from the same cloth of Dracula only you know bother to twelve years later it was when they made it it's classic Lugosi it's got the classic\nElements to graveyards the bats you've got a wearable through there who talks claim English which is kind of silly but they they have all these elements and you have the those are the police detective who who doesn't believe any of it\nThis is a fun movie it's worth tracking down especially if you have shown you know younger generation the original Dracula and taught them to appreciate\nWatching a black and white movie that's not going to spook the special effects in action from an ad and enjoy the atmosphere now this isn't as atmosphere\nAs the Nineteen thirty one version the Nineteen thirty one direction was very atmospheric and the set design as a result do for the academy frame and it's\nVery intricate and intense this one's a little more mainstream for the time this was around the time they were making the man and Frank and find me ... as opposed to just coming out of the silent era Nineteen thirty one when the original draft laws but still this is worth checking out it was sort of a loss favorite would be able to do the return of the vampire\nRocks and\nYou're listening to fact guys at the movies or Kevin car I just have a couple of minutes talk really quickly about the fun house and that's all I really need drenched by Toby Hooper may Nineteen eighty one a group of teenagers go into a carnival and hide overnight and the fun house only to be struck by abusing killer\nSomething like his father\nSomething that has a\nFlesh law\nOn that [noise]\n\n\nThis is very similar to how fast which is out right now and this was just a slasher is not a particularly good slasher it has some great imagery to it and it has a great box covered had always had a great VHS box cover\nBut it's in essence it's it's a bunch of teams going into a bad situation and being stopped by color not much more takes a long time to get to the\nThe the slasher part of the slasher and\nOther than that the characters are terribly memorable they're not terribly well developed this is exactly the kind of movie that came out in the early eighties that was trying to play off of all the success of friday the thirteenth and the Halloween movies so it's sort of one of those things I have never seen I wanted to see\nBut I have to say that it didn't really grabbed me as a horror movie even as a retro horror movie somebody love the eighties I grew up in the eighties this one really is somewhat forget them all so I'm going to have to say the fun house kind of sucks it can affect the\nWay that that and I know like I don't know that that's a segment when it come back we're going to be talking about the new

Kirk he does find in a movie in fact I think he elevates the movie way more than it really should be the story is really I mean\nStory is really uneven\nIt's got the billionaire trying to colonize other planets it's got this weird environmental message but this anti you know billionaire message you know it it's got like thing happening you hear the story construction moments where you're like well I don't even understand\nHow that pragmatically happens you know they're stealing homeless people in running experiments on them and then making them disappear but somehow they're stealing them and having them signed waivers but then they just dump them in a landfill to get rid of it it's the strangest\n... set up of a movie that I've seen that that takes so much time to explain\nThe nuance of what they're doing with it and making those that's also the acting ... good everyone else was terrible Michelle Williams is in the movie she plays his girlfriend or his ex girlfriend and\nShe's awful in this movie and and I'm not a huge fan of Michelle Williams but I've seen her movies and I there are times when I think she's done quite well I thought she was actually she was one of the best things Brokeback Mountain I thought she was the best performance and that one I thought she was a fantastic performance of Manchester by the seat\nOf the ones that she gets a lot of accolades for stuff like my week with marijuana might that one was dumb I didn't like her and that so she kind of blows hot and cold boy she was really cold on this one she is terrible in this movie the other thing with the movie it's it's it's very an even if it feels like it was shot to be are rated\nAnd I think they were going for that they're going for violent gritty you do something that could stand up with Logan or that point\nBut then they decided to make a PG Thirteen and so it seems very cobble the editing is really clunky especially in the action sequences like a point where venom like kill somebody and then they leave and then you don't see any remains you don't see them via splatter and you're like well that doesn't even make any sense\nSo feels like they really sanitized and a lot of ways\nAnd

continue on with the reviews I Want to do another retro review literally a retro\nBecause the movie's called retro puppet master\nIt is not based on Robert Hi lines of puppet master master it's nothing to do that the reason I'm Talking about this one it's a bizarre\nRandom moving but like I said I like to watch a horror movie a day and this week I watched retro puppet master part of the reason I watch the news because it was on Amazon Prime and it was done by ... now if you don't know what ... they're the guys from mystery science the earth three thousand the second generation you've got Michael J. Nelson you've got bill Corbett who played\nBrain guy in crowds and then of course Kevin Murphy has been with us forever playing Tom serve up\nAnd they risk the movie they do a commentary tracking it and it can make terrible movies kind of funny the other reason I picked this is because of the stars somebody from one of the worst movies ever made grace the stereotype who's known for being in the room\nAnd he of course wrote the book the disaster artist which which was made into a movie last year with James Franco which was one of my favorite movies here so I thought it was interesting to to sort of see this this bizarre piece of cinema history\nFrom the direct video shops and retro puppet master the rooms grace the sterile stars as a young Andre tool on a French puppets\nMaster of the rooms grace the sterile stars as a young Andre to on a French puppeteer who creates a group of disturbing pop ups that are brought to light\n\nI'll be honest when I first picked up I thought it was just a renamed a version of the original puppet master\nIt was the the puppet master series is from full moon and I have always had a lot of respect for full moon they were a direct a video series\nCharles Band had been making movies in the eighties either he was actually involved and stuff like a re animator which is a fantastic film and dogs and troll\nThen eventually he developed a full moon brand which was too big in the late eighties and through the nineties which was a direct a video\nGame company they just released everything on VHS nothing ever got a theatrical release I mean like dolls originally did like his first earlier films but when he was doing the full moon stop there was stuff that he just crank out and there was a certain amount of kids to him he did these things called subspecies which had\nA ... these ... empires from Romania and that he did the puppet master which were these dolls that came to life and of course you to do man which that start Tim ... as a cop who who would gotten from getting down inside\nThe they did a lot of these movies and they were only shot and Romania and there are super on the cheap\nBut there were actually kinda fun when they got to about the fifth or sixth and stamina franchise they're really gonna circling the drain\nSo anyway this one is it's a terrible movie stars breaks the sterile of course it's going to be a terrible movie it's actually kind of hard to follow at times it still feels like a full moon movie but it feels like one of those ... movies that has been made after the full moon heyday and full moon like I said I ...

and\nUm it introduces herself is Marvin his wife and then you go through that whole thing and take people on that a journey and then you wrap up\nLike I was saying that the endings important to wrap up the novel ... because they are going to start to have a routine if he does he ever routine is there like a celebration dance you do you know Ernest Hemingway used to take every one of his brother out and and then there's other James Patterson\nHe would just start working on the next one immediately I mean it's really interesting how people\nKind of celebrate because some people say sort of
