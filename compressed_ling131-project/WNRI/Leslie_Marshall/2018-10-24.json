minus for most of us\nCongressmen what about this migrant caravan how big a factor is that\nWell I think that that ties right into what we're talking about was Trump\nWhen people begin to understand that we have a guy a tough guy like Trump\nAs our president it gives us some kind of confidence that we're not going to our people our country will not be invaded and are Democrats who are earning or
