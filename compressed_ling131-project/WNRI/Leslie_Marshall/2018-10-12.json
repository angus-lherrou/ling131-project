a connection between the welfare state independently\nWhat he said about Ninety percent of the media being liberal liberal oh my goodness and for embracing Donald Trump what a racist what a sell out we talking about that in just a few minutes\nNow I just received our latest alliance defending freedom total and I'm grateful to men and women just like you were helping us reach our goal but we are

five to eight six six four three five twenty to fifty two\nKanye West made an appearance today at the oval office along with Jim Brown and the reporters were all there because Kanye West is a star and chip brown star the why is that when they're given a rip\nAnd Kanye West ended up speaking almost ten minutes kind of a stream of consciousness some type of it'd make a whole lot of sense but most of it had to do with his belief that black people needs to rethink their assumptions\nAnd that the police have a job to do a and she did not like the idea of this knee jerk pulling out the race card and he's being hammered been called a sellout being caught an Uncle Tom\nSo real meat is\nPresident Trump is a bigger piece of racist because that's my white people uh he advised Jim Brown and Kanye West into the White House he's ... he's ... he's a bigot doesn't like black people so it doesn't matter\n[noise]\nI look at this a reaction to what kind of you with that and I'm going to talk to you about what they said on CNN about him with Don limits that calling him a token negro\nOne of the commentators calling him a token negro another one said this is what happens when negroes don't read\nNow calling a black person and they grow in the year twenty Eighteen as a slur and I guess he's black commentators believe they can get away with it because a lot of white people don't realize calling a black person than they grow and twenty Eighteen is a it's a it's offensive\nIt's something that you say when you want to put somebody down 'cause that's what they're doing the getting away with this victory left wing bigotry\n\nAnd Kanye West says he grow up without a father\nPresident Trump today in the oval office how much that bothered him and it is far and away the number one problem in this country the number one problem in the black community the large number of kids growing up without fathers far and away\nNothing else that even close all the other stuff people talk about all this other nonsense\nAnd you have somebody calling us you can call them uneducated you can call him a not terribly literate calling what you want at least he gets the big picture he also understands\nThat there's a connection between the welfare state and the demise of the family\nMy friend Walter Williams and Thomas all have written about the black family after slavery a black kid was more likely during slavery to be raised under a roof over their biological mother and biological father than today and after slavery because\nFor years it was illegal for slaves to marry it\nWas a huge uptick in Mary and if you look at census reports Eighteen Ninety Nineteen hundred Nineteen ten a black child was slightly more likely to be brought into the world with their biological mother and a biological dad on at the same roof than a white kid\nAnd then along comes the welfare state and dependency and the LA Times\n... for people to non poor people questions about welfare and about dependency they ask the question to Nineteen eighty five they asked him again\nOr in twenty six team do you believe welfare creates dependency or do you believe it is a stepping stone to get you on your own two feet\nAnd they asked poor people in non poor people those questions forty one percent of people living below the level of poverty responded welfare creates dependency and forty one percent felt that he gave us stepping stone or to get on your own two feet so as many poor people felt that welfare I was harmful\nAs felt that it was helpful\nSo don't you think maybe just maybe that's worth looking at\nThat topic worthy of discussion as many poor people think that welfare is bad or ethnic it's good\nIn about eight percent or so have no idea I don't have an opinion one way or the other\nThat is a boatload of people on welfare who believe that it's created dependency and that's what Kanye West was talking about you don't think it's worth having the conversation of course you don't know if you're on the left because you look into the mirror and say oh my goodness what have I done to be stabilized families to change values change incentives\nMy dad used to many people are motivated by two things promised again in fear of loss you monkey around with that with welfare you've destroyed human incentives AAA nine seven one F.

Greenhouse [noise] even longtime no here from\nYeah it's good to hear from your thanks for having\nMe you're still staring them up icy or talk to us about I talked to us about what's going on with the California DMV as a result of this motor voter law\nWell you know the DMV it's it's kind of picking on a DMV is kind of like shooting fish in a barrel I mean DMV\nAre are just I compare to tour across you know going through the DMV it's like a cross between a bus station and the Soviet red line you know the five six hour wait we have now so what I thought was if we're doing a motor voter what worse agency could you can you have to ah to\nDeal with this stopped in the department of motor vehicles and no no\nNo government agency or that does a pretty good job with databases and the DMV is notoriously awful it basically everything it it it does so now we're going to allow the DMV to\nRegister voters and this was in a state where and I'm not against having driver's licenses for for non citizens just for practical reasons but if you could just see the problem coming right and I wrote a column for the union Tribune\nA back in two thousand and Fifteen when this was proposed and was of course accused of of being a racist\nOr by now we see all these sorts of problems so\nWe've got a thousands of a a voter registration ... you know the the the envy reported last month at a big twenty three thousand voter registration errors resulting from\nWhatever they they blame it on other Fifteen hundred ballots are potentially a you know mistakenly registered by the DMV uh the DMV insist that no illegal or legal immigrants have as a gotten them but it looks like some\nPotentially some non citizen trash that has gotten these these ballots and then that the LA Times look at a software that there may have been Seventy seven thousand voter records that were misreported\nThat lets you always use me Seventy seven thousand\nSeventy seven thousand that were misreported to the DMV and some cases allowing duplicate valid in other cases um the DMV seems to inexplicably have changed the party registration of some voters\nSo we've just we've just got a total mess and uh you know it's become it's a big scandal that even the Democratic controlled California somewhat of a scandal or\nA you know again the DMV insist that are no illegal\nResidents have voted or whatever but you know it's really hard to uh it's really hard to trust trust what they're doing and this comes against the backdrop of you know with the ... id law\nWhich is the federal law mandating you know new driver's licenses to where people provide a you know a information so that the security go on airplanes\nWe've got these enormous backlogs\nAnd the DMV he's had these huge commercial license backlogs of the drivers would go through school they get they get a job and then it would take months for them to get a commercial license just because the DMV process so how do you allow these folks\nTo be in control of a voter records\nAnd then the law when it was passed in two thousand and Fifteen one of the big problems with um you know it had some amendments to it um where you're not a lot where really limited the ability of the secretary of state to check out the immigration status of the of the person\nUh you know who who is being register and in that law said if a person as as quote if a person who is eligible to vote becomes registered to vote by operation of the California New voter motor voter program\nThat person's registration shall be presumed to have been affected with official authorization and not the fault of that person so if you accidentally get registered and you're not eligible to be registered to vote it's presumed that it's not your fault so it's just we're just looking for trouble right\nSteven Greenhouse gases article surprise DMV may have registered non citizen voters a Steven I was not in favor of illegal aliens getting driver's licenses and I was called a racist you are in favor of illegal aliens getting driver's licenses and you're called a racist so I'm not quite sure\nWhat the right on yeah exactly I mean of libertarian ... and I'm not you know my views on on immigration are really quite you know quite ... cords I lean towards bloody as many people and that's\nAs possible uh provided they follow some rules so I'm not exactly you know some kind of immigration restriction ask them yeah I I you know I get it to we all get it right\nNow uh again if somebody who's an illegal alien inadvertently gets registered to vote and he or she votes what happens to that person\nWell according to the law nothing nothing zoom that a ... and less and less I guess you'd have to prove that they can show will fully\nUh but you know they basically when I pass the motor voter laws and I am against those in general\nBecause a lot because you can't go through the trouble of of the minor process of registering that maybe you're not uninformed voter and
