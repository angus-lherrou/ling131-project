Carla this was like a pivotal moment where you realized you know that you were a strong in different was good tell us more about that how young were you what what influence you that\nThere are a lot of different incidents at the one that I only think about is when I was in school and decided to take French and the language and all the other African American students were taking Spanish and they would ask me why and he said I I Love the language I think it's beautiful and I and that's what I wanted to do ...\nAnd you had a teacher you said that didn't influence you positively but that was okay tell us about that\nAnd you get to a point in life where you can't look for outside influences to encourage you and maybe along um I had other influences outside of school but I learned to encourage myself\nBut one of those other influences outside of school ... what else ... did influence you\nAnd I was in a youth ... pi group and I had a great church family and community and um I was in other organizations where I saw an\nAfrican American youth that we're having the same issues that I was having and that helped me grow through my issue that I was having with myself\nTo you fellows other kids were having the same kind of issues by getting involved in these organizations outside your immediate community\nYes it started that way but it wasn't until I had gone to college and I joined a sorority alpha cap alpha story is the first black sorority where I found my community of intelligent black women who were very confident\nHow do you know how to you know the guy was your community what are you talking about there\nYou know how to you know the guy was your community what are you talking about there\n[noise] um I went as I said to Penn State predominantly white institution as opposed to going to a historically black college and um I'd known about the organizations that I just all these um beautifully intelligent articulate women who are just like a sisterhood\nUm that we could relate to one another and I really felt that I was home with them for computer\nCarlos ... funny that\nInner strength as a teachable and how do you teach it\nI think at some time at some point you have to be honest with yourself and and you can't do that on your own I'm\nJust individually it comes with time um and it comes at the white influence and I think being in the right environment and around the right people helped me get to that point\nWas go next to spend some of your early career is working with your dad and then you broke up went into the corporate world and came back to the company how did you impact the company after after learning what you do outside of the family business\nA while I was outside of the business in corporate America I ought to start in an online business and I learned a search engine optimization a lot of online marketing\nI took that information back to the company I'm what my father would say we were posting along I Would say we were flat lining from a business background as opposed to engineering background his off that he has a computer science background\nSo I took that information that I had and we put it into the company and they just turned it upside down and even as of last year we had a twenty percent growth spurt which was unheard of after being so flat for a couple of years Carl if we did your dad sitting here with you what what do you say about you how would he described you [noise]\nUm I think my father has we've learned to I'm really rely upon one another I'm I'm a trusted advisor of his at this point I think I've grown I'll always be a daughter but I've grown out of just being the daughter\nA as the executive vice president I Do the strategic planning for the company I create the opportunities that we have them out looking for those opportunities though I'm at this point he would say Carl is in charge for me ...\nHow how's your mom supported to entrepreneurs and the forever to

calling people earn man and and just the overall respectful tone for individuals\nAre not costs a little bit more about what what what's the ... thing about\nUm it's it just brings a level of kindness and to the environment when you treat everyone with respect um we live in such a fast a tidy and everyone doesn't do it\nWould you make sure that you do yeah I'll go to first how's that for the uh your organization\nAnd I like everyone to know that you know we are even though we're a family company I liked to treat the entire organization other family a lot of them I've worked with us for over

afraid to break a few eggs to make an omelet what would you share with her young audience of entrepreneurs black white anything what would you share with them about going forward\nI think you have to find your voice and no one can coach you through it and then one can teach you how to do it um it's your own emotional journey and when you get comfortable with yourself you're able to find that voice

what they think that they owe it however there is a statute of limitations and the question is which um is this thing is to New York times outlined about Donald Trump are within the statute of limitations on what you're not\nA crazy um and then back to the cabinet I think NBC reporting to the FBI hasn't contacted people with information cabinet that\nThis is what's happened to many people and we have said that they have information I'm cabinet that they can either back up something or not back up something there's something like forty people have said that the FBI has not even gotten back to them even after they've offered to speak to the FBI\nWhich we kept in a secure facility behind closed doors it is a single copy and one by one but senators walked in and signed in like it's a library\nAnd read what they read at the FBI report seems kind of crazy ... because I think they're afraid of the whole week thing I guess especially and none of this coming out\nA senator Amy clover char the Democrat from Minnesota as a member of the Judiciary Committee who opposes Kavanaugh said McConnell filed closure even senators haven't seen the FBI report hadn't seen that that it was why\nI'm a you know and then you had a lot of reaction to wow can we do this without seeing this so maybe you know it's kind of in that phase of like I said my mind goes to a seesaw one minute it looks like OK boom and this is going to go\nAnd then the next minute it swings back into you know the other direction and this is nothing new with what we see here in the United states because it's teams then so\nWith the very polarized and of course politically speaking and then with midterms coming up and and here's the thing to me look get the best person on the bench period whoever the best person is\nLet's get that this person on the bench because that's a lifetime appointment and it is an incredible honor to be tapped the egg to be picked for that if something on ever getting paid for something that nobody listening to this show because I guarantee none of the Supreme they're listening to America denied I doubt it [laughter] so\nUm you know what would that be like to be\nOn the bench in the highest court in the land I mean that is an incredible honor to to to do that to be pegged as somebody who gets confirmed goes through and then\nHas the ultimate say it's part of that process uh to me that's something really sacred and I hope it won't trample on all of that\nReally honestly I Hope not so the Republican to save the Republicans are of safeguarding the FBI report on one by one I guess people are filing in and they're gonna read it and then however long that takes\nA while to actually if you think about it\nWhat is really wild ... really sad and more than wild very very sickening I think is what happened with these officers six officers were her wind killed\nIn the south Carolina shooting and you know I've heard this before because I have family members who are police officers that domestic violence that's where you can add a debt when you're a cop so what happened was that was a two hour standoff\nYou're a cop so what happened was that was a two hour standoff in a nice residential neighborhood in Florence County South Carolina\nWas the man who had children hostage he fired on the cops from multiple agencies because they were from a couple of different ones the kids were unharmed that's the good thing it started about four o'clock eastern\nWhat happened was the shares the Orange County sheriff's office tried to serve a search warrant at home I'm In a subdivision not far from where the flooding from Hurricane Florence\nHad really the ripped up places and then the suspect started shooting they said all you can hear you know shops all over the place\nAnd the where he was positioned his view of fire was several hundred yards and he had an advantage they say and imagined again trying to serve this\nSo I'm the wounded officers were evacuated they were transported to a hospital and the the one that was killed\nWas a a thirty year veteran of the police department I mean really John Will Keller um you know talked about it um it's the talk about it was a parent's Caraway they say and I just gosh\nIt just breaks your heart when you hear these stories I mean how difficult it an awful as this and a lot of people were tweeting out about a senator I'm Lindsey Graham said heartbroken God Bless the people who choose to protect us and their families\nA president tweeted out thoughts and prayers with the Orange County sheriff's office and uh Florence police department tonight I in South Carolina were grateful for law enforcement\nOfficers and then here's\nThe reaction and just a little more detail about the officers being shot\n\n[noise] um and the more that reaction is the um governor from South Carolina said this is simply devastating news from Florence to selfless acts of bravery for men and women and law enforcement is real and it's um\nYou know I was looking at a map and and it really was in the middle of all the devastation that happened with the heavy flooding because of the hurricane and it's a it's a city that's like kind of in the northeast because I've spent some time now as you well know in South Carolina it's like in the northeast corner of\nThe ... of South Carolina and it's right where two majors thoroughfares or interstates you intercept Ninety five and twenty it's a pretty decent size city and I'm here is that reaction more reaction\nThese officers were there and\nTo do random\n[noise] yeah so random search warrant ear not looking for that to happen and this is in in domestic violence cases as I've heard from family members this is where is the scariest when they walk into the situation that they don't\nEven know what they're walking into they have absolutely no idea ... while\nIn the meantime with a little bit of this and that meaning things that we might miss on the map\nOf quickly or go to a couple of stories that I was looking at earlier in the um earlier in the day and one of them was a this one and it it has to do with the fact\nThat you've got 'em why I like I have no idea what's going on with the\nUh airlines because we keep seeing that none of these things are happening and they're having to to land planes and when I say that there was kind of a may there was a mayday call with this Australian flight and it you know the horror was\n... I mean what's going on because they just hear this mayday mayday just really creepy but they United a flight ended up landing thank goodness and\nIt's a it landed safely in in Sydney after the hysteria over that it was seven eighty seven\nDreamliner from Los Angeles and they have low fuel low fuel oh my gosh really oh that's awful so what do you do when you have low fuel while you do a mayday because what's gonna happen if you can't get there\nIt's gonna it's going to trigger responses to All right if you've got low fuel where can we possibly get you down and it was looking like\nThat's what was going to have to happen they were going to have to figure out a place where they could dump their flight and um it did it did land and then there was some kind of weird mechanical issue but they got to the gate the customers got off\nAnd uh you got a hundred and eighty passengers fourteen crew and it was a a fuel saying that there's an international standard that requires when you get down to your fuel reserve\nYou have to declare a fuel May Day you have to do that\nIn case you can't make down my God even closer roads around the airport [noise] my on my\nWay to do it for granted a mailbag neck money [noise] [noise]\n[noise] hello I'm Mike ... will be a bedroom my jaw and like all year olds are problems would be almost original wild I Would flip up all night long I Would wake up with a stronger now and maybe or George I needed to now even though I loved it or is when I say my Joel I wanted it to where you can\nYou need some individuals regardless of sleeping in my\nJob will give you into the deep REM sleep browser and you will stay there longer was not about how much time we spend about it's about how much ...

training Miller and it's time for another Morgan Stanley money brief and today we're Britain crouch back with us financial advisor for Morgan Stanley here to speak [noise] hey thanks for joining us Brett\nThanks for having me on pleasure to be here\nUsed to one thing that we've heard too many of these segments of the importance of having a trusted financial professional and many of our listeners out there may already be working with someone but what if you don't have\nAnd many of our listeners out there may already be working with someone but what if you don't have a financial professional or work with how do you find somebody you can trust\nOr history any I'd say I think about a financial professional and what do you think about other professionals you may be used to working with for example most of us have a doctor we go to for a checkup periodically\nThat Dr Mason get other specialists or you may seek them out on your own foot doctor Dr similar to the professional field there are a lot of different types of financial professionals out there\nYeah sure they can have different specialties and with so many choices it can be really difficult to find somebody to work with\nA right but it doesn't have to be and that's what I'd like to appeal it as like today it doesn't require a little bit of planning and knowing the right questions to ask but if you're hoping to find someone you can trust it's worth the initial effort\nOh of course was a ... brain going back to your earlier point most people do a little research to find a doctor they feel comfortable seeing okay so how do you get started [noise]\nI'd say first let's focus on the questions you need to narrow focus in on and on what's important to you\nSo what's the question should we be asking\n... well what exactly are you looking for a need someone that can help you plan for your children's education save for retirement or buy insurance how 'bout helping you consolidate pay down debt\nOr maybe you're looking for someone who can look at your whole financial picture compare that to your goals in life and assess whether they are on track\nRight like how soon can I retire now that makes sense that will help you figure out if you knew specialist or someone to help with everything\nGoing for some people a one stop shop that provides an array of services it's preferable than finding multiple specialist separately asking friends family some colleagues if they're working with someone and if so did they recommend that person\nHas put a lot of referrals and do some research on line you can even ask for references and those professionals they can get a better idea of what types of people they work with and the quality of the relationships\nI never thought about asking someone for represents but that makes total sense kind of like a job interview\nActually after all you are looking for someone to work for you in a way to meet with several people and get a sense of how well you cannot during an introduction meeting your instincts\nBrent this has really been helpful and I know you have more to help our listeners spine of financial professionals so let's continue this discussion next week thanks for being here today\nThis radio program does not provide individually tell her advice is unprepared without regard to the individual financial circumstances risk tolerance
