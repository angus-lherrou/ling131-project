Nineteen years old and I'm ...\nSo uh I that yet\nHave you ever seen is there\nA spirit guy okay\nYou haven't actually seen a guard\nI okay what ... what one time I had seen a ... usually come tends to be stopped for\nOkay or no right\nTo a ... and out here the thought or or else he's a vision okay in my life I Would like if I was dreaming or something like that uh-huh\nIt up close by I that that that's how I see your grandma games are on the senior grandma ... it's not that not that she would come and talk to you but you can't even talk to my mind\nYes a shirt retiring from large retailer and uh she found the option of taking a lump sum or monthly distribution for her pension\nMy goodness she's retiring from a retailer and she has a pension\nYeah believe it or not last ones left wow\nYou know there's almost no such thing as a as a retailer with a penchant for their workers\nAnd she'd been there for a thirty four years now wow\nHow can I be of service 'cause that's a shocking thing\nWe were just wondering what looks murder taking a lump sum or taking a a month and distribution [laughter]\nSo if we just look at the dollars and cents or without looking at her individual plan almost always and it's not a hundred percent of time but it's close\nIt's better to take the monthly payment from them than it is to take the lump sum\nBut you since you told me it's a retailer you kinda knocked me back on my feet because\nThat creates a different concern\nHow solid financially as this retail\nThat we don't we don't know if\nYou have real ends to doubt how viable they\nMight be oh yeah if you do\nThat would mean that even though the odds are overwhelming there would be better for your wife to take a monthly check\nIn this case she probably be better served taking the lump sum\nWhat about taxes other lumps from was that the fact that our current rate or whatever they are starting to the lump sum be\nYes so with when you get a lump sum distribution you get clobbered on tax in the year you receive it\nYeah that's the only reason I Do want to take us 'cause that would actually very tough tax bracket\nSo here's the thing if you take the monthly check and she was there a long long time there is a cause I federal agency called the pension benefit guarantee corporation so if at some point the company she works for fails to ceases to excess fails and they're done\nThe pension liability is turned over to this agency the pension benefit guarantee corporation and they have a formula based on how large your pension your wife would be receiving what\nKind of haircut she'd get how much of her pension she would actually have reduced that she would receive from then forward from this ... federal agency\nSo resonance Larry writes the risk to her is this is you know if this was a company that was doing great and reporting huge profits and their future looked great far out into the future then you take a monthly check\nIt was almost always the monthly check him periods higher return and then you're going to be able to generate on your own on this pension distribution but the lump sum you know she gets the money\nSo I always tell people take the monthly check unless you're worried about the company's finances\nOh I don't know which way to go\nI think it's a matter of let's look at it this way if she takes the monthly check and let's say three four or five years from now they fail\nWithin gray with it just demolish your quality of life and your ability to afford things or would it be more like a well we're not going to have that money every month but will still be okay\nHarold ... well\nIf it's an old well and you're going to be fine either way take the monthly check if it's money that's do or die for you as a couple I Would take the levels I'm\nOkay well that's good to know\nSo and I would I Would say with her as well because she worked there for so long psychologically it may bother her a lot of you know the pension stops or has a new wouldn't be stopped but it'd be greatly reduced and the event of a failure\nOr does that help okay here's a here's with a\nK 'cause I'm fortunate enough to have a pension benefit that I have to choose at some point lump sum or receive as a lifetime benefit and these are tough decisions how to choose Sheryl is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Cheryl\nHi how are you great thank you\nYeah like I said as I heard an advertisement I'm On the radio about real estate company that makes the opposite if they're willing to give me a fair market I find your home without each fixing enough or getting any repairs either will tell your house in like six or less guaranteed are now by it\nOr that market price that they offer to [noise]\nI think to get to the trains hot I checked with you\nSo this is happening around the country residential real estate it's a very high interest item right now so there are local\nIt's a very high interest item right now so there are local real estate offices\nLocal individual but high volume sellers and national offers where they say we not only will market your house but if it does not sell we guarantee that will be the purchaser\nMhm and as for what the purchase period is most often what I've seen is you said six weeks for the one you saw I think for\nMost of them I've seen are twelve weeks\n'cause normally for someone to effectively market your home they need typically a three month window\nBut anyway if you found somebody who says six weeks fine so these come in two types one is selling distressed real estate let's say you're having to sell the house of a loved one who died and you're the administrator executor exact a trip that's one guy\nThe other is where you're selling your own home you know you're having to relocate ... somewhere else so you've already done if I had the home you want to move to you need certainty getting your house so so in that environment is not a distress sale it's not a house is falling apart or anything like that\nAnd you're just looking for certainty that the sale will go through and you're not going to get stuck with two house payments\nSo with these things but a key test is they offer they make as to what their fallback price would be ... is it one you can live with\nYeah actually the price that they offered to her and we got to pray and sent and it creates I'd on I was actually surprised I thought it would be way under\nThere and I think that's fine if it gets you the peace of mind that you're working for them and they're you know that six weeks out if it's not so old and the open market you're out of that house why not\nThey are saying that they charge you X percent there that have been like a fair price\nSo they would do you pay six percent commission if they find a buyer you discount the price six percent if they're the buyer okay is that right\nThat you had six percent met that included the buyer and seller if they buy it outright I don't know if they just kept that are not\nWell normally they would they would have some discount that would be the equivalent of a commission from the price they are offering you and I have no problem with that\nOkay okay so you got to be the right person do you got to be the person you need to be done with it and you know that you'll be out of the house at that point if they price they offer use reasonable\nWhy not have that certainty okay\nSounds good and I don't I don't I don't hear back from you at some point hey six weeks comedy drawn and made it in the honor the deal I Hope he does not fell I Will tell you that that's never happened before\nOh okay well again no one's ever called me and said that I'm not going to say that they have it every time that somebody with one of these all can I get from one of these companies but nobody's ever given me that feedback the thing that's unusual what you said Sheryl is it the purchase price they're offering you\nIs there a fallback price is in your word spot on and that's not what I usually heard from people usually I've heard that the backstop price that they offer\nIs a price that the person calling me feels is below market but in your case you've got nothing to lose if the price they're offering is at market\nJoel you and I should test this ourselves yeah we sell our houses I don't want to do that you you're listening to the Clark Howard show

help a public service announcement brought to you by a A R P and the council\nUm\nAre not how're you\nDoing just fine thanks so what is it fits frustrating\nWell I'd I'd like to be able to travel from one major metropolitan area to an adjoining say their visit my dad who's in a in the living facility\nAnd flexible on day I could pick up and go tomorrow if there was a good deal on airfare I could go next Tuesday or\nA week from now or whatever I mean I I have worked to build it allowed me to go to miss a day on on short notice when that might be able to do is track the effort and get the lowest possible deal but I can afford to travel\nGo down and see my dad and then why back home and the same day that\nThat or the thing but most travels by they want you to\nPoint out a particular day and so you're you're looking for that day by day and it it's hard to find the best deal\nRight so the three deep discounters are doing what you want\nMe now at spirit air allegiance air and frontier which are the three hard discounters are deep discounters that uh you earn your savings because it's a different way of flying\nWith all of them when you go to search if any of the three serve the area you want to fly they put up a calendar for you and they show you the fare each direction day by day for a two month period\nOkay so you can actually see well gosh there's a forty two dollar fare on a Wednesday two weeks from now I like that what's the return and you see if they have a deal coming back as well\nRight there is no we're quibbling on the threefold for Latin American United and delta repairs are um they're not into discounting at all really right now\nIt looks like some states must go unsold\nNo the the um load factor is the percent of the spill is at all time record highs the airlines have become so sophisticated and figuring out what the ... seat can sell for and so they're fine flight after white\nCompletely full or just about and so the the desire to discount isn't there anymore because white American United and delta did was they parked huge numbers of planes in the desert and said Bye bye to them\nIn reduced the number of planes that they have in the air and so they manage this supply so they could control what they could demand unfair is from people who wanted to go\nWe are creating basically a three speed air travel market\nThe three deep discounters I mentioned the leisure frontier and spirit\nOr offering one kind of product when the MIT prices like southwest Jet Blue Virgin America Alaska they're offering a different kind of product more a blend between those two extremes\nBut if you're trying to get down to see her dad\nHad the cheapest fare with the greatest flexibility when you go in return [noise] absolutely [noise] a frontier a legion and spirit or where you're going to want to get your deal [noise] you're listening to the Clark Howard show\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] an official message from Medicare open enrollment than so now it's time to be open mind smoking everything like prescription drug crimes and Medicare Advantage plans insurers wine goes climb straight so can you help me I'm going to lower costs arm extra benefits aren't saved money open the door open Greta\n... got a call one eight hundred Medicare today\nPaid for by the U.S department of health and Human Services\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your rate stays locked buddy of rates go down\nStates now Alaska coming in with one of these junk fares these basic economy things where they can show up better in the air fare searches but knowing that people overwhelmingly aren't going to buy that fair\nAnd it's just a bait and switch so no that that ... the Internet\nAnd our ability to shop around and the whole comparison shopping thing that we now into everybody's trying to manipulate us and so it's up to you and me to know that you know you got burned one shame on them you get burned the second time shame on you\nDo the work where you look not just that that initial click but what really is the total price one and actually I wanted to mention to you with American Airlines with its basic economy fares different than delta United and Alaska\nWhere with delta United in Alaska often you have just a little tick up in price to go from basic economy to regular economy American on the other hand looks at basic economy one of its strategies is specifically targeted at spirit legion frontier\nAnd the basic economy that they sell in markets competitive with them maybe half the cost or less with their regular economy is and then you've got quite a choice to make\nChristopher is with us on the Clark Howard show Christopher you want to worship the sun is that right\nThere and why is the son so great other than it makes me at a much better mood\nAs they are so so our free power yeah you know I'm I Am I'm the wrong person to ask about solar cars I Love it\nIf you talk about it so much you you're not allowed to\nSo do you have it are you thinking of getting it or where where are you in your head on\nTheir um I'm thinking about getting solar power and I'm just wondering at what point it would make sense for me to do it as far as you know how much ice than likely on my electric bill is fairly low anywhere from\n... to one twenty month is not typical electric bill\nAnd so just looking at whether it makes sense or not is\nFull of a trigger and how long it'll take me to ... the money and stuff like that\nYou know if your average power bill let's just say is twelve hundred dollars a year it would take a long time for solar to pay off for you how many square feet so you're home\nAround that Seventeen hundred square feet\nOkay so that's kind of a typical size home so you may be looking at somewhere around ten thousand dollars to put in so we're at your home and have you gotten any price quotes is that about what you've heard\nYeah I just recently got close and ah it was for ten thousand four hundred dollars but that also included\nIncreasing the value of my place in an addict talked about the rating barrier a solid addict fan and a new talks about putting in a new um water hybrid eight ball\nOkay so that's a lot for ten for now you know on the solar portion you're eligible for thirty percent tax credit\nYes sir and he was saying he did it all together that everything is all under that Thirteen percent tax credit\nSo you'd end up you know you'd end up at a net of Seventy two hundred dollars let's say for your net costs that writer was attend for after the tax credit\nI Believe that and for was after\nOkay ten thousand dollars you know it would it would take you a substantial number of years to make that back maybe more than would make sense from strictly dollars and cents\nYes because er which are fighting against as you already have a very reasonable power bill so as much as I Love getting free power from the sun you have to weigh that money out out front that ten grand up front\nAnd I don't know that you're gonna make it back in a reasonable number of years because your power bill is not going to go to zero it's going to go lower but you might be talking about somewhere twelve to Fifteen Years to get paid back that's a long time\nOkay what's your thoughts on the a hybrid of water heater as it looks like and just look at the energy guy sticker on my life at it's around five hundred and forty one dollars annually and then the one that they're they're selling is around a hundred and eighty two dollars annually\nYeah and those attackers are generally a very accurate so if you were to say three hundred and something dollars per year how much is that portion of the home improvement or was it under\nSo that would be that would make a lot of sense and want to work for a payback period on any energy related improvement you do have eight years or west okay so that would easily get done and less time than that\nAnd would make perfect sense to do that the one thing with the sole where that is the unknown and it depends on how people would value at the time you go to sell your home\nSomebody very well might pay you more for your home because it has the software on it because they would pay much lower power bills but if you look at it strictly from the numbers you present it\nAnd the pay back years it would take installing solar I don't think you were there at your house because you have been so lucky you with how low your power bills are I don't think you'd get the real pay back from it\nMichael's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Michael\nClarke or the show\nClark Howard show hello Michael\nClarke they'll show\nIt's great to have you here I'm very interested in your question about DNA testing\nYou know my family were wanting to do a Christmas present star daughter and she would wipe the heritage profile one of the things that you know there are multiple ones out there\nAnd I'm concerned about you know water her wrist as far as getting the information shared out into the world and uh you know one of the positives for that and are there any product that you're able to recommend it\nWell I have never heard about a risk of buying one of these services that you can buy on the Internet where you buy the cat\nAnd that you take a swab and then they're able to do the the DNA on you as far as the that information being used in a way to hurt you bad has never been on my radar\nBut you know the number one thing people want from these tests is the ancestry\nOr they want to know background you know a lot of us have questions like\nWhat what are we all mixed with that I mean I'm a I'm I don't know if you know this old old expression I'm a Heinz fifty seven mutt or I Am so many things that make me up who knows what all my parts are so now you've got me in tree because\nOne of those services ancestry dot com has a DNA test that you see directly below ancestry dot com slash DNA is this one you've looked at by the way as ancestry\nYes we've looked at by one particularly for us as my my wife's side of the family or grandmother a reservation ... photographs of their family at all and then on my side we have someone else and so we want him to you know I don't see how much of that she cared\nWow so with these tests I think you don't know what you're looking for and you know they do a pretty deep dive now they have the competitor that I think is older for this which is twenty three and me they offer\nA health test which is one that was very controversial but government gotten their business about it that gives you a full genetic break down\nAnd it gives you a fair amount of information about your health that would set you back two hundred dollars\nRight and I noticed that that some of them they're doing or doing research like in a market for early riser is\nAn implication of that and you know people who are like at night and those kinds of things and that's a concern is you know how they might use that information that they would\nFall into the wrong hands at some point or at\nYou know I I don't know you know if employers do the stuff that freaks me out\nWhen I was when them any information if you get your health coverage from an employer and they say hey would you have go have this test the employer has access to all that information there's no protection for you as an employee and so ah agreeing to any of those\nTesting programs the employers have comes with a level of risk but if you use one of these commercials services I guess you could fall one of the wrong hands and cause you a problem but I wouldn't worry a lot about that Michael I think that would be pretty far out there as a problem\nBut if I take because I don't want any ... show on my competition I Know your voices so don't ah anyway I'm just\nKidding uh I like what Jeff says you know choose life a God Bless America vote read see you next week\nRighty owning the\nFBI and local
