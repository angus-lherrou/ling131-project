a situation where we are looking into some hearing aid and then they seems like they're so expensive several thousands of dollars even at my favorite warehouse club or I Know it's leased to reputable Christ\nOr when you are you when you have favorite warehouse club are you talking about Sam's or Costco\nUh it'd be Costco\nCosco has some very basic hearing aids that you may be able to buy it like five hundred dollars a year okay but you can do a lot cheaper than that and get a true real hearing aid and that's what you'd like you'd like a better deal right\nWhen I'm starting to see is neither newspapers or magazines some other cheering a type of companies and I'm looking to find out if they're reputable or if there's any other recommendation that would be a little bit better priced\nOkay so there's two things you'll see in the ads one you'll see your ads that are very cleverly written that under the law the devices are not considered to be hearing aids they're referred to as peace saps under the law\nPersonal found the amplification product I think is what it stands for\nAnd those are being very heavily promoted on the Web and as you mentioned the newspaper ads and people are selling those from anywhere like under a hundred dollars to typically camping out around three hundred dollars\nAnd then there are actual real hearing aids that require that you also have the services of an audiologist in order for you legally to be able to get them there was a hearing aid is licensed by the FDA\nA piece at you and I could go start our own Mike ... piece at company now there is one that's kind of a step in between and I'd like you to look at the website is I hear medical dot com\nAnd they sell a hearing aid they also sell a FDA approved test kit where you can do your own actual fully FDA approved ear test okay because the way the business works right now\nIs a lot of places do the hearing test quote unquote for free\nAnd then they make the massive mark up on the hearing aids is to my knowledge we're the only country on earth that uses this business model and so I hear medical gets around that\nYou buy you actually paying for the hearing test and then you get the really inexpensive true hearing aid\nSo heard anything about them or any others are reputable so we don't spend money on something that isn't worth a dollar\nOkay so the thing with hearing aids who's going to sound terrible it doesn't matter if you spent five thousand dollars on hearing aids the customer satisfaction with hearing aids is extremely low so that's why I'd like you to start off with something much less expensive and see if\nYou can find one you're happy with before you spend a zillion dollars [noise] you're listening to the cars that will show [noise] [noise]\nI used to have a

the hit on the radio on and I'm only ... after work 'cause I'm driving home um and you mention that for people that are under the age of Twenty one so that Eighteen to twenty\nUm they want to be allowed to get a credit card um due to a federal law and\nI looked at a credit union I'm graduating from college so much going on for years now and I am just now that the further away and I knew that because I recently issued cards and a half college kids or college students I should say\nGet their first credit card under the age of Twenty one so\nAfter doing some research to find exactly what I was talking about I realized that it was the credit card after two thousand nine that you're referring to but if people are able to pay down debt than they could get\nA credit card debt and Twenty one so college students adult part time job they're ... to send an application and they have limits though you have to say that if the facts on male [laughter] which isn't hard to do\nYou have to see the effects on male which isn't hard to do some financial institution and I mean this is only one way to start building credit and I just met at a question on line or a blur chew yeah just kind of\nWell I appreciate that you know most of the time when I'm being asked the question it's about students who are not working you know they're just in college as fulltime students and the idea of the car to act was it was such a high delinquency rate\nOn credit cards when college students were given them the first week of school at age Eighteen or Nineteen\nThat's why the card act provisions are there but especially if a kid is I use the word kid even though you just corrected yourself if somebody is working\nAnd they're going to school they're considered to be someone who is some degree of financially independent and they are eligible to have a credit card if for financial institution will issue one to them\nMhm so you were completely correct\n[noise] or the other thing as I Know plenty of high school students they graduate maybe they don't go on trade technical school or a four year degree program but you know they go right into the workforce and they have to wait until they're Twenty one [noise] it'd be hard for them but\nThey don't have to if they if they show that they are um under the car to act as long as I understand the provisions right as long as they are financially independent they're eligible to apply for a credit card at Eighteen yes\nIt's only college students that are completely dependent on their parents who are the ones that are supposed to wait till they're Twenty one and I appreciate you\nGoing in and digging in and reading the rules and regulations nobody ever does that jump is really neat Judy's with us on the Clark Howard\nShow hello Judy Hi

home improvement contractors I read one recently in the Indianapolis Star about a couple whose finances were basically destroyed\nBy a cricket contractor who's now in trouble with the law and as I've always said about hiring a home improvement company\nThe problem is it's so easy to get married to them and so hard to get divorced and so if you hire the wrong person no matter how sweet talking may are no matter how knowledgeable they are and they take advantage of view\nThe recourse after the fact is almost non existent\nWhen you go about hiring somebody you've really got to think through\nHow you go about hiring that individual and today\nHome renovation home improvement contractors are busier\nThan they probably have ever been and they're having a real hard time finding subs and finding workers\nOur time finding subs and finding workers so even the best most industry is most honest most dedicated contractors are having a harder time delivering so you've got to be very very careful\nIn several areas one when you're considering hiring a contractor to do an improvement or renovation or addition to your home\nYou have got to do the hard work up front 'cause remember when I said it's real easy to get married to him hard to get divorced you want thorough references thorough\nLast ten jobs they've done\nYou want to know when they were started and when they end you actually want to talk to those references surprisingly\nPeople who have had a renovation are edition done to their home are so proud of it they don't be surprised if they invite you over to see the work ask specific questions the project go over budget did it take longer than expected\nIf somebody says no to both of those they're lying there are a plant for that contractor 'cause there's never been a

are rising on credit cards began charge officer rising I read recently in the Financial Times that credit card companies have significantly tightened standards for getting credit cards because they're getting scared that people are we using again with them\nSo the way you know you're we're using with credit card debt is simple if when the bill calms you can't pay at least double the minimum payments on that bill your when you say\nIf you're having trouble making the minimum you're way past way you think you probably can't breathe that all financially anymore\nAnd there's this hard split\nWith people use credit cards a lot of people using them justice a payment system to be able to get rewards others using them with the intention of using them as a payment system but finding that you charge too much\nThe reality is with interest rates rising and there are many more interest rate rises it looks like in our future\nThe pain from having an unpaid balance on a credit card is moving up so what you need to be about if you know you're having trouble handling using credit cards you need to put 'em in the deep freeze literally\nYou get a freezer bag put water in it but the

you making progress with them or are you still\n... had to take some time off because of a financial issues involved in and south actually bleed been hanging on them for the past twelve years for the first number of years I was just doing the minimum but I've increased that I basically like one and a half payments every month\nGreat and dean away the interest rates your these loans Eighteen years a long time ago what interest rates there at\nI don't really love is like three percent three and a half a great show but I was actually got them down to a more than half paid off\nWonderful so in your case you're probably in a position where you just want to keep paying 'cause you're making progress now now every additional dollar you're paying more but it's going to a principal in interest anyway yes the loan forgiveness is based on choice pro fashion\nAfter so many years of payments the remaining loan balance is forgiven uh-huh and under those forgiveness programs it's ten twenty or twenty five years of payments in your case how much remaining balance the have Eighteen thousand\nOkay so the rate you're paying how long is it going to take you to pay that off\nI'm hoping I can have it paid off in about a five or six years\nAll right and what do you do for a living\nI'm In the medical field okay so in the medical field depending on what you do you may or may not be eligible under

headed off to Europe yeah it's quite an event I'm 'cause I was an air force and I get married and England Nineteen sixty eight in December so that wasn't a good time of year for a honeymoon didn't have any money [laughter] so in may I took\nBecause a couple of weeks leave I think we have two hundred and fifty dollars took a train to Paris and we have a book you're from five dollars a day which is very helpful at that time\nI remember that was the book that launched Arthur from er\nYeah I still have it you don't\nOh yeah we have a way of our scrapbook anyway we went to Geneva, Switzerland on a train and then from Geneva we hitchhiked\nHad no idea where river going ended up in Grand old interlocking up into the option of over into Lichtenstein\nA Jew or a little bit austere in fact and in Germany look some bird Belgium and back to England state and youth hostels and we met a gentleman and for such Lichtenstein into cafes have helped us interpret the menu and\nBelieve it or not I found this man about six months ago and rotate at him\nI was in Nineteen sixty nine when we've ...\nSets amazing and next Wednesday we leave for Geneva we're fine to Geneva with two backpacks and we never went backpacking before and we're going to do the same for the same thing [laughter] don't wear winging it\nWell let me tell you in Switzerland people don't hitchhike anymore somebody told me that\nYeah I mean they are one of the very wealthiest countries on earth so that's probably not going to make it happen or you\nBuy hope because we're we're we're sick I'm sixty seven and my wife sixty four\nWell what about renting a car\nWhere we're not planning anything as far as how it's going to go other than lands and in the airport\nWell see if you rent a car you can go wherever the car takes ...\nYeah but that that would take the fun out of you think so yeah\nWell you know our first trip was really really the way to go we met people we saw things that we wouldn't have seen if we were tours it was absolutely probably one of the best experiences in our life\nI think that is so fantastic it's just different now\nWell I Know and we're where everybody tells we're we'll find out really you know it's either going to be a very spectacular trip\nKnow you'll have a great time\nBecause we're going to end back in England the latter part of the month for ... for the whole month now we do have a real fast for England is that for most of the relatives ... some friends we have the the other four will be just rely on our phone than you are\nI think that thumb thing you've got to put that aside and may be considered and if you want to stay in hostels that's fine and then as far as getting around using the Swiss rail well I Know I'm taking all the fun out of this story\nYeah it it might end up paying that but uh the the one thing I wanted to know like I I don't even have I guess they call it of a Mac card a debit card or whatever I I don't have a I got one from our local bank very helpful because of ... you should have went over there to here\nAnd use that and then some people said well you can also use your credit card\nYeah but with your credit card so many credit cards ... or ... USA I remember having served in the military\nNow I have a visa and I have a mass of Karzai's\nSo you call each issue her and you asked them what their foreign currency transaction fee is\nOkay no I did find out from the visa which will probably be the one I use its one percent\nSo you just let me just wear that thing out but before you go you got to make sure they know\nYou just you just wear that thing out but before you go you got to make sure they know you write countries you're going to be on right so they don't shut you down\nNow would it be better if you use a credit card then the bank card I\nUse their credit card you know when you're in Switzerland get your Swiss francs right from an ATM but\nWhat I did I got some I've already got a couple of hundred bucks for each of the currency I got some choice French I go to mirrors and some pounds\nOr then you may not need to withdraw money but I didn't get that many\nYeah well he too because different from when you were there in the sixties where nobody knew what a credit card was no Europeans like us use credit cards or debit cards for every last thing\nFor everybody I Know here does and we don't I don't even know how to use the courts\nWhich are going to be there because the exchange rate you get is substantially better mhm using your credit card than using cash\nOkay at the youth hostels you're going to find that a lot of them will not take credit cards\nWhat we did we had to vote one when we landed in Geneva we did folk Utah so for that first night 'cause we're going to be tired we want to replace at least for one night to know wherever saying\nAnd uh they just take your credit card as far as a deposit and uh we we joined us hostile for years thirty five dollars for the two of us\nI Am so glad All right so when you're traveling around or you Web savvy now\nSo I don't know if I can sit and watch YouTube forever and my old TV shows and that shit I I'm not a ... we still have an old dial phone I use\nThe reason

Europe that would be quite a sight to see with your backpacks and as you as you're in Utah so you'll learn from other people of all ages\nThings you should be doing but I Am just smiling ear to ear\nBecause I Want to tell you something run that chance I could get my wife to do a trip like you're describing really is so much less than zero there ain't no way I she's doing that\nI I Know some people that that wouldn't even think of doing that either you know\nWell but it will be I'm sure it will be a great trip down memory lane Joel your wife is so amazing and travel she is is that working for any creature comforts or anything like that but which she do what Ryan and his wife are going to do I I Can't see that she packs\nLight and we're cool with lower level accommodations but I'm not

can say oh well we don't think that you Tom took good precautions and so we're going to hold you liable for the charges or whatever which they cannot do want to consumer car so\nI don't like even if
