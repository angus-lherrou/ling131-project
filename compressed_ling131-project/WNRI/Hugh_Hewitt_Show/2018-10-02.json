right\nUm I didn't get that far [laughter]\nUm it it is absolutely I okay\nFor you to use acorns and have it as a path to start building up some money for you for\nFor the years and it is it's where

Do\nYeah and you know ... investing\nInvest things for the long haul and you know in the shorter term you might put money in and lose some of that at least temporarily but over time you can end up with a substantial amount of money a dollar here a dollar there through your week three year year\nAnd it's money that becomes painless you don't even realize that it's banished and gone into investing so I'm impressed with what acorns has put together\nThat's awesome gives me a comfort level that I can go out there that I'm not worried about sharing information\nI Would feel absolutely fine investing with them\nAwesome well thanks for your information I appreciate\nIt so I Love is your son is teaching you think so yeah absolutely\n[laughter] isn't that great Ashley's with us on the Clark Howard show hello actually how're you doing I'm doing great care Ashley you've got a question for me let's see if I can help you with\nYes I'm I'm hiring a virtual assistant she helped me with my mind mundane tasks touches paint dry laundry many groceries and things like that but it's through up Oregon I\nKnow that in a qualified people that I Want to be able to get her ... and ... to pay for something without risking credits or its filing credit card and ... and things like that while minimizing I read ... que\nSo you're going to give this person the ability to make payments that you want to make sure they don't destroy your credit and at the same time limit access that this individual would have to your funds absolutely\nOkay I've got something I like for that\nAnd I've only one other time of I suggested it in a situation or something like yours but it seemed to fit and it's called blue bird have you ever heard of bird now if you look at ... dot com\nIt is a payment system that is a joint venture of American Express and Walmart\nAnd so you're able to issue a bluebird account to this individual\nAnd they can do a bill payment for you they can do transactions on the card you can see every transaction this happening and here's the best part you control the flow of money into the blue bird account\nSo you don't put any did you put in at only the money that you need this assistant to have to do the transactions that you need them to pay for and take care of\nGreat that's exactly what I mean the exactly my requirements I thank you\nAnd the other thing with blue bird read through all the ... all the ways that works as long as you jump through all the right hoops with blue bird you don't pay no fees at all to have this ... for\nThis assistant\nNow you're only risk is let's say you do run into a problem with this individual and you have let's just say for argument's sake you've got three hundred dollars and the blue bird count at that time ... and so you decide you got to let this person go 'cause they're not performing well\nAnd so you decide you got to let this person go 'cause they're not performing well or they have not proven to be trustworthy or whatever they'll last amount of money you have on deposit that they have access to may well be at risk\nAbsolutely so but you know you will know the amount and it would be kept by the amount that you were put in there that you've trusted 'em with yes\nAnd that's a risk and willing to take up to a certain dollar value\n... okay so it is a the possibilities it's number one for what you're trying to accomplish that I Hope that you find that it works well for you if it turns out that blue birds a bust I Need to know that so I can take that information into account next time I might talk about it\nDarren is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Darren how are you today\nGreat thanks for the political certainly you want to talk about your child or children\n[noise] yeah I had a question I have all of a as obsessed with credit freeze or you are\nAnd [noise] my wife and I asked her accounts were frozen than we are as our daughter's\nA ... as we got a Social Security number on her but my question is why do they even have a credit files on minors or ... why do they even permit activity if they're not you know legally able to find her any\nYou know any hangar open new accounts\nSo criminals are exploiting a loophole and how the three major credit bureaus do business so the credit bureaus what they do is they they make money collecting data they make money selling data\nAnd so they build ... on on anybody who anyone reports credit activity on so they didn't start off with a file one you're young daughter\nBut what happens with a dinner you fast in childhood enemy theft is far more likely to occur than for an adult\nIs someone will assume you're trials Social Security number and they'll do it for many different reasons their favorite is it there's no history there so they'll start applying for things as if\nThey are not necessarily your daughter but using her number\nAnd so that's what creates the file with the credit bureaus and voila suddenly they're crook has\nTaken over your daughter's Social Security number and potentially created a whole new identity because remember there was no pre existing record for your daughter\nSo what child credit freeze does\nIs the credit bureau actually creates an empty file for your daughter\nBased on her name and her Social Security number and then freezes which prevents anybody from applying for credit or doing things as if they are the holder of that Social Security number\nGotcha kind of a credit bureaus are at cross checking the Social Security number against a birth date\nAbsolutely not because that would make too much that's\nNo that would cost them money to the credit bureaus there was no necessity or even desire of the credit bureaus to be very accurate\nThey're happy play on horse shoes clothes for them is good enough because accuracy would be expensive and it would reduce their net profits\nSo everybody understands and the lending business big credit bureaus are an approximation of

club but he was a member of that he ended his membership but they were still drafting his checking account\nAnd this is a problem that happens again and again when you allow an auto debit or a car loan for any kind of product or service when you give permission or any place\nTo go into your checking account and take whatever they want through a C H automated clearinghouse you need to know that your rights under the law or post static\nBut when a business or any organization takes money\nThat way it is a real chore a real hard thing and many times you will never be able to get your money back\nSo if you want the convenience of making sure that bills get paid on time set up where you are in charge\nWhere you set up to automatically pay each month on a credit card 'cause you have a whole bunch or rights if a business does a charge against a credit card that they shouldn't have done\nOr you use your own bill pay\nThrough your credit union or bank where you're controlling the payments that go you set up automatically but you're the boss when you quit some service or whatever or you've made the last payment on a loan or something like that\nYou go into your bill pay and you just continue paying\nThe problem with the drafting with the AC age because you have virtually no rights\nIs that if money is taken either by mistake or on purpose\nIt is extremely difficult to get

think we have similar um daughters in the sense that they're both going off to college this year and they both have peanut allergy um my daughter has a life threatening peanut allergy and we started the process about Eighteen months ago and trying to\nFind the best college in the best for her and um I thought I was doing the right thing by going to the right channels at the university that she packed\nAnd come to find out where you know ten days from low then date and they're\nBeing inflexible in regards to the dining plan is kind of how I Would see it um we thought should be able to\nTo go to the dining hall that when she got that for orientation it was obvious that there was a lot of um opportunity for cross contamination and so in a couple of days she was there for orientation she kinda grabbed a banana and one other thing from there and thought\nI Need to do something else so I'd ask to be exempt from that dining plan and they're saying no she's not allowed to be exiled to have and\nWe got talk here because we got a similar thing going on with my daughter and that uh for her housing assignment\nYeah she had requested that that she be with a roommate that had food allergies as well or roommate said would agree to have no peanut products in the dorm room 'cause you know those dorm rooms here on top of each other\nAnd she got lost in the shuffle and she's with two roommates both of whom she's communicated with on social media both of whom\nAre not products are very important part of their diets\nAnd also now and and we got her advocating for herself she's been working with the school to try to get a different housing assignment and wearing count down to going as well and have a similar issue\nSo ah on the food side what I Would do is get outside the bureaucracy at the school\nAnd they send a letter to the chairman or the board of trustees\nOkay and it's an obvious thing that no school and what goes bad guys it's Latin or ... you know school is a is ever supposed to put a student and life and death danger\nAnd it's an old legal concept and the school by being careless is doing exactly that with your daughter\nAnd it is a is a proper thing that if they can't provide a safe environment from people aren't aware your daughter in mind can die almost immediately from being exposed to cross contaminated not or peanut products\nAnd it's one of those things people roll their eyes were they get a rash or something they don't get those NF lactic shocking and a infant death\nAnd so it's possible that the administrators at the school don't get the the life and death aspect of it either so\nI had never heard of a allergy still our child almost died one day from it and I get how dangerous it is so I Would uh if you're going to advocate for her or she should be advocating for herself as well\nI Would find out who the chairman of the board is and that's who I Would immediately contact\nOkay\n... what's that because I've been working with like the directors of dining and and they're simply saying well it's really up to the director of how are ya ya ya I got another game\nHere a credit mumbo jumbo and they don't care if your kid doesn't live up\nThey don't care about that you're the one who has to carry your daughter has to care about herself and that's why you go outside the bureaucracy and you make it now I I don't see anything wrong with calling the president university\nOkay where there any other advice that you have is your daughter goes off\nWell I mean if you're at or near daughter's Eighteen or Nineteen and his live with us how well on\nAbout sixteen years\nSo just like you know my daughter was a almost died it too so we've been fully aware of it or allergy is not lessons you know we did the tests overtime hadn't lessons and so I I feel like at their age they're good at protecting themselves\nThat they're not going to you know at late teen they know the drill and they know the risk yeah and and making sure she's always got to at the patterns that are in day that is important but you don't want to have to use those you want to use your good judgment to avoid any situation where you\nUse those you want to use your good judgment to avoid any situation where you might die my daughter came and go to a baseball game\nNo no I ... yeah so there is no baseball in our [laughter] our household right um\nBut time here as soon as she said oh I don't understand it and how could they I mean why would anybody understands\nBy because they haven't experienced it firsthand there's no way so it's not like we should be mad at other people for not carrying they don't know how important it is that's why we've got to let them know\nRight [noise] I ... ... okay no follow up with me let me know how it plays out when you start reaching outside the normal channels\nOkay I Will do that right best of luck and Clark\nAnd wow what a strange thing that is exactly something that we're going through a parallel playing here but it's not funny playing at all George is with us on the Clark Howard show hello George\nI ...

it's the ... and I've been on in a different\nUm but ah I lost my job a oh I'm Sorry thank you I lost my job a few months ago and the first one day is it wise to take because I have a pretty good\nAmount of money in my soul and Kate I'm getting ready to wall oriental is really a way and um I was thinking is it wise to take the money and pale faced with mental\nWow uh gosh that's a tough one because if you take the money out of the four one K. instead of putting it in the IRA you were going to do you suffer tax on it and the ten percent federal penalty\nSo the tax consequences or severe usually the tax and penalties will add up to around forty six percent of the amount of ... no no that wouldn't be true anymore it's forty four percent\nOf the amount of money so that means for every dollar you would take out of the four one K. you no longer habit for retirement and that dollar becomes reduced to fifty six cents going towards the student loans so it is a\nIt's a very harsh way to get rid of the student loan debt\nAnd now let's see if there's any reason that would make sense what interest rate the your student loans carry\n[noise] full point one twenty five\nNow than it
