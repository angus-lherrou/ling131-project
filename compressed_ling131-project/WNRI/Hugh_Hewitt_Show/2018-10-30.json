that so many people have done in the past regret so much\nDid you know that if you work for a small worm lawyer somebody other than a giant company\nWell that if you work for a smaller employer somebody other than a giant company\nAnd if they offer you a four O. one K. did you know\nThe your expenses that you're paying on that four one K. are usually four to five times as much\nAs they are for somebody who works for a giant company small businesses midsize businesses face an enormous administrative burden and cost offering four oh one K. plans and those costs\nIn most cases are passed on to you\nIt's weird but it now costs more\nTo have a four one K. if you're employed by a smaller employer than it is for you to have your own IRA or Roth IRA with a low cost company\nAnd that's why I recommend to you that if you do work for a smaller company that you put in to their four one K. only up to the match\nAnd then after that if you're disciplined you put money in your own IRA with one of the low cost companies on my investment guy to Clark dot com\nSo this is a terrible problem that why is it that somebody who works for a smaller business which more than half of Americans do\nShould be discriminated against on a four one K. plan versus somebody who works for a big company it's just not right especially it harms the long term growth potential in the United states if it discourages people from working for a mid size or small business\nAnd they tend to go to work for a slower growing bigger company\nIt actually squeezes the future potential of the U.S economy so there is a new rule working its way through the bureaucracy that hopefully in the next few months\nWill allow operators of small and mid sized businesses to go into pooled for one case where there were a trade association they'll be able to offer a much lower costs four one K. and in many cases\nEmployers who are unfortunately offering high costs for one case will be able to offer for one case at

know my oldest brother huh\nThat's what he told you so you'll be able to answer the question\nIs what my oldest brother um when his ... he had already retired and then his wife are retired and they have no real permanent address and they just go wherever and right now they're living in Arizona for six weeks\nAnd then they're going to go to Japan for four weeks and just wherever the deal is on a cruise ship or at a resort or travel internationally they're going to go to\nItaly for two months and the fall and they're doing everything on the cheap\nSo the question of where you Dahmer style I'm like I'm not going to give you the book cancer I might give you the real answer okay\nFor ... for instance you know tax reasons yeah I'm sure injury then right I'm voting I mean how do you do that if you're if you're traveling\nRight so you establish residency wherever it's almost a convenience like a lot of people will register and Montana because their taxes are so favorable and that's where they'll dom asylum or they do so in Florida you work for a state with no state income tax\nIs rule number one mhm and usually what you do is you do I'm now again this is not the book answers what people really do okay but I give you the really do I answer\nWhy I called okay so what people will do is if they have a friend or relative or whatever in a zero income tax state you Lisa room from them and their home and you sign up weighs probably never use the room\nBut you just pay 'em like a hundred dollars a month to be able to call their place you're home\nSo you don't actually fish we have to own property and know your residency states\nKnow the big thing is you don't want to set foot ever in the state you live in now if you come from a high tax state you live in Connecticut and that's why we want to\nFind as you say you're never and Connecticut again right if you go if you go back to visit relatives in Connecticut you stay in a hotel\nIn somewhere else in the tri state area and you drive over to see 'em but you're not spending any time in Connecticut because the big thing in high tax states they're going to try to come back at you and say wait wait wait wait\nWe don't really believe you're a resident or whatever\nAnd you been here a lot you're not there are a lot when you leave Connecticut you leave Connecticut\nOkay so you just basically do the math figure out which is the most tax has been changed your state and decide to live there\nYeah and practically what most people do is they do Florida Texas or Montana are the three that are done most often but there are special advantages to Montana and so if you\nLook around on the Web and you'll see where people posted articles about why they use Montana as their dominant style [noise] you're listening to

dollars so [noise] hopefully by the end of the air she'll she'll actually be graduating and uh hopefully we'll have employment as an elementary school teacher\nJobs is you know are so relatively plentiful\nSo it's not a question of if she can find a job it's just is it going to be the job she wants so yeah I wouldn't worry at all about her\nCrossing the thousand dollar income threshold so doing a raw for her for a grand is such a wonderful gift because at Twenty one way that you said she's graduating from college and she's only Twenty one\nYes you know most people don't finish college now tilt twenty three twenty four\nRight she had she actually had skipped a a year of high school because she entered an advance program with a school up in northwest Missouri\nAnd uh it gave her both college credit in high school credits and uh she found that she didn't particularly like that program is supposed to be a two year program but then she took it upon herself when she found that she would have to go back to high school to finish her a high school diploma at her old high school\nShe decided to contact the president of one of our state universities\nAnd contact him directly saying you know\nThe problem she was having at the school and he moved toward the admission officer who then said well if you just get your GED we can go ahead and take those credits in it but she went to college and so which she should've been starting her senior year of high school\nShe was actually a a freshman in college that was about halfway through the freshman year already with the number of credits yet\nYou have one industry has daughter there and what I Love is that she advocated for herself at Seventeen years old and made this happen for her and she's got a bright future in front of her and the ... doing that at Twenty one\nThe number of times her money will double that thousand dollars will double\nYou're adding I mean just simple math you're adding like a whole additional cycle at least a veteran army doubling by doing it so young\nRight and my my question was is is the rough IRA the best way to go I was\nThree hundred percent ... okay\nYeah there's not even gray on that that is the perfect thing you can do for her good and um I have a guy I don't know if you've seen it at ... dot com it's a basic investing guide ... he can get that set up in all in like ten minutes time\nAnd you're open a shell account and then she can find it with a thousand you're going to give her and she'll be\nAll set\nAll right very good I appreciate your advice on that thank you\nWell that is great and congratulations to her doing something like a throwback getting an undergraduate degree by your twenty first birthday John joins us on the Clark Howard show Hi John\n... thanks for taking my call I learned a lesson you over the years\nWell thank you very much you have something that's been pets do you want to run by me tell me\nAbsolutely I heard you talk about the long term care insurance but mostly the traditional pie and we are destroying insurance agent I my uh state planning attorney\nWho recommends a whole life policy that he got the ability to use for a certain amount of long term care insurance and years at a certain amount for both me and my life\nA very smart move by the insurance industry\nHas long term care market has mostly exploded\nBecause the number of people who claim long term care and has turned out to be far larger than the insurance actuaries expected and so the big push in the insurance industry is what you heard the pitch for\nWhat happens is you buy a whole life policy where they ride or for what sometimes is referred to as a living benefit\nWhere if you never need long term care you just have a death benefit that goes to the beneficiary designation the policy\nOn the other hand if you do need long term care with money that would have been paid out at death instead is paid for the benefit of care for all\nUh instead is paid for the benefit of care for a long term care facility care in your home a nursing home whatever up to the limits that the policy calls for and you've purchased\nSo for the insurance industry what it does is it caps their risk and what it does for you is you have a premiums are ... you pay and you know that that benefit up to that dollar amount will be there for you okay is that how it was explained to you\nBoth very much so I guess the question is I've always ... hour but I think is your philosophy to go which a term insurance ... I'm well covered there and I was wondering what I'd be a true much for that to get a whole like algae that I don't need to check that\nYes we are dealing with a very broken system so long term care there are a small number of companies that still sell it on my long term care information that Clark dot com and you don't know what will happen with the premiums if you buy one of those so despise your certainty\nBut what it does do is you're paying a great deal of a premium for that certainty\nSo are you someone who could ... you might not like it but you could afford the premiums if over the years ... years for a long term care premiums escalated\nYes that's true if that's your case go with traditional long term care insurance and go with one of the mutual insurers that are on the list like um northwestern mutual as an example would be a better choice Joe joins us on the Clark Howard show hello Joe\n... certainly got a\nProblem a Charlene hair and age that I Want to live here and\nThere are several times a week and the competitors are they all have some fun and uh I don't know that much about it like about it and tries\nWill you know the United states is almost alone in the world with hearing aids being so expensive\nAnd so if you were overseas is kind of typical that for a pair of hearing aids you'd spend around oh four hundred eight hundred dollars\nAnd in the United states it's common that you pay several thousand dollars for a pair of hearing aids\nBut now the competition from overseas is coming into the United states plus some homegrown players and one that I Would like you know look at Joe is one call I hear medical dot com\nThe letter I. H. E. A. R. here medical dot com\nAnd they are selling a hearing aid for two hundred Ninety nine dollars\nCome yes I have a medical um\nYes and so ah two Ninety nine per year is very cheap they haven't FDA approved process where you do you're you're hearing test at home\nAnd the company is from San Francisco and so two hundred and Ninety nine dollars an ear is great when I have recommended to people\nWith anything like I hear medical or any of the ones that you would do on your own at home is that you start with one ear\nAnd see if you like it because you know the problem with hearing aids people will spend thousands of dollars to do and then they don't like them and they don't wear them\nA lot of people complain about a ... they're not satisfied with and it's and a lot of money on

is\nBrian's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Brian\nHow are you there oh sorry [noise] live life has been driving the same car for twenty two years\nTwenty two okay how did you end up coming right here right now the talk about me trying to get people to keep a car ten years or longer and your wife runs a vehicle for twenty two years what\nTry what lasted twenty two years Brian\n... a Toyota Camry a Toyota Camry and how much\nIn terms of repairs and things like that anything major like that other people would have said I don't have the stomach for fixing this I'm going to bail anything like major happened over those twenty two years\nIt's been a great car we love it and we're thinking about getting another one now say any transmission aim engine in a great car fan I'd asked as\nWell that that is a great story to hear well how can I be of help because it sounds like you're the one who should be leading other people here are your wife should be\n... well\nSo we're looking for another car I'm probably another ... family and um I Would consider buying use but hurricane was here a year ago hurricane was it\nA ... well out here in Florida and\nThat [noise] yeah and that it started out there were cars that were flooded and maybe someone got their car fare themselves and that information never makes it to the car title and on that end up with a bad car\nAnd that could happen and that's why a you know when I talk about checking vehicle title history that's only one step of two major ones when you're looking at buying a used vehicle and the other\nIs to have the vehicle inspected by the whoever the Toyota mechanic is who's taking care of your wife's Toyota for the last twenty two years because they'll be able to tell me I'll be able to there'll be signs that they know to look for\nWhere they'll be able to see if a vehicle suffered any water damage\nOkay now we're far enough yeah I should\nTell you we're far enough away from Hurricane Irma now that it would be less likely that there was still be a flood vehicle somebody would be trying to pass off in the marketplace that could happen\nBut it's not as much an issue as it is in the immediate six months after a major hurricane\nOkay are you and I make another two yes and that is that Toyota\nIs having trouble getting people interested in buying ... cameras because the market has shifted so much too little SEVs and in fact traditional passenger cars are now down to\nA third of the car market or vehicle market from being nearly two thirds of the market just a few years ago\nBecause I look around everybody's driving\nA heavily these smaller SUVs which are basically just an SUV working top put on the same car platform as a passenger car may have been so I got pretty good fuel economy and all that but that's what people are interested in so you may find you can buy a new Camry\nAt a fantastic price [noise]\nYeah and not even a buy one that's a year or two old since since your wife likes to keep a vehicle for two decades\nShe could go ahead and get a new one potentially instead of a used and not have to worry about the flood that\nDo you think I might find good prices on cameras than your cameras\nSo yeah oh yeah I mean you know the the sedan market is true so on lives right now\nWell I I've been talking to dealerships and I started with a Costco program and um I've been trying to negotiate lower right and I am and I'm finding dealers don't really want to go there were a lot\nWell that's because the Cosco car buying program is such a a you know what I saw the equivalent of the largest cardio or in the United states and so the price that costs go member debts for the Cosco car buying program is going to be a very good price\nAnd I'm curious equipped is your wife wants what kind of price are you seeing on a new Camry\nOn a Camry s e Costco price and I have it and at that I Want to pass on you and the list or the listeners can we as a out the door\nIncluding taxes and all this junk ease the Cosco prize is twenty four two and change and um\nSo then I started talking to other dealers and the problem that I found I was asking or okay what's your best fries including her dealer fee so\nFinally I started asking them okay it out the door fee and they were adding on all kinds of joke I learned that when you negotiate for a car you have to get out the door the otherwise they attack on all kinds of stuff right when you thought you had a good price\nThe the Wednesday drunk the versus the friday John ... versus the Tuesday ... yeah yeah it's really crazy isn't it\nThe Tuesday junk food prices yeah right yeah it's really crazy isn't it so I'm not a you know I don't know twenty four\nAre you comfortable with that are you still want to work used\nI think I'm more comfortable that so\nI think because of the history of ownership and how much your wife is like having the cameras she's already had this one will seem completely different because technology's changed so much in two decades I'd say why don't you splurge and buy or the new one\nAnd that we're coming out of my mouth will is with us on the Clark Howard show how long will ... will how can I serve you\nUm I just had a a tireless request show ID anyhow\nUh I Do a ... foot center said and I worked for one which I Love for lunch and then I thought ... or send in July Roth IRA us taking a switch in that and that is actually a lot ... than putting maybe three or sent back to work for a while but I just wanted to get your it'll it'll that idea\nOkay so explain why you're thinking of flipping\nA just cause I worked at a match lie a match and just in case I ever needed all at the principle of the Roth okay tax free\nAll right ... that's a great idea the thing is though make sure you do that raw with one of the real low cost providers\nSawyer preferred on the talk about for the regular stuff\nAnd so you want to put in the amount you'll end up putting into the rock is it fifty five hundred or how much total would you put out\nI wouldn't accept every year\nYou would max that every year for her and then do the other yeah I mean your employer not giving you a match makes that makes perfect sense okay if you could consider are you married well\nI'm not married the other thing I thought about doing that was passed away I have student loans and just do an even harder and and those are quicker\nOkay I like that idea if you go ahead and put an end of the rock the max and you're going to be disciplined to do that pop fifty five hundred India stop contributing anything to the four oh one K. works as there is no match and use that three percent you would have put in their towards the student loan debt\nOvershadow it as I guess\nYou will shown real discipline saving for retirement already and there's always this issue you know what should go towards savings from retirement and rainy day in which go towards debts student loan debts kind of sit there like like these heavy weights on your shoulder\nOr so I like that plan it\nAnd I keep saving keep building for the future and I should ask you will how far are you away from being done with student loan debt\nA line for years for by federal and then I replied life private to a lower rate I Nine years left\nOkay All right well best to you is going to feel wonderful when you're done with all those

on and I was reminded by it by two stories I've seen recently about employers viewing employees surveys and saying they're anonymous\nAnd then later\nWell it was an anonymous at all this happens as well as a customer when you're asked to fill out a survey and often it will turn out not to be anonymous at all at places of work\nWhen you're asked to fill out an employee survey and some places push for one hundred percent participation and someone will come to you and say hey you haven't turned in your employee survey how ... how could that survey be\nThey know who hasn't turned one in think about that and think about how somebody could decide well we have to always somebody off and the department and you know Jim didn't seem very happy from that survey\nLet's give him the boot\nAnd so the cause of the fact that employers can be dishonest or deceptive\nOr even at a supervisory level based on a number of responses supervisor may successfully been able to guess even with an anonymous survey who failed it out\nWhen you're asked to fill out a survey at a place you work unless you don't care if you get to keep your job or not\nOnly if you have to fill it out only say nice things do not\nSay anything that could boomerang on you\nAnd could be used to harm you\nHad a place of employment where a supervisor a manager or who knows who decides to have it in for you because of what you said about them or their department or the operation when you were doing a survey\nManager listed and so that would be the only reason you would want to have it removed is some times\nUnderwriters a mortgage lenders will say we don't like how much available credit you have to worry about their new home you'll charge up everything and that really be why you would\nWould remove yourself but other than that leave it alone\nOkay very good so basically take action is they say that you know those limits are too large but D.C my scores ... of you know drastically if in fact I Do are moving in the future\nWell it depends very very utilizing twenty five percent of their available credit roughly a that's a good ratio anything below thirty\nIt really is helpful to you and with the credit you have

home movement has lost a lot of steam and the last couple of years you know it was it was really really in a few years ago but people have found it difficult to live in less than four hundred square feet\nSo now people are when they talk about living in a smaller home generally it seems to settle down to around a six seven hundred square feet which gives you just don't want to do more\nRoom to live without an enormous increase and the cost of construction or any of the other expenses because with a tiny home if you're living in something under four hundred square feet\nYou have so many of the same costs as you would in a larger home you've got to run utility used to it which is a big expense you may have permitting costs and the rest now sometimes with a tiny home\nIt will be on wheels
