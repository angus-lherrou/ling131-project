Bobby Fisher to welcome you here how are you doing I'm fine thank you for taking my call\nSo how can I be of service to you\nWell I I I I saw things on E. bay I also buy things and I bought a um an part case for my daughter last week for Ninety One says with free shipping and it came from China [noise]\nAnd I [laughter]\nNow now remember this pay pal fees there's ... shipping fees and\nPlus the product now you know Ninety One sense would free shipping and I wasn't able to track it right to my door till it said delivered it went from China to Chicago to Orlando to report on Florida where I live and it set out for delivery and delivery of units showed delivered\nI Can't even first class leather China for less than three dollars and twelve cents now for me to sell on E. bay I'd have to provide tracking with delivery confirmation\nMight shape is service for me to send to China would forty six dollars and if he says it has to be said with a minimum of priority mail express trying to get a tracking number with proof of delivery and I just find it it's impossible to compete with that\nAnd I went to some possible is for that kind of thing to continue I buy a cell phone accessories on E. bay and even if they don't come from China they seem to be almost a hundred percent made there\nAnd the price points make no sense at all I mean I'm I'm with you why would somebody sell your daughter a case\nFor under a bug that even if they make it for a nickel by the time in and all the shipping costs their negative several dollars\nIf even if I sell in America and I ship in America my cheapest service that I could use printing with a discount through e bay as a top rated seller is a dollar Ninety three for first class or liberal reconfirmation solar my ... my cheapest way to ship something in America is a Ninety right\nRight so where the normal business Bobby the explanation for that would be but it's a loss leader to get you in the door of a store\nEither online or physical store than buy other things that higher prices but the disjointed marketplace of e bay generally doesn't support that so I'm I'm as mystified by this as you are\nThe only thing I could think of is that our government postal service let's try to use our state for free\nThey don't they don't and so the seller lost money I don't care a lot of ... I don't care if you call it the people's money I don't care if you call it the U.S dollar they lost money and whatever currency you counted down\nWhile it just makes no sense\nYou know solve I'll give you another example you know I was talking about how we're getting all these less expensive cell phones and some of them coming to the United states are from Chinese companies and I noticed something on E. bay that I Can't place my finger on either but you can go buy\nA one of these phones from a Chinese seller haven't shipped all the way over here and buy it for at least a third less than it cost if you buy it from an American retailer that cells that Chinese branded phone\nIn a retail store on line so it will hold what might happen to the Y. Asian\nGuy I Can't compete with what's going on from China July shipping alone I Can't compete\nBut but the thing is it's not sustainable it's not sustainable and it's not gonna last so people want to sell us goods below their cost I Know that it's called\nSomething but I Am in favor of dumping because if they want to lose money to support us let him go for it but I'd much rather lob cellphone cases at a loss at us and spent a nuclear tipped missile any day you're listening to the car talent show\n\nYou'll see one earnings growing up\nIf you've done offshore squeaking right board market\nEasily one of the most annoying office noises there is right up there with the woman who taps or Penn like she's doing a drum solo at a soda arena [noise]\nAt monster you can't stop those types of noises but we can quiet all the noise around finding the right talent you know the knows we're talking about all you're trying to do is fill rules for your company but instead you're being inundated with reps from job sites trying to sell you one size fits all products you don't need and your inbox is full of candidates you'd never even consider\nMonster cuts through that noise we work with you to really understand your needs and address those needs with the right solution no more no less just smart people getting to know your business was simple personalized solutions for a fair price real human being human how's that sound\nSo what you need to know particularly if you're moving into an area from out of town or even if you're a local you don't want to rent a place sight unseen\nPictures on the Internet not enough you want to actually see the physical place now the crooks are going to vanish\nWhen they know you want to see the actual rental property and that's the greatest protection you can have\nMagnet is with us on the Clark Howard show how are you I'm perfect Craig how can I serve you well\nUm I haven't been having is they add birthday next year and I was wondering if there is any way I go there every search for him and vacation in Antarctica I could afford on our library and budget hey that\nThey can age however so I just wanted to surprise him but something nice\nWell are you just the sweetest you're not going to go now okay so I have not Antarctica is the only continent I haven't gone to\nAnd normally you think it's because I haven't gone because I'm cheap and I won't spend the money that's half the answer the other half is if you watch any videos on YouTube about what the waves are like\nIs you go south most people go south from Argentina\nThe waves are dry a monster waves most of the time when it comes as you get closer to Antarctica and so do you think your husband could handle going through her\nHe went and got a lot by bus and I understand the way there were other unpleasant that as well\nOkay so good for him I'm not doing that so I see not me out for like two days and I woke up and I had no one had been through him so the the reality is going to\nAntarctica is going to be an expensive venture\nMhm and there are no true bargain trips that I have ever heard of to Antarctica something that has to be a very very special event that's worth laying out some serious cash\nThat's not the answer you were looking for for me was that\nWell I'm just wondering maybe if they have in the air or if they are and ... minutes shows [laughter] okay\nSo if I Will go to Antarctica ... term there\nYou go to Antarctica during the um north northern hemisphere\nWinter because it will be summer so you really want to go and I'm ... January February and Antarctica is I'm a generally you go\nOn a boat and uh there used to be um like discovery fights that people would go on where you just fly down\nAnd you'd fly over the uh Antarctica and then you fly back\nAnd it's that something that I'm not aware is done any more because it just doesn't give you the experience you have\nIf you go by boat many of the boats that go are for scientific research but there are journeys for people who just want to experience the adventure uh-huh and I'm trying to think where\nYou know what okay Krista my producer just came up with something on the Web that did not occur to me you're going to like this where she just came up with\nThere are a when they have ... sold burst on the cruises to Antarctica they offer deals on them just like they do for any other crews for last minute unsold cabins wow\nI Would have never thought of that that's why she's my boss just got that brain power fat so that is the right thing to do is to look for a last minute cruise what month are you thinking of him going\nBut it's like ... it kind of go again to go any any any time next year\nOkay whatever so it was what I Try to\nDo what I Would do is I I Would I Would I talk to someone who is a cruise only agent and get a he or she to to keep monitoring it and when there's a real special for one opens up particularly for a last minute\nThat that's how you book at and that's how he goes\nOh my God\nAnd you have to add in the cost is most of them as I mentioned go from Argentina huh so you have to add and the cost of the flight from wherever in the U.S to Argentina not to Buenos Aires to ah to [noise]\nI Would probably is frequent flyer miles that's what we did find that they're ...\nVery smart very smart that combination my there would be a great deal use a free ticket and then a last minute crews and he will ever experienced the only continent I have not been too and maybe I Need to stop being such a wimp\nRobert's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Robert\nHey good a player so lashed out here today\nWas great to have you here\nYou are or me about it\nHow I get a raise or to last so long that right [laughter]\nYou mentioned drying the blade well I Can't figure out how to do that\nWell I don't do the right way\nRobert what you're supposed to do is you're supposed to use like um\nAlcohol to dry it or some people that are obsessed use a blow dryer there are now devices you can buy a drug stores that when you're done shaving you put the blade into it and then it's basically an internal hair dryer kind of thing\nThat that drives the blade I simply a dry it on my tower shake it off dry it on my towel put it in the drawer\nAnd two blades ago my blade lasted Fifteen months my most recent blade I Am sad to report only lasted three months I don't know what I read the wrong 'cause that's the shortest any blade is lasted\nSo I don't know what I did wrong 'cause that's the shortest any blade is lasted me and years and years and years but it only got three months out of it\nBut let's do it for is what I like that alcohol I did I think I'll do it that way [laughter] so\nHow often do you replace a blade Robert\nOh well I only shape about twice a week and I can get probably go with ...\nWell now if you start drying it you'll make it a is a twice a week shaver you might make it two years\nWhere we will see it I'm going to take up the challenge\nAll right let's see the longest 'cause I was impressed with my Fifteen months but there are people have gone way past Fifteen getting as a a razor to last because the key is that blades don't deteriorate from the active shaving they deteriorate only from moisture\nThe manufacturers a chicken ...\nAnd the other smaller players make fantastic razors now\nAnd there's no reason for him to degrade and never a particularly ladies don't leave you a raise or in the shower or you're going to shorten the life of it to about

decades had been swindled by a con artist usually overseas\nYou're generally outside the reach of US law enforcement\nWho ... them into believing they've won a pile of money\nIn a foreign lottery or they used to be referred to a ... as I remember years ago they were overwhelmingly\nA British lottery scams or people were getting calls saying they had won the lottery in the United kingdom or this one or that one or the other one from Germany and then there are a lot of them that were um callers from\nUh Europe or Africa is saying that people who won the lottery is there more recently it's been out of the Caribbean and regardless of where they come out of the Caribbean they're referred to as the Jamaican lotteries scams or Jamaica\nJudge packed with us and\nActually a lot of them do actually operate other Jamaica telling you that you would have won this lottery and all you need to do is pay for as it's been all through the decades pay for the taxes to get your winnings\nAnd people do it

great but please call me Clark\nAlright clerk I'm I have a question for you I Am in high school I'm about to go to college and I just wanted to know what I should invest in 'cause I'm thinking about investing about a hundred dollars a month [noise] and I really want to start investing\nMost people are going to college or only spending money how are you in a position you're going to be able to invest you working while you're going to school\nYes sir I have a part time job right now and when I'm In college I uh to get in to another part time job\nWow so for you so you're like Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen somewhere in there\nYes there wow okay we're not related are we [laughter] no I don't think so\nBecause I started my first IRA when I was Nineteen years old\nBecause I really was working while I was in school and so the beauty is that when you put money aside as a late teens or in your twenties the money has a chance to grow and grow and grow because time as your friend your ally\nAnd because you're working there something called a Roth IRA which would be my favorite place for you to look at stashing you're a hundred dollars a month\nIf you've ever heard of ... you know what that is\nI'm not sure what the difference is between a rock and a regular IRA\nSo a without air age you don't want to do a regular IRA because you're not you know going in a high tax bracket\nA Roth IRA works backwards from a regular IRA regular IRA you get a current benefit on your taxes but everything that the money would accumulate over the decades for the next gosh forty years\nWould grow tax free but then every penny you'd end up with would be taxed where the raw it's the opposite you get no current tax benefit but everything that that money grows to be over the years becomes years tax free\nSo that's why I particularly when you're young doing the Roth is a vastly superior option\nIs er at Clark dot com I have information Grayson\nOn choices I'd like you to look at to put that raw money and you can put in up to what you earn in a year but never more than fifty five hundred [noise] so you're a hundred dollars a month as long as you're earning\nMore than that you're good to go to do the Ross\nAnd once you have a thousand dollars is really easy for you to open one of the really great Ross IRA investment choices\n[noise] okay\nGrayson if you go to my investment guy to Clark dot com I'll take you through how to set up the raw and then what you should invest in in that raw you know where you could do the raw and then based on where you go what to invest in and\nIt's a raw and then based on where you go what to invest in and you're off to a great head start and I think that's really exciting\nI Want to start early just you know so I can have the money for retirement\nWealth you start as early as you're starting you may be able to retire significantly earlier than most people are going to be able to do so good for you David with us on the Clark Howard show hello David\nCarr fame and you're getting married I Am well congratulations to you that\nThey get that much ah June third\nRate or another June wedding you know the people in the wedding business that overwhelmed every June all of that [laughter] well how can I be of service to you\nWell as the advice of any marriage counselor I think they tell us that you know it's important that we enjoying bank accounts and I currently bank with one of the biggest banks and so basically\nYou know we both used direct deposit we use a debit cards and credit cards for I Would say Ninety nine percent of all of our purchases and then you know what what we do or we'd be able to pay off but\nRight now since we are going to be enjoying a bank shall we want to find the best and bank that's going to be for us whether it is with a major bank or something small you know we want to add that online banking option we\nStill want to have the option to be able to write checks that need the still be able to get cash from an a an ATM that's not gonna you know hurt us with the ATM costs and those sorts of things as we're overlooking for\nSo I got several things to say number one I normally don't recommend that you merge all your finances right away oh what I tend to like for a couple to do and I should ask first how old are you and your bride to be\nI'm thirty and she's twenty nine\nOkay so you been out in the world for a while that's especially when I don't like for a couple to merge everything especially not at the very beginning I think there's an enormous advantage and having his accounts her accounts and their account\nThat you have a household account where you take care of the household expenses like rent or mortgage or utilities anything that is a obviously and expense of life living together\nAnd then that you eat to continue to have your own separate accounts as well and you agree up front how much each of you will put an end of the joint operating account because people come into a marriage with different ideas about money\nAnd I don't want you to be in a position where you assume one thing about her she assume something about you and then it becomes a flashpoint for disagreement about how each of you set your values with money and priorities\nOkay over time you may find that becomes necessary and you can point to merge everything\nBut I think at first it's best to have his hers there's okay as far as as where I like for you to look at putting money or do either of you do much investing\nA I Believe a you know we are\nSupposed to work for the state so we uh we uh we invest in the retirement system um and\nRichard don't you don't have like an investment account with the stock brokerage or anything like that no\nNo no no\n'cause that's my first go to is usually the best\nUm accounts for checking and for ATMs and all that are with the stockbrokers but if that's not part of your life and your state employees I Would like you to look at doing your joint household account with the credit union are available to you and your state to state employees\nOkay cause credit unions are owned by if you open an account or will be owned by you and your bride to be\nYou know hero you're an owner of the place so they're not trying to rip you off they're not trying to con you and they're going to offer you legit straight up deals at the credit union and you may have an office or offices right near the state facilities you work out\nOK so that would be my favorite and over time you'll know when it's the right time for you to um jettisoned having any separate account of yours or having any separate account of her ...\nOver here and it's usually really advise that you keep each keep your own account if you have really different ideas about consumption\nYou know what I mean if he really loves to shop and the other would be happy never to walk in a store is that right either of your deals\nOh absolutely I mean we uh I'm more of the savers is more of the ... there's\nSo then I Would say for longer than you might imagine it will make sense for you to have\nThe separate accounts but congratulations on your white starting together on June third you're listening to the Clark Howard show\n[noise]\nFood cars close funded by and not so hard life insurance not so much having a good life insurance policy is super important but one third of people don't
