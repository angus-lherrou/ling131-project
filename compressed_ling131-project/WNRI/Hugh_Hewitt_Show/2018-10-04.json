insurance [noise] and a bunch of states I'm going to tell you how this fast growing method of insurance works\nAnd why it might be right for you\nOn TALK today about something that is very confusing is when you decide to buy something because there's this fat and screaming sales sales\nAnd then something that it's become more and more popular with department stores and clothing retailers ... double discount\nSo they'll say forty percent off plus another twenty percent off and so in your mind once forty plus twenty it's sixty percent off but no it's not because the twenty percent is off the already reduced price\nWhich makes it less of a discount and it seems\nThere was a study done at the University of Minnesota they found that even when people were told look for the tricks and how something's priced and they were given calculators people still consistently\nMade the wrong purchase decision influence too much by the on line seller or the physical stores marketing ads or in store signage\nIt made you think you are getting a better deal than you really were or that the way they had worded the discount you didn't realize\nThe item was cheaper somewhere else and when we move into the Christmas selling season which gets earlier and earlier the first Christmas merchandise is already starting to appear\nOn some store shelves I Know that's crazy on August but it's all\nOn some store shelves I Know that's crazy and August but it's already starting to creep into the stores\nSo this time of year now through Christmas is the worst for you being tricked on pricing\nParticularly with Christmas merchandise and through Black Friday week a lot of items being sold at Amazon dot com and being sold and physical retailers will scream at you huge discounts massive per cents off\nBut know that when it seasonal merchandise but it's just designed as promotional items\nDon't believe anything you see about any discount out all only look at what the actual selling prices and you compare that if you can do the same or similar merchandise elsewhere\nBut the discount it's being promoted is a fiction the fact is what's the actual item going to cost you and is that actually a deal\nNo I haven't I hear all of that stuff\nDon't get a free\nI'd like you to go sit down with somebody there they'll have a lot of long form where you lay out everything you is going to be easy for you because you've already um added everything up\nAnd then you sit down with somebody and let them help you try to come up with a plan doesn't have to be when they negotiate they may feel they need to or they may feel that they can come up with the budget for you\nIt'll get you to where you get this paid off in a realistic amount of time based on your income would be to take that credit card debt to zero in five years okay\nAnd I know that's not tomorrow but as you go through paying on it you'll feel the benefits\nSo I Know you have to hear it many times and really process it before you make an appointment with an FCC\nBut I Hope that you will will go look at the website and FCC dot org okay and process that\nAnd having somebody who does this every day come up with a plan for you I

vacation\nUnfortunately it's just their vacation but we're hearing ... who Maui in Hawaii during a twelve day honeymoon\nWell congratulations\nThank you very much\nHow can I be of service with is Ryan\nWell [noise] I set up some fair alerts and haven't been watching their prices but it seems like Hawaii is a little bit of a different animal and wave fanfare eleven twelve hundred dollar range\nWhat are you trying to go from Europe to Hawaii where are you talking about\nOut of the Milwaukee\nOh man okay so the way you buy a ticket to Hawaii is you only shop fares from the west coast okay\nBecause from Milwaukee you can get to the west coast really cheaply their sales all the time\nOkay and then from the west coast there's been sale after sale after sale to Hawaii\nOkay so if you if you do this thing called breaking the fare on the west coast where you have one ticket to the west coast and another to Hawaii it'll cut your overall cost probably in half\nOkay now some of the things you should do is you been working at the fair shopping sites fine but with Hawaii I once you're looking at the websites of Hawaiian Airlines Alaska Airlines and Virgin America especially those three\nOkay for fares from the west coast to Hawaii when things is because you can city shop if there's a great deal let's say from San jose California and it's better deal than Los Angeles or there's a better deal from\nUh San Diego than there is from San Francisco you just pick any of them and that's where you fly on on your mainland ticket\nFrom Milwaukee okay so this is great to know\nAnd Virgin America is the nation's best domestic airline and they've been offering some great prices\nFantastic\nWell I Want to make sure you have a great time how are you going to pick your accommodations on the various Hawaiian Islands\nWe did that hurt already and I've been ... thank you for a few months and we actually did the air being beer out\nGreat after looking at a couple of the

sad and are you doing anything to have your wedding be extra affordable\nYou know\n[laughter] a good honest answer will have a great wedding a wonderful honeymoon and a great\nLife together ginger is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi ginger Hi how are you I'm great thank you ... how can that be of service to you\nWell we want to get guy earthquake got insurance and a concept that gave us didn't seem very brief them all they had to replace lack at two hundred and fifty thousand for the house at south and the houses actually it was seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nAnd ... sorry ... stuffed with thirty seven thousand five hundred and we're just wondering if that is at a common or reasonable\n... you want to have your house insured for what it will actually cost to rebuild it do you have a sense in your neighborhood if there was a vacant lot how much the vacant lot would be worth of their house on that they were going to scrape the lot and build a new house what the what the builder would pay for the land\nAll I have no idea\nBecause the key is not what you did what somebody coming in to buy your place would pay because they're paying for the land in the house it'd be what it would cost to rebuild the house on your homeowner's policy\nWhich you have I guess years of experience with what did they say your house is worth for the actual structural purpose\nUm for for the house that South\nYeah with your regular homeowners forgetting earthquake\n[noise] um I think seven around seven hundred thousand\nHow many square feet do you think your house is\nA thousand one hundred\nOkay it would be it would be unusual recall seven hundred and fifty dollars a foot\nTo rebuild your house and I wonder if there is South Korea right but even with that that's um\nThe the big cost again is the land the house sits on I see so you know they don't replace the land they only replace the house and I'm always worried about people being under insured on a home mhm\nWhich is why I'm going I'm feeling nervous even talking about it this way with you\nBut it may be\nAnd I I don't know it may be two hundred and fifty dollars a foot\nTo rebuild or maybe it's five hundred or whatever it is what is going to cost you to rebuild the home and it is the amount the insurance should be for so do you deal with an agent a toll free number how did you get the quote on the earthquake insurance\nWell we have ... and um you know it came up for renewal and when it came up for renewal they send us out something that said they have to by law offer you the earthquake us off\nRight so I'd call and do you deal with an agent at that homeowners insurance or do you call a toll free number\nA tougher number\nTo call the toll free number and say please explain and I get your homeowner's policy out and see what the coverage is our please explain why the coverage is for the house are listed is so much less on the earthquake rider than they are on the actual policy\nI see okay\nBecause they should match All right if it really is seven hundred dollars a foot for you to rebuild\nThan you know you would need coverage like he talked about on your house and the thing with the earthquake insurance same for people who live at the coast to have to have hurricane insurance uh-huh is to the doctor bowls are crazy high\nAnd that's just something you're going to have to live with\nThirty seven\nAnd that's just something you're gonna have to live with\nThirty seven thousand is raising 'em all\nWhile I didn't say is reasonable it's typical chemicals out from a nap yeah I I'd rather than but I'm I'm more I'm is nervous if he wanted to make sure you're not under insure them and then of course will make the premium go up\nBut you want to make sure you have the right coverage Michael is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Michael how are you doing clerk great thank you Michael what's going on in your world\nUm well I Am very proud to say that yesterday I made the last payment on my student loan my wife and I have been put in about a ... eleven hundred dollars a month towards that and finally got paid off as of yesterday and [noise] well\nHow do I figure it out cause for celebration yeah\nMy wife and I broke out the ... brand a wine last night [laughter] corporate\n[laughter] but yeah what what what we're looking for is I'm advice to see if we're in a position to start putting enough towards our retirement now that maybe we can start using a little bit more now for a family vacation in such\nWell certainly you freed up eleven hundred dollars a month you need to treat yourself so if you were to to take like the first two months after you pay these all take eleven hundred dollars twice take twenty two hundred dollars go do something fun\nThat's go reward yourself you worked hard to pay off that that you got rid of it and you know this is something I talk about that getting rid of debt is not supposed to be just drudgery followed by more drudgery there needs to be a reward a privilege that comes at the end\nYou it's a privilege time\nSo yeah and he wanted to take a vacation you go on vacation\nWonderful and and I guess the the follow up with that I I feel we're putting a a a decent amount away both my wife and I we have government and since we're we're going to have government pensions on thirty four she's thirty three and
