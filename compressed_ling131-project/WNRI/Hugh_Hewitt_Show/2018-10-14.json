circle\nTimeshare developers if you're so busy trying to get people taken away from their profession\nOr get people charged with actions or fraud because they're trying to help people get out of the time shares don't you think the real thing here is that you need to come up with a system where when people want to dump a timeshare you're there for them to dump it too\nBecause obviously a product

in a good\nHarvest gall bladder which I don't think so either and I'm hoping I got the right stuff because I'm On my daughter you know if I had bought the bio class or a combination of all crowd shout out and I've got\nA bad day for a low pay and won't get like ... ... if I\nHire on it yeah there's only one and you do did exactly what you should do and I'm telling you right now what you've done in learning that is you're going to one you're in a lower your risk of cancer because people who lose their gall bladders have a higher risk of cancer\nOf course doctors don't tell you about that before they clip it out of there usually unnecessarily by the way\nMost gall bladders are taken out on necessarily when you can actually and I know it's water under the bridge and it's in your review Amir but I Wish we would've talked before you had it out\nAnd anybody else that you know because we have been able to and many other health professionals have been able to uh stop gall bladder removal by simple only flushing stones and sludge out of the gall bladder with a very simple concoction\nOf a combination of olive oil lemon juice and apple juice it's so simple it's so easy and I have supervised myself personally hundreds of them\nHundreds of them as has other health professional so and but there's you know there's that time one gall bladder surgery can be necessary when they're just it's so far gone\nThat people need to have it out and we're glad to have the modern techniques of a surgical procedures that are a lot better today than they've ever been to take the gall bladder out but foreign away\nOr the gall bladder normally does not need to come out I mean think about it oh these organs are there for a reason they all have a function our creator wanted them there but doctors are kind of like\nThey're kinda like carpenters you know\nThey've got ... a carpenter with a hammer in his or her had everything becomes a nail so anybody counting in\nThat complains of right abdominal right up or a quarter abdominal pain\nAnd they can't quite figure it out and tomatoes and they do all these tests and finally they do the hydro scan or they do it all sounds yeah oh yeah true gall bladder it's moving we got to take that out you just don't need it anyway I mean gosh I can make your body better by removing your gall bladder I mean people get talked into that\nNonsense and people buy it because they believe in the system just like these are what I'm going to be talking about later on in the program the St that same profession meaning while\nGiving decongestant drugs to young children for decades and now we learn how dangerous it is and how many children have died from\nThis but that was the uh you know the standard practice at\nThat time which suddenly just almost like a a page turns you know and now it's not as good for you as we thought that's what we call modern medicine Basie\nIn any event I think you have it right Linda so go forth with that knowledge and information to know that ah you were meant to obtain it and now you're going to benefits ruined by it\nOkay with that olive oil lemon juice and what was the other\nWell I Do not recommend these things be done\nIn a non supervised manner do not try this at home\nYou need to be in the care of a person who's familiar with the protocol who can monitor and be within a phone call of you in case let's say something goes wrong which it usually doesn't I I can count on one hand the hundreds of them that I have\nSupervised the only thing that really wrong as somebody gets a little
