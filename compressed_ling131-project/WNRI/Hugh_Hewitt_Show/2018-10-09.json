liked the condo you haven't really had a lot of fun renting it out there and that's something people do frequently\nWhere they have a home and investment property is they may decide to flip and move into the investment property the advantage to you with your own home his it appreciate and a lot in value\nDish so if you salad\nThat's an advantage because you get to pocket as a single individual a quarter million tax free a married couple five hundred thousand and gain tax free if you hold on to that and converted into a rental property eventually you lose that\n\nSo if you wanted to flip and move into the rental property if there's been a big gain on that house here and\nI Would sell it\nAnd now he can do so\nWell again if it at all but it's a more modest pricing point of view or area that's where homes are still selling very well\nOkay I I think it is in that area so there has to figure that saw Fager fishes ...\nSure and best to you with what you end up doing and James joins us on the Clark Howard show Hi James\nI'm oh I'm fourteen and that I find that hundred dollars and the bank and\nWhy why why why what you were fourteen and you already have twenty five hundred bucks how'd you do that\nI just collecting money from Christmas and birthdays and now that I'm going on in the bank and at times\nSo\nYou when you ever see money as a gift\nAnd holiday periods and for your birthday\nOr you\nDon't spend it you save it\n[noise] I spend a little bit of it but I don't really have anything more south by south ...\nI'd like for you to meet my Thirteen year old son and teach him whatever it is you know because he by his own admission is a spender and I'd love it if you could re educate him to do what you've done which is to save money\nSo let's talk James money you have this twenty five hundred what do you hope for it to be the Sunday what do you hope to use it for\nWell I right now having a credit union bank which is let's get on it at two dollars a year interests right about that but in any ... CDs and trying to get a little bit more money\nThan what do you hope at what point do you want to use the money where are you going to use it to buy a car when you turn sixteen or you know saving up for maybe are going to college like what what's the purpose of the money in your life some day\nWell I finally not touching it until I guess your college but I wasn't lady and a little bit and make it in the future to take her car or\nRight and the reason I asked that is that you would would do very well putting money into a fund and letting it grow enough on and there are a variety of them that I like where you can put money in a you mentioned a mutual fund\nYeah I like for you to look at something known as an index fund\nIndex fine because it's not traded a lot you can have an account and you don't have to worry about a lot of it being taxed while you have it in there\nFor a low the way that just gradually make some money\nThis is great now one idea I've talked about in the past\nMoney well this is great now one idea I've talked about in the past have you ever heard of a company called fidelity investments\nI have I don't know much about them but I\nKnow our fidelity has an account with zero minimum and zero fees and you can put your money and to find that owns a little tiny pieces are most U.S companies and you don't I guess stock in like three thousand U.S companies\nAnd then they have another one was the row fees zero minimum that puts money an international fund choices and you could go into a fidelity office you'll need someone who's an adult to go with you because they have to say what's known as custodian of it or you probably have a custodian\nIran right now have on that credit union account and you just go in there and they'll set that up for you know the thing about doing that kind of investing\nIs in the shorter term over the next several years you know the stock market goes down your potential in the short term show that you've lost money was a real money until you sell\nBut if it's money how much are you about leaving alone for eight to ten years to you're done with school that's a great time period for you to work at putting money in there and you can add to it over time the only bad side of any of this I should tell you\nIs that if you're going to go to college and apply for help for financial aid with college this money counts against you for that\nOkay\nI Can't tell you how excited I I'm your age you're doing this and the reason I specifically mentioned fidelity is to have these choices with no cost and they have actual real office as you go into and sit down with someone\nAnd having account there and have somebody you can talk to their and so it's a great way for you to learn and learn more\nBy having the place you can go and having the actual account\nSo as you go to LA you know someone ...\n... no I Want you to open the fidelity is zero index funds is what they're called ... zero and they'll when you walk in an office fill up signs everywhere for fidelity zero yeah so\nYou just tell them that's what you want and a ... I I Want to say to you I don't know if this came from inside you er visits come from your parents or wherever where you\nAre so into saving and then the idea of investing at fourteen years old but I for one am really proud of you you're listening to the Clark Howard show\n[noise]\n... you'll see one or earnings go up\nIf you've been caught um squeaking board marker\nEasily one of the most annoying office noises there is right up there with the woman who taps or Penn like she's doing a drum solo at a sold out arena [noise]\n\n\nRadio news hurricane Michael strength into a category three storm over the Gulf of Mexico\nOn Tuesday the storm is expected to hit Florida Panhandle sometime Tuesday National Hurricane center director ... on what scares him about this storm\nA couple things here so it's going to be oh window event for sure but at the same time you still have this heavy rain but there's something else I'm really worried about here when you look at those storms this is a very vulnerable part of the Gulf of Mexico when it comes to the storm surge and if you look at the same for the coast\nYou get these little areas that are safe like that the water just gets trapped and I can't go anywhere so the water piles up and the other part is right along the coast is very shallow so what happens is that water piles up really quick\nEight to twelve feet of inundation is just absolutely staggering\nA teenager and Oregon is suing McDonalds over hot water being served at an unreasonable dangerous temperature the teen is suing for one point six million dollars you're listening to us a radio news\nSwing into state line service entire Center for all your automotive service and repair needs conveniently located at twelve Oneida social street in one socket Rhode Island right on the Bellingham and Blackstone lined up and you can reach us at seven six five\nZero one for six books your appointment we perform all car and truck services such as breaks to exhaust suspension and diagnostic repair all services are handled expertly by our a as he certify technicians and delivered on time and that fair prices to\nProvide for we'll computerized alignment service and offer a hunter road for us we'll balancing to keep your eyes rolling smooth and straight Fisher to like us on Facebook\nTo see our service Centre and check out the special deals on the many tier brands we carried an entire rebate specials Facebook messages check daily state lies service entire center just two miles from highland park so call us at seven six five zero one for six to let us makes your automotive service experience a home run\nInternational Monetary fund is downgrading its outlook for the world economy and also America's here's usa radio networks Chris bars with the details\nRising interest rates in growing tensions over trade the IMF says the global economy will grow at three point seven percent this year\nIt'd be IMF says the global economy will grow at three point seven percent this year at the same as in twenty Seventeen but down from the three point nine percent that it was forecasting for twenty Eighteen in July the IMF expects the U.S economy to grow a two point nine percent this year the fastest pace of two thousand five\nAnd unchanged from his ... forecasts but that was predicting us growth will slow the two point five percent next year as the effect of recent tax cuts wears off and what it calls the Trump trade war with China takes its toll free usa radio news on Chris bars\nFormer New York democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner is scheduled to be released from prison May of two thousand Nineteen this is three months shy of him serving as full Twenty one month sentence you're listening to us a radio news the bottle\n[laughter] now is Sam ...
