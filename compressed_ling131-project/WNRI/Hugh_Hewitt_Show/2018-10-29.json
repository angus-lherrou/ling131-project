as trying to first then become a person all die or doesn't seem very accessible [laughter]\nThat's a beautiful understatement are you in the Denver metro area or where are you\nYeah exactly just right outside Denver\nSo in Denver it's become impossible for someone to middle class job to buy a home right now it's just the way it is and it's been very frustrating to people I read a story and the last few days I forget which\nI think it was in the Financial Times that did a story about how there are people and middle class professions in Denver they are actually choosing to move somewhere else in the country because they don't see any prospect I'll ever be able to own a home\nIn Denver at the kinds of salaries they make in a middle class kind of job it's\nTough I I I really don't know how people do it is you know we ate my wife and I we you know as a as a household we make well above the median income a site you know I I can only imagine for those people to make below the median income that what they're facing\nWhere you are one of the issues in Denver which is not just a Denver problem is in other areas as well is the cost of land acquisition for builders\nAnd then the costs are permits the costs of hiring labor and the cost of material new homes are a out of sight and builders because of the base costs they have for ... and things like that they only want to build larger more expensive homes\nTo try to make any profit out of the deal so you really have to you and your wife really have to concentrate if you want to go ahead and buy now\nOn used homes but housing markets go in cycles and anybody who's been in Colorado where Utah for a long time knows the swings that have occurred in both states where the real estate going on a pendulum\nOf extremely high demand followed by a wave of soft demand\nDo you think you and your wife have a little patience and you are do you want to go ahead and pull the trigger now and getting [laughter]\nWell we definitely I don't have patience outlook on work a long term and that's kind of relate to what my question was is I'm curious about is you know for for folks who by during when it's you know the the market's really hot\nUm are they more often than people who buy in a in a buyer's market you know just long term because\nYou know for for a second home no matter when we do as a second home you know housing values are going to be up or down but if if we jumped in when things are very hot um I Would just wander is long term um\nThat would impact the finances of a negative way\nFill the way you make that test is by comparing the cost of renting today versus what your effective cost of homeownership would be today\nIf when you take the costs of the mortgage taxes and insurance and add those together if they are more than twenty percent higher than what you can rent today your best off waiting a while before you buy\nIf you can buy a place at a margin that is less than twenty percent higher\nFor current cost of mortgage Saxon insurance versus rent then particularly if you're going to own a property for a significant number of years which in an overheated market like the Denver metro area you want to look at a ownership window of ten years\nYou're comfortable in owning a house for ten years and you can buy a within that that price window I'm Talking about no more than twenty percent higher effective cost per month in rent and go ahead and buy\nOtherwise I had my way for a down cycle and they always come\nOn I think I'm gonna late [laughter] I think our focus is going to be or just you know stick it out in the apartment and pay 'em as much towards my student loans as possible for\nThat is a very effective strategy you know a lot of people don't feel like they've really settled down\nIf they're reading instead of owning but that is something that is in some sense psychological and if you can get your financial house better and order and getting rid of student loans is a great thing to do and rent and let the market find a new record every him I Would do just that\nJames is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi James\n... ... ... it's\nGreat to have you here James you are a little muffled sounding right now about\n... sorry about that is a little bit if that is better\n[noise] okay my question for you is all of the fortune one home that they had been contributing to a traditional four one K. or at seven in his show years\nFall early contributed a eleven percent ... company match\nAnd Jeff fish ... ah they had advised that they're going to start off in a while for one day\nSo I'm kind of half way and semi retired and shape of attribution is I'm going to be contributing mother's Seventy eight years give or take on its own should switch all\nWhich would be more beneficial to me\nLove the idea of you having done a traditional four one K. all these years moving forward doing the raw four one K. because whether it'll give you an retirement and your company match that six percent of the company matches\nWill still be pre tax money even if you do the Roth four one K. moving forward\nCritic but having a pile of money that's pre tax pile and a pile of money that's after tax file which the Roth becomes\nIs extremely helpful in retirement to make sure that you harvest money is you need it from what would be the most efficient at that time in that year also we have a really good shot\nThe tax rates are going to be higher in the future than they are now\nAnd that would make it a potentially better idea to do a raw four one K. instead of traditional moving forward but there is an exception\nInstead of traditional moving forward but there is an exception and discuss whether you whether you're an exception you get if you're making huge money and your job then you want to do the traditional because if you're an extremely high income earner the odds are\nBetter that you're in a higher tax bracket working then you'll be in retirement but\nI Would say if you're a very small percent of people were being this territory um are you single or married married to both of you work\n... right if your income is north of a quarter million dollars a year then you'd want to do the traditional ate there so that has that so yeah so you're at one twenty five family income\nI Would do the raw four one K. moving forward and if you can hang it up ... percent because remember you're going to have to use after tax dollars instead of before tax now have you can keep your contribution and eleven you'll actually effectively be significantly boosting\nWhat you're saving for retirement age and\nSo that would be a wonderful strategy all these years of pre tax all of the future years a mix of pre tax imposed tax employer pre tax dollars posed tax that's really good you're listening to the Clark Howard show\n[noise] [noise]\nThey sing songs you about living life you're dying but the truth is no one wants to really think about dying or buying life
