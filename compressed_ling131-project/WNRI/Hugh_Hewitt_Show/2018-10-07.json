a little ticket at said attached to the bag of shrimp and calling manager or and so the manager came over and a U.S but you know what this could possibly be and she said we really don't know we all we looked at the expiration date or wasn't expired didn't expire till next year\nI'm In and I said well you know maybe there was some kind of recall a and the manager said you know that that's entirely possible or the you know at this point we don't know so I've looked since then to see if there was a recall on any kind of frozen shrimp in there hadn't been wanting a couple of years\nI'm ... is that maybe there's a recall in process um and it just hasn't been announced yet but they would not let us buy that bag a shrimp\nBad is fascinating and it's a mystery maybe will unfold over time but that is the kind of thing that's coming is that we will before we can get out at the store\nThere will be items that are still on the shelf that have already been identified as being a risk for whatever reason and before that item could end up at home you watching football and suddenly not feeling so hot\n'cause not cause your team lost but because it was shrimp or or or like a sack in your life or you got sack for big\nBig loss anyway you'd never had that happen\nNo and and you know I I think the manager out as I said you know I'm Glad this happened when and I didn't end up exactly where where you are talking about Clark\nWell the good thing is that whatever the issue was shrimp it didn't happen to you and the fact that we're going to have more and more circumstances where we don't have to worry about as much the safety of the food we eat that's nothing but for the good\nThank you very much and thanks for having Brian's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Brian\nHi thought great thank you Brian how can I be around you\nAll the glitz and about ... fly home on it and they do and I still\nI I live in the Senate\nAnd the and is planning on doing the bulk of Internet and on the out all all of that day I thought I thought it looked like a little clip about nine dollars a month or the ice and the Internet\nAnd television and um they signed the dynamic than the fact that there\nIs no way no yeah [noise]\nSo the association are you in a mandatory association community\nYeah wow\nSo the the board of directors wants to sign a ten year\nFiber optic agreement they would stick current and future residents owners with an obligation that we'd go till twenty twenty eight or twenty twenty nine\nBut I Would never do that never what kind of penalty is there if you know the market is changing so fast right now\nI think that like\nWhat kind of penalty is there a break penalty or break the ... the association would have to pay if waiter or the president said a new board says this is a terrible idea we gotta cancel this thing do you know what the break for years or I mean I Do\nNot up to life than\nRight so how far along the border they canvassing homeowners to see I feel about\nIt online and um they let it took a look that way I got to go all the way\nLately and the other part that all the all ... like I had a contract is not as I Know that is a is there like that and and actually had that they they do like the fiber optic\nUm they claim that\nWell you know they're they're doing that survey that's not really if it's filled the bullet and I'm only thirty five percent of the ... sign up for that so they\nAll right well I went on to what I Do fast as you possibly can this is gonna sound so analog but I Would go print up as many yard signs as you can and have people put signs in the yard note of fiber\nAnd and have a citizen uprising\nAnd in my feeling is that there's a big fan of that because there's only a\nNo no no no and if Iran let me tell you something there's not a chance this is a bad idea it's this is a bad idea at a\nTime of rapid technological change\nIt is a major error to enter into a decade long agreement for technology like Internet and TV that is I mean when you look how much things have changed in the last year\nWith all the people cutting the cord across the country that all the experts said would not happen for years and years and years and years and years\nThis is a rotten idea and you need to stir up the membership and get people up in arms before it may be harms people's ability to sell their properties down the road\nRotten idea the sport especially doing a survey and going against people's wishes\nWhat are they thinking\nCarolyn with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Caroline\nHi Clark thanks for taking my

lifestyle purchase\nAnd they can afford it and it makes them happy and it just means that um they they don't have as much money potentially to give to charity later to their kids or whatever\nAnd they're comfortable spending that is a lifestyle spend\nThey can do it but as if you asked me the dollars and cents of it I mean it's a terrible you some money\n[laughter] yeah my sister and I are
