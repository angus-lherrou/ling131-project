business classes all the accounting classes at all I have left are about twelve or so credits so you know the standard math and English that those other stuff\nThat I've been taking a one to two classes per semester I took a break the last two semesters um and I actually ended up paying off a little bit of students that I have learned that association last year\nSo you're working full time squeezing out around that picking up courses to get ... is this going to be a bachelor's you're getting an accounting\nOr actually starting that associates and hopefully change very\nVery good All right that's great how can I be of service cars you picked a great field\nOh well you know I'm working full time work six days a week or during the summer when we're almost sixty hours per week and um I work at a motorcycle shop that I Would say oh I Do enjoy what I Do but uh there's not a whole lot of room for an answer that true or a a ... in a job\nSo I'm kind of the I'm thirty eight years old and I'm Wondering if I should show which my major to something a little more practical the technical uh awfully\nWell I mean there's ... there's a great field for you to transition into\n... you're talking about getting an associates an accounting right yeah that's a that's a wonderful field that I wouldn't switch gears on that if you finish the associates and so you said your twelve credit hours away so he\nIs each course three credit hours that how the math work so you have more to go like\nSo you get the more and more courses done and you've been going to\nTake that accounting degree and go get a job in that and leave the motorcycle shop is that the\nThat that is what I'm planning on 'em that effect\nNow I'm just not sure what jobs are available as far as the accounting\nWould I Would do is I Would call one of the owners of a local CPA okay yeah I thought about that\nAnd go sit down with the owners they're always looking for people to work doing accounting or various levels of bookkeeping and to go in and talk to one for advice is the first path to you and finding a place that may ultimately employee you\nConsider doing that I didn't know if that was yeah\nCome on what I'm going to a hundred percent\nBecca people love being asked for advice they generally don't like being asked for a job there so I think that what you worked so hard to achieve complete\nJet that accounting degree get into that as a field and then see if you if you want to then go on while you're doing that and get a bachelor's an accounting go ahead if you decide after a while why did I think this is what I wanted to do then maybe you take your career path a different way but\nI think he picked a great field it takes a special person to work sixty hours a week and go to school you are that person you're listening to the Clark Howard show\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nThis is John Green and if your teeth are staying some coffee tea or smoking power swabs is the answer in five

minutes and you're done to try power swabs call one eight hundred six seven nine o nine six night\nBut your windows your utilization of credit cards in order to get the very best interest rate on a mortgage needs to be below ten percent that means and simple math view of ten thousand dollars available credit on credit cards\nYou want to charge on them in a month less than one thousand dollars or manipulate the score\nBy sending in payments to your credit card company before your billing cycle closes so that you're essentially pre paying that much balance before it would generate\nAnd that can move your score big time or\nThe other huge chunk of what makes up your credit score is paying your bills on time every month and if you have had a problem with that\nThat's not easily heal that one take some ... significant time but if you\nAre\nGoing for a home and mortgage\nAt least four months out I Need you to get copies of all three of your credit reports and do that an annual credit report dot com completely free\nAnd look for any note pays or white pays but particularly no pay an unpaid balance most of the time it will be for some medical thing you didn't even know your money on and you want to take care of those\nBecause that is an important factor in underwriting\nBut remember the most important factor\nIn terms of getting a quick jump on that score stop using your credit cards Jennifer joins us on the Clark Howard show Hello Jennifer\nHi Hal\nI'm doing great thank you and you have\nA mortgage\nFor\nSo tell me or you just starting a mortgage are you in it and they're offering you a bi weekly\nI came here and I get\nOut of oh I think it is that right and I thought if I go back to ... ... they're not offering any housing and\nOkay so what are they gonna charge you to go from paying your mortgage monthly they're paying a bi weekly\nFat fat for for for free really\nThat's why I asked her how how how do I [noise]\nI hit like that uh [noise]\nWell that is a great question and there are a number of programs\nWhere you can pay your mortgage bi weekly but it is not it it's not really doing what you think because they do just what you said you pay the money to them half a monthly mortgage payment every other week\nAnd then by the end of the year you made the equivalent of one extra payments since there's\nFifty two weeks a year you've made twenty six half payments are Thirteen full payments and I am looking at the\nWebsite of its Quicken Loans is who you're mortgages with All right and they say free and simple other companies charge a fee and they say it's completely free with no extra fees and when you make the payment\nVery explaining it gosh exactly like I Do that you've made an additional payment\nAnd they talk about the set up and all that it's the first time I've ever seen one\nThat allows you to do this once you have a loan in place completely free but it does not say and the explanation\nIf they're just holding your money for that whole year and then making the one additional payment for you at the end of the year so you're right to ask that question but I'm stunned because I don't recall anybody ever offering this as a freebie\nOkay\nYeah I mean if you if you if it works for you to get paid every other week\nNow\nOh well that works the same yeah so if you want to do this in ... years off you're alone and they're not going to charge you anything for it I think it's great\nBrian is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Brian cyclic REO great thank you Brian you did a good job you save money at your own job now I tried to well that's great how can I be of help with that\nWell I just recently started a new job and the previous employer and the current one boss have four one K. matches or they're managed by different companies and I'm Wondering what to do with my old four oh one K.\nAnd how much do you have in that old four one K.\nShift a little bit less than Seventy three thousand\nOkay that's great that's great can it can I ask how old you are Brian I'm forty six okay so you know you want that piled or grow and grow and grow\nSo they can have a point that you can retire and comfort in that retirement and building up that four one K. money is great your new employer the match they have how do they do that one\nUh it's just a direct eight percent that they put in\nNo way so you put in money and they'll pop in another eight percent\nI don't have to put in any I Do but they they will put in eight percent wow\nI'm In the wrong business in whatever business you're a that's a very generous you know yes so\nThe question on the old plan since the amount of money you have in it it is ...\nThe question on the old plan since the amount of money you have in it is completely your choice\nIf you will have the money there or you move it to the new employer and the way I'd decide is it the old employer plan is a one of the ultra low cost four one K. plans\nBecause I Would leave but money behind on the other hand if you're a new employer has an ultra low cost four one K. plan then it would make a lot of sense to move the money\nAnd they're both plans are kind of\nEqual and cost then you could either move the money to the new plan or put it in your own IRA but do you have any information on the kind of cost structure that you have with either the plans\nI Do not I don't know that\nSo that would be chief for you and making a decision because over time over the next Twenty years till you hit the key to retire or mid forties when most people retire mid sixties but costs and the plan\nHave a massive effect on how much money you actually end up with it the end of the day okay so the the lowest cost plans in America are offered by one company in that span guard\nAnd so if either of your plans or vanguard then you'd want to operate based on the fact of the band guard plan of your old plan was vanguard plan where you put money behind if you're a new plan is a vanguard plan than you'd want to move the old employer money\nFrom the old employer into the new importer vanguard plan if it's not vanguard then you've got to go a step further and dig in\nAnd see what the costs to actually are and are just for frame of reference\nHow many people work for the company you're working for now\nThe fortune five hundred company\nOkay so the costs on the plan all and should be less than one half of one percent\nOkay and it is managed by my new company and\nSo then if it is a vanguard plan to move the money from the old plan roll it over into the new company plant okay and your senses are vanguard plan you don't even have to worry what the expenses\nAre going to be because I'll tell you they're going to be ...\nOkay either experience recently Brian I was at a gate for an airplane that was delayed and one of the airline employees came up to me to ask me a question about do four one K. so that delay of the white\nGave the time for the airline unemployed asked me about the plan and I had him pull it up on the computer and this huge airline is giving its employees a terrible\nFour O. one K. plan terrible with very high costs and the only thing I could figure is maybe the airline does a lot of it's hum\nA debt placements and a stock issue in since and by ... through that same companies so they feel like they have to throw their four one Kay business to them and rip off the employees\nBut there's absolutely no excuse for a giant employer like an airline to offer its employees up ... terrible rotten four O. one K. that's just bad is malpractice on the part of that employer you're listening to the Clark Howard show\nI Know you've been very busy you're working very hard and if anybody has any doubts if this guy as the energy to be the mayor the city of

Scott Tucker [noise]\nLast\nFriday Clark ...

than half a billion dollars as being paid back to people and\nThis gentleman is going to prison for a number of years re allegedly I Can't say a wide joy\nThey stole two billion dollars from four million Americans and an illegal payday loan scam\nAnd he's now serving a sixteen year prison sentence\nBut the illegal loans were being issued under a number of brands\nAm gee services five hundred fast cash advantage care services marrow alone one quick cash star cash processing United cash loans and us fast cash so\nBelieve it or not to your last known address refund checks\nAre being mailed by the fed and there's going to be over a million refund checks mailed out to people that will not\nConstitute for restitution but it will be partial restitution to people who had money stolen from them in this payday loan scam most important thing for you to know even a legal payday loan\nIs a recipe for financial disaster in your life paying four hundred eight hundred percent interest is never a way to get financially healthy and I know desperate times sometimes bring people to desperate actions are payday loan\nIs never a good choice you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nDiabetes high blood pressure high anxiety meds everyone's on them if Europe fifty year old male maybe it would be for your even with type two diabetes a million dollars of term insurance my only cost you about two hundred bucks a month of\nPortable ... life insurance is out there called term provider and speak with big blue and eight hundred board one fourteen fifty eight eight hundred for a one fourteen fifty eight or is it big lewd dot com\nHey independence my bachelor's degree I think I tried every and I just don't have any more option that I was like I Can't get any financial aid because my dad took out the lump sum when he retired he looks like soap making more than he actually is and they refused to sign on the line with me\nAnd they didn't give me any financial aid um they only offered me sixty nine hundred dollars and she didn't want any hair\nI'm In my tuition and twenty eight thousand dollars\nAnd when a guy there twenty eight is that a state school at twenty eight or is that a private university at twenty eight\nIt's out of state uh\nOkay so are you thinking about dropping out or something\nUm I think ...\nAbout dropping out or something\nWell I'm I was thinking about how they associate that then this semester I was thinking about going fulltime working fulltime and then trying to go to school part time right now I work ... hours a week in retail and I have to take classes lot ... than in this semester um\nWhat an ambitious person you are [noise] they're a person after\nMy own heart you know I went to college at night and work full time during the day for most of\nAll I think my dad for my work ethic\nWell that's great and that's going to serve you well you know be true beating your head against the wall and out of state school paying tuition at twenty eight grand a year\nWere you consider going back to where you're from in doing your junior and senior year in in state tuition state school\nWell if I go in a long time if it's an eighth of I go back to an eight in Mississippi and said it's still around twenty thousand dollars for me if I were to go to a state school really\nKnow why I got a New York now that you can really loud because it said public university um so I stay here at the same as I said what the cause\nOf Mississippi State university for Mississippi residents is tuition of twenty eight\nThousand dollars that's crazy high I think if they're on twenty four but still I mean it's the same ballpark right\nSo have you made friends with the uh financial aid director at the school you're going to\nI haven't but I've been to the financial aid office and I talked to my academic advising several times and see if there were any other option for me and my school doesn't offer a whole lot and scholarships and that's the only what you mean and sixty five dollars and financial aid\nThat's why I wanted to go I Want to do two things I Want you to meet with the dean of the department that you're getting your degree on the you're planning to get your your bachelors in okay because you never know what things the dean seeing what kind of work ethic you have\nSerious yours a student\nThere maybe who knows it may be some a part time work you can do for the faculty there may be things if you get to know the head of financial aid and instead of talking to the people you go into the office gets tossed they had a financial aid advocate for yourself\nYou know you're a you're more able to advocate for yourself\nTwo years and then you would have been as a new freshmen on campus\nOkay and you tell them you know here's what I'm doing I took six classes last term I'm taken seven I'm working thirty hours a week and beating my head against a wall trying to pay for this I don't want to drop out what can we do\nOkay and you never know what doors might open particularly with the dean or department had what is your degree going to be an\nAdvertising marketing communication so you know how to advocate for yourself you market for yourself you have a well okay and what is it that you hope to do with that when you finish school\nUm I Would ideally like to work for a marketing than working to connect friends with them and say\nOkay what about I'm going to meet the people who recruit students for the school\nThe admissions counselors\nOkay\nThe reason I'm thinking about they live a marketing challenge every single day\nI'm going to cause as a state school they're trying to improve the um was how selective the school can be the caliber of the students that come and if you've got bad interest in that kind of skill area maybe there's things you can do and the admissions office\nOkay I'm just trying to throw I'm trying to brainstorm whether you every possible way that you can stay in school with this tremendous work ethic you have\nThank you for your health and really trying every option I have started up on me and I didn't really work and I didn't fly for over fifty scholarships not fashioning here I think and I only heard back from two which is about five hundred dollars into um than I'm really trying [laughter]\nNo I hear it I hear it and that's why I'm trying to noodle through with the new ideas because who knows there may be a professor\nIn the marketing department who's doing a a um a marketing plan for a business needs an assistant doing research or writing the plan and then he got really\nMatter of fact they said they all had an article you had that ten year that that can experience to teach scared though there are all working in the industry as well and um I think I'm confident that would definitely be an option\nBecause especially you know you said you're working as a waitress right now or he said working retail I forget what you said in retail retail so much better it would be if you were working in in the field that you're studying on\nAnd one of the professors it's in the thick of it could potentially get you hooked up to do that kind of thing\nYeah I just apply ... paid internships in the city um and actually that the interview coming up their nose and though there with marketing term in office doing the work instead of just a retail job\nYeah and again the professors are the ones that can help you get wired for those kinds of things and create the possibilities for you people hire people not applications so let me hear back from you how you do Kelly I have faith in you\nKnow you're going to make this work for yourself\nDoug is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Doug\nO'clock that's talk with you\nWell great to have you here Doug you have an idea you want to share is that right\n[noise] yeah um yeah talking about credit unions on a credit officer at acreage year and a wonder if they let the very frequently which really irks me up and get her to as people whose credit has been really damage but they uh twenty five dollar medical collect and I've seen that really impact people's scores by the hundred points to four\nAnd a lot of us are not even aware of it but my idea is that collection companies and businesses before they would polity derogatory a collection of information on on account of data and required because it's like a thirty day heads up\nOn the credit record for the people that at least monitor their credit report could see that\nWith a lotta times better than the notice a snake it's backed out the wrong address or whatever the latest hurt folks that are monitoring their credit they might say that it up and that if you look at a record company item\nIf somebody has a medical collection that they pay off it essentially wipe the slate clean\nWhat once it's paid off right and they'll say like in the process of going through all that ... clear that off of I mean it's going to go up for our application I've got a bad time to find out that the the thought that if you weren't aware of\nAnd I've got a bad on the on the book that if you are aware of\nIsn't it terrible and do you know that um I've heard and you would be better able to reflect this bit roughly half of collections on credit reports or medical\nIt wouldn't even higher in the numbers a lot you know on the older ... and and the balance there usually fairly low there are a lot of the under a hundred dollars\nWell it's because their balance bills you know somebody goes somewhere they pay their co pay they think they're done and then some kind of stray weird balance bill is generated that has never sent to the uninsured and then before you know it it ends up in collection\nRight you know just care that you are earning about ... or things how many companies to be able to tell us the upper\nThigh give their notification before an item goes on the report\nWas on the report and set up through the mail or if I'm In my email\nSo this came up with you know we do a message board called Clark stinks I don't know if you're familiar with that is where when people are unhappy with me they posed what they're unhappy about\nAnd we had an office manager from a radiology practice who had posted when I was complaining about the medical collection items and what she said and our court stinks was that they don't even know\nHow to find the the person who has a bill for the radiology is reading and so they don't have any other way of getting their money other than turning it over to a collection agency then goes out and tries to find the person who I was the money", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "city": "Woonsocket", "day": "12"}
