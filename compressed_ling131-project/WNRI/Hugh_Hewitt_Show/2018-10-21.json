Chuck\n...\nHow's it going not bad not bad at all how can I be of service the you know\nWell over this the last ... or a little bit longer up and get offers from companies that are interested in buying my house you know they're pretty persistent and so I just that let me\nLook them up and see what they were all about but uh I haven't really been able to find out much about them so I guess my thought is I'm a ... number choose um if they all legit today you know do a\nA little law offer on your property and blood out of the dangers order risk in in going forward with one of these folks yeah and I'm I'm just doing it primarily right now for\nEducation to learn what they were about what their business model is like so that I can like uninformed decision\nRight so the the people who are approaching here's your house a house in good condition and I are established neighborhood\nYes it is so go ahead and name who it is who is on your radar is there any particular company that you're curious about\nUm one of them all of a a thing goes by name open door\nAh I've addressed open door on the air and let me explain to you what this is about there are a number of companies that are sabotaging and they're racing to establish the city after city in the country\nWhere for um [noise]\nI guess you could refer to his mid priced homes in a market there's enough inventory where they feel like they can figure out what is a fair value for your home [noise] so what these people do is they guarantee lie in the case of open door and\nIts competitors they guarantee you that they'll they'll evaluate your home they may come in and they'll do that on line they may come in and do an inspection\nAnd then they will make a firm offered to you to buy a home and then with the idea being that you've vacate really quickly typically within a month can be quicker but\nThey just buy it then they charge you roughly the equivalent of a real estate commission to do what they charge you about six percent\nOf all I'd say just for argument's sake they said the house was worth\nTwo hundred thousand they would pay you like one eighty eight somewhere in there and you're out and you're just going so the question with any of them oh and the reason they do that\nIs they believe that they develop systems open during his competitors leave they develop systems\nWhere they can properly price of house get it I'm dressed up however they need to end the landscaping or inside\nAnd get it sold quicker than you can when you going to a traditional real estate agent and having them market the traditional way whether or not these things are going to stand the test of time\nThe market will decide for what you get out of it is here just dont know if you like the price they offer you ma'am you're out\nNo questions no ifs you know you're done\nYou don't have to worry about showing the house or anything like that\nI see okay\nAnd you also have to decide the price that you were offered [noise]\nDo you think they're low balling you or do you feel like it's really a decent offered they're making for your house\nAll day does that make ... yes\nYes it does I just wanted to have an idea what they're about whether or not you know they were\nTotally totally legit no doubt that this is a a a real thing\nThe company's doing this I think another one is offer pat\nI think is another one and there's another one called knock\nAnd so with these companies they're learning how to price they're learning how to market their learning how to sell\nAnd then they add cities around the country very heavy emphasis\nOn the south south west and west and the reason those areas because those are areas of the country that developed along the automobile have a lot of suburban housing a lot of ... a a subdivisions and developments built with very similar\nHousing plans and looks so they can more accurately price to house they're not interested\nAnd really high end houses 'cause they don't know exactly how to price them and how easily they'll sell and they're not interested in the houses that tend to be in neighborhoods let's say there in transition that maybe had been rough neighborhoods trying to get better or something like that\nBut it is the real deal and Tom is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Tom\nHi how're you doing stuff that\nCorporate thank you Tom how can I beat him service\nOut here and a half ago I got us listening to the mail for a credit card from a small business and I stopped\nWell about a year and a half ago I got us list I said the mail for a credit card from a small business and I thought\nWell let me go and sign up for this because I never have a backup card Kay she made it\nSo I I when I got the car's starting using that because it actually had a better cash that war than the one I was using previously so that when we go along fine\nOne afternoon I got an email from the credit card companies saying well we've got your address change which obviously was a mine so I called them ... card know sent me a new one the whole smear\nAt that point to sue the cart into the two lifestyle and started using my original art at the end\nAnd at last September last September I got the same message from the credit card company so I called them\nThey went to the old and so they sent me a new card and then it happened again and all over ... times it's happened to spend a different addressed of a male and the new car too\nSo I talked to the company and they sent me on the front of the ... the whole thing I did ask him I said no other cards I have off for a second level security worried and they would ask you a question like you know who's your favorite rock group or a ... year old ...\nWho is your art rock group called the purple okay now I Know the code to get any of your\nCredit [laughter] I'm not that one [laughter] okay [laughter]\nThis or that offer that said that they they they gave me some language skills to say well people can guess that well maybe not but it's still should be a level of security they should offer\nLike there's an issue though that I Need to point out to you the reason the current issue or may not care as much with a business credit card\nIs business credit cards don't enjoy the consumer protections\nThat a consumer card does under pre existing law and the card act was passed after the banking scandals\nSo the Congress carved out exception to consumer protections for business cards so as an example let's say a criminal did run up a lot of charges on your car and if they were successful you are able to take it over and run up charges\nTheir credit card company with a business card can say oh well\nWe don't think that you Tom took good precautions\nAnd so we're going to hold you liable for the charges are way down which they cannot do want to consumer car so I don't like even if you're using a card for business purposes I like for you to get a consumer card\nAnd just use it in your business and pay for it from your business [noise]\nOkay so is it best course of action and that is just because they have this account close even\nIf you've been hit three times by people attempting to take over the account and divert the bills so that you don't know that false charges are being made\nI Would say three strikes and they're out okay somebody has somehow figured out how to crack in on your particular card and who knows how many others\nAnd I don't want you vulnerable since you don't have the normal slate of consumer protections you can get any consumer card and just as a practical matter pay for it from your business\nIs also the Carter needs to be in the business and them\nNo oh you're liable anyway you know when you get a business card\nYou know the ... one of the things you've signed as the her personally liable regardless so they always pierce the corporate veil sir you the companies responsible and you're responsible so it's actually yell barrier to consumer card in virtually every aspect\nNot just for lunch breakfast and dinner menu to open daily at nine thirty Sundays at eleven friday and Saturday nights open late too old to a a shortage like on New

talking about and with that let us welcome a doctor Amy Sarah and to the program good day to you Dr Sarah\n...\nA ... let's get right into the topic here you know we have discussed the topic of stress on this radio show many times and our audience is well aware\nThat stress is insidious and it's pervasive\nAnd Seventy to eighty per\nCent I read this correct me if I'm wrong Dr ... here in the business of it\nSeventy to eighty percent of all doctor visits have some level of stress component associated with it whether to hang Naylor a headache or anything in between most people going into a doctor's office don't realize that the stress they're under physically mentally emotionally spiritually\nIs driving their health downward in a spin and they just don't know how to get out of it in your body may be expressing it in a certain way but there is that underlying simmering stress component that they're so\nAt this topic is ... you know well misunderstood in our society and how to treat it can you explain\nYou know a little bit about it and what your approach would be\nYeah it is true when we think about all these ailments and everything that people are suffering with even a lack of sleep or ethical issue we often don't\nLook at the culprit extracted inflammatory to our bodies and any time we're in a key state of the trap that mean in the ... we may not even realize it\nBut it's chapter eating habits on our house\nTrying really misunderstood and waves are managing it are very very old ways and we know they don't work because men at your body get stressed out and your brain and track even if you don't know what your body in plain\nUm there's all kinds of profit that happening inside of it and what happened here thinking brain actually start shut down hill it really doesn't make sense that we're telling people to you know stop try to take deep breaths we can take deep breaths and moments that we're not ... but it's\nIt take deep breaths we can take deep breaths and moments that were not stress but immediately when we have the strength which go on in our bodies all of our thinking and our ability to try to control it actually goes out the window fortunately ... science\nCan actually help divert the body's stress response and real time and that was part of my exciting discovery\nI don't I Would be happy if it were just that where people were told to take a deep breath but that's not what happens people are told to take a pill is what they're told her to take a call me down and well true too\nYeah and um and you know we really don't want to invade the body with anything that's going to have side effects we always want to go to you know natural fast acting solution before we do that\nUm we get a lot of people in our clinics that are on pills for anxiety and fortunately we're effectively able to get them off with some of these other methods one of them being attach point\nWell our goal here on the show is to point out to people look okay so you've got stress or whatever that origin came from you know what you made that you created that between your ears it's the perception of stresses the reality that goes on between here\nA real or otherwise and you know what you can on created did you know that and so we try to impart that\nSo that we tell people that if you can create it you can unwind to you just haven't been given permission or you haven't been given the tools or you haven't been getting the instruction of it and that's essentially I guess what you're trying to do as well correct\nYeah you know people with their the difference between stressors and stress stressors are the things that are happening outside of me and then strength as my body's reaction to it and sometimes just our belief systems are a problem people thinking well you know if I got to see on a test I must be upset about it\nBut somebody else gets to see on a test and they are expecting an F\nThey might be quite happy about it stretches your personal intimate response\nTo whatever's happening around you or whatever you're thinking so if you change the overall quality of your thoughts your stress levels in general will go down but none of us are immune to fluctuations in stress an editor a moment and and that's why I called the strength which because what's happening is loud sound or a district serving thought\nOr being reminded of something in your life that isn't going well all of this thing can set the stress switch off and it's actually not a conscious network that's doing this\nThe networks in your brain that are controlling it are very very hard wired primitive network that we are not in conscious control up until it doesn't make sense for us to and every moment try to consciously control that\nThis is why the narrow science tech technology in touch points is actually going to defend that stress which down for you as you go about your day you don't actually even need to stop what you're doing and certainly you should stop what you're doing and sometimes and do healthy behaviors and have a base\nOf healthy behaviors like good sleep and exercise and nutrition but on top of that\nWe are so stressed out as a culture that we need a go to and you can use this technology to be here go to an any moment that you're experiencing\nTrashed and well those are you've dealt with a lot of people and you know do you think our society today let's say versus ten years ago or Twenty years ago is more stress than ever\nAre citing is very stressed out the American Psychological Association polls are very clear and we actually have a database of over ten thousand individuals and we're tracking their stress and we're finding that over fifty percent of Americans are overwhelmed with stress\nAnd there's some other interesting findings and teens teens are actually more likely to be angry or very un focused when they're stressed out and do you want to know the most stressed out group in America\nWhen an age of thirty five to forty four and that makes sense to me you know they're running families any of them have career he want to know the least stressed out\nGroup in America is good\nNews for you Dr bobbitt men he does the sex and above or the leaf stressed\nOut hey wait a minute I just turned forty six the other day ... well not really but\nAll right I'm a I'm going to have you know I'm going to have you hold your thought right there Dr Sayre and when we come back I Want to get into the air you mention touch points I Want to talk about this amazing wearable technology and how that could help our little\nOur response distress were not taught how to deal with that were growing up we just overreact to it mostly and then wonder how to get out of it and a lot of people died just sharing let's face it use everything from alcohol to cigarettes to marijuana illicit listed drugs to de stress or on wind\nSo described to the audience looking at the device the touch points device what it looks like and what they would expect should they attempt to reduce their stress by Seventy percent and who wouldn't want that in thirty seconds everybody has stress\nPoints are two devices and in order\nYeah go the extra points are two devices and in order to divert the bodies treasury bonds one needs to be worn on each side of the body so they how much risk than than their small square they look sort of like an apple watch and you can wear them on your rent in your pocket and your stack\n'em or even hold them in your hand and they work very quickly some people just put them in their hand and then when they feel better they turn them off\nAnd they think are night with each other that they're they're written that air to them to the the gentle vibration and this is
