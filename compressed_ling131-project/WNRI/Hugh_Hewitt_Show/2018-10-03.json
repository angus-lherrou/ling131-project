him\nWell he is probably wondering ... ... ... ... and why and ask about that but I also heard that they do something else to charge that\nYes for people that are self employed no employees a hot ticket right now is what's known as a solo four O. one K. or a self employed four one K.\nK. it allows him as a one person energy\nTo have an ultra low cost plan like he worked for a fortune five hundred company right it's the weirdest thing but one person company gets a better four O. one K. than a two hundred person company ... his change\nSo it's because for the cello we're self employed four one K. the rules were so streamlined that you can go\nTo any of my really low cost companies that I Love and open a self employed four one K. and use their absolute lowest cost investments\nTo go in that self employed four one K. and the limits are very high for the money and put in\nThe advantage of the ... though is there is no paperwork I mean it's like half a page and your husband in a year that things go really well can contribute roughly a quarter of his revenue to the south and the year that money's tight he doesn't have to contribute at all and it just instantly becomes\nThis up essentially becomes a regular IRA just with much more flexible and higher contribution limits\nAnd a cat on a fellow faraway chaotic put in\nA way of trying to remember is Eighteen thousand a year but somewhere up\nThere are okay All right and how it's going to show that White House or the other Kennedy got by well though\nOh is either either can be done with the robo investing already can't yeah it's just the robo investing organization would have to offer\nA self employed or or a solo four one K. okay okay so if you went to like Charles Schwab to do it with Charles Schwab has something called intelligent portfolios\nWhere I'm based on your husband's agents situation you pick a portfolio and they handle the mix of investing for you it's a a free version of robo investing\nOkay and he could do the self employed are so low four one K. and that might be a great option for 'em but either just doing either\nIs what's so outstanding either the solo four one K. or the south they're both winners\nCharles is with us on the Clark Howard show how Charles how are you doing\nJust fine how are you great thank you you're giving advice to a family member is that true or friend\nWell advice but also just hoping to make arrangements myself and stumbled into a challenge trying to\nHelp someone to get a rental car out of state um there's seems to be a few places where you can prepare for cars but and almost all cases they require you to present the card that you use to repay rental at the rental desk when you pick it up\nWe would see you're renting a car you're paying for it but somebody else is going to be driving the car and a whole another state\nRight trying to help an analog get to town of Christmas for example and just was\nYou're right and you're asking to climb a a hill that it's going to be very hard to climb [laughter] Sanders is not set up for that because of all the problems that they have with stolen cars\nRight and so all so you would be taking on an enormous liability risk\nIf you are a renter of record and someone else's an additional driver so the whole purpose of this is to get this individual to you is it cheaper than having them fly 'cause usually flying is cheaper\nWhen\nIt's when we're trying to to get several people now in children and and Christmas gifts from all of that so what car would probably be the easiest [noise] uh I don't know if it matters but I'm I was actually looking into renting it and their name with them being the rent or just trying to celebrate the transaction\nBut even in that case they have to present a card to the rental agency now the the way that I could think of so they have no credit card is that right\nThey do but we're just ... they don't have a lot of room on their cards so I mean if\nYou're trying to help 'em out you're going to pay for it right okay so that's how you do it\nRight so what you do is instead of trying to rent it on your card or anything like that\nYou make a pre payment on their credit card so that they go into a negative ballot so they have a room available on their credit limit right whatever they estimate of the rental is going to be and then they have the room on the ...\nRight whatever they estimate of the rental is going to be and then they have the room on the card to rent it with their cart gotcha and then you are women ate the liability risk that you're making my heart beat too fast [laughter]\nI understand well that's a good idea I should've thought of that but that's pretty straightforward\nAnd so you don't want to pay their credit card company too far in advance of when the rental is going to be because some credit card companies as we've had color say if you over pay or whatever that they\nThey send you a check for it but if you were like ten days out of work perfectly and allow the relative to rent a car\nTerrific well that that does sound like the flu shot appreciate well\nAll right well you have a great day and a great holiday to excellent book David with us on the Clark Howard show hello David Clarke how you doing great thank you you are a Nissan Leaf driver\nYes I Am actually and a great car so let me tell you the deal I bought it\nWhen they had a really good rebate on it and all that actually ... for two years coming up on the end of the lease I at this point the cars essentially cost me nothing because the government tax credits pretty much paid for the least aimed at this point so I I Want to buy the car\nOr the problem I'm having as it's worth on the open market probably seven thousand Seventy five hundred dollars and the residuals Fifteen thousand so cautious number one is I Would want to do was go to him and say I'll give you some thousand dollar\nExactly what it's called actually because they don't want your wife back\nSo you go to I mean you offer um market value and Nissan tells you to get lost that it's Fifteen thousand or nothing you say I'm going to get lost here's your car back and then leave says you've seen are widely available on the use vehicle market\nFor six to eight thousand dollars depending on the mileage and the year and the condition\nAnd you just turn around and and buy another one by used one\nRather than have one that you have known and driven for the two years it'd be better if you could buy the one you have David 'cause you know its history you're the one who created that history\nRight so that's the other side of it you always say when you buy used car do this checked out by a mechanic but where do you go to find a link mechanic there don't you don't do anything because you know there's there's simply no maintenance on electric\nCars are the only thing you would have a leaf checked out for as best I can tell is the remaining battery life you know that meter on the right hand side where show right field empty he'd want to check that and the other thing is you'd want\nHave it checked out by a body shop to see if it had been in Iraq other than that you'd be good to go as long as the the battery is not degraded too much and it hadn't been in Iraq\nJust a matter of which color leap you want to drive in by ultra cheap you're listening to the

Philip cutting the Senate loud when I left it was close to eighty thousand\nCongratulations\nOh thank you thank you so I'm I'm currently getting ready to get back into the job market and I kinda it didn't really know anything about that far away okay and protein that one year mark and I'm pretty sure that the one year my account on something like you\nDo not you don't do nothing so when you have that size of money and a four O. one K. and a former employer or you can leave it there forever if you wish\nRight but are they going to start charging fees\nOr no they charge you the same fees I charge you if you were employed there okay there's no difference in the wall discriminating against people that were former employees the law was changed\nAnd unless you have a very small remaining balance in four one K. in which case they would cash you out and voluntarily with the amount of money you have an eighty thousand you can stay in that play on forever or if you go to your new place of employment\nAnd congratulations on your new job by the way\nIf they have a great four one K. you can move the money from the old employer into the new employers four one K. if you wish okay you also have the option if you wish at some point you can move it from the old employer's plan\nInto your own IRA but it the old employer offers a low cost four one K.\nI wouldn't want you to leave the money there unless you're a new employer had to lower costs four one K.\nWell then I guess my question is how do I now let's say a low cost for a\nI have to tell you okay even as a former employee they have to tell you\nSay you can call the administrator you know when you're a statement it'll show when number\nThat you can call the administrator and say I need to know what I'm paying an administrative costs and investment fees for having the four o one K with you and you want those low cost four one K. plan all and will cost you less than one half of one percent\nOne K plan all and will cost you less than one half of one percent per year\nLeft and on half of one percent right okay\nSo uh that's the standard that you should judge the plan by and if the costs are higher than that then you start thinking hey this isn't so good and if it's above one percent all way on then it's a complete rip\nOkay then that's when you'd want to look potentially at one of my low cost choices that I have on my investment guide you could move your money too or if you're a new employer offers a low cost plan then you move the money but if you're older and poor how big a company where you will for those Fifteen Years\nGlobal company like ... and just over ... place\nSo that many employees it would be surprising if the costs you were paying were even as high as half a percent\nWell it's an embarrassing like ...

Gabriel and that we just passed yesterday the guardian angels\nSo our guardian angel a feast day was yesterday and\nSince I Am talking about my Halloween party on the twenty fifth that double mansion and having to go hundreds come in to do a real life goes on where you can win that went to talk about more later I decided to talk about the end of the fallen angel tonight so\nHe is the master of lies of course he is the angel that was closest to God before Michael even and who wants to be like God was thrown out of having for doing so and along with him\nMany of the angels followed who wanted to follow him and be his cohort\nAnd they were thrown down to earth from heaven to rule for a thousand years and of course Mary I'm other Mary is in charge and has one already God tells us and is in charge in well crushed to surf and had\nAnd all those fallen angels that came down with him and following him or some people believe that demons but others say no they're not those\nAnd there'll be a great time so I Hope people will come and it's only forty five for single and sixty five for couples and it includes um\nLike I said a lot of giveaways free reading hundred and fifty dollars cash prize to runner up cash prizes for best costumes are couples and single a lots of food to buffets regular food chocolate buffet it's gonna be an awesome night\nThat's that's so exciting that's a that's an awesome\nI knew it Harry Okie all kinds of good stuff\nYeah that sounds great fish I Can't wait for thank you say I'm going okay fake you haven't brought it to you too thank case power right by\nSo talking again about a loose suffer and fallen angels and one thing I wanted to say is that you know some people believe that um they can be possess and I mean although\nYou know deemed possession is kind of a weird topic in the u._s. um something that maybe we don't engage in too much on there are people who do believe in it um there are which doctors out there and ... and other people believe in this in the eastern kind of quick to recognize us and\nCall out even possession and spiritual activity um than in the west I mean Hindus obviously they attribute bad luck and the circumstances to demonic activity the Chinese they light bonfires ... and ... and sent spirits back to the land of the dead and Buddhist and Thailand keep a spirit house\nAnd in in their home and they leave food and water out to appease the spirits and in the west we tend to kind of reach for scientific rather than a supernatural explanation when we encounter the abnormal um\nBehavior or events that may happen in stone always a bad thing but it does kind of make possession when and if it happens like less recognizable sometimes chance of the people with\nWhom I mission seems um\nPeople like we'll go out I mean mission teams will go out and and have like\nSome strong beliefs about these things and try to help people like the Baptists um they have you know like those hailing Catholic masses and people will come out and tried to take out possession no take out demons from people so\nI mean it's important when you're around people like that and not to get too caught up but I mean it can happen I Believe it can happen\nAnd I just said on their self with the truth to call on the name of Jesus if you ever feel this way but not everyone believes and stuff but these\nFallen angels this is their job so loose suffer as the head one and he gives out and says what to do if you know anything about job and the Bible um he\nWas tormented so much she had everything he had money had family had land yet everything and he was so Tom mentioned God actually allowed him to be\nTormented by evil and by the uh demons and say and\nAnd he did regain everything bad and his faith saved him so people that do believe in us um\n[noise] evil and get good against evil and um\nIt's always a good idea to call in the name of Jesus\nEven if you're not Catholic Relief if you have something going on and so next week because I Am having this big Halloween party at the ball mansion ah on October twenty fasten doors open at six thirty I'd like to talk a little bit about what we're going to they're so hopefully if there's any\nUm goes or any demons or fallen angels they're they will be exercised by seven hills a ghost hunters paranormal researchers by the order of St Michael and the exercises so they will be there\nThat night and someone's going to win I'm a ghost center the mansion after hours from twelve to one thirty I got a least twelve to Fifteen people will be able to go\nSo a lot of people when and there's a hundred and eighty tickets\nThat you can purchase on line it's forty five first single and sixty five for a couple of like a St Louis and lots and lots of food lots of music karaoke all kinds of cool stuff and then go hunt of course and wanted to go centers will be held live next week to talk about that\nI'm In what they actually do and a lot of stories about I'm sure evil and demons and some possession and fallen angels in what they do to overcome them\nOn their travels so anybody that's interested please go onto event bright and buy a ticket and I will also be at the ... cost on hotel on the twenty six the next day reading for the witches ball as well\nSo these are evil\nFallen spirits that are under the sea ... rule will be along with him of course crushed by none other than mother Mary and she has full right over that\nAnd um she will crush the demon said it said in the Bible and we shall be set free from him so we have nothing really to fear but\nNot everybody believes an evil and if you don't believe in it and you had bad things happen um what do you attribute it to because I feel like they're really is\nBecause I feel like they're really is\nGood and evil and the world even if you don't acknowledge it it doesn't mean it's not there it's kind of like\nA protons and neutrons and Adams and oxygen I mean you can't see it but it doesn't mean it doesn't exist 'em and say indefinitely has this rule that says a thousand years in the Bible\nUm and then with the second coming of course there'll be this big battle with Michael on the angels and I'm a lot of people think we're in a time right now and of course they were thrown down to earth and a lot of people feel like well\nWe pay all the time for like heaven on earth and is that why the battles now was this big spiritual battle but what about how is it really a hell and who's going to go there and is there even purgatory um Catholics believe there's a place in between\nUm and some other religions I Believe too because they believe you go somewhere else and then you're reincarnated again\nI'm but these angels\nI'm always around doesn't matter if it's this lifetime or your hundred lifetime to torment [noise] um and to carry out stands wishes and to help him with his evil plan although we know that\nMother Mary is ultimately the one to defeat him and I ... a feud between the and the woman between the offspring in her as she is to crush I had bought out this line ambush at her heels nuts genesis three Fifteen [noise]\nSo she is definitely and the one to overcome so there's a beautiful prayer\nI found um on line and I just want to read this really quick I thought it was really beautiful so even if you don't believe in anything but you're having a hard time are you really feel plagued at all with any\nKind of fallen angels or spirits or demons or just having a really bad ... even um this is a really nice prayer its\nMajestic queen of having the mistress of the angels dial just received from God the power and commission to crush the head of ... and\nWe're far we humbly besieged for you to send for the legions of having the under the command they may seek out all evil spirits engage them everywhere in battle curb the in science and hold them back into the pit of hell\nWho was like on the God of good intend to mother that she'll ever be are hoping the object of our love a mother of godsend for the whole angels to defend me and drive\nFar from me and a cruel so holy angels an arc angels defend us and keep us and if you remember last week we talked a little bit about the\nGuardian angels which the feast of guardian angels just passed yesterday and how it's not such a good idea to try to find out the name of your guardian angel and there's a reason for that because when Louis suffer in the fall in angels and demons come in\nAnd they know who\nYou're guardian angel is and they know you know who you're cutting angel is by name they can trick you\nAnd use that against you and use that name so there are things that are too high it says for us to know and that is one of them the name of our guardian angels because\nThat is um one of the main reasons why we're not to go to that ruined to find out everything especially a name a lotta times says lots of passages in the Bible or\nThey have met angels and they asked in an angel wasn't able to say the name only certain angels are able to say that name that we know and that we can are allowed to call on them because they are the highest and actually I read a passage recently\nUm that not just Michael but actually gave Gabriel\nI'm is one of the ones we can call in and re field but Raphael namely is the one even above Michael who will be a big help and taking down stay in and his cohorts along with mother married I thought it was really interesting so ratio has a really big job and not to\nUm even\nAlmost more so than Michael which was really interesting so um\nI just wonder sometimes you know like you know what happens\nAfter we die and where we go and um you know things like here too while we're here on this earth plane like is there\nAnd once you hit that target whether it's in your thirties forties fifties sixties or never that's when you know you have enough money built up for the lifestyle you've grown accustomed to\nThat you can afford to live and definitely on the money you say and it I Know that's an oversimplification but it really is that simple as soon as he went on to say the power\nThat you need at least five or six million really you might need ten million dollars to retire securely and respectfully as strong\nTo retire securely and respectfully I strongly disagree with what Susan said there are people who easily\nCan get by for the rest of their lives when they hit the point they've saved a million dollars it means they're living a not a barebones lifestyle but they're living more careful frugal lifestyle\nBecause what you want to see one enough money saved\nThat you have invested that you can throw off enough cash to live on each year and the same time have the piled the stash you built up have enough in it that you can earn enough on it in the years following to cover the cost of inflation\nBut let's go to our core principle\nIf somebody is a Mac saver\nOr today a proponent of the FIRE movement and they say like a maniac can they get to a point and let's say in their mid thirties that they've saved enough money that they've created real financial security\nIt doesn't mean they don't ever work again it means they only do what they enjoy\nYou know I retired at thirty one and here I Am working now talking to you at sixty three and since I was thirty one I've only worked when I wanted to\nAnd doing what I enjoy because I had that financial security\nWhen I was thirty one so don't let somebody tell you oh you're never going to be able to retire 'til you have twenty million dollars\n[laughter] [laughter] oh boy [laughter] anyway no that you have to have a goal you have to have a target you have to be realistic about it and you have to live your life in a way that you will accomplish that\nYou know one of the things when a years ago my book living large and lean times came out and then the companion book came out later living large for the long haul\nAs I learned so much from people\nWho had adjusted their lives to live a more frugal life and to be in a position where they weren't living on borrowed money where they were always saving money and I was inspired by so many people and so many stories\nOf people that I talked to\nWho did change the direction of their lives and how they were living\nAnd created that independence and freedom in their lives so I don't want anybody tell you you can't do it it's up to you if it's important to you and it's just got to be something that you don't say you actually do\nJohn joins us on the Clark Howard show Hi John\n[noise] good afternoon Clark [noise] how're you doing couldn't be better thank you\nSo John you got a question for me about your kids how old are your kids\nI've got three uh sixteen sixteen and Seventeen [noise]\nDid you say sixteen sixteen and Seventeen I did that's a lot of kids all lumped together at one man\n[noise] adopted from uh South Korea and ended up a pregnant with a in vitro twins boy girl

listening for years and I love your program and what you do for the community\nUh three children I'm moving from a home schooling environment to a an an elevated home schooling uh environment where there are no knitting access to local laptops I Know you're a huge fan of the Koran book uh done some research have great great things about them\nI just don't know how well they will perform and if they're designed for um a more traditional setting where I'm going to be using excel power point spreadsheets things of that nature um under the additives you have to be a tip connected to the Internet on the chrome book and I just wanted to get your opinion on that\nRight so schools have been adopting the chrome book is their computer of choice and massive numbers and the ... now completely dominate the educational environment\nThere are still a particularly in the private school environment where they're using Mac books but overall the chrome book dominates not totally\nBut
