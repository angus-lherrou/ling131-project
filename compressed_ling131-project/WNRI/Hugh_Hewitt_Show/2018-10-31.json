Clark Howard [noise]\n\n\nGlad you're with us here on the Clark Howard show\nWhere it's all about you and that followed a yours that when you were an idea is to be more of what you may [noise]\nComing up later when to let you know how things are starting to have five for the Christmas shopping season the unofficial start of the Christmas shopping season is just\nDays away and uh did you know there was an official start and I'm going to fill us in on what kind of things are out there to entice you this shopping season right I got a crazy thing for you\nTo you know there are now the monitor is being sold that are geared specially marketed towards families with young children where that's a mom and her hooks up to the Internet\nWell during where this a mom and her hooks up to the Internet and keeps records so when you call the pediatricians office and you say a\nJane is not doing well and and they'll ask well have you taken or temperature and you say yeah\nAt one thirty seven her temperature is blah blah blah I for fourteen it was this and now at eight oh two it's Bob la and that's the kind of thing I can tell you as a parent of three were all past that stage now I Wish something like that it existed\nWhen my kids were young and you'd call the pediatricians office and say well I took it I don't remember was that this morning when I take that temperature so\nHaving the ability to have the Internet be or record keeper and be able to track\nAs often is your advice to take temperature of a kid who's not feeling well having those records instantly your fingertips seems like a great idea\nBut listen to this creep out thing so one of the the monitors that is always connected to the Internet is the cancer\nAnd so this one now is in half a million houses New York times reports that cancer is taking the data on all\nThe people having their temperatures taken at all times around the country and then supposedly taking it down to a anonymous data that's tracked by ZIP Code and then they sell it to companies that benefit from when people are sick\nAnd so a company that might sell over the counter meds to\nPharmacies will know okay there's an outbreak of some kind of bug in these codes must get extra inventory to those stores\nThe advantage to you as a parent is it seems whenever you go when the pediatric medicine section in a pharmacy is empty just when your kids sick because it's like everybody else in the class is sick at the same time\nSo you're right now over withholding and you're ending up having to wait for a big tax refund each year is All right so there is no a science to his more art and the easiest way to do it unless you suddenly have gotten a big pay raise that work is I did actually\nOh congratulations [noise] so you're a payroll office will tell you with your normal exemptions what you're gonna end up with this check in check each pay period you increase your withholding so less money will be held back\nOkay so is it better to do that do exist myself altogether in and take that percentage and put that into a savings account\nSo how do you work for a big company that has a human resources department or payroll department as a tiny employer\nAs big a big player\nSo there is a big employer you can go to a human resources and say here's what I wanted to do I want to reduce my withholding each pay period by X number of dollars\nHundred two hundred or whatever and they'll just help you do that they'll help you change they will tell you fill out a new uh W. for\nIt and they'll reduce what you're having withheld and then you won't get that refund\nAnd that's what I recommend pretty much everybody do because you don't want to be in a position if you end up being a victim of tax id fraud the you end up waiting tend to fourteen months for that refund you're listening to the Clark Howard show\n[noise]\nDoes your dog it's scratched tanker shed like crazy come to die by pro ordering Ninety Days plant\nDynamite diner

you\nIt's beyond comprehension the contracts will often be sixty two hundred pages long\nAnd battling the contract is not only not understandable by you but even the person who's selling it to your doesn't really know what all those sixty two hundred pages man I met even a warrior who does securities work couldn't tell you what all of it may\nSo you have somebody that addition to having the deck stacked against you having poor tax treatment also has exceedingly high management and insurance charges in it\nThat are as much as forty times what a low cost investment choice would be so that's not

to be able to maybe one store\nBuy a fifty inch for equivalent or less than another store is selling a forty three inch TV\nSo we watch that compression and price with a larger sized TV a lot of people buy TVs thinking about uh how much how what size of a TV they're comfortable and they only shop within that if you have a little flexibility\nWatch that the fifties because of the competition

I'm a ... few crazy trying to ... I'll be doing it for the rest a year\nBut compared to like if you go to a commercial shredding service figure you're going to pay like a dollar a path\nTo rise though I two or three hundred dollars is what it's going to cost me\nYeah so I Would rather see you buy a a\nShredder that will allow you to do what we might call medium volume shredding I have one that I bought for it was like fifty nine dollars that I can cram like twenty sheets and of the time and it may or an awful racket\nAnd my kids have gotten too old now but I used to pay my kids to shreds for me and they thought they were making a fortune when I'd give him a dollar to to do it\nA bet yeah\nSo do you have any kids can rent them the the shredded oh\nAre you at a ... I got to try and it twenty five year old so I don't know if it's out\nThere that's not that's not an aging and pay a dollar or two [laughter] so I guess I got or you need to have some mindless TV on and just sit there and shred stuff went after another\nSounds like that's a shame\nBecause you said you had hundreds of pounds right\n[laughter] yeah at least two or three other adults\nThat's 'cause that's hundreds of dollars you don't want to\nPay that kind of money to pay a commercial try to do it sometimes credit unions will have a shredding day try to attract new members where they'll shreds stuff for free but I don't even know how you find out when credit unions are doing those free shredding days what a neat idea\nSam is with us on the Clark Howard show hollowed Sam how ya doing very well our thanks well great to have you here you have a question for me about home insurance is that right yes I Do I like\nHave a question for me about home insurance is that right\nYes I Do I like to purchase a condo or town hall for the Los Angeles county\nLike concern and fear is that showed an earthquake happened and the entire building are complex isn't covered by earthquake insurance via the homeowner's association that I could possibly lose all my equity and my unit and even not have a place to live as well\nYou are correct so we usually when a condominium that they would go with you from is typically called self insured to rebuild the buildings for ah the aftermath of an earthquake\nOkay so when you're looking at a condo you can request from the seller ... they provide you all the documents on the condo association and they have to supply you that if you request it including you want to see what kinds of reserves the condo has\nAnd if it's not disclose do you want to know what kind of insurance coverage they have and then the dish and with that there's a crazy thing with condos that if you owned a condo before you know I have not So Tim this is one that's like freaky weird okay\nLet's say there was forget earthquake let's say there was a um a fire or some event that caused\nSignificant damage to the building and it had to be rebuilt each condominium\nBesides in their bylaws what they're responsible for and the homeowners you still have to have like a condo owners policy and you got to make sure the condo owners policy you get matches up\nWith where it takes over where the condo association policy leaves off\nSo some of them might even re sheet rock your condo and leave that to you after a destructive about others might include flooring others might not include new foreign it's not like a traditional homeowner's policy or condo owners policy\nHas to be written so that it doesn't leave gaps between what the condo association coverage is and what your policy would cover now and the earthquake\nYou so you don't know yet if the condo association has earthquake insurance\nI Do not I I look to see if they do and as you mentioned it is extremely rare that had a choice they would have a earthquake policy for the entire complex very rare\nSo the ruins the risk to you can be intense\nVery substantial\nNow are you going to have a mortgage on this condo\nYeah although I tend to pay it off the within say five years\nSo the the mortgage company will probably have a requirement that you have some level of insurance including for earthquakes to lower the risk to them in the event there was a catastrophic loss that you're building\nThat makes sense you know I'm aware that you can get insurance or inside the unit\nYeah that's what I was remembering too about the policies that match up with a with a condo association policy and you do need to have\nThat you depending on your mortgage lender they may or may not require that from you but you definitely want to have that\nI agree with that but I wouldn't be surprised that the mortgage company would also require a joy to a mortgage or earthquake insurance tire complex\nBecause the lender is completely exposed if the condo is uninsured or under insured you're correct correct\nSo I I think you you know my position on this the thing with the earthquakes is that they are even in California there they are rare but when one happens that can cause loss of life and massive destruction and loss of property\nRomano for governor also our children grow up to enjoy the things we hope

offering retirement plans to your employees at a small business\nI offer the people working on Clark dot com and car deals dot com\nI offer them a four one K. plan that is for them a low cost four one K. plan and I have mandatory enrollment everybody has to participate\nAnd I'm match dollar for dollar the first six percent\nThat my people put in so\nYou know I beat him over the head you when you're automatically enrolled you put the money in your double your money right away and people can choose if they want to opt out they can\nOr they lose out on the free money I Would throw their way but what's not free at all for me is\nBut what's not free at all for me\nIs the cost and hassle involved the administrative chores\nOf me as a small business offering a four one K.\nI've got to have a was it was a compliance administrator and to make sure that we're doing everything by the rules are the IRS could come down on me and say oh we're just allowing all this because you didn't follow this that or the other I mean it's a pain\nYou just can't imagine and the cost involved with it so most small employers say\nYou know I'd really like to offer something but I Can't take on the risk I Can't take on the expense\nSo the president's executive order\nIs going to lead to new rules on allowing employers\nTo go in to co ops to provide for ... plans\nIt will be a whole whole lot cheaper for small businesses to be able to enter into a four O. one K. cola and so ... what it means is that instead of me shouldering all the expenses\nInvolved in providing a four O. one K. to the car dot com

from your power company tell me what they offered you\nWell um they offer basically they are looking for customers to leave their panel now I Am a familiar with the son of that as I Know how they work\nUm what I Would like to know is how my company um cost wise what helped me installing them or they be only a what the benefits for the average person\nSo with solar panels the leasing offers had been declining in the country and more and more people are moving to buying solar panels been leasing them\nLeasing solar panels generally doesn't save you enough money and at the same time you're creating an obligation for at least they may go way beyond the time period you're going to own a home\nYes so I don't recommend doing any of those so where are you saying offers unless\nYou you pay for them ... it's not a good deal to have 'em least is that what you're saying right\nRight and even if it means you finance panel's but you own them yeah I'm fine with that\nBut doing a ... I don't like those deals really at all and I know because you don't have to lay any money out up front people think that those are there's like a no brainer no risk kind of thing [noise] but I think there's\nTwo of the reward for the obligation your take on and that's why I Would say no [noise]\n\nDoes your dog it scratched tinker shed like crazy come to die by pro order and Ninety Days supply of dynamite\nEverything we tried sail except to\nPick up two bottles of super mega fish oil get the third bottom three ... three ... and a PA fatty acids super make us great for your dogs immune system healthy skin and sock shiny bird dogs love to try to make official al by to get one free at dynamite dot com\nI N o v I can\nHear the story of Laura ... wants to play the game will come\nThrough scouts came to a bunch of games where Lawrence was playing\n\nAnd gave us no indication that we were going to get hit with this letter and um basically non renewable\nGenerally with homeowner's insurance phrase the industry uses is use it and ... [laughter] yes you're thirty three years before these uh claims you hadn't back to back when you said two years ago and then recently\nHow many claims that you ever had against the homeowner's insurance and the prior thirty one years well\nWe have had three different we've lived it for different homes in three different states and we had no claims on any of those previous homes we'd been in this home for ten years and unfortunately had for a December when we first moved in there was one water issue with the water here line\nAnd then we had a catastrophic uh hail storm and our rift needed to be replaced\nSo that was the first one is two thousand six with the water line in the water heater and then\nI Know that's a long time ago to ask you this do you have even the famous memory how much that claim was\nYeah I have it right here because they told me what it was and I'm In the water heat it was two thousand three hundred and eleven dollars\nAnd so we shouldn't even filed that but\nWe asked them and they didn't really seem to give us any good direction on you know how to make that call a we had a thousand dollar deductible at that time [noise] uh in the last two years we left our deductible too I think it was I don't know half a percent into it when it's like Eighteen hundred dollars\nAnd um so they only paid out twenty three hundred you know way back in two thousand six\nSure All right let me tell you the cold hard facts here and this is you are such a positive person by the way well most people would be just like steaming near here so positive and upbeat about this but the reality is\nThat homeowners insurers many of them if not most of them judge you now based on a number of claims rather\nThan the dollar amount of the claims and it doesn't even matter that you've been with them thirty three years if they've decided that recently you become a frequent climate they don't want you\nAnd so it's a double whammy because now you have do you know you have something called the clue report\nI just found that out he s\nAnd we'll report um follows the house not you write so even when you go to sell your house somebody coming to buy it may have a hard time obtaining homeowner's insurance because they've ah put you through the clue process\nAnd when you go to buy now you're going to have three years of having to buy substandard homeowner's insurance that will basically just pay to rebuild your house in a catastrophic boss\nOkay well we have called around and talk to an insurance broker that deals with eighty agencies and several of them just right out of the gate refused to write us because of the last we had a preferred rating insurance score which meant that we were just spotless\nUm until the quiz kicked in and we had those two that showed up so it looks like our insurance is going to double um because of that\nGoing on and so it'd be crummy coverage now\nWell it it looks like it's going to be pretty calm purple\nThat's unusual can I make a suggestion sure\nI Would I Would accept a lower quality insurance policy by that I mean with a beat up to ... much higher deductible because it's really important now that you only make a claim if you have something that's gigantic\nNumbers gigantic\nSo it depends do you have a mortgage still on your home\nNo ... we just pay that off\nOkay great so you're free to do the deductible you wish and I'm going to tell you to look at something maybe in the range of ten thousand dollars okay\nAnd then you may be able to get the premium back down to where it was and then only if you did have something truly that was terrible would you be making a claim\nRight and so we need to be prepared to just pay out of pocket like the first ten thousand dollars regardless\nExactly and the hope that nothing I mean you've had a bad run with yeah I mean these things happen maybe your ... run out I Hope so and you'll have a good long run with nothing happening but the key for for your fellow listener is that with homeowner's insurance\nYou'd want to do the higher deductible gets you a lower premium anyway\nAnd up to whatever your mortgage company would allow your case that's not a factor for cause you want to be in a position that you don't get fired for a plane and then have the problem where you're going to go next so it's just a it's\nReal issue that the insurers only want you for your premiums they don't want you for your claims Justin joins us on the Clark Howard show hello Justin hello art how are things going for you Justin\nOh they're going just fine\nWell good how can I be of help to you\nYeah I'm I Am a I'm I'm a masters student and my wife and I we both made it through undergrad with no debt and we worked full time I worked full time she got her masters and I'm going back to get mine\nAnd what are you getting your masters that\nI'm getting my masters and industrial design\nOh you're going to have good job prospects aren't you ah hopefully so [noise] that's great\nBut neither one of us have ever owed a credit card we have no credit I'd been steered away from that for my entire alive and well when my wife I Want to get our first apartment and my dad had to coast side\nOr that I felt bad right\nYeah I did actually looked into your website and I looked at real war and the best rewards cards\nThat for you right now they're not too\nSure [laughter] and that's what I was going to ask you know\nSure [laughter] and that's what I was going to ask you know what is the best starting card that we could get because of all I mean all we want to do is build our credit we're interested in really traveling wars\nOkay so here as a grad student I don't know if you'll get the same offers that an undergraduate would be eligible for a college student card\nIs what you really want because they don't care about income they figure you know college students are very low level risk and tend to whatever card they get first they tend to hold for a long time it's not a lifetime\nAnd there's a real loyalty factor would be in that first card have you tried to get a card on during the college student credit card programs\nI've not tried um I Know we have ... bank account with ... sorry\nThat's right I don't know of regions offers a college student card but if that's where your customer go into a branch and find out or\nYou know we have we gone in there and my wife she acts as a force for like three months now it's just something that we don't want it to do\nBut neither of you have a credit score right they're not going to issue your car is not going to help to apply for that card and that's why you've got to get in there under one of the college student programs as the first best option\nOkay and if that doesn't work then the best thing to do is\nUh the credit union at your campus\nMhm is to go to the credit union and see if you can do if they don't have a college student card if they can put you in one of the um one of the cards where you put money in savings at the credit union and your limit is based\nLoosely are strictly by what's in savings and then you graduate fully out of that\nTypically in six Eighteen months into a regular old card that will help you get older your credit standing okay and so that should get it done and having credit is a good thing not a bad thing oh yeah and it's usually credit is a terrible thing\nRight and that's yeah that's where I Am yeah that's where we are now I guess as I'm I'm very certain that are going to be spending money that I don't have no way it has gained\nIn are you going to make it through your grad program as well with no student loan borrowing\nIt is looking like that is going to be the case I I've had a well rough\nSo wait and see you and your wife will each have gotten bachelor's degrees and possibly both get master's degrees and not have one set of student loan debt\nThat is correct\nWell that is wonderful and that will make your wife moving forward so much easier

anytime for zero one five seven three forty three sixty and we're talking about Halloween all how close is and how it affects people I'm In a lot of ways to\nIt can open you up I'm sure there's a lot of energy not just that hollowing but like all the time if you know what I mean if you're a medium and you do this kind of thing but most people don't get that they think Halloween is\nSome special kind of night um energy in the air is very very very\nExtremely potent energy high high by an energy it's the kind where you'd definitely can feel some thing\nOr someone around you um but you can get that feeling most people don't know that they can connect to their loved ones that just ... months even pets um and get messages themselves and I really believe that I just watched the show 'em and\nNot knocking anyone you know but um there's there's some places out there including Lilly Dell in New York\nAnd people go there to get readings and they pay money to stay there and I'm just watch the show at least so laying and some people weren't a hundred percent happy with the reading they got\nDisappointed a little bit and I can see why I'm In some aspects but everybody can do that is not it's not anything special I don't consider myself to be special um I've done this my whole life but I'm sure if you look back\nYou know it may have been times where you got to find from having someone passing you thought\nWow like I just saw this animal or I just saw this flower or whatever and it reminded me of so and so that was so close to me and I would I just feel like they just gave me a you know like a I was just talking to them and all of a sudden you know out of the blue this happened and so those kinds of things are not random\nOkay and you can get those a lot and you can actually here\nAnd um signs okay and you can get those a lot and you can actually here and get messages I'm sure if you ever heard of song a special song by the radio\nAt the same time you're thinking of someone will pass a one and the other favorite song that meant something special ... came on and that that's a sign and some people get that some people don't\nRight away but other people do but I can tell you that a lot of times you cannot pull through spirit who you want to come through it doesn't always happen even the most gifted psychics\nOkay even lowly del psych eggs so that doesn't happen\nUm a lot of times this is how I Do my rating so I can tell you from experience that I Will say I will ask for your guides an angel to come in and my guides and angels to come in after I usually say the our father prayer with you on and then I'll tell you\nThat as long as you are open to receiving a message and they're willing to come through to give that to you\nAnd you're also ready to receive that that that will happen and a lot of times I Will tell you that it's not guaranteed on any reading\nFor medium ship but I Will tell you that Ninety nine percent of the time medium ship happens on no matter what kind of reading you get from me whether it's a straight taro whether it's a a clock tick whether it's an angel card reading whether it's passed by for eating\nMost readings I've done even the ones in Salem recently though which is a ball which were three cards five minutes out the bouncer was right there you know that's all you got medium ship came out on almost every single one of those cards readings so most of the time somebody's wanting to talk they love to talk spirit loves to talk of ... but some spare\nAnd I can tell you from experience that I have no different than anyone else almost anyone in the world can do this you don't have to get into any kind of group you don't have to go\nUm learn how to be a medium all that stuff all you do need to ground and center yourself and get really calm take some nice depress you know\nJust imagine being in a really beautiful place and not think too much you know had a time about what to expect\nMaybe just write jot down like who you would like to come through well what you would like to know and then just go into like a very peaceful meditation or go to sleep\nAnd just ask before you go to sleep you know for them to come in and a lot of times you'll get a message you'll find something significant you might hear something you might even feel it a lot of times I don't hear anything I feel it it's it's more of a feeling and and knowing um of what I'm hearing\nIn a different way I just hear it with my body um so it it all depends on the person sometimes I Do hear actual voice inside or outside of my head I'm not my own so it it always comes in different ways that anybody can do this and it is usually\nVery easy especially around Halloween only because\nThe veil is a very spin around this time of year but you can do this anytime\nYou don't have to be special you don't have to be with cannot pay again and I believe that even Catholics you know growing up Catholic I always always honor the dead we always went to the cemetery we always put flowers there said prayers\nWe you know all souls day you know all that stuff so\nIt's it's no different than any other religion really talking to the debt has been going on for infinity at will go on for infinity I don't believe it will\nEver stop will always want to connect with our loved ones and our pets and people I'm On the other side will always want to be there to connect with us and and let us know and give us confirmation that yes there's more to life than what we see\n'em and what we know and that yes it's a great place and most of the time it is and sometimes you know I hear stories about other soles like I said depends on that person and and what they were going through when they passed away and how easy\nUm they want to make it for themselves to pass on so if you hear stories about oh this is so creepy you know there's like a ghost and when like for instance there's a covered bridge in Vermont um and I forgot the girl's name the ghosts name but it's a woman um and you can go there I think it's Emily but I'm not a hundred percent on that\nAnd um you go over this covered bridge and most people have experienced have had experiences he cat anymore obviously it's\nKind of because there's been so many um blocked off now\nBecause cars have actually stopped and not being able to start again and people have actually gotten her and scratched and a blood and things like that according to um us from the story of this goes to was jolted by a love her she was waiting on average\nFor this man who she fell in love with from a very rich family and she was very poor um but they were in love and so they were going to elope and he was supposed to be her on the bridge\nYou know at night and they were going to take off well she waited and waited and waited and of course he never showed so she jumped from the bridge to her death and so the story is that she's very um me and to men or I heard this very much\nOh who's two or three three and gosh time flies and your kids you and your wife have very strict rules on any screen time at all even including\nTelevision yeah so we try to limit television consumption to forty minutes a day which have been a honestly seems like a lot especially the way they respond when we turn the TV off\nBut definitely zero cellphone time and zero I pat or any sort of tablet time or no apps or anything like that\nI I it just in my opinion for our kids at least are the sort of stimulus that they get from a lot of those apps and make some of the more mundane things in life feel even more mundane like it's really hard to adapt to the high color high touch I'm super fast world of playing games in a nap\nAnd then kind of come back to normal life and just have to eat dinner with the family um it's just tougher three and a five year old to actually be able to handle that well so\nYou know as parents I'd I'd say that each of us handle it how we do I'd say that I completely failed it this way I mean my oldest daughter this wasn't an issue\n'cause electronics were not everywhere like they are now but I'd say with my two younger kids that uh I was a big fail at this and my wife was much more aware\nOf the potential for harm than I was I didn't recognize it and I I feel bad about that that we as parents need to recognize what we do that a centrally with a very young child you're re wiring their brains\nAnd I'm not one of those people who believes\nThat you ban it entirely that's why there's a range of opinions and Joel and his wife have said none at all but having the tight collar on time watching video of any kind and you may find that any app that's free as one you want to avoid\nIs an apt it's free how are they gonna pay for it they're going to pay for it by having ads embedded in it so actually chi chi telling you to pay for it\nPaying for Netflix if you want to let him watch video instead of letting them watch traditional TV where there's going to be all the ads is a way you can ah prevent the advertising from having undue influence on young child's mind\nBut the screens themselves having tight limits that are age appropriate on how much time on a screen is great and with the new fancy\nWireless mash products that I recommend for you to have in your home but he'd be much more reliable and faster Internet and you're home there they're going to be completely calm and if you're out looking at technology at all through this fall\nThere's instead of having a traditional wireless router these things all at base or getting back to an app you're able to control\nHow much time you're kids can have on screens automatically So Joel mentioned forty minutes how would you enforce that well with the apps you shot a device down when it when a child's use would hit forty minutes they're done whatever the the rules are you put in place\nIt's a very easy way for you to enforce it using\nElectronics to defeat electronics yes we've come to that\n[laughter] oh boy met some of those on the Clark Howard show Hi Matt\nHi Clark it's an honor to talk to I've never been on live radio before\nWell it's great to have you here and you have a question for me that if you knew the arguments that go on in our house over what you're about to ask me oh boy hit me with it\nYeah I can imagine so right now I live on my own in Minnesota and in the winter it gets pretty cold and I was wondering what I'm at work for eight ten hours a day what temperature shaved my thermostat at when I'm done and there's no one there heat in the house so that I'm saving as much energy as I can\nOkay so wow you didn't ask me what I keep my thermostat which people ask me a lot so what temperature are you comfortable when when you're home\nAnd the way I cared about sixty four sixty five weight when you're home yeah\nOh my goodness I found somebody who is worse than I Am\nAlso live slaves and blankets are for\n[laughter] well see that's my kind of attitude my family says they all are miserable during winter 'cause they say that I keep the house like it's a refrigerator to save money\nYeah that's after we've done extreme insulation in the house and all kinds of other things to reduce energy consumption so mhm if you are you're shocking me that you like the house at sixty four so you would be okay\nAnd if you get a nest thermostat something like that they're really cheap now\n... what a smart thermostat from a different company\nSo you've got one I Would say generally if you keep it at fifty five degrees\nWhen you're not there and a half hour before you\nTypically come home that you have the smart thermostat is set to go up to sixty four sixty five you don't want to let it go below that you have danger with potentially pipes breaking it also makes it much harder for the house to heat backup but if you have\nA roughly eight to ten degree lower temperature when you're not home and you liked to have when you're home that would be where you'd want to be\nThat's great thank you 'cause I've been keeping a fifty eight and I felt like it still is too warm when I'm God\nYes I agree so if you were if you like sixty four you could go maybe to fifty four\nOr five fifty five is a pretty good number okay and I can't I Can't even begin to tell you how many people are listening to you and me right now Matt who think both of us are ridiculous\nBut it makes it fun for me when I get called the think I'm saving money so [laughter] so I got extra finals [laughter] well\nGood for you it's funny I I was uh the other day\nI was in a store that was selling it was all day and they were selling these men um wintertime lawn pajama pants that were like um\nWith that material like flannel and it seems like they'll keep me warm when the temperatures like forty four in the house Tom how're you doing today\nVery good\nSo you live in California you're listening to someone in Minnesota talk about winter most found like really crazy\n[noise] yeah it's it's here we are getting towards winter at Seventy one and sunny outside for us [laughter]\nPretty good temp isn't it yes [laughter] yeah my wife refers to\nPretty good temp
