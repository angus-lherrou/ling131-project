actually\nWell that's great how can I be of service to you with your upcoming wedding\nAfter the wedding we are planning on selling the house that word and right now and open and make about fifty thousand off of it which is which is pretty nice but I have a question about the capital gains tax I I think what our research is that all goes back to\nYou know as long as you have been in the house two years or longer and you make a profit even as a single individual of less than a quarter million you just put the money in your pocket\nThat I like that\nYeah isn't that great you know the rules for what happened when you sold at home he used to be so ridiculously complicated\nAnd people without even intending to be tax cheats would mess it up and so but just by saying you have safe harbor up to a quarter million single five hundred thousand married\nMade the process just so much easier to understand and easier for people to comply\nFully ... to ... we sell the house we're going to actually do in fact the all these parents for a couple of months while we look for another house [noise]\nSo I had to play and pay off a little bit of that look that money and then also I was thinking like said thirty five thousand that on the side or a ... percent town I'm ... I'm\n... I'm sure way you're thinking\nThat gets into your cell and do search these things all kind of came into my head so we have thirty five right off the bat from that sixty that leaves us with twenty five and my fiance has fourteen in\nIn loans and a lead in Grand less calling her car but also I Need a car show and I was thinking was not paying off her car and getting by in a car for me flat out that way we don't have\nAnother loan open up within only\nNeed a you don't want any loans opened up close to when you're going to buy a home I Love the way you've thought about all this quaint surely there's no need to rush to pay off her car loan car loans extinguished themselves so quickly just with the number of months left to pay them off\nAnd you buying a car for cash\nIs a great idea wiping out or student loans are wonderful thought and then you still have the money to twenty percent down on a home loan I Want to congratulate you Jordan because the way you've thought this through is a great way for the two of you to start your marriage together\nJoyce joins us on the Clark Howard show and George she'd been in the process of trying to steadily build up your credit it's great to have you here on the Clark Howard show tell me where you are right now in the process George\nWell I've already got on credit card got a one with a major panic that honestly I'm probably after listening to the show recently probably thinking about this and that one but I Do want to have to also off of your eyes and um\nI mean you have a credit card with Wells Fargo yes it's a\nOkay don't dump that card because of all the ethical and legal issues that Wells Fargo keep that card because that's the only credit you have does it have an annual fee attached to it\nNo um it doesn't\nThen I Want you to keep that Wells Fargo credit card and I want you to go ahead and apply for another card cause\nAt Wells Fargo credit card and I want you to go ahead and apply for another card 'cause the grade you've already\nMade it through the hardest stage of establishing credit which is having your first major credit card visa MasterCard discover American Express once you've got that and you handle paying it well and don't use a lot of the credit\nYou start building up a credit story that you can get that second credit card and to establish good credit you need a minimum of two major credit cards\nOkay do you run a balance on the wells Carter is it something you paying now Nobel\nI always I'm always paying it off before the payments due\nTo an added to build their me All right then I Want you to go to a website called credit card tune up\nOkay and you'll be able to based on your charge pattern see what reward card you should get because if you pay your balance and fall every month you should be not only building up your credit more but you should be getting\nRewards for it may have you set up a credit karma dashboard for yourself\nI have not no I'd like you to go do that and you'll be able to track the progress with your credit score over time and they'll suggest you it's for you to do and use they'll suggest to you what credit moves you need to make to keep raising your score\nOkay and I would say get a second car now\nAnd then give it a half year and then at that point go back to credit card to not pick another card\nAnd then at that point don't dump the Wells Fargo card keep it open just don't use it anymore and then you'll have a much wider snapshot of credit for lenders to look at you'll be in great shape\nEdwards with us on the Clark Howard show hello ed were\nGood afternoon Clark how are you oh fine thank you know you're doing well having a great day thank you\nGood first of all I'd like to listen to your forever but I'm a actually a first time caller that just really want to thank you for all your best advice ... assure we should go into government or public service to apply that knowledge we could really use it [laughter]\nWell you're kind of say that I I think that ship has sailed in my life\nSo I Hope not but anyway\nUh the reason I'm calling is way of grandchildren that are starting to go into the college scene I really have a two part question relates a four year colleges versus community colleges are first with all these uh student debts that are coming due and fishing is generational students\nI was really wondering what four years lived for your schools have gotten so expensive and if anything can be done or should be done to try to reduce east cost\nWell actually I Believe and there's something some people disagree with me strongly about I Believe the reason the University of just gotten so expensive is because of how easy it is for people to borrow money\nThat we created the very high cost simply by creating what appears to be an unlimited supply of fun\nSo there hasn't been market discipline for the colleges and universities and so now the cost of educating someone has way outstrip the increase and family income over the years and over the last couple of decades\nSo it's my belief that if we heavily rained in the ability to borrow for school\n... colleges would become much more efficient\nAnd you give the example of community colleges there are a number of community colleges around the country now that offer full four year degrees that offer bachelor's degrees at all really hairy low cost yes Florida has been a trailblazer in that\nTexas has a program I guess you'd call it modified community college where the cost of a four year degree is designed to be ten thousand dollars total\nUh have you went out right
