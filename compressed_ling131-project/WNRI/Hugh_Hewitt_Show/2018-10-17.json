I've talked to Granger because when it comes to keeping your business running ... got your back ... super yourself Granger\nBobby is with us on the Clark Howard show hollow Bobby\nA clerk doing great thank you you're trying to get your first credit card is that true\nI Am in the ... so I've been saving a lot of the past ... years and find it looking great but I don't have any credit history I applied for a a major credit card to a major bank declined for that credit card that ball history\nSo I've been getting a lot of different people and all different places saying a lot of different things and it's kind of confusing to try to figure out some sort of called up for some advice on what I should be looking for the first credit card\nSo if you've never had a credit card and you don't have any history of the car loans or personal loans or any loans at all is that right\nAll right so you're starting from scratch you're going to have to do some heavy lifting to establish that first credit\nAnd it it's more work than it should have to be but if you it's one of those things if you don't have history how do you get history the way you do it\nIs you need to either go my first preferred choice as to go to a credit union are you a member of a credit union yet\nI'm I Am not but there are several in my area that I could go on yet\nBecause a number of credit unions have what are known generally under it's not a trade name it's kind of the general category we're known as fresh start programs where you can establish an account\nA membership with a credit union and what they do with those programs as she put money on deposit with the credit union and a credit union CD or savings account and then that establishes your eligibility for a visa and MasterCard\nAnd the limit on how hard is somehow loosely tied into what you put on deposit and savings or in a CD\nAnd then they'll have like a a schedule that if you pay the bills on time month after month they gradually move you from having to have that CD or savings account to just having\nA credit card with no restrictions the advantage of the fresh start programs at a credit union versus what you might have heard from people about secured cards they might mention is occurring car do you\nHave heard about this yes\nRight so the difference is the credit union cards generally are not considered to be secured cards they're just a regular guys or MasterCard but the credit union is protected by the money you have on deposit with them as a member\nA security guard fair secured cars are issued by banks of various sizes and with the security card you specifically give them money that is equal to the credit limit they're willing to grant you and they have possession of your money\nAs a security deposit if you will like you would have if you went to rent an apartment and then ending on the secure card after twelve or Eighteen months of on time payments they then transition you to a regular credit card\nOkay no problem with the security card programs is they have usually very high annual fees\nAnd you've got the time period you have to wait and usually the way they're reporting the card to credit bureaus is under a status that lets the credit bureaus know that it's a secured card and not a full real visa and MasterCard\nOkay yeah my bank tried to get me to sign up for one of those but I didn't see that it had quite a high interest rates I was sort of shying away from it\nSo this is one of those areas where if you find a credit union that has one of these programs near you it's a vastly superior way to establish your first credit\nOkay fresh our program at a car and I will definitely look into that thank you\nYeah there's one other option I'll mention just briefly and that is if you have a family member who's willing to add you to their credit card account\nAnd that would give you the ability to establish credit and the fastest way possible and depending on the issue or a credit card some will only extend you as well as soon as unauthorized use or others will make you a co owner\nCo owner of status is what's really best for you and it would allow you immediately to establish credit record in credit history with a major credit card your family member can sign you up for it but then not give you possession of the card they don't have to worry about well what you might do with the card\nBut any of the methods will get you\nPretty quickly to where you have that establish credit history and then after that is just up to you how you handle it\nDaniel with us on the Clark Howard show hello Daniel\nHey color Daniel you have a one year old boy or girl girl she or one years old that happy birthday should we break out in song what's your daughter's name\nBoil well happy birthday to well I Will not say I don't want to hurt your ears and thank you [laughter] so how can we help with one year old willow\nLooking at a study of some kind of college\nWhat can we help with one year old willow\nWe're looking at a story of some kind of college savings plans for a little bit ... contributing loaded with only a side where somebody already give us a college savings bond urged savings fall not college savings on [noise] I'm just wondering a is a five twenty nine plan right for us\nAnd if so which Warren 'cause I don't see my own state listed on you're you're a best buy twenty nine plans\nYou're a Floridian that's correct so Florida does a different form of a five what comes under the five twenty nine code Florida has a prepaid tuition player\nAnd so you've got Seventeen years to totally brainwash willow that the only school she's going to go to who is a Florida State school\nOkay now what are the odds though that Seventeen years so now you won't have long moved to who knows where else in America\nProbably very slow and we've got a lot of family here saw yesterday in this area so\nIf you're going to stay in Florida you do have the alternative because five twenty nine college savings plan is basically a tax free way\nTo put money aside for college I used it any a real college for even colleges overseas and can be used for any eligible college expense so well I Would have enormous flexibility where to go to school\nOn the other hand you ... it's an open question how much a school where you're going to be able to cover with the Florida prepaid tuition plan you will be able to buy essentially course credits\nAnd avoid what inflation will do the cost over the next Seventeen years\nSo it's there to entirely different ways to attack college costs\nAnd so you're okay you really need to think through are you are you comfortable for willow saying hey you get to go to any college as long as it's a state school in the state of Florida period\nAnd if you are then you should probably you look at doing the Florida prepaid tuition plan\nAnd that's because the way to gauge where he writes you'll you'll know we bought this\nMuch of willows education\nOkay one more thing do you have an ex wife works at a local college here in the state of Florida and\nShe gets I guess for torture or spouses and ... and the child I assume you should stay there Seventeen years from now so I guess that's kind of an option as well so how did the for the tree paid or twenty nine point how would it be if I was trying to get my money back because\nI see what happens with a traditional five twenty nine plan if a child scholarships out\nThe ten percent penalty they would normally\nAffect you with a five twenty nine plan not used for colleges waved but you have to pay tag on any earnings\nBut you know uh considering we're education's going let's say well oh your wife still working there will goes there gets the free undergraduate degree such a big number of students now go on to some form of graduate school\nAnd the five twenty nine point money would easily be used for graduate school\nOkay it makes sense so\nThat is an unusual twist you brought to the table they're\n[laughter] all it's a certain level it will be there so I Know\nThat the twist I mean how do you even protect that but one thing I'm sure we can verdict

to go to a deal or cause dealer's car dealers will buy vehicles even if you're not buying something from them because they want vehicles on their used car lot so\nAs part of the process of selling

built the modeling online and had a real sense of what I thought value would be but then\nI went out there and got for prices for offers for the vehicle and I learned something so important for you\nWhen you're trading inner vehicle because most often people aren't doing what I'm doing where we're not going down a vehicle or did go down a vehicle and you're trading in one to get another the variety of offers I received\nFor the vehicle is one there would be purchased by a dealer\nWere so different now there's a twenty twelve model\nThe highest offer I received was fourteen thousand five hundred the lowest I receive was Ninety five hundred\nAnd then the two others were I'm not that far away from the fourteen five but they were they were lower as much as eight hundred and fifty dollars so in other words three offers I received for in the same general territory one was much lower\nAnd so\nWhen I got the Ninety five hundred offer for it the gentleman somebody like me to start the pay

part is here with the best company\nAnd so it's possible you could shop and you might find a premium lower somewhere than a maker but would that be a smart move\nI Would say if you can afford the

now managed to invade them [laughter] oh [laughter]\nSo he's adding you a pitch how you're going to get rich if you joined him in some kind of multi level or something\nThat only a multi level marketing thing it sounds fishy I don't really know exactly what they shall\nOkay let me stop you right there drew you don't need to proceed any further I cook I don't know if you're just looking for me to tell you what\nThe things you can tell your friends say your friend or go away I'll do that but you know when somebody is even considering a multi level if you don't want to do it [laughter]\nYou don't want to do this at all [laughter] fat off of a reason because LA you're talking about something that your friend drives you crazy talking about it all the time right 'cause I\nFair and and it's a little awkward because I Know it's on his line and I'm not really gave all my ashtray and or or\nI don't know I Want to be supportive of them but I also want to know more about\nThis okay so this one is like many others right now that promises gosh they must be Fifteen or twenty of these right now the promise that you can get discounts on a variety of services\nThat many of us already use that's right and so they say you know instead of you just paying for these why don't you get a discount getting um for me and why don't you offered to other people that they'll get discounts buying 'em from you\nAnd then everybody's happy 'cause everybody's paying less\nThen you get extra income how am I doing was I'd there through when you have AOL right\nThat sounds about right okay so the real story is that\nUh you will not necessarily save money\nWith any of these multi level things because there's so many commissions that have to be paid in so much administrative work this fall that by the time somebody buys a service and all the commissions are paid and all that the odds that there's any money they've saved\nIs so low that it's really a lot of sound and fury signify a waste of your time\nNow you're talking about a shining a light utilities with family\nOr your house in and out of also enjoying it 'cause I Know like to join in this thing you've got to a new way of getting hit by fire way and you write for like five or six hundred dollar\nRight and then he gets commission on the five or six hundred and I wasn't even going to get to that but I Will if like I didn't want you to say something to this guy who was who's a friend but not a close when that may person somebody who's not even a a non close friend\nThat he don't want to do that yeah so what happens is if you pay the entry fee bats what generates a lot of income for your friends\nAs are the ones that are further up the ...\nSo it is you buying your way into\nA organization that is not as best I can tell none of these utility kinda ones are scams\nIt's just I Can't see where anybody actually makes any money a marketing the utilities and people buying those services from them that the money is made from recruiting people end of the organization\nThrough my belief is the only people should get involved in a multi level or people who will go well outside their circle\nAnd chat this up to strangers and they're always thinking about it they're always trying to sell\nI think you just keep it simple say\nI'm just not a sales kind of guy\nThis wouldn't work for me and make it about you not about him you know like when people break up with each other and say it's not about us about me that's how I'd handle it with him\nAnd maybe that will make it a west tense and uncomfortable when the two of your around so there's no not to try to pitch it to you Gloria is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Gloria how are you\nI'm just fine Korea you have a question for me about banks versus credit unions is that true\nYeah that's correct I Would change leading my bank and um [noise] I had a thought there was some advantage and going to a credit in all and that's how I got my\nWell first of all asking me that question isn't fair\nBecause my answer is going to be nearly a hundred percent of the time a credit union and the reason that I say that is that at a credit union you own the place so the culture is set up\nIn life it's a dysfunctional credit union the culture is set up to serve you the member\nAnd so most credit unions offer free checking where most banks no longer offer free checking\nAnd interest rates on savings\nAre generally higher at a credit union than they are the bank and then in turn interest rates on loans if you do borrow from a credit union the interest rates on many things like car loans or half the interest rate of what you pay on average for a car loan at a bank\nSheldon my walks question orange ... I have to be a member of like do I have to be a teacher\nI have to be a member of a like a ... do I have to be a teacher to go to a teacher's credit union or any any other discipline\nThat is a wonderful question and there was a walk change up a little bit more than Fifteen Years ago they made credit union membership much more available\nAnd there are a small number of credit unions that remain there are as you describe that they're only for people who work for a certain company or have a certain type of job\nBut that's very rare now most credit unions and a local area are available to anyone in that local area\nHow would I find that out from just all them and Ashton\nYeah I mean how many credit unions in your area do you routinely pass every day five on yeah I got three\nOh okay see a you know just make a mental note of the names of them and just call up and are you more interested and better deals on loans are better deals on savings and checking\nSavings in chapel okay that the reason I ask you that question\nIs there are credit unions that have a favors culture\nAnd their credit unions have borrowers culture and a savers culture credit union will offer more generous interest rates to people in savings and CDs uh-huh but then in turn not offer\nThe absolute rock bottom race on loans because they're paying a little bit higher interest rates on savings\nAnd then there are others that are borrowers credit unions that everything's about giving really cheap interest rates on loans sort of the raid say pay savers and an CDs are not as good so when you talk to people if the rates on simple savings are important to your money market account\nAnd I asked the person you talked to on the phone what are the rates you pay currently okay and that would be for you\nProbably the easiest way to comparison shop which credit union you'd go to\nOkay great well thank you so much part thank you and have a wonderful day I Want to thank you you're listening to the

without\nKnow you you don't leave that behind\nYou know a fewer angry drug when you were allied and your kids the hanging around your son you might found the loneliness give her a little scary\nYou know I've tried to scare him yeah okay I'm not everything follows follows at home\nThat's a little things that you know I've heard throughout the years that well\nHow did you once you get in there and you find out here and I'm not talking to you then why do you\nUsually photography a you know you find out if you know it was kind of a spirit and you try it tried to get it to tell you you know what they want\nTo know if they're a loss loss soul and they want to move on and we can try to open up the light so they can move on\nSo how would you do that for him if you knew that was just so that was kind of stuck in that was asking for help what would you know I've got I've got\nPerson I work as somebody ...\nLike you the kind kind of a medium and they they turn around and they they actually have that gift of actually\nOh OK getting to open up but the light so some of their families can call to them and you know I Believe that they can pass on [noise] um they kind of ... along yeah well none no because they want to go they just need the light to reopen again the light doesn't stay open for rabbi\nOkay so if you have things that\nLike a spirit that usually stuck here is usually the idea that they have something they need to finish they worked on a project their whole life and they want to finish it and uh\nThey have loved ones they don't want to leave behind the kinds of things that they they will they will not enter the light when they pass away you know our help them to do and it's just we we just kind of ...\nYou know if you don't want to ... and that usually up sometimes the other issue is just\nJust living with it OK okay you attended a tenant like can you sit down\nAnd just say hey state of the rules in my house and you know I don't care if you're walk up and down the hallway in the middle night of the whole bit but there there are private places dumping in my bathroom domain my bedroom you know these are private but you stay out of them you know usually the spirits are really good at that that you know the things like ... you know\nIt's it's like a kind of what they believe it's ... it was their house and fail they want their house\nIf it was a demon now what would you do ... how would you know and what would you do\nI Do miss a little different they're more they're they're more violent and there are there out to hurt people they're not like a ... you know a puppet of our guys are ... hoping ice is actually a German word for noisy spirit okay it's got an all kinds of different\nIf if you follow the field there are Fifteen different\nVersions of what a poll picked ISIS and why why's he well I don't know I mean there's there's a lot that they ask that you know these people believe that this these people believe this history so people from different places have different on different names I guess it's just\nWhat somebody told to uphold the guy says\nSo what's the difference between ... and Paul today\nA poker guys to me as noisy spirit it's just it's just the spirit that turns around and as I said earlier I have a bank or he's going to pull off the chair are being ... off the table has floated onto\nA ... agreement is the idea of who wants to possess juice so little by little he's gotten a whisper things in your ear OK okay you're going to not be able to sleep for days and days you know\nIt's like a robot you know he works on drunks he works on you know people were really bad issues right now is just little by little inhale usually out of a family he'll pick one or two people that he'll he'll attack for us\nSo how do you know going into something that you know while you got a demon like what is one of the biggest give away\nWell like I say it's it's just the I I I I guess they're not going to come out and talk to me is now why you know they want to hide themselves away so how you know there's something there\nYou're not there to you guys have figured out you're you're you're kind of have to talk of the ... the people the things that attacking okay what's exciting and\nYou know and why do you believe that say you can is to you or what it does it ... it ... them down and the other hand where you start asking for help from anywhere All right okay\nSo the plant unbearable yeah and then you know it's a demon debts Damon and then how do you solve that one\nNow again in a ... a mentor light on no no I\nAm a team in the fall of fallen angel okay he's never been human it's not\nYour friend at us as a whole lot different the spirit of spirits been human okay good notice the feelings and the love of\nOf where even as a team in a demon has been here forever he's he's one of his when Luther ... will suffer was from Rona either heaven he brought hundreds of thousands of angels whether he brought in the process army with him and when it has on me again you have\nSaid that the little little those are ... okay the high the high ranking demons\nIt although those are ... okay the high the high ranking demons recalled dabbles OK okay you know imitate us there\nOh sure terrorists the same idea you know I've done it a try it's trying to keep you awake it's trying to break it down so that will do the same thing as feral despair or only where they can still growing up and and yeah you know he you know he he just won't\nOkay and like I say when we when we come in where we have a lot easier way of of a spirit coming to talk to us you know because they want to okay where a demon alone in the demon is more on the idea of Trump trying to possessed you right okay and set up the idea of so when you\nRead possessed you you mean making you do something maybe you don't want to do or or stopping you from doing things that you do want to do or\nNo just a huge huge try to steal steal your soul and kind of the whole life how would they do not like I say eventually break down and out to your you're asking anything for help and as soon as you as you know you know but the devil or somebody for help then of course that gives them\nDown on them that you give them the same old they play with a ... or ... house and you know I'm\nI'm really not you know I'll call them in on purpose so maybe you didn't know that sometimes you do what they were asking for help you you'll you'll take help from anybody and I think we said this last week but is\nThere a difference between ...\nNot a whole lot of different like I said you know I think a lot of it just feels deals with the name you'll you know what about the\nCards for 'em that we're using to we touched on that a little bit last week like any any card tarot cards angel car like LA all an opening Tammy\nMadrassas over and asking you know for help you know you're turning around and you're asking asking spirits for help but you're asking the other side the other side of the realm\nSo when you open no matter how you open to the other side you're opening to something dark\nYou you ... you criticize but your philosophy okay like I tell you you know the the ... borders and so then every toy store right I had a ... and that um generous and lots of people play with them I mean they do\nOkay and\nIt doesn't happen all the time but once in a very well you open the door you know you you asked something then you know a boyfriend breaks up for their girlfriend or the girlfriend broke up with a boyfriend and they play with all these people and and now she wants this\nBoyfriend hurt right well okay she doesn't want to do with social ask a demon role of\nCourse it's like it's ... you open up the door and you're asking this thing to come through so\nDo you believe that there is a difference between somebody that is asking\nUm with the intent of literally bringing forth a demon compared to someone that's just dabbling oh that's not not really shows is going to work but like really just angry and just you know doing something or just\nPlaying around is there a difference is it more I'm apt to be able to take over one so over the other or doesn't matter\nNo it doesn't really matter it's it's the idea of\nYou seem to come in contact with okay your turn around some kids play with the thing and they turn around and you know they're asking grandma for help\nSo you're saying neither that's bad for you and I say oh everything like this should be left up to the experts yeah I mean you've got to learn to quote blows up the door you outlined in\nCatholic Church to as so adamant not to do this I mean maybe other I don't know about other faiths so much as like a pistol Hayley in a Baptist and what their beliefs are really ... about that spirit chilly but I Know growing up Roman Catholic that it's a huge taboo\nOh this travel proved to do anything I mean if you've been myself I'm I'm kind of camp\nTaboo against the church for it but yet\nIf if they if they need help it's very idea that you know it's not I'm fry trying to fight the church it but it's we need to know what are we dealing with this is something that the church needs to be involved in or is it something that you know because after\nYou can do alternative things like a setup\nWhich takes like no paperwork to open some provide employee pension and

... house at the same time\nI mean I I think my head would've exploded so oh my goodness maybe years who can handle the dual 'cause you gotta do suck there on cash flow by home and starting a business so which is more important to you right now\nI'm starting a business is is more important if we have to rent temporarily that's okay um whereas that\nBatman me stop shallow breathing hey [laughter] see some kind of entrepreneurial PTOs be said that I was like [laughter]\nOkay okay [noise] um\n'cause you don't know exactly how the business is going to go how how quickly is going to be profitable how much it's going to grow how slow it's going to grow and I want you to be careful because you buy a home you got a fixed overhead there you read you know it gives you more flexibility\nOkay how are you from the business\nI'm a combination of sun some cash and some some alone um so we wouldn't be and that Santa franchises as they're out we're going to go and then um we have a twenty percent down saved away for the home in a way we can\nYeah I Would really I'm I'm really\nAsking you to put that just on the shelf for now because when you start a new business you don't know what your cash flow needs are going to be you know you know the franchise people are going to promise you that oh yeah our trend line is you're going to be casual positive and how many months and they tell you\nI promise anything they show is their best guy their worst guy in their average guy in an even worse guy would be okay with us\nOkay All right well that's good I I\nAnd ... either you you say we as you and your husband are going to have either of you worked in the industry before that you're going to have this franchise\nWe have now so\nI'm just all a stop signs and red lights right now I'm OK fan of one of you going to work for one of the franchise is doing anything and everything for at least three months mhm because you got the rest of your life you can own the franchise\nBut I really like for you to a experience a one or both of you to experience the business before you're all away on\nOkay\nAnd I don't know if that's something you've considered but with any business whether it's a franchise or not having some experience when your money's not at risk\nYou there's so much you learn in a relatively short period of time that eliminates a issues concerns mistakes you might make once you're owning a ...\nYeah that makes sense\nSo I put your whole life on hold but you wanted to talk to about\nOkay [laughter] well um you know I respect your opinion and I thank you so much for your advice\nSure and I wanted to ask you one thing before you go the borrowing you're gonna do you say the SPA maybe\nThat's what we were thinking\nThat he would ... small local bank that you can go talk about your plans with\nFor a local and not yet know gather a recommendation\nWell that's just what I Want you to be about this I Want you out there talking to the there aren't as many small local banks if they're used to be a lot of them look like they're local really are just pretending and there are parts of bigger operations you want to a bank that you can grow with and that specializes\nHas people on staff that really know the SBA loan program and I would get out there and and started interviewing bankers you interviewed them\nLike you're interviewing them for a job\nNot like you're going hat in hand and say Mr ... bank or you want to lend us money you know you want to interview a banker and decide who it is you're comfortable working with a centrally being in business with\nThat climate is with us on the Clark Howard show that I get\nYour name right yes hello clerk Hi great to have you here\nThank you for what it is for the American consumer\nWhile you're trying to say that how can I serve you as an American consumer\nWell thank you are a lot of people are going to find my question humorous but I run a thriving waterfront vacation rental in North central Florida and because it sleeps Eighteen or more people I find myself buying lots of paper towels and toilet paper\nWhile you have a single rental but the people use as a party house would hold that many people or\nIt can do that it's a collection of story old Florida buildings that lake water make up a waterfront compound\nHow 'bout that it's pretty cool that\nIs neat and so just things like a consumer balls or eating up into some of your profit\nOr to a degree yes and I don't know whether to go to the local big box store or perhaps to an online a purveyor of these paper good\nI Believe you're going to get your best deal over time with the Sam's Club and Costco Wholesale\nExcellent\nYou know both of them have institutional supplies are you familiar with\nYeah both of them have institutional supplies are you familiar with how Cosco has the business centres\nYes and they approached me as a likely good candidate for their wholesale club and I just did not know what to think of that\nCause the business centres specifically deal with um a owner operators of small motels they sell 'em you know a facial tissue\nAnd private label and huge box quantities you know where you have the the size the individual boxes are smaller but they say you're a big quantities one time huge amounts of toilet paper all those kinds of things Sam's Club if you joined their premium membership\nHas a delivery service were you won't won't even have to go get it they deliver for free All right and when they have a periodic fail they will deliver to you\nAnd slams club also has a corporate a sibling cold jet and a lot of people who ran air being abused and things like that by their consumer bowls on jet dot com\nOr that direction I Will look into all of those options\nSo the good thing with jet there is no annual membership fee was sams and Costco both of them you have the membership fee so that's why a lot of people with a air being bees use jet 'cause they get what they feel are really good prices but they don't have\nAny membership fee they have to pay an Eighteen people and one rental at salt water you're listening to the Clark Howard show", "show_name": "Hugh
