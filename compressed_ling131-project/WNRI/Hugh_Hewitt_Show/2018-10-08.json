question about sixteen Seventeen years ago I was diagnosed with some thyroid problems I think it was I\nI always think button anyway I'm over time my uh the amount uh take up to one twelve now the industry where he is or whatever it's called\nThe rock center since rodeo mhm\nNow there's just wondering if uh I just recently retired my insurance before paid for ... choice and now that I'm not on that or and now my insurance or pay that much more um I live with Iraq's and is is there a difference in that I mean\nYou know a source who said that that's actually interesting question is you know first of all let's clarify the difference between natural thyroid and synthetic spy read your taking the synthetic thyroid\nWhich is fine for many people are however I find that some people don't do as well on it as on the natural ... so the natural pirate goes by ... different names or use Roy to armored thyroid a natural desiccated thyroid\nBut you know it sounds like you're doing okay on the synthetic by rate which is why they're generic ... or brand name since we're so little background on that\nIs that uh the makers of since Freud\nA undertook a study years ago to try and prove that their brand name since Freud was superior to the generics because I Would offer which are obviously offered them a competitive advantage I mean their product is more expensive and why would you want to take something more expensive if I'm there wasn't better\nSo the study of basically demonstrated that they were equivalent that health Roxanne generic was equivalent to since Freud\nAnd there was kind of a scandal because they tried to bury the study and the author of this study are actually came out it was kind of a whistle blower they they just told her up to the study was done okay you know that's where I Know I go home thank you were doing the study and they tried to suppress the results uh so uh\nHowever that being said some people do appear to notice the difference when they switch from center a delta rocks and often doctors say well you know where to save somebody will put you on the generic patients don't just feel the same it's different strokes for different folks uh the difference is in the delivery system\nThe amount of medication in a generic is always the same\nBut the tablet he may be different and for some people the way they digester absorb the medication the medication may hit them all at once or may be released in a slower fashion depending on the matrix in which the medications delivered that's what the differences between a brand in a generic\nAnd uh it makes a difference in how they feel 'cause thyroid if released all at once can give you kind of a\nRocket ship trip and then drop your back down and wants to wears off and you want it to be kind of gently time released into your system I think personally that it doesn't make that much of a difference when it comes to this particular product\nDifferent situation when you deal sometimes with psychiatric drugs some people say well I Do great with a lecture pro that is the brand name but the you know the generic\nOr doesn't do the same for me I always feel altogether different\nThat can make a difference as I said different strokes for different folks great question Jay stay well thanks for calling thanks for listening to us up\nTo Miami I'm Dr on how many seven seven seven to six
