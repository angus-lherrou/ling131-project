started looking at that ... that are clearing it also has it looks like a regular check and still had the account man by the by\nRight that is a great question okay so when you pay electronic bill pay most of the payments you'd make or going electronically not a paper check if you pay a small business or you send a payment to an individual\nThey're all they're going to do is they're going to rent or what they call a batch check they're going to present\nA electronic paper check on blow open they're going to mail it but as opposed to the things you pay are going to be paid truly electronic no paper\nOkay well I just noticed that some of them when they clear look like ...\n... some of them are some of them will be so much say you decided you just wanted to send me money Laurie uh-huh and you can you do go under your belt pay you put in my name my address and you decide to send me how generous of you today how much money to send me\nOh I don't know twenty five\nTwenty five bucks a huge

though\n[noise] okay I have a question for you yes my name is that really and I was just wondering what kind of ... out there for them to kiss\nIt is not easy for people in their seventies to find affordable life insurance because usually by the time somebody's in their seventies [noise] they've got something wrong with them some form of pre existing condition\nThat insurers are afraid of tell me specifically what is the insurance need for your parents\nOr to go with it as a show that that ...\nOkay you know older All right so when somebody dies and less debt is jointly held in most states the survivors are not responsible for the debt\nSo you don't normally have to have life insurance to deal with a let's say with a husband and wife only and trying to remember is that six states are eight states that are known as community property states\nUm everywhere else the debts of one state as the debts of that one and do not become debts of the out of their\nOwn life insurance is not something normally you would have to worry about um one thing I recommend with people who are getting up in years like your parents is that it's not a good idea to have joint credit cards\nOkay because we are joined credit cards what happens is the one dies the other is responsible\nAnd like uh if there's a car loan you don't want to have the car loan necessarily in both names ... so having\nThat that are separate as someone reaches um the later stages of life is something that is a better plan\nSo do your parents have a great deal of debts though\nA lot too much is this a but I'm Out ... are they called the leftist\nRight right so I'm so seeing believing this or have they talk through review what they want to have happen at time if they're passing\nIf they want to have a traditional funeral they want to have traditional burial they want to be cremated like it has a better family conversation since it sounds like you're the one who's going to be responsible and be helping out [noise] have you had those kind of conversations\nA ... is\nOkay we'll get on it All right so that's a conversation I'd really like you to have because nobody really seems to want to address the subject and you may be surprised that one or both your parents really do want to talk about it but nobody has gotten around to asking them\nOkay because that makes a difference as well you know if somebody says oh no we don't want anything fancy you don't go spend a lot of money on a funeral and this is what we want or whatever it gives you some peace of mind and understanding and also you know\nHow they feel about spending a lot or a little or whatever on final arrangements some people\nWant ... are very specific and weren't really fancy funerals with special things in them and whatever but the more you know the more you understand about that the better one other thing about that is there's a website I'd like you\nTo look at coal funerals dot org\nOkay and they're in much of the country there are these co ops that you can join for like almost no money\nThey give you access to much cheaper funerals much cheaper burials if somebody chooses cremation much cheaper cremation [noise] and so I you know when when someone asked me about how\nWhat should we be doing with our parents and their expenses and worried about that\nOne of the things that your parents tend to\nIsn't worried about that\nOne of the things that your parents tend to ask me about his this kind of stuff and that's why the more you know when you go to talk to him about what they want you're able to give advice and guidance and suggestions but\nI don't know that life insurance at this point really sounds like a big priority Steve is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Steve\nHey how ya doing great thank you Steve how can I be of service to you\nOh I've got to retirement planning question I didn't ... my wife is sixty two powerhouse switches value by an online service said just a little less than four hundred thousand dollars is completely paid off\nOur combined annual income now is about a hundred and sixty thousand kids are grown they're on their own um but my wife is retired should try and send and she's also working part time jobs I Do I write\nIn your wife is retired as a pension and is still working two jobs\nSix camps as soon as the definition of Taipei as a personal trainer and she was also working at a daycare center has blessed there is no stress and she loves that\nThat's neat okay\n'cause I work full time but I'd like to retire soon um we do keep track of those networks on one of the ...\nAnd I met with a check but this one is just about ... million that includes the value of the helps\nHow'd you know that was my next question [laughter] so you can literally listen I listen to it too much\nTo the house cannot generate income for you but a million dollars you have the way you figure that is you figure the million dollars will generate a and grow to cover inflation about forty thousand dollars a year\nAnd so if you base that that at this point would generate forty grand and your wife has a pension generating so much and at some point you do one or both of you will be eligible for Social Security\nWill will as soon as she is eligible now for the minimum I Believe but I think we'd like to weigh it\nShows you want to wait and you want to wait as long as you possibly can for both of you so the question ultimately is can you live on\n... theoretically forty grand coming from what you've saved\nThe money she has her pension but money both of you would have from Social Security and whatever part time stuff she and you do for a fine like she's doing it or 'cause you want to supplement income or you can live on that you can rest easy\nOkay that's a that's a curiosity is timing and an dollar amount at that a lot of reading and it says that or you can check between three and a half and four percent of what you've got a retirement account because it'll continue to generate an answer the question is yeah um you know what kind of planning services are available\nOr he'll go ...

I think the official end is going to be in September twenty Eighteen of or into the website and unless\nHave you been in the end let me explain that that's the end of the federal fiscal year the federal government was trying to get people to save for retirement\nIt was trying to get people to save for retirement and very small chunks that but there was a feeling that a lot of people don't really know where to start or what to do and so the Myra was a very simplified way\nTo put money aside that would be basically Ross IRA money\nAnd then if you got enough money then you'd have to move that era transition into Roth IRA anyway but the feds have decided to stay on the thing and kick you to the curb\nSort of they say they're going to transfer to quote unquote retirement clearinghouse enter whatever trend that she wanted to put a year\nAnd uh so my question is what my best point of action like most like lie dealing amount of money on their I'm willing to disclose its only eighty three dollars in there so\nI was thinking of putting it in a life saving the crowd well what's that sets you recommend to check for\nThe best all my savings account or is there an alternative\nWell what if she has this status or way to start doing your own Roth IRA\nThe only thing is I don't think I meet the federal requirements for all the IRA\nWell the only thing that would prevent you is if you're making too much money or you're not earning earned income at all\n[noise] I mean currently I'm a part time employee so I'm not sure I'm\nNot yeah you do it if you have earned income you can do a Roth okay and the beauty of the Roth is that the money in it is never taxed including the earnings have held to retirement\nSo even though you've only got a three dollars in this thing I Love it if you took do you have any cash sitting around that you could add to that\nTo put into a rough IRA\nMm\nNot at the moment maybe my next a check ...\nOkay so you can get it to a hundred and put a hundred and a raw and fidelity now has no minimum so I used to have ... ... thousand minimum trying to remember Schwab has a minimum I think they do\nBut if you were to open a Roth IRA and then when you're a part time earnings you put money in and then when you get to a position where you're working full time you've already got stabbed or she can\nHopefully get on a schedule of adding a meaningful money every month to it and build up some money\nIs there like a liar a deposit for each month or anything of raw or\nNo there's just a maximum you can put it on ... so hey Schwab won't work because there are minimum grand so I think fidelity which just eliminated is account minimums will be a great place for you to look at they have offices all over the place\n[noise] okay uh I really do appreciate

dollars\nWell now around the country recording the Orlando Sentinel a number of lawyers are facing broad complaints including one of the biggest operators or this or guy ever had questions about in the past maybe judged and Philips who has now been disbarred\nOr\nAre committing fraud against people telling them they were going to be relieved of their obligation for time shares\nThat easily go actions going on against the lawyers around the country are all being heard by the big time share developers so which brings us full circle time sure developers if you're so busy trying to get people\nTaken away from their profession or get people charged with actions or fraud because they're trying to help people get out of time shares don't you think the real thing here\nIs that you need to come up with a system where when people want to dump a timeshare you're there for them to dump it too\nBecause obviously a product that people buy bay cannot wait ourselves is something people

socializing and they just as soon as a cat and want to hide method high that's what kept to do catch a really affectionate animals as you well know self they're hiring downstairs where they're
