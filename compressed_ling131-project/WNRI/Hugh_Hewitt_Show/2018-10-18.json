autonomous\nAnd how great is that going to be\nDaniels with us on the Clark Howard show hello Daniel so how can I be of service to you\nYes so I was approached a with a co worker who has a great reputation in my book and she was talking about eight to me he was starting to work part time for and so forth so he said was scheduled time than him in a representative from this couple came on over to sell kind of catch life insurance and\nAh besides life insurance which will funds and getting out of debt and that sort [noise] uh and of course at the end uh kinda pitched a little bit about how they were taught fifty and a rapist towards a New York stock exchange that they are on and how I can work for them so far with that\nThey are the pay was not about necessarily buying the products although they'd like that but you selling for them as well\nCorrect okay they catch what they see my was you'd have to pay nine dollars\nFor a background check of what they stated a and from there\nAre a twenty five dollar technology she if she chose to use the technology for it now this company said that they are trying to help only middle class families a man that David also send you to your licensing or for the state to satellites life insurance and mutual fund et cetera with that\nMy my question was is if it was a legitimate company if they're legitimate\nPotential side income or just a regular MLM or a multi level marketing\nNo no this is a legitimate seller of mutual funds and insurance movies they were talking about those are completely normal there's nothing okay rip off or weird about them what you should know is that when people call me\nAnd the other side where they're saying hey I've had the salesperson offer me these mutual fund should I buy them and on that score I've said they're very very high cost funds so if you were coming to me as a customer for the product\nI Would tell you why is not a product I'm excited about it all\nOK but as far as selling it's not a scam is not a rip off um it's just an expensive way for someone to start to build up\nInvestments for the future and to buy insurance so okay does that help at all\nThat's all it does\nWhat does that make you think he wanted to do\nUh I Do like my normal job right now I should say or if it's not the best product that I don't want to and you're supposed to be helping families out Cho comfortable maybe selling that product it's not the best product out there for them\nGot it okay good for you and is is I'm Glad you have\nA specific reason that you're able to give them other than say will Clark said I shouldn't do it [laughter] not a bad okay [laughter] I got enough about going on [laughter] Andrew with us on the car coward show hello Andrew\nHello Clark how are you great thank you you have your retirement plan with the uh uh that's correct yes are you are a teacher a college professor or work for a nonprofit how'd you end up with them\nI was a teacher for fourteen years in public schools but I'm a college professor of seven years at this point so\nAnd so the University You're at offers to your retirement plans\nCorrect and they're very generous to they contribute to eight percent a year to our retirement\nAnd uh in addition to that I've been contributing roughly seven percent to that same retirement and the question I had for you as if that is really the best thing for me to do because the eight percent is really not a match\nIt gets contributed whether I contribute or not\nAnd I also have school credit card debt or that my family is a build up over the past couple years because of some health issues and medical bills as well as some damage that occurred to our house to water damage that we had\nIt was a medical bills as well as some damage that occurred to our house to water damage that we had to have repaired uh\nWell I'm Sorry yeah we've had a lot to deal with haven't you\nWell yeah but I mean life necessities you know you take them out as any chairs so uh so we have a but now we're I'm I'm sort of at the point where I Need to sort of figure out the best way to eliminate that credit card debt and I was wondering if I were best be served to pull that seven percent that I put into my retirement and use it to\nHelp pay that credit card debt off and I guess the overarching question is would I be better to even be putting any money into this ... or would I be better with Iraq once this credit card I\nKnow you know the the plan that Iran with the uh is so low cost did and it comes automatically out of your check I'm really comfortable with you doing that\nAnd at some point the uh may offer some form of a raw for three be\nInstead of going to traditional and you could consider at that time going into the raw version but going from the seven percent you're putting in to the zero and just picking up with the employer puts in what the university puts in there to concerns I have that I'll just lay out to you\nOne is that\nOnce you've reduce it to zero it's hard to get back to putting that money aside for your future and all the time you have that you're not putting money and you're losing the opportunity for that money to grow for you\nThe second thing is that and I'm Sorry both of these are so negative what I'm saying I just got away I'm Out the other is a lot of times if somebody does let's say take it down to zero and then you have that seven percent the sale added to your check\nWould be a little less than seven 'cause it would be pretty tax money going and now the net effect you maybe like five percent more bump into your take home\nIs does that five percent actually make it to the credit card bills are not a lot of times the money will somehow vanished before it goes to pay those bills\nSo you got to know yourself shore or compromise would be what if you cut your contribution to let's say three percent from seven\nSo you're still contributing to your retirement and you use the difference to go towards the credit card debt\nOkay and that's a thought because you'd still be saving roughly eleven cents out of each dollar with the employer money put in in what ... what you're putting in\nAnd then you can put your focus on getting that credit card debt pay down and I wish you the best with the uh with the medical situations and with the house\nAnd you're able to get

someone who's been rolled out for college or at a private school so I think our car courageous that is is you're already having to pay tuition\nYou pay to if you think are the right people and you get money taken from you that is no fun at all if you get any kind of notice saying that you owe money for tuition and to click on a link to pay a\nDo not click on that linked to pay\nInstead go to the school website itself outside of that email and check to make sure that there is actually an outstanding balance\nOr maybe there is an outstanding balancing if there is a ... point then you can pay it however you would from inside the school or universities website but don't ever\nEver not ever pay inside that out\nBecause well not that I'm Sorry up inside that email\nBecause the link may be completely fraudulent and your money takes a one way trip\nNever to be recovered and I have recovered from taking my teenage or off to college and she's settled in now and having a great time I've

doing\nGreat thank you Rick you want to talk credit cards\nI Do my wife and I wanted to apply for a new credit card to use strictly for our online purchases [noise] and uh the only way that we've seen to be able to apply for that card is on line\nAnd so we went online to fill out the application and our Social Security number or my Social Security number was required\nAnd you know we've always heard that you know never ever give out your Social Security number especially online so that is that legit to they can they require a Social Security\nCard because they've got to what I was just talking about with the credit scores they've got to run your credit and all credit reports and scores work based on your Social Security number\nOkay 'cause it's been so long since we've applied for a credit card I mean it was back in the paper days away\nReally Oh yes oh yeah I mean we have ...\nI don't know there is a way to fly by paper anymore\n[noise] well that that was the problem we couldn't find we couldn't find out how to get an application so uh I mean we've had you know there's terrorists we've had for well over Twenty years [noise]\nAnd now are very loyal customer know whoever you end up getting a card from it will be to their advantage to have you because there's a big expense for the banks getting a new credit card customer\nI've seen estimates as high as six hundred dollars a new cat sure new card\nIssued and marketing costs when they allocate it out to one new person\nSo you being loyal for so long they end up doing very well with you versus people card hop so if you want to make sure that you're doing it the safest way possible go to the actual website of whoever the card company is\nAnd do your application through that instead of in response to any email or anything like that kind of like when I talked about earlier with a scam with the tuition\nAnd and we've done that when we know we know the site where we want to go and so uh\nWe'll trouble that that is okay to do you know my thing about giving your Social Security number out is only in a situation where it makes sense and that would be a case where it makes sense because they have no other way to evaluate you\nTo decide whether or not your credit worthy and they want to issue a cart\nOkay thank you very last year\nI Hope you enjoy the new plastic\n[laughter] so [laughter] well they don't make any money off of us we we pay 'em off every month anyway\nThey don't tell them that [laughter]\nDo you with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Julie\nHi how're you doing\nI'm fine thank you how are you\nGood you have a question for me that I both welcome and dread at the same time\n[laughter] [laughter] yes yes yes I'm I'm a single mom and my Thirteen year old now needs braces I was given a code of almost six thousand dollars\n[laughter] and that really ... for me even though there is insurance and insurance will pay a little bit of it that covers only maybe that thousand dollars but the rest of the time\nI have to pay for and I cannot afford it I was wondering if it wasn't any sort of program that um you know low income families could get braces done\nOn a sliding scale said the Gary scale or even for free so I'm here to\nOkay so I'm not aware of any reduced rate programs based on income to get braces\nBut I'm about to step into something that whenever I mentioned that I'm asking for trouble but I'm going to mention anyway I'm about to tell you something that orthodontist hate and think that it is a danger\nThat it's creating a menace for your Thirteen year old but there are now a number of organizations\nThat fell braces over the Internet oh\nAnd they send you a mold that you take an impression of your Thirteen year olds T the mold kids tend to be like eighty two hundred or so dollars\nAnd so you take the impression and then they based on the impression make 'em make these um retain ers\nFor you that ah that your child would wear that these things that people are buying online ... costs tends to be depending on who you go with a thousand to two thousand dollars\nTends to be depending on who you go with a thousand to two thousand dollars so I think that's a huge reduction and cost\nAnd I am obviously not um [noise] an orthodontist and\nAll I can tell you is that they orthodontist think this is a horrifically awful terrible dangerous idea but people are doing it more and more\nOh I see okay so\nI I'm just want to introduce that what you make your own decision tell you that I Am unqualified\nYou if that's a good choice or not um I have you know both of my daughters went through braces they went the traditional way to an orthodontist it was the fortune you talked about to have a Thirteen year old son\nSeems to be fortunate to have faith that are really really straight and hopefully we'll space so\nThat need braces but this is the alternative bit again I have no personal experience with that I didn't do it to my kids but if you were to go on Google or whatever search engine you use\nAnd do 'em a search like a self self\nInstall braces or something like that you'll find there are a bunch of these companies selling these now\nOh wow okay [laughter] [noise] well um that's interesting to know I had never heard of that but I can still Google and just get the EMT though\nYeah um and make a decision if it's anything you want to get involved in a search that search term that in order to braces at home see if that works\nAnd you'll find and filed a working right now\nOh my goodness there are a lot of these companies oh well that are selling the self install again I Can't tell you if it's a good idea because I'm not a medical professional I can only tell you it exists\nAnd if I Do go with it I Will let you all know\nPlays I
