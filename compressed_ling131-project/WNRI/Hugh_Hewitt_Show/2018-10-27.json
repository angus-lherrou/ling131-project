boost scores that one counted as my second one\nOkay great questions so you're are you an authorized user or a co owner of that account with your dad\nLeave I Am an authorized user\nEyes so it depends on the scoring model an hour a credit card company would report whether that authorized users status would be a particular note for you I assume your dad's a great player and that's just good stuff for you on the report or neutral one or the other\nBut yeah yeah but you're working you're out there doing your own thing now yeah I Would much rather you get your own card another card yeah and then

you\nGreat thank you just plain old Clark is five [laughter] yeah so what's going on Josh\n... or so back in ... and Thirteen ah I've played for university football um they had me under full scholarship and\nDuring that first year or I received a back injury and oh I'm Sorry did it end you're playing career\nOr they will to play for about two more years and then eventually I had to have surgery and then that did and so yes there\nYuk what position did you play\nIt often to guard oh\nBut ... you can be because people are coming for ... every single down\nYes there but it's all worth it [laughter]\nSo I'll let you know and I'm near high when I decided I didn't like getting hit that was the same position I played I paid laid right off and sort of guard\nI played on the left side so\nThey were you obviously were much better than I was that you played through high school in three years of college\nI tried my hardest those those are sheer\nWell or so from that I'm gathering something looking back five years there's a hassle now\nYes sir Yes sir I'm hearing recently in two thousand Eighteen um I went to go and check my credit score on Experian and before I even got to see their credit score\nThat I saw to charges that were unfamiliar only a again our feet I was on her full scholarship um I have letters stadium that I should've been coverage for tuition ...\nFor the university should have been responsible for these medical charges that are from long ago\nYes sir okay\nYesterday and so now I is called the ah credit corporation to see what steps I can take 'em Dan so long ago\nAnd now the university has a whole new stuff\nSo that makes it a a quite difficult to communicate with them um and it seems to me that they of course kind of drug this cheat a little and would I've gathered from the credit corporation is that um is even if I go ahead and just have this myself\nI'm it will mark the mark as paid them all for the next month but the dams credit score will ask for six years and a lot to\nSay I and you're getting close to the end of that yes so um as far as you paying a bill that was never your legal responsibility\nI Would recommend that you not pay okay and not have any further contact with the collection agency odds are in almost every state in the country you're outside what some of the statute of limitations and you can't be sued against that\nThose unpaid medical bills and but it is an obligation university had and even with the turnover and personnel\nI Would suggest that you make a call to the head of the alumni association\nOr ... or the head of the booster club for the football team okay you know 'cause the ones that are involved with the booster clubs they are intense\nAnd they are very influential on a college campus and where others are are avoiding responsibility for a bill that belong to the university people in the booster clubs may be able to get the university to do what they should have done originally and should have hop to once notified by you\nKnow sing okay but otherwise if the university just blows you off it means that when they try to hit you up for alumni contributions or they don't get those from you know for a but is as far as the bill let the clock run cars so little time is left\nOkay All right so it's a question just just to follow up the the actual money that is owed even after that term is up and it goes away from my credit score does that money stay on my head\nNo so remember as far as being on your head if you will once the time period is passed to be able to sue against the debt basically it's just a reputational thing which is what it is now and then that repeats\nIt really it's just a reputational thing which is what it is now and then that reputational thing and at the they said six years eleven months and I've never heard that is the exact time usually out here six years now and are seven but anyway it goes away\nIt doesn't mean that at some point or was it was a scavenger collector may ten Twenty years from now contact you about it but you have no obligation in any way shape or form or fashion and it can not be used in any way to harm your credit wants to seven years is run\nInterests and okay\nSo you can rest pretty easy about this because the clock doesn't have much to run okay but if you want to try to get the bill paid hit the pressure points at the university okay\nAnd best to you as one fellow offensive guard to another one who was good at the game and one who was not namely me\nDawn's with us on the car coward show Hi dawn\nHey they're\nDawn you have a question for me about credit let's see if I can be of help\nOkay so um I've got a good credit rating but and and not paid off my credit cards that feeling great about that\nBut I've got one more credit card that's got a pretty large balance on it and I'm trying to find a maybe a credit card company that I can transfer that get from the higher one to maybe one with a zero a PR start twelve to Eighteen months I'm\nGetting me time to head off the interest charges are astronomical\nSo there are fewer of those offers right now than there were a year ago and the reason is that interest rates have risen\nAnd its costs and credit card companies more money if they extend zero percent to you\nSo what you you may find here or there is zero percent transfer but they act they often will ... interest in it within up front usually four percent of the of the balance you're transferring that they didn't give you the twelve or Eighteen months interest free\nRight yeah I've seen that and I'm willing to do that that that I can transfer the ballot gay think that that's just not a good idea\nTo no no that's a fine idea if you think you can kill off the balance in a year and a half if that's the offer then yes go for it because right now you're looking at an interest rate mid teens\nYeah yeah so if you take something from somewhere in the mid teens and you take it down to you pay the upfront I so I don't know what the actual and Putin interest rate would be but obviously a lot less than paying Fifteen Seventeen Eighteen percent\nI Would go for it as long as you down or certain you'll be able to wipe it out in the interest free period because the problem is after that period the rates tend to boomerang really high on those zero percent offers\nYeah I'm confident that I can do that but um I don't know where a lot I see ads for things all over the place so I don't know you know was on a sweat not\nWell do you have a credit sesame or credit ... are both dashboard set up I don't set up both of those and based on your credit profile you'll see offers available and you'll be able to see what might be there for a\nZero percent balance transfer\nPerfect and also if you are you a member of\nAny credit union\nI Am not\nBecause I was gonna say sometimes credit unions will offer social effectively lower rate on a credit card that it works kind of like doing a balance transfer cause you drop it from a mid double digit and the teams down to single digit rate\nYeah I looked at that I looked at that I just didn't you know just so many options out there you can get ... sometimes\nAlerted completely are like a ... that's ... that sounds great\nOur best to you and I wish you the best getting rid of that debt\nNino Romano is

a bank and you should really think long and clear about whether or not you want to do business with them\nBut the thing with the CDs\nThe federal regulators are solidly with the Wells Fargo were any bank it wants to set ugly rules on CD\nThat if you don't on a timely basis\nRedeem a CD and think about for the bank\nIf you have a five year CD and you forget about it and you don't go into the eight

are you today great thank you Patrick you got a bill shock\nA big bill shock what happens you well I got my\nWe know from my car insurance the other day and found that it had gone up sixty percent\nSix zero\nSix zero percent we're both retired and uh we have excellent driving record so I've had the restriction of course caused our person\nAnd found out that with a credit for and they raised me from a ice you probably know about this how bracket tend to uh bracket twenty because I had my credit frozen\nRight the insurer has the ability to do what's known so soft hit check on your credit even with that frozen so our ensure his lead you down\nWell I'm sure I mean sure let us that and the other thing about that too\nIs that I go through an agent and she didn't know anything about it so she was talking to the company about this and they said oh we have to pull all three reports and we need ten days to do this\nSo either of course I'm afraid is fair to airports so now I'm just waiting for the company that come back with another quote\nTo have you considered this company is providing such bad customer know service why don't you have your age are in shop other companies\nAre eight and does shop for other companies but\nYeah but I mean right now while you're credits ...\nWhy don't you have your agent shop you with multiple companies right this moment where any company would be able to check your credit dress like they're doing but there were some of the higher doing wrong at this ensure because once you're already their customer\nThey are allowed to check your credit even when it's frozen\nSo they're doing something wrong administratively so while it is thought I'd\nHave your age your shop with multiple companies\nI contacted by credit in and they ah they

you have to make up that thirty six hundred\nIn the next sixty days or you end up paying massive tax for not being able to make that up so what you do with whoever you would go with\nIs vale do paperwork that will move the money directly from the old employer's plan straight into wherever you're going to have the IRA\nAnd an ear recommend an IRA or the Ross are a ... I just I hear you talk about yeah I just [noise]\nI said the story is you can't take money there was in a traditional four one K.\nAnd put it into a Roth without having a big tax bill because all that money they don't end was pre tax correct so you go into a traditional i._r._a. without money not a Roth IRA okay and you can over time migrate the money\nFrom the traditional to her office you could afford to pay tax on money cheer or you know you got money that they are that's going to grow\nTax on money cheer or you just know you got money that they are that's going to grow over the years that you're going to have to pay tax on some day now let's talk about the other one the seven thousand is bad in a big employers plan or small\nBut it's a very large employer or their trail the stock exchange\nSo is a big employer the odds favor that that will be an extremely low cost plan probably lower than you could find in an IRA okay\nSo are the only exception to that would be if they have that money administered by an insurance company for them the four one K. or buy a bank\nIt's it's it's it's just through one of the three that you mentioned\nEarlier and you could just leave at seven behind him move the Eighteen\nOkay and then as far as contributing to that and you're able to contribute straight to the IRA versus trying to go through that\nBack in a way through great question so let's say let's hate this simple I in fact let me let me really think about this who is the company that administers the plan for the big publicly traded company used to work for its vanguard\nSo if you wanted to keep it simple\nUm move both of them to vanguard in an IRA and just be done with the old employers for one case 'cause it was with vanguard the cost will be low enough as an individual anyway and then you've got the simplification of just having an IRA there\nAnd then at vanguard open a raw for any future contributions\nTo you all have the twenty five to grow and a vanguard IRA\nAnd then you open a new account with vanguard for Ross in any current or future contributions he may go into the raw\nOkay and then those can be the so just so I'm Sorry I I'm not a hundred percent up to date on all these states that Iraq is post tax correct\nExactly yeah and you're already going to have twenty five grand that center pre tax account you want to have money in a post tax accountant or raw truly great to have a mix of both but tilted more towards the raw\nThis'll be a way for you to do what you simplify your life you just have an IRA vanguard a Roth IRA vanguard old money and the IRA new money and the Roth IRA and that would be a good way for you to build up money going forward\nChris is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Chris\nHey Clark thanks for taking my call\nSure you've got a puzzle you want to see if I can find the pieces for\nHis or a wife and I were looking at twenty Nineteen health plans I'm currently we're we're all on a family plan under lined health insurance however the like how many starts search hurting a surcharge for a spouse that's able to get health insurance through their employer\nAnd using round numbers it's roughly fourteen hundred dollars a year so it's like ... and then see myself in the premiums would be nine hundred versus including her which would be Eighteen hundred on top of that fourteen hundred dollar surcharge and\nSo she's nine hundred extra month plus an additional fourteen hundred dollar surcharge a year\nCorrect so she's ten eight a lemonade twelve twelve thousand something a year for health coverage through your existing employer ... how much is it for her if she goes on her employer's plan\nThe eleven hundred a year\nOr eleven hundred a year versus twelve thousand a year\nOr a versus on twelve hundred additional on top of love for the family plan\nAnd then I say too is if we both take\nOur company ... plans that are both high deductible plans on line three thousand dollars but the company in San ... the employees are two thousand a fleeting roughly a thousand dollar to cover for that ...\n... or ... or hers is five thousand but it would cover one hundred per cent lunch that's let so it was the main course will still keep the whole family under one aired or should we each take our own plan and then just tried to maxed out a a annual age essay calling Nineteen", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Woonsocket", "day": "27"}
