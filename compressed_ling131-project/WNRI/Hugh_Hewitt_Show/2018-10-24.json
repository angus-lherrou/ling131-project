Larry you want to ask about something that uh that I have been into for a long time for at least oh how many years now at least twelve years and that solar right [noise] what are you thinking of doing Larry\n[laughter] well I I just started looking into it and I was talking about doing solar for residential house and I'm trying to compare the options of the ... you know the ... time they say they're your distributor say it's about nine years [noise] and whether it's worth it or whether it helps the resale value of your house\nAnd to finance is whether it's easier to pay cash or two years or one of the suppliers of money that they'll supply to the interest rate or just information of that nature\nYeah so whether you're buying so or will automatically pay off for you\nIs and I know and it's hard to say for sure I've done it just because I Believe that it's part of our future and I was willing in spite of how cheap I Am\nWith things that involve energy I'm really willing to put my wallet to work even if I don't get the pay back so I'm a participant in that area so\nWhen I installed solar panels were much less efficient than they are now and they cost more than they do now so hey the numbers are far more favorable to you putting solar\nThan it was when I put in software last decade\nSo I'm just because the numbers are much more favorable doesn't mean it's going to pay off for you because the questions that come up is ah what kind of good southern exposure do you have you have a road when your house\nTo house faces west a nurse who cable roof is facing directly south and I had one representative come look he said yeah that's okay so\nYou don't want more than one that's the most important thing I've learned about solar is that\nYou get multiple quotes and most people feel comfortable once they've gotten two or three\nWith so or if there are let's say five active so we're installation companies in your area I Want you to a quote from all five because you don't worry things just through talking with the sales people\nAnd you don't want to just let them go look at your property and give you a written quote you want to walk the property with him he want to be talking to him you want to learn how they decide where to place how they decide if your property is um an efficient enough one and it ... and\nAt the U.S department of energy website you should be able to find a information about how to him or how to figure out your pay back not based on what they tell you but what you were able to see for yourself\nAnd where's that website to\nUm I Try to remember if it's on Energy Star dot of our energy dot Gov a producer Joel was checking right now we're talking on the issue of paying for it if you are in a position to pay cash pay cash and just be done with it you're going to get thirty percent of that back\nAs a federal tax credit with your next federal tax returns right and as far as whether it increases the value of your home or not when you go to sell it it depends whether in the area you live\nThere's a culture of installing solar if there is then people ascribe value to you having cell were on your house\nAnd the only study done was done out west that found that the average installer so we're led to a Seventeen thousand dollar increase in the value of the home but if nobody around you does sell where\nThey may not see the value in it so you would have to make your own case with what your utility bills are\nRight [laughter] well I live in the south east insist emerging air as far as I can tell there's a few houses and in this neighborhood that have it already\nAnd he was talking to any of your neighbors to get any sense of power bills before and after\nI Am going to the guy wants to talk to wasn't home and I tried but like you mentioned I'm just starting this process so I Will\nDo to him yeah All right so the more research you do the more ... comfortable you'll be with the decision you make uh-huh and it I mean one of those things not to do impulsively\nOh yeah [laughter] for sure [laughter] have you got paid back on years I Know you said you had an older sister ... is a ... where are you happy with it well for like you thought it would\nIt's it's better than I thought it would be and we're saying really really nice reduction and power bill but it's going to take me I'm even with the credit it's gonna take me and its energy dot com where you find the guide going sour\nBut it it's going to take me and its energy dot com where you find the guide to going solar okay I'm going to take me it looks like fourteen years to get paid back\nHave you talked to anybody who's done his recently and then their payback time or they're asking me to pay their\nNo you know I don't know how often people actually figure it out you know I don't know there there are people I'm sure that are that are really numbers oriented that really do thorough research\nLifetimes what people do is they say no or they live in a part of the country that that is suitable for saw were and they install a system they get back to thirty percent\nAnd they're really comfortable with what they save on bills every month but that's more subjective an object to and that's why you want to look at this energy guide see if you can figure out what kind of payback you'd have\nWhere you live in the south east I can tell you for me what's great\nIs writing a very small checker no check at all\nFrom my power bill in a month is fantastic\nAnd is it up is with us\nUp welcome to the car cowards show hey Hi how you doing I'm doing a lot of a ... it's great to have you here how can I serve you\nOh you didn't get a real estate bubble I guess you know and I felt was a few years ago\nScientists at a couple of properties or their condos a lot on our land and uh the\nThe market is doing it in a good now and then what came up and uh uh I have a boat or a loved by a both and to the property now and a lot of them I Do want to continue to do investment in the last day so\nThat Congress not what I have is a is it a good time to get out of this show and I get the cash and make or\nI got the next opportunity or or should I just I didn't hear the whole of them are and maybe a a friend or\nA you know All right\nLet me tell you how I feel about this\nI own a first foreclosure I ever bought I bought in Nineteen Seventy eight I still own it today and I've been through thick and thin with real estate markets and all that but there's\nNothing that appears any way possible that we're going to have another real estate bust\nLike we had the last decade\nThere were so many unique factors that led to that fit there's nothing I can see\nThat would lead to where these properties that you bought at a great time have gone way up in value that there's going to be a a down wave coming I don't see that\nSo you may not see increases and value moving forward like you've had there may even be small dips in value from time to time but the question is are the properties in a condo buildings in the neighborhoods\nThat are getting better or the neighborhoods declining because that's how I decide\nWhether I Want to keep a place or dump one\nAnd have a really good perspective on what local government can do but it's currently not doing too I Want to thank you for your loyalty and your commitment to our community and tell you above all else you matter\nAnd I will continue to recognize your challenges and support legislation that protects your investments and cultivate your grow ... as a business owner and manager of money and\nMy favorite employee was always the one that require the least amount of maintenance man the one who came in knowing what needed to be done and did it consistently efficiently and what appeared to be\nIt was always a sure thing to me\nThis person had done their homework\nThey knew that crashed into this was an employee I greatly values and wish to retain Mm\nThe past two yet it hasn't been all rainbows modified and I've heard my fair share of criticism I thank you all for that as well because it's helped me to ... I have interface with thousands of people over the years Mm\nSome stronger than me some richer some modern and some not and I learned in a crowded room you cannot really tell who is to do it it's always best to stay last and do more\nI thank you for your time and make I continue to ... to bless are beautiful great country a beautiful city and this humble servant with your vote on November ...

or at the stadium and it will be filled with people and it would be you know\nAll kinds of people that are coming out to find out\nAre the ones that are engaged you are the ones that we can count on you were the ones that are here so you ought to be applauded for that\nOf it's also thank you for being here and\nIn two thousand and sixteen I was elected to the one soccer city councilman\nKinda surprised I got elected because I just wanted to serve my city again and I was really hopeful that I Would and I did and I was so grateful when I when\nThe past two years and I've been able to serve the city and\nAs a city councilman but also in the community\nRotary Club in other clubs nice Columbus\nDoing good work in the city ...\nPast two years has given me the ability to connect with some of the most positive people some of the most incredible people in this community that come out and just give a\nLove themselves each and every day it really is a fantastic thing so I've been exposed to some of the best people and these have been some of the best two years of my life\nAnd what you hear a lot about his collaboration\nI guess the question is who doesn't want\nI think we all do I think our differences or\nWhat makes us special\nYou know we all come from different walks of life on the city council right\nWe all bring different perspectives and\nHave different opinions and sometimes we agree and sometimes we disagree\nWhat that is is a\nOf ideas all coming together and trying to find the best one and I think that's what we do and that's what I was taught to do in the past\nTwo years on the city council ...\nThe past two years to do some really good things and I agree with um\nThe fact that we have a high commercial tax rate in\nThis council over the last two years this past very responsible budget ... a\nVery good for the ... but also very good for the commercial right and we've tried to trend that\nWere successful ones not so successful twice Mm\nI think budgeting is so important as learning how to learn how to be able to pass a responsible budget ...\nOf the things I wanted to do was hold our elected leaders accountable\nThe mayor is whether it's\nAaron polls beer or Kevin Coleman or ... or ...\nIf you're the executive you have to be accountable for your actions and the city council because they've house ought to be it's a\nFor its actions and I believe that we need to hold\nActions are interactions and\nYou've got to school too many candidates here tonight\nThat's because this council thought it was important to go back to an elected school committing\nAs attorney one of my skill sets is his writing legal documents and I was able to reduce the legislation and moving\nWall forward on getting us back to an elected school committee so now you've got candidates here tonight\nThankfully the referendum passed overwhelmingly and that's where we are going\nAnother very important issue that we're working on his renewable energy and where\nGoing to be able to generate and save the city ...\nMillions of dollars and that's a big accomplishment before this counseling and something that I spearheaded on the a renewable energy stumped committing\nSo these are all things that I think\nAre really important as we move forward and I pledge to work\nGets elected should I get reelected\nBecause I think it's really important to be able to say Mm\nAfter the election when this was all done thankfully I Know your outfit and I know we all are when this is all done that we can just work together to\nThere's going to be arguments there's going to be disagreements\nAnd that's okay that doesn't mean\nThat we're not collaborating\nThat the point we have to be able to know build a deal\nPositively with our our differences and\nSo I guess what I'm saying is and I hope you'll find that over the last two years my service to you or\nBeneficial that you'll grand me two more years to serve in the city council if you do I will be both humbled and grateful to return and serve you as best as I possibly can and trying to make you proud so thank you very much and thanks for being here [noise]\nFor a few times I got to bring them down at night to me it's one of the moments John ... is going to\nAfter John Ward we have\nDan gender\n...\nLike this go Crazy Brave that\nAnd I'm asking for your support on November sick to allow me to Hawaii is to do that\nAnd to bring forth more responsible budgeting better funded in resources for the city or when socket and in any cost of living that we can all afford and with that I think you and ask the support on November sex\nLike you're damned gender and uh we do have a James ... coming up to speak and following James will be Richard ... and that will uh be the final or city council candidate then we'll move into our mayoral candidates change color\nLike\nMy name is James kind of where I've been on the city council now\nNearly two years in December will be\nA two two years I'm\nSo look you\nA record you know I Am and you can watch the meetings and you can read the papers you can\nDo the blogs the whole nine yards around\nMy philosophy is very simple\nBeing on the city council meeting the mayor\nBeing involved as a city official it's a serious job with a serious business um\nOne hundred and forty plus million dollar business not counting the enterprise funds so serious and and\nWhat we do is elected officials has an impact on people\nSo again we have to take it seriously and\nAnd what you'll get from age I'm ... very simply is I Will take the job seriously although my sleeves up or do the hard work that's necessary and I'm going to read the documentation I'm\nTo ask questions I Want to push a challenge and this is one thing I Know for sure um\nWhich is true in life everywhere in business and family and city government et cetera\nHas all the answer is no one person is going to lead us to the promised land\nCan give you a silver bullet and it takes a group\nHeard it conflicts in Murray and referred to it everybody talks about collaboration and working together\nAnd again in theory who doesn't um but it's required but that doesn't mean\nThat doesn't mean you always have to agree and there's nothing wrong\nHaving disagreements\nBecause not everybody's always right they're not everybody's always wrong\nOr you can agree to disagree respectfully hopefully some times strongly sometimes not so strong\nBut it's okay to have disagreements\nBut it's always necessary to do the hard work that's required to make the right decisions or at least in the best decisions you possibly can\nBecause it affects people's lives are\nWe heard from some of the schools I heard\nThe school committee earlier they suggested that one of the biggest issues the school department has its poverty I tend to agree with that\nAnd what that means is we don't have to make the burdens any worse\nThan they already are people in the city not everybody but there's enough people in the city that struggle financially we are in distress community where not all rich so again from my perspective we have to take it seriously and make sure the decisions we make do not make like any harder for people\nSpend more time you know who I Am most of you I have a record you know you're going to get I'll do the job I work hard we may not always agree but I promise you I'll do my homework I work with people as much as people work with me and I will insist\nNot only for myself but for my colleagues that we make informed fact based decisions not based on emotion but based on facts and data\nAnd that's you know get from age I'm going to make you very much and lastly I like to thank the host\nThe Marlins as well as W when I arrived\nThis event and I thank you all of a coming our going to be very honest it's a much better turnout than I expected it's very refreshing making\n[noise]\nThank you James ... final city council candidate making his presentation Richard fattening\nGood evening ladies and gentlemen\nMost of you know me my name is Richard factor\nOn soccer for sixty seven years and married for forty two years and I've\nBeen with the same woman for forty five years I have two adult children that went to the one socket school systems and\nI went there so did my wife and now my grandchildren are going down and\nAlways prepare myself but I don't usually follow\nTheir sixteen I came out with this card\nAnd basically it was what I ...\nFight against wasteful city spending become affairs defender of the city's taxpayer dollars were full time as your councilman never know when we make voters decision that would harm the taxpayers the citizens of ...\nBut normally make voted decision that would harm the taxpayers the citizens of one so I can\nCompleted all those ...\nIn two thousand ten eleven\nTo serve in some capacity or\nSo I could give back to my ...\nAnd he had an opening on the zoning board or review and I\nAnd it wasn't a stepping stone\nBecause I never thought in my lifetime I Would run for power ...\nI just felt that is not was wasn't what I was or\nI Am but when the budget commission came into two thousand twelve if everybody remembers when\nForty forty three percent\nTo family everybody else supplemental tax on the vehicles five quarters and we still have supplemental packs right now\nAre two point five million dollars that's built into the base yearly I remember at the time going in fighting at every budget commission meeting\nWould have been a forty two percent loss for the people who could not afford that why did they come up with the homestead exemption back in the day because the people in the city couldn't afford to pay the taxes Mm\nAnd right now\nBetween the Seventeen percent from forty two to twenty five and the ... the supplemental tax that equals six percent\nWe're still behind by twenty three percent so that's what I through my head in the ring and I said I'm going\nTo run for city council I'm going to be independent I'm going to make a difference\nWants didn't make it then I ran against a Mr Steve Casey\nBecause that seat was the people's seat\nI wanted to get it back and he only beat me by a hundred and thirty forty votes but you know what I wasn't deterred I said okay I'm going to\nRun again ran where I should say to sixteen\nWork real hard because I wanted to represent the people like me miss the average citizen\nThat we were being abused and beat up by taxes\nAnd I pledge that I Would work hard to do everything it was a tough situation for me because I'm not used to\nPlay nice with people sometimes um\nAdmit it but I got to work I rolled up my sleeves I made some mistakes\nOf my track record and I\nPapers over there anybody wants to grab\nOne show you what I've done the last twenty two months ...\n\nFive ordinances that benefit the citizens\nMm\nI'm independent I came into this how soon to sixteen by myself\nAnd I'm In this race to get reelected by myself\nDon't think the council should have a team what any team the only\nTeam that I Want to be on as a citizen state\nThey voted for only two years ago and I'm working for that take that pain that voted for ...
