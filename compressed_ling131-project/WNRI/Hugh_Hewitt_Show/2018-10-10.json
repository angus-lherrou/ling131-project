your score potentially some but it depends on the scoring model being used how much effect it has so the newest scoring models like the newest psycho model\nGives you a good bump into your credit score if you take an active collection and\nSatellite pay it and it's now report is a zero balance but the lender has to be using the newest model of the psycho scoring which just completely depends on the credit grander\nYeah so it's not whether one of the three credit bureaus are using the latest model it's based on the credit union and what they're even\nExactly so as an example the one that takes into account how you handle past was excused the term what they would call bad behavior and you've turned it or you've turned it around and you've taken care of something the model known as spike of nine\nIs the one that the credit union would have to be using as I understand it for there to be a meaningful impact on your score paying off and old I\nMean generally wants an old item hit seven years that vanishes anyway\nMy follow up on that is a one of the items that in collections is from ... eleven but it looks like one on my credit report and now shows twenty Fifteen like maybe there was some way to the gate got refreshed or is that\n... that is the term that I use for it and that is an illegal activity on the part of whoever is reporting that debt unless you took some kind of action on it and twenty fifteenth so what you do is you challenge the date was known as the date of last activity for it\nGot it and generally they don't want to fight with somebody who knows that's how the rules work that's how the law works so you would challenge that item not being on your report but the date\nThat that item is on your report because the aging of it is so important and you contact both whoever the collection agency is reporting it as twenty Fifteen instead of twenty eleven you challenge with them and the credit bureau\nGot it okay so ... how many I was there that are these old items and collection\nOf depends on which bureau I have as little as two one zero and as many as four and another one\nIn or they generally in the age back like early this decade or some of the more recent\nThe most recent one I Would say is four to five years ago\nOkay so that one's got a little clock time to run\nBut the thing is is that the whole idea of credit scoring is that you're not in a credit purgatory forever the ones that period of time passes even if you don't pay on the debt they disappear and you have a fresh start\nSo you're getting closer to that but settling the ones in particular that are more recent would be to your advantage if you're trying to get credit right now\nExactly so the first thing for me it was just talk to the credit union and just ask them if they're using the\nOnline and the person you talked to a loan officer that will know if it's just somebody at the credit union they're not going to know\nAnd you ask them how did they make a determination on making alone\nIn the event that you have a zero balance is on these old items will that change the loan approval process for them\nThere is a great explanation about what happens with older items on credit reports at a website you may have heard me mentioned from time to time credit sesame dot com go read their briefing on what happens with a collection items and the different scenarios that apply Jim joins us on the Clark Howard shown Jim\nYou have an idea you want to share with your fellow listener about emergency savings bond says that true\nThat's true so Clarke I er I already\nMax out my retirement or a threw rocks and I ... and I've got a money sitting in the emergency fund obviously for emergency [noise] but uh it's a pretty good chunk of money and I was toying with the idea of taking maybe I don't know half of it\nAnd putting it into\nA target retirement fund that\nEither recently passed knowing that the you know that they're trying to keep someone who is retired or about two or tired or try to keep their money you know from from going down obviously I Know there's no guarantee that I was wondering what your thoughts were as doing something like that in order to maybe for a little bit of money on that\nI think that that is a very low risk strategy to try to goose the return on your rainy day money right and so going into a post retiree portfolio which is what you're doing I think that's a very viable strategy\nObviously a someone who's already in retirement they've they've moved more towards\nObviously a someone who's already in retirement they've they've moved more towards bondsmen stocks I noticed the interest rates go up bond won't be looking so hot\nThat is true but you know the whole idea about how they do one of those portfolios is where I mean you can even go into a balance fun that's fifty percent stocks fifty percent fixed income or bonds and the ideas that the risk counteract each other you'd have to have a perfect storm\nFor you to lose a substantial amount of money with either scenario\nAnd even though you're a hundred percent correct this interest rates rise the value bonds will go down if you're concerned about that you could build your own portfolio using an a short or ultra short bond fund\nAnd using a lower risk stock portfolio stock fund portfolio and eliminate a lot of the bond interest rate risk\nBut the idea of as somebody who's a Mac saver like U. of taking a lot of your rainy day money and investing it at a low risk kind of point of the scale I think is great\nChris is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Chris how can I serve you today\nWell I'll tell you what for years I've been thinking about lasik surgery surgery and I keep upgrading my glasses every year year and a half and got the point now a doctor or a regime [laughter] I cannot seem so many price ranges\nA Somali dollar and then there's some said I'm going in was low dollars are not just want to know all the way to go\nSo this is this is a tough one because this is where the wallet meets medicine and science so there are high volume chains are used to be a a lot more through the shakeout phase with lasik\nBut there are the volume chains that charge like two fifty three hundred three fifty and I yeah and then there are the boutique places that do lasik they charge several thousand dollars and I\n... and this one is one of those things that does not have a\nRight answer when you go to the high volume chains you have the benefit that the uh the ... just doing the procedure dies a ton of them and there's an advantage\nWith medical procedures when someone has a great deal of experience\nBut also you are in a basically a factory and assembly line and if you have\nIssues or problems later the difficulty you might have with one of the high volume discounters is there any follow through is extra any what they call the euphemism enhancements\nEnhancements means and lasik surgery okay a lot of people may not be aware that after you have an I'd done you may need a follow up surgery that it that it may not have gone exactly as planned and with a high volume discounters\nYou will usually pay every time they do any kind of follow up\nWith a with a boutique practices where you pay a much higher price up front\nIt tends to be a more personalized experience\nAnd more time will typically be spent with you pre qualifying you as a candidate\nAnd then doing the procedure and as a general rule it's not ever going to be a hundred percent but it was a general rule all follow up is included in

I got the plan for you the money that she's going to make net of whatever childcare expenses you have the entire rest of the mountain goes towards the credit card debt\n[noise]\nAnd that is that is the simple as back of the envelope way because then it's not trying to figure okay so we should send put so much money here and so much money there and I'm a big fan of\nDoing a ladder or where you pay the minimum ... towards the lowest interest rate credit card debt you have and what's the highest DEA of one of those like screaming highlight Mount Everest twenty five percent\nA no luckily no we do have some of the store cars that we try to you and then pay right off just with a hard [noise] um but it's um [noise] twelve nine twelve nine\nNine oh that's great so you're not paying back breaking interest so that means of your payments an enormous amount of your payment will go towards principle yes that's great what's the lowest rate you have on a card\nOr not you know I think it's around nine\nOkay so uh pretty close spread in that case without a big gap in the interest rate from highest the lowest you could do something that a lot of people find psychologically rewarding and instead pay minimum against\nAll your cars except the one that has the lowest balance and white that one out because you don't have that much interest rate swing from one to another psychologically for a lot of people it feels better when you were able to get rid of a card and how many cards total do you have\nA lot and I have four [laughter] oh you only have four in total\nOr she has one in\nFive so whatever the lowest balance on one of them is put your big efforts from her new paychecks and to that says that's paid off go to the one of the next lowest balance and that way you feel like you're really making progress as the balance comes down what's so nice when the overall balance comes down\nEach check that she gets has so much more impact\nAs a percentage of the overall remaining balance now another strategy you can do is the thing I talk about paying down your debt and Thirteen months\nWhere your goal would be in this case you pay a roughly a thousand dollars a month for thirty months and end up completely credit card debt free\n[noise]\nPeople can see their way to uh thirty month go you start looking sixteen months it gets a lot harder [noise]\nThe goal you start looking sixteen months it gets a lot harder [noise] I don't know if she's going to earn the kind of money at the job she's taking that she net out enough money for you to throw a thousand that the cards\nYeah I'm not I don't think so are you going to be gained from\nIowa so the the net amount so take then that amount and just keep attacking it and I promise as you see the balances come down you feel so much better\nAnd you have so much more sense of control so the amount you owe is a burden but not a backbreaking one so I I Wish you the best way that I Love it if next spring you call me back\nOr let's do a checkup and see what kind of progress made with the credit card balances any suggestions I might have at that time ... joins us Jill you need some advice for your mom is that right\nYes I actually just wondering whether I I'm a very harmful or ... or somebody you know up there in age [laughter]\nHow old is your mom eighty one eighty one okay so she is she's a typical eighty plus driver she's driving a somewhere around twenty five hundred to five thousand miles a year\nWithout ... that would be her so the car she has first I'd like to know it should it be replaced is there anything wrong with the car she has currently\nNo not really I just had a couple you know let minor ... I Know it it it could show that we needed to\nSo the reason I ask is that if somebody is driving that small amount of miles unless she was just tired out of that car you know she hates it or she's bored by it and she wants to spend the money is better at the very very very low mile or she's driving to just keep driving back\nA little bit for her that's the problem\nOkay so the question of buying or leasing we sing would not work\nBecause driving a couple of hundred miles a month end up so far below the mileage cap on at least that we have is completely on economic the best move for someone in your mom situation is to buy a three year old used car\nOkay because the years take so much value off a car and if she buys a brand new car drives a couple of thousand miles a year at the end it three years even though she hasn't driven a whole lot the value of the vehicles been driven way down\nSo if instead buys a three or four year old car\nThat already somebody else already took a lot of the value off it doesn't matter if that car has forty fifty thousand miles on it because three more years she might not have had a you know close to sixty thousand the cars still a baby right does that help\nOkay that help it helps a lot of them on\nOne additional suggestion because the cars driven occasionally cars actually suffer more when they're driven not a lot so and it's very important to buy one that has a great record of prepare please look at the Consumer Reports records of repair\nThat they have on line or in the April auto issue to see if a model you're considering

lead it onto the city which open to them on his own accord and they went out and passed on through one street\nAnd forth with the angel departed from him eleven and when Peter was come to himself he said now I Know of a surety that the lord has sent his angel and you have to live in me out of the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the people the Jews twelve and when he had considered the thing he came to the house of marry the mother of John who's\nSurname was mark where many were gathered together praying Thirteen and as Peter knocked at the door of the gate a damsel came to

leave over again okay okay that I said you oh\nYes there's an intelligent hunting and that's of course for once you look for is because that they'll be it the other one settle for things up or knock things over\nOr you know they're trying to get your attention okay okay either trying to tell you something or it could be you know\nIn all of those are the ones that you have to worry about that one of my heritage or\nNot so much hurting because these are these are people that are passed away a lot of times if we walk in and they're saying you know like the kid you know the child's being ... up in the bedroom right um\nYou know I tell people to sit down as a family and you know become one kind do you own unit and picked up the spirit like like a tenant\nOkay you lay down the law is okay I don't want to the bathroom wouldn't be I don't want it to the bedroom would be these are private areas you know I don't care if you walk the halls I don't care if you do this for that\nBut I Do this and if you know you live what something given the down you know rules and not this is how is that how it is you lay it down and that's it\nAnd and that's where you where you stand\nOkay and about eighty percent of the time that works is that the spirit doesn't want to leave their house right but you know it's you know\nTo them you moved into their house\nThey don't realize that that is your is

I'm sure they call them something else I I've heard of that term you know he's running around and they're they're just little\nAnd a noxious in in what they're trying to do was break down your spirit yeah for us when they can break down your spirits and then they can ...\nNow do you believe that they can just do that like you have to call them in\nI Believe you have to call them you know somebody how to call them something\nI'm not a whole true believers so so much and like a curse type deal that somebody can put a crush on somebody and I ... and I you know like I said this is only my belief right but I Believe if I if if I can make you believe that okay then of course at work you know from my face\nSo how did these things work if they do want to come in say you worked with the boy who was possessed how did that happen\nOkay well okay well he went he went through a heart transplant\nSo liberally while he was on the table he when he was real reconsidered legally got\nWild so they asked what recall the veil right there is a very thin tail between life and deaths and he was on the other side of the bill okay and while he was over there is what we figure is he just pick something up\nOh wow and that came with him oh wow okay and\nTo us he came through was kind of like a nod to soldier okay as you know we thought we were speaking German and all this now I don't speak German so I didn't know but it always sounds\nIt sounds like that but I also work for for ... college oh hang on to their their uh their uh language department I said can you tell me if is is you know German right and they came back and said yeah some of its German but they said some of its polish\nReally and you speak and three to four new language and you know and he was on Eighteen and he said he didn't know any of that and\nHe lives in this little small town and you know since he had his hot issue he never really he went to school but it was never\nYou know like a full school schooling type\nFrom ... um he didn't really get the education that you should have a lot are you a second I imagine I cannot see the idea of infected up languages huh that he and the family didn't teach him about\nHuh and really strange and so how did he get cared for years and courage yet it's like we actually\nTurn this fun oh over\nThe ads diet dialysis handling with it from now we got we gave them the evidence that we are okay and they'll deal with it from that\nOn so what about ghost in particular like say you're in a place I'm like\nThat they're not sure they just know like the bull mansion for instance knows you know this is really old its history its it's related to somebody who has a history like with I'm sure you know the Winchester Mansion and stories around that and Sarah Winchester so\nI don't know if there's any story that because no one said anything to me as far as I Know I haven't talked to any of the staff or anything like that so that'll be a first um lower there and of course if you wanted to call them at a time that ... um there'll be some that that night and then\nHow will you go about that goes with everybody like are you gonna use certain equipment and and what are you looking for an end how how's it going to work okay I\nI'll ... I'll set up different types of ... ... men and most of it's enough to factor that's the whole between let's say the north pole and the son of a sudden you know the equator and what does that tell you well it's a group of the house will upset that\nCertainly can yes yeah and there will certainly be attracted to you okay you're pretty much like a beacon for them\nSo what can people do if they know that his spirit around to kind of guard themselves are protect themselves and is there any way to know what to do\nWell no but my thing is is a PR free us the best thing and of course I'm I'm taking it grew up Catholic beliefs ranging okay and a lot of people don't work and beliefs around thing else you know I mean there's a whole bunch of different than it's whatever you believe in\nOkay it's it's the fate itself that I Believe that works right you know\nYou know it's not really so\nThat's right you know you know it's not really so hyper religion or\nPractice you have it's it's\nIt's what it's what you see on your high All right okay if you believe this has got to believe in higher your power okay he's going to help\nYou All right and you know and and that's for real real real really might ripple effects focuses right\nI'm I'm I'm working in this kind of sounds cocky and I'm like you know and I'm not cocky because I walked into everything with the idea that yes to something in here that could hurt me okay I Know it can but I'm looking for the price that I Will tell you I Will never go back to\nA country that it scares me that that might or that while bothers me about my\nSo hopefully we don't want to do that to the bowl mansion 'cause I'm sure they don't want to lose their customers are great bistro and they're great event place and I don't think it is because I've been in that and I do feel like there is something in there the first time I walked in\nI did feel in energy there um that's part of the reason why I wanted to do that um and I don't think there is anything is going to hurt anybody in my opinion um but that's why we're asking you to kind of like figure out what is there what is and why\nIs that all Proctor staff and I'll see what the staff fields because of course it's what the ... right and you know you know you're taking you know a young young\nLady just sending her to the base that of course he's gone on to get created outrage because of the players because it's it's a basement exactly and in a basement stay here and of course you know oh\nIf you shut the lights were off in your house and it's a dark corner yeah sit there long enough I don't see it will be right you know you can\nAlthough some people aren't freaked out like I was watching one of the shows I think it was close encounters\nUm last night the night before it without and the gentleman was like I'm OK there is a ghost in here and I know that he's inherits as black thing and I've seen it a million times and once it just like\nWas there any he's attracted to me I think he likes my my young energy and he says so I reached out when it was right in front of me and put my I'm right through it and then it close like also a corner it's just like a TV set like when you turn it off the old fashioned ones and it was gone and he was like\nTalking about this thing like it was no big deal and of course in the beginning it was unnerved him but at that point I guess he had seen it a few times but when it appeared right in front of him I Would have been scared I Would have been like what is this thing to do to me you know what what does this they want like standing right but he just shot touch it and just gone went away so\nWeird but the thing is afraid you're younger you turn around here was used to it or the time he reached out and touch you so you think it was just like um brought I you know I'm Still a block\nBlob I wouldn't want to touch on\nMost things show walkers or black was like yeah like um\nWe're always ... you know your your spirit itself has this little been worked out OK energy but yet it can grow to the size of a you know a human being you know it's the ... in the streets in the ...\nHave you ever seen a full form here you have like a real like live looking person like solid form\nPretty much our local board yeah you know the old\nI Believe and tore and red ... and ... just standing there ever was the first thing you do is you just want to go over and say okay All right I didn't know it was before you well know armor well\nI mean or did you realize there was like you know I'm just standing there and I'm looking at them it's like you know like I said I wanted to go over and talk to them right and I really feel I felt the hands of saint Michel touched while it was like don't do that okay because I talk about what do you mean that is where I'm at\nI don't know of course say while while they were ... I Hope your heartstrings yeah you know can show up in\nA while if you're a little boy and he's you know he's out in the whole it'll help them and across for just talk to them and trying to help them to serve your costs just appeals for the year yeah but no but actually I really felt by just trying to sell\nI've never seen like a ghost like you actually could see through I've only felt like I I've seen a full form like that like it looked like actual child children and we were actually talking to them um it was before my brother died about a few weeks before um and I believe that's why that happened and um we didn't know they weren't until after they turned around disappeared [noise] um and then we\nPretty much yeah OK they yeah they look pretty much like they weren't from this era they talk different that an accent and then they disappeared obviously um and then I saw her white messed once and that was that I've never seen an actual goes to you can see through except on film and I
