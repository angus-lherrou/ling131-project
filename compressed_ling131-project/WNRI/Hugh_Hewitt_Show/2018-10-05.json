just basically a post in the ground\nAnd a box sitting on top of it\nThat is a lending library and people when they're done with the book they put it back when they have books they're done with that they'd like to donate to bill lending library the micro library they put them in there there's no late fees no fines you steal a book it's just\nToo too bad because the whole idea\nA little book it's just too too bad because the whole idea is everybody benefits from the micro library you know libraries around the country that are government supported\nHave really kind of lost so much a better place sadly because the technology there are still a lot of libraries morphing to serve current needs but it's kind of a ... back with micro libraries because it's about physical books\nAnd there are a lot of people who've never liked reading a book on a candle or a phone or things like that and then other people totally adapted to it\nBut a lot of people really love the relaxing experience of turning a page in a book\nAnd so these micro libraries these lending libraries are a win win win win in my mind was sort of say in my book which would be terrible for me to say and it's really easy for you if you're interested in starting your own\nThere's an organization called little free library and it's been kind of like the uh\nThe teacher if you will of how to set one up if you want to do so and there's now\nMore than fifty thousand of these apparently in the United states these micro libraries and if you don't have one in your neighborhood and you love to read maybe you're the one who

mullet [noise]\nThere's a new report out ... says the student loans alone\nAre leading to a terrible terrible outcome or relationships and marriages and more than a third of borrowers now in a study that was done on behalf of sun trust bank\nMore than a third of borrowers say that college loans and other dads led to the end of their relationship or a divorce and\nThis is crazy but\nOne in every eight marriages where I'm Sorry one in every eight divorces the overriding factor was student loan debt\nThe average student loan debt and the country now is approaching thirty five thousand dollars and that\nCan really eat it you it's forcing people to do away so many things in their lives for cause of that student loan debt\nSomething that I've learned over the years though is the student loan debt or other debts when you come into a relationship particularly when you're engaged in preparing to get married doesn't have to be\nA cancer on your relationship the key is counseling\n... you know a lot of religions require premarital counseling that used to be just a relationship based but so many religions now understand\nWhat a serious issue with financial side is and require financial counseling a lot of people are not doing a religious based wedding and you're not going to have any kind of requirement like that so for you\nWhat I can recommend strongly is if you're entering\nA long term relationship or you're intending to get married\nIn one or the other or both of you have meaningful bet\nGo first session with an affiliate of the national foundation for credit counseling\nTalk through your debt see what kind of plan you can come up with our budget so that you can tackle those\nAnd don't ignore them and don't hide debts from someone you love they need to be discussed because the worst thing is the breakdown in trust and anger that occurs when you've hidden debts from the person you love\nYou know a relationship with someone you really love or care about a marriage to someone you love so much is so great it's like no other experience and you don't want to allow money to be the thing that poisons that\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show

your information safely\nThat's right what are you thinking of well\nIt's a service which is advertised by financial companies one of which I Am an investment that they claim that they can store all your financial products or one place or I guess over cloud Safeway and I wondered if your heart of it and if so what do you think of\nIs this fidelity product for all the investments exactly nobody asked me about that in a good while it's called like a fat fidelity safer than what they call it exactly\nIt's called fit say All right let's say at the\nRight so what they do is they provide you know finality any of the big investment companies have massive data storage center is that they either operator they lease\nAnd so the capacity required to store digital records like um account records insurance policies um you know special documents you want to keep track of like\nYou gotta will anything like that if you want to have a digital copy of them\nThe capacity that they make available is teensy tiny you know it doesn't take\nA lot of of a cloud storage at all to do that so it's really smart or fidelity is away particularly to get their own customers\nInterested in having backup copies of records scared for fidelity is good for you and they make it free\nAs I recall not just a fidelity customers but you know you have to be a customer of fidelity to use it\nI had no idea [noise] so I\nIf it's still true that anybody can use ... say it's a great way for you to store all your digital records you know a lot of people now use Google Photos to do it where you essentially take pictures of your documents and store them in Google Photos free storage forever\nOr the only issue with anything like fed save\nIs with anything else like this are you got to hope that the security standards are able to withstand the attacks the hackers which is a risk all of us face anywhere you know we store stuff and then the the second is do they at some point decide\nIf they want to charge for it\nAnd you'd have to make a decision to move things to a different place or pay their fate that it\nBut as far as a way to store all your important personal records I Love that\nI Love it because I'm getting older I mean I'm eighty years old although I don't feel it is\nBut you sound like you have a very young voice Brady good for you\nAnd talking to you I'm walking around here in the sunshine in California where I moved from New York [laughter]\nSo you you had to go from one high tax state to another high tax state\nOh this is [laughter] I couldn't believe what I didn't own a house in New York earlier piece of property in California [laughter] and looting why proposition Thirteen because I bought a house that's more expensive than the older house rather than less expensive quite a shock\nOh well but you are enjoying life and the great weather you bet All right well continued good health to you and I would feel absolutely fine and sleep well at night using to save\nWell thank you and that's of course thank you have a great day\nAnna's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Anna Anna company your husband works for is not as generous as they used to be are they you know they are and what are they doing to your husband\nDo they go stop matching had ... take on track the ...\nAnd what was their reason for their sudden loss of generosity\nKnown actually no I'm not sure if they have one or what it was\nA case of no match anymore they're offering the thing but whatever money he puts and that's all she wrote\nYeah ... I didn't have kids who are able to fully fund how's all ... that were only able to print outs and dollars for each age and so I was wondering should we continue kept it and they had Portland chain email like apple or should we just start has a lot\nOf great question so the advantage of the four oh one K. is it just comes out automatically now I think about it it just happens in that so that's a valuable thing not having to have the intention but getting it done but it sounds like he was a couple\nHad been getting it done anyway with your raw you're getting it fully funded so if you were to choose if you are in fact use a low cost provider for that Ross\nAll things being equal with no match and the four one K. I'd love it if he instead of contributing to the employer four one K.\nPut that five thousand or maybe bump it up to fifty five hundred into his own Roth\nOkay and where do you recommend that rolling whatever it in that or oh one K. and\nYou know you can't do that while he works there okay so the money that\nThey're stays there but put any future contributions and do a raw I think could be very valuable\nOkay and so it's just better tax\nSo the difference is the employer plan may be a moderate costs low costs are high cost plan okay but you got the underlying expenses if you use one of the aisle cheap oil companies I have on my investment guide\nThem the money is going to be going in low cost and the difference is the the four oh one K. but money that goes and gets a tax deduction up front but everything in the account including its earnings will be taxed down the road\nRight where the Roth is the opposite the money that goes in the wrong there's already been tax\nBut it grows tax free and the spent tax free\nNow there would be an exception to him doing the raw personal\nNow there would be an exception to him doing raw as an alternative what kind of money is your husband making a year in general terms\nI was ... years\nIf he's making low six figures than scratch what I said and he should stay on the four one K. okay why is that because the tax benefit\nOf being able to put money in pre tax is valuable enough at a six figure salary ... to his advantage to continue to put into four one K. even without a match\nOkay but I Will say that if she is in a job in the six figures it'd be great if he put aside more money each year than the five grand\nEither we're paying for a full say a\nLittle louder\nGod I got it okay All right but in that case with that kind of income\nHe should keep doing what he's been doing even though they're not being generous anymore are no matter most most people don't make income and that kinda stratosphere yeah them for them doing the Roth would be a better choice but in your husband's case before when Kay would probably be the best thing to continue\nTaking my call right have a great day\nDavid with us on the Clark Howard show hello David Hey clerk David here thinking of buying a new home from a company that when you look on line people hate their guts\n[laughter] well that's that's what it seems like and\nYou know we're considering buying a home from a large national homebuilders are in the online reviews are so good and that concerns me yeah\nBut then again I looked at some of the online reviews for other large builders and there aren't any better so I'm Wondering perhaps it's only the people that are dissatisfied are leaving the reviews are\nWell it's a great question you ask and it it has long been an issue in home building is that it's very rare that somebody says I Love my Belcher I Love them I mean I Can't wait to have them build me another home some\nDay you know you just don't hear that 'cause it's a tough business but I'll tell you this my bias has\nAlways been to buy used homes instead of buying a new home\nReally because we're we're considering both\nAnd the reason I'm a big fan of used homes is when you buy that new home it is and I know you don't know if they're going to meet their construction schedule if it's going to have the quality construction that you\nSaw in the model home if you're going to get something very different than what you had anticipated and then there you are what are you going to do if the workman ship is poor or whatever 'cause I'm sure a lot of the complaints you see are about workman ship and warranty\nCorrect right so when you buy a used home it's already found this real true market value likely where when you buy a new home development from a big national builder where they're building a huge number of homes and development\nThey're guessing what that home she'll be price you buy in there and then you need to sell a few years down the road if they guess wrong and they price them too high you bought too high then you end up losing money when you go to sell\nNow but that's a well done commercial ... listen we're out of time\nI'm a great
