treatment in infants and children\nIt's in the European journal public health\nAnd the study found that when the results from twelve studies were pulled together\nInfants and children were kept is twenty nine percent less likely to have been prescribe antibiotics if they receive pro buyout acts as a daily health supplements I'll take that any day but then they refine their analysis and they repeated it\nThey looked at what they term only the highest quality studies\nAnd then this percentage increase to fifty three percent reduction in the need for antibiotic such a spectacular result\nThe findings are very intriguing the researchers say quote given this finding potentially one way to reduce the use of antibiotics is to use probiotics on a regular basis\nThis according to the leading a study in just a gator Daniel ... he's a Georgetown University school of medicine and they go on to say we already have evidence that consuming probiotics reduces the incidence generation and so they already have certain types of common acute respiratory gastrointestinal infections\nAnd more studies are needed in all ages particularly the elderly to see if sustained provide accuses connected to an overall reduction antibiotic prescriptions have so this could potentially have a huge impact\nOn the use of probiotics in general medicine and consumers in general this according to Sarah king from Cambridge University who also participated in this study so what's going on here so the ...\nGets purported to not work when you take a probiotic and provided doesn't show up and you're still sample so is it useless then will the answer is but doesn't necessarily mean it's useless and I've got to say that\nI myself have dabbled in checking my own stool samples using the various services that are available\nAnd mostly what I found was disappointing is I on a daily basis take up robotic doctor here as robotic which contains lactobacillus I've taken many other robotics and consistently I'd find that I have zero lactobacillus and mice tool and\nMany by patients as similar find it so what's going on with that does that mean to provide acts are not working they're not taking sort of like spreading seeds in the Sahara Desert it's an act of utility 'cause the soil is not conducive to their growth [noise]\nSo does that mean that they're used to hold the answer is no because probiotics may work in a different way and some people because there's something called bacterial cross talk bacteria in the intestinal tract\nInteract with our immune system a large part of it which resides in what are called the tires patches in our large intestine\nAnd these tires patches\nAre actually receptors for information from the bacteria that populate our intestinal tracts are micro biome\nAnd if you have a healthy microbiomes you have healthy beneficial cross stock and if you have an unhealthy micro biome with bad bacteria and a lack of good bacteria your immune system gets the wrong signals\nAnd so based on this idea of cross stock it certainly is possible even if you had to buy their own implant and grow in your intestinal tract they're doing something more over\n... may be responsible for the synthesis of beneficial compounds\nVitamins nutrients that are essential for the functioning of the immune system and for the bodily functioning generally [noise]

amount and property taxes\nWash it out I think in the end [laughter] okay it's a great place to live ... I'm not complaining about my state okay [laughter] so we have about last week we had a hundred and thirty five thousand the account today we have a hundred and twenty eight\nOh because of the market decline what what are you invested in and the five twenty nine are you in the age space portfolio or un something\nThat we are an age case portfolio and I looked in preparation to call and it's you know fifty percent well only thirty one percent sock bonded at fifty one percent so they've already taken into account that I get nervous considering I think we have the most of the money we're going to need help ally\nSo I'm just wondering when cash preservation comes into play versus gross\nWell you're shallow breathing I get it right so you may be at that point you know I Would I Would encourage you to stay age base because we don't know at what point the market does go through a serious decline and since you're at a point that the movement in the market\nOnly has a thirty percent effect on the college money\nI Would encourage you to stay age base except I've heard you loud and clear you've got the money you're going to name so going into a a find that just preserves the cash is fine for you to do and then you'll just rest easy\nThrew his four years of college\nThat was kind of my life when they were a four hour it's come freshman year\n[laughter] one problem at a time\nRight right so you know if you and most people are not in the position that year round that you've already been able to save a hundred percent of the cost of undergraduate school\nAnd since you have done that been forget the classic advice I Would give a being in the age based mix and just go into the the thing that will preserve the money and you won't have to worry the next four years\nAnd so even going and buying them and that could potentially lose money too right\nYeah there aren't as interest rates rise on bonds which they are the value of bonds you hold go down you've got enough years that the higher interest rate should counteract quite clearly some of the decline and the value of those bonds but again you've already hit the goal line\nYou've already ... okay you've already scored the touchdown so if you want to just a take victory laps for four years do it and you learn a little puny a male\nAnd the and the preservation fun you might earned a couple of percent a year and that will help a little bit with the cost of inflation and tuition over the next few years to just take the victory lap\nAll right I'm running as we speak\nRight best to you and besides you got a thousand dollars on that savings bonus pet is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Ted hey Clark how're you doing today\nGreat thank you tip you are at the end of it why and you've been trying to get to learn while tell me how long this path of getting rid of debt has taken you\nAh well we started really seriously about three years ago and um we had three credit cards within our whole it\nTotal and or were actually paid off too\nAnd we are in the process of getting the third one paid off by November\nCongratulations says he says it\nYeah we're kind of excited about that it's been a lot of the dark cloud over us for a few years so but I Do have a question um once we pay off the third and final credit card should we keep one of those accounts active all three of them active or should we just canceled all\nYou want to keep all three active uh-huh and that's really key to your credit score your credit score has been rising\nProbably all through this three year pay down process as having less and less severe available credit if you close accounts it will actually affect your credit score negatively because it will show less available credit\nIn your credit scoring mix so are you going to be tempted though to use them\nIf they account stay open and you don't want to have you\nEver I don't think so unless like something major happens um we're\nReally 'cause you could more of a cash you\nCould cut them up but we account soap and so you'd rather prevented from using the cards\nAnd you would have the benefit of having the cards active it'll be a a decent while before any of the three credit card operators decide you been active too long and they're going to end voluntarily close your account\nOkay can let those run for a while the ideal thing would be twice a year to use each of the cards for one small transaction and that would keep them totally active and you wouldn't have to worry about an issue we're trying to get rid of you\nOkay congratulations to you on the discipline living on less than what you make so you could\nYou on the discipline living on less than what you make so you could pay off this that that was just it sounds like it was a burden in your life\nIt was and are a target date as the spring of two thousand Twenty one will be totally debt free\nCongratulations on that as well it feels fantastic owing nobody on earth anything\nKenny is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Kenny\nClark Oxitec luck all\nSure Kenny you have a question for me about tapping into your four one K. and you're gonna have to really work hard to convince me you should do it\n[noise] yeah I did with my circle because you are but I'm going to buy a house and I have about almost Fifteen Percent safer downtown so\nSome of my friends are saying you know facts on steel to get to twenty percent they all have to deal with mortgage insurance and I'm trying to gauge does it hurt or help me more to do a follow on a loan to get to that twenty percent\nWell first things first you don't necessarily have to come up with that five percent anymore\nYou can do a alone where you put a Fifteen Percent down and you're able to get to the twenty by doing a very small second mortgage\n\nAnd that would navigate you having to borrow from the four oh one K. and these are known is eighty Fifteen five ... where you borrow I'm eighty percent on the first mortgage\nAnd then you put a actually I should have said eighty five fifteens say eighty percent of the first mortgage five percent on what would be a relatively small very low risk for the lender second mortgage and you put the Fifteen Percent down and you avoid the private mortgage insurance", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Woonsocket", "day": "22"}
