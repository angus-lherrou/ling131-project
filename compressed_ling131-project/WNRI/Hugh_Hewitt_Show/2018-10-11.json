right now about winter\nYeah that's pretty cruel and me in October to talk about winter but I got to 'cause I got to talk about your wallet there's new data that shows that the amount of natural gas which were used for roughly sixty percent\nOf our energy and the United states\nThat number may be off a little somewhere more or less sixty percent now\nIt's a little somewhere more or less sixty percent now natural gas is in shorter supply than it's been in recent years as we head towards colder weather months and one of the ironies of natural gas\nIs it's now used for things way beyond just providing heat because more and more power companies around the country use natural gas as their main source to produce electricity\nSo natural gas has gone from being a smaller market serving heating needs for people and in certain households providing a natural gas cook tops has a lot of people prefer cooking with gas rather than electricity\nAnd that we're just say that yes even though natural gas has used for both that's the big change so the overall market demand for natural gas is much larger the current supply a little smaller\nAnd so what does that mean and the market it means that we have a decent chance of seeing higher prices on natural gas remember you had hit on both sides of the equation even if you don't use natural gas you're home you're still affected almost certainly on the electricity side\nSo no one can know what's gonna happen where the wintertime temperatures or you see a cold winter or not it's going to be another mild winter we don't know that but what we do know is that the odds are higher than we could see price spikes\nSo what I recommend to you is they use this time to do simple things\nTo reduce the overall energy demand in your home and do you know

leases with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Lisa Hi there how are you a great thank you you are thinking hey how am I gonna go retire someday is that right\nExactly right exactly right tell me what's your story is\nWell I'm ... years ago when we were in our twenties and just starting a business I'll I'll go ahead well no it was my thirty we didn't have enough money and I try and do anything but it started a business and down and it was you know fairly successful and we have three small children we went to a financial planner\nBecause thinking that was a grownup thing to do and I needed to get started on that\nAnd it was from one of these major companies or it cost me maybe about six hundred bucks at a meeting with him when he gave us our review of what we should kill it included most of our money going into an insurance plan that when he sat with\nCarol Hi good pass right\nFor you I don't know if they own is a variable universal life policy or universal life policy\nWell I wasn't saw that because that ideas it you can't get something for ... and that idea scared the heck out of me I'm including at the time he wanted to contribute as much of the eight hundred dollars a month which we didn't have\nTo pay anything we can put into it so that scared me off of financial planners it'd be quite Frank with you I just then was skeptical cynical distrustful so I put little bits of money into the stock market and hard about forty thousand dollars in\nTrading account\nI'd had quit ... and IRAs but I'm not a ton and not and that's the particularly well some on particular stock rather than usual signs but so and that's active account ... about forty thousand dollars which was have and to have an eight and a market crashed and then\nI thought oh you know now I Can't trust that I Can't afford to lose half of my money sure and since that time we have yeah we have paid off mortgage pay to our business mortgage put three kids to the school over the last one\nIn her second year but where it came out in a position to have that said no problem and we all know flown but we haven't Kim related cash because if I see it in my bank account I can trust that it's fair\nThat I Know that that's not sustainable for retirement and\nYour ... your business continues to do well when you generate a nice net profit each year\nCorrect okay being a business owner is a key ingredient to you being able to amp up your investments and savings and retirement available money so much quicker than normal earthlings can do\nAnd Alisa you're hitting me with the dilemma that happens to so many small business owners you've been investing in your business over the years ah you went to somebody who you realized was trying to swindle you out of your savings with a terrible insurance product\nAnd you and your lost money in the stock market buying individual stocks and you're like what do we do right [noise] yeah yeah right so as a small business owner\nYou have access to one of the greatest savings tools there could ever be known as a set up an S. E. pi\nCan do that at your incorporated yes\nOh well I've talked with several things people and other financial planners that I Know and everyone says that's simple that's not the same thing right\nIs simple way there's having sample about a simple simple requires pretty extensive paperwork herself does not and when I went to like you to do is I have a list of companies that you can trust\nTo advise you on how you handle building a retirement plan some of that stuff you said you're so puzzled you feel like you've gotten burned trying to make decisions\nAnd I've got a a list of companies that you can invest directly with and then I have two groups you could go to where you can talk with somebody\nWho can advise you and if you're choosing to have somebody who you pay to manage retirement funds for you yeah and focus on your business and have them do it one of the group is Garrett\nIt's on your business and have them do it one of the group is Garrett planning network that you'll see on ... dot com the other is not for the national association of personal financial advisors\nAnd either of those groups you can you can see they use different strategies to help you\nAnd then look at my investment guide for companies that I really trust for you to use for that investing guidance for your retirement account\nSteven is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Steven headache or how you doing great thank you you're saving for a home I Am congratulations\nYeah so my wife and I recently got married than the last\nYear and congratulations again\nThank you and sought our tax return and got a little bit more back to their expectations are wanting to start saving for a down payment Ali and years from now\nOh my goodness you're a new bands play on her I have never had anybody ever called me about saving for a down payment on a house or to purchase a house who said it was something they were doing ten years out that's what they\nWere trying to plan ahead a little bit of GMI another look down payments and so we're just wondering what is the best place for our money and you should just put it at our ... and then the ... when we eat it\nOr is yeah I mean if you got a ten year window\nThat really changes the answer and you are right just continuing to make your deposits in your Roth IRA and the freedom you have to withdraw contributions a decade from now with no consequences in terms of penalty or tax\nWould be a very intelligent strategy and with a ten year window you can take more risk with the money\nThen you would what would be really consider to be short term risk the long term smart then you could if you were doing something like like putting money in a savings account today yeah so and the savings would ... the cheer\nWhat type of conned would you recommend a charter ... or ...\nBut I Do I Would do a balance fine like the vanguard star fund okay if you look at the star find requires a thousand dollar minimum to open\nAnd then has a very diverse portfolio of what your money goes into\nAnd you do stand the risk and the shorter term you know at some point we could have a correction we will have a correction in the stock market and you could think that I gave you the worst advice ever write tell you to put money at risk\nAnd investments but again we're talking a ten year period and going into something like the star fund is a moderate risk choice\nTo invest money and has extremely low cost for the management of it and then what happens is let's say\nTen years from now you are pulling money out for the down payment you don't touch any of the earnings because if you pull out earnings then you get hit with tax penalties\nOr just a constitutional right and with\nThe with the contributions it's sort of completely non event as far as the IRS cause concern and if you end up in a position a decade out you're buying a home\nAnd you don't need to touch as much money as you expect it from the Roth or maybe your circumstances change or you don't need to touch any of it all the good cause you would have had already a ten year period of growth of money for retirement you're able to leave him there\nAnd let it continue to grow tax free for retirement\nOr that sounded like make you laugh\nAnd it's like you're a throwback to an entirely different era and America nobody ever differs their wants like you're

update about something I gave you limited details on last month [noise]\nNow I Know more and what I Know is more distressing than what I shared with you last month and today's Clark rage\n[noise]\nSo we just moment [noise]\nThere was information moving around on security blogs\nAbout a criminal ring that had tapped into payment terminals at a handful of restaurant chains now there's more information put out by the fads that the ring was based in Eastern Europe\nAnd that they have at least Fifteen million\nActive credit card and debit card numbers even though the ring as a there's some members of the ring that have been arrested it doesn't mean that the numbers are safe\nAnd there are any number of chains already known and there will be others that will come to light probably ...

there you have to be a member to buzz yourself in\nWhich you're a member of the co op and you it's an honor system\nOr the items you're buying their cameras watching you typically but it's an honor system and you pay for the items you scan the items you pay for the items you have purchased and you just walk out by not having to have employees on site\nAnd having it be people that are members of a co op who are all benefiting together or suffering together if somebody does a bad thing by eliminating the labor of having employees on site\nIt in theory allows items to be sold cheaper so\nWho

there's something you're like there ought to be as story that does blah blah blah you can be the one who's the author and makes that happen Dave is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Dave\nClark thank you for taking my call\nCertainly day you've got to gripe about Amazon\n[noise] I certainly do [noise] I'm In a member for a long time [noise] I'm always enjoyed the service however lately it seems like I'm not getting two days service shipping a change like I'm getting four five six day shipping\nA ... you know I order some for my garage door my batteries went bad I ordered some replacement batteries a on a Wednesday morning at eight am [noise] the uh noticed I got the shipping noticing it was saying today the following week\nAnd I called and said hey what's going on all will expedite it overnight for you know ... chart [laughter]\nAnd they came on Monday [laughter]\nWell they Amazon is straining and they are doing every experiment they can come up with to try to get their deliveries back to being reliable but there's a there's been a deterioration that any\nAmazon Prime loyalist would see exactly what you are saying and his experienced it themselves fit the delivery frames are not meeting the two day promise anymore in fact Amazon now says the two\nDays means from when they've actually fulfill the order is not two days from when you order now\nDo yes and I guess the worst one was on the black Monday I really wanted to fifty inch TV for the three hundred dollars [noise]\nOrdered it [noise] and unfortunately we were going on vacation on friday of that week we were leaving five AM in the morning [noise]\nOrdered the TV on Monday got to notice that it was shipping on what's going to live on friday\nAnd I called and I said this won't work and they said well ... and they gave you ... they gave me was the TV had to be repackaged and pulled off the shelf in the warehouse and shit\nAnd I said well that will work there will not be anybody here on friday\nAnd they said well sorry there's nothing we can do you just have to cancel\nSo I did I immediately sent an email canceling the order and about two hours later I got an email saying we can't cancel your order\nThat okay let me explain that\nThat could happen so that's been a really confusing thing for people Amazon as I understand it from what I've read is doing a lot of what's known as direct ship\nFrom uh manufacturers are from wholesalers where it's never passing through an Amazon warehouse is shipping from a manufacturer or distributors warehouse and once they put in that order that's how it's being rounded to you\nWith a third party delivery service\nSo Amazon Prime you were a member\nFor cause it's like a victim of its own popularity and success is not the Amazon Prime of any more\nI understand but the problem was I didn't want to fifty inch TV sitting on my friends\nAre a lot more of a pirate run off with it\nExactly\nRight so let me let me cut to the chase on this with Amazon to day delivery no longer means two days except by whatever calendar Amazon uses\nHowever if you do get some of the incomes late and you call Amazon the most common thing they'll do for you is extend your prime an additional month for free [noise]\nSo you get something for it but if you're hoping that Amazon in the near future is going to go back to being reliable worshipping forget it\n[noise] ah [laughter]\nI think about it they got how many members they have now they keep raising the cost or prime and it doesn't seem to make any debt and the popularity of it in a number of people want to sign up\n[noise] you know I understand but it sure doesn't help me when I Need the items and quite frankly I I'm not convenient stores\nFrankly I convenient stores okay\nSo I Would suggest experimental what'll tried jet dot com which is a retail are a lot of people really love\nAs an alternative to Amazon they have no membership fee\nOr you can try an even number of people you can try boxed I don't know if you've ever tried box B o X E D dot com seems to be putting a smile on a lot of people's faces are there are there are alternatives even if you are not an area convenient stores\nThere are these smaller competitors to Amazon that maybe are worth a look as Amazon\nHas disappointed you at least these two times recently\nCarlos is with us on the Clark Howard show hell or Carlos Carlos you have a terrible situation involving a broken heart and I'm Sorry about what you suffered through lightly\nThank you so I was engaged um and I bought a wedding band and engaged in LA um spend a total of ten thousand dollars so we ended up breaking everything off and so I've got a this jewelry um G L A certified\nUm you know from a reputable place so what am I options as far as Shelley [noise]\nWell [noise] or I should tell you that this is a terrible dilemma with broken engagements and like one in three engagements don't make it to the altar so don't feel like you're the Lone Ranger on that\nOr doesn't heal your heart any easier but a diamond once it's purchase from a retailer ring purchaser retailer will not bring anywhere near that value for you when you try to sell it\nAnd the the options see you are somewhat limited some viewers will allow you to do a consignment where four percent\nThey will confined the jewelry for you the diamond in the jewelry for you but it is a a a situation where you will suffer a meaningful loss\nIn this case with ten thousand dollars on the line in the thousands of dollars\nSure because there's such a difference between the retail sale of a diamond jewelry and trying to sell it and the secondary market\n[noise] is there a benefit to hanging onto this even for a few years I'm with\nYou mean in terms of the Oreo diamonds appreciating or whatever that is that is so hard to call if they would be enough of an increase\nIn value and a historical trends would say maybe not remember you are not going to get near retail for it\nAnd I don't know I'm going to ask you a difficult question now do you think that diamond as a loose diamond you would ever be comfortable giving it to another woman\nI think I Would be I'm not
