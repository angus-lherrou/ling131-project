his first day that land holding them is due in November he hauls three subsidized student loans and it's titled nearly a lot involved in dollars he's never had any credit\nOther than these loans and his credit score is fixed at each ... he has the money to pay those in Seoul now but what's the best course of action to positively impact his credit score to the head off in full or overtime\nAnd allow officer you said he says is six fifty two yes which may be enough of a score for him to get a loan limit a traditional visa and MasterCard or discover card so\nI'd like him to do that regardless of where we talk next about these three subsidized student loans and ... and I wished he or you would have called me before he graduated 'cause then it's really\nEasy to get a credit card okay it is he a member of any credit union is All right I'd like him to go to the credit union\nAnd instead of applying straight on line for a credit card talk face to face run a loan officers\nAnd see what the likelihood is he'll be approved for a small limit these or MasterCard why and if that doesn't get it done if they are like not quite there at the six\nFifty where you are the next thing would be to potentially try a loan limit card with discover\nAll right and if all traditional channels fail and like him to try something called pedal card P. T. A. L. card dot com standard say non traditional issue or a traditional visa cards\nAnd see if he can get one from them All right on the student loans with um federally subsidized student loans the interest rates now that he's going to be paying and when he would have graduated from school those loans are pretty low rates aren't they\nYes about four percent or less\nSo that's really lucky you know people taking out student loans now federally subsidized or an subsidize are paying higher rates interest rates have gone up to his timing was good and the eleven represents his entire student loan debt yes\nThat's fantastic he's a very good kid at\nWell that is great so it'd be has cache\nHe could pay them off but ah at the interest rates they have\nThere may be other priorities like what kinds of things is he having to do right now like is he having to go rent an apartment or is he needing transportation like what's going on in his life let's say in the next Eighteen months to two years\nHe's killing him so he's enjoying being rent free for right now I'm an transportation is taking care of so he does not have as as as right now\nWhat point are you going to charge him rent\n[laughter] navy so [laughter]\nEven even a token amount of rent I think is good for somebody to be paying\nWho's now graduated it has a job yes yeah\nSo um I think that's that's good and I hope you've set ground rules for him [laughter] yes okay All right you can tell I'm a parent of of kids who have been through this right [laughter] yes [laughter] so if there's nothing\nSpecifically that he's trying to save up for anything like that and he's got the fines that he is four percent even just go ahead and ah encourage him to wipe out the student loan debts and be a you know he's starting off in a new job finishing college\nBeing totally debt free will be wonderful\nShop but\nBoth of them off for he pays them off I wanted to make sure you can get one of these credit cards\nThat I Will do that\nAnd then follow through the student loans and he'll be good mostly is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi how you doing\n[noise] good afternoon clerks\nHow can I serve you today\n[noise] Clark number one I heard about your house here so I'm Glad to hear that you're back to have a survey\nOh well thank you are somehow the fact that I had wrapped do my closest says just reemerged I

all three agency so thanks for putting out their good information\nYou know that makes your score higher than mine\nJust recently and you're you're above me right now\nFor me to get through the really where you're at so [laughter] I guess my question is this a mile above twenty thousand dollars left on a car\nOh about twenty thousand dollars left on a car hello I'm a some credit cards were putting limits on one of them will take care of most of that low considering doing a balance transfer to get the answer is down to zero of pain but also I wanted to get their life on that\nSo you can do is zero balance transfer no four percent face for doing the balance transfer\nThere's like a three percent transfer she but no interest or a certain amount of time out to them\nSo you get like Eighteen months so you ... percent or so where would you be able to wipe out twenty grand in Eighteen months\n... player was two fold especially given you're going ... percent if yours to just do it traps where again\nRight how long do you think it would take you to take out the twenty thousand\nUm if ... ... it will be four years so I Would say less sued for two\nOkay 'cause I'm trying to gauge what's the best idea of what is the interest rate you have on the Carl M\nCalling us\nWhich is not a terrible rate is that issued by a car dealer a bank or a credit union\nBank okay are you a member of a credit union with your credit score or credit\nUnion may take that loan out at two point something percent\nAnd that would be better than\nHe was doing the zero percent transfer paying the three percent pay up front and knowing better clocks gonna ticket whenever the zero percent runs out you've got to try to figure out how to do something else again I'd rather it be simple and if you were to take\nThe twenty thousand on the car loan and go into let's say a two or three year car loan re fi with a credit union you may get a rate low enough that that'll just work for you\n[noise] considered at\nCredit unions do a big business and refine car loans cause roughly I'm somewhere three quarters eighty percent of people finance a vehicle at the dealer\nAnd the dealers mark 'em up and stuff so and credit unions pretty easily can re fi somebody into significantly lower rate usually than what they've got in the loan they originally took out by the vehicle\n[noise] it's awful low there and tell us what my credit\nAnd see since you've got this what's known as a golden credit score once you're above eight hundred known as the golden score you probably you'll have people at the credit

we're definitely in the planning stages are coming up in November and how many years and yet\nWhile we're at where the big numbers and so uh what I've done the previous anniversaries I'll probably set the bar just high enough to ensure there might be another one the next year so I Want to do I want to go a little bit beyond that this year\nWhat do you think you\nWere actually thinking about taking a nice trip somewhere haven't really decided exactly where but we're considering locations maybe in the Caribbean or um Costa Rica ... we were looking at maybe doing an all inclusive resort type vacation but not really sure where to start\nWhat month of the year would you take the anniversary trip\nIt would be in early November\nOh you are a genius does your wife say that does she know you're a genius\nYou know if she does she she doesn't like them to tell me that too often so can you from getting too big of a head so\n'cause you know when you look at November for fun and the sun and Costa Rica Caribbean you were off off off off season\nI like to hear so your timing is ideal\nAnd being able to find a all inclusive that would be a reasonable price should not be a terribly difficult thing doing that trip in early November\nOkay now would you recommend going going straight to resort to book the logistics are going through a travel agent or\nI think I can travel agent uh leisure oriented travel agent travel agent guy had pretty much become almost extinct and they write I'm back to life because of this need that people have to have\nYou know you only got so much medication you only have this tenth anniversary once you want to make sure it's right in going to somebody who's experienced knows the places um\nCan see to it that as much as they can control that that they get you to a place is going to be a good experience\nI think it's worth it\nRight grades kinda by down some of that risk associated with the planning this big big event so\nYoung I travel all the time I think that and you do a lot of this kind of thing ... it's hard to beat that travel agent and his or her knowledge\nGreat I appreciate that court\nAnd by the way with November one thing to be mindful of is staying out of what's referred to as the hurricane belt and November you're still on the edge of hurricane season\nAnd I would be mindful of that and where you choose [noise]\nOkay we'll do I'll I'll keep that in consideration\nOkay and again congratulations to you on ten years\nThank you thank you very much they're All right\nEric is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Eric how're you doing\nClark or thank you for taking my call and thank you for your service\nAbsolutely you're moving\nWe are going to be moving or from the east coast to the west coast\nFrom where the where where specifically are you going\nTo want to be going to a little town outside of Sacramento called Grass Valley California\nAnd the station that I don't know if I'm On there anymore they're transmitter is in Grass Valley oh you're kidding no oh that's great and where are you moving from\nFrom a low birth Wilbur in Georgia right outside of Atlanta right that is quite a move now you know the greatest trade you get is you're going to have in and out burger\nYeah but we'll get a bad fall a lot less for house when we go out there\nThat is so true well how can I be helpful with this move\nWell I have a a few questions related to that first of all I did go over your website and a couple of places trying to do my homework [noise] one of my questions is about a full replacement value insurance coverage\nAnd I know that it moving companies are supposed to provide you with that insurance [noise] um\nNo no they they can sell it to you right now I'm invited to\nRiot provided with a charge yeah my one of my questions was are there any uh reputable third party insurance carriers where I might find some competitive or rates for that\nPrice so you own a home yeah in Georgia and you're going to be buying a home in California your homeowner's ensure now they don't cover well that's what I wanted to talk about some do some don't\nBut those that do I should say differently typically insurers will but you can't count on that and a number of the mass market homeowners insurers no longer cover your possessions on a move but they will sell you was often called a writer or a floater\nThat is like a temporary add onto your policy that will cover your possessions when you move okay um well should ask area is this thing and sure if they offer a moving ride or removing floater\nOkay and if they don't are there any other a third party insurance companies that one could approach for this kind of coverage\nI have not heard of that I'm not but I Will tell you this when you get to your new home and ensure who doesn't even cover your possessions when you move isn't insure you probably have gotten all the information needed about and you should kick him out of the car\nYou should fire yes okay completely so as far as the alternative\nThe fire yes okay completely so as far as the alternative the principal alternative and there's a third party one I'm not familiar with it the principal one is to buy replacement value coverage from a reputable moving company I'll talk about reputable ones a second\nBut I'm like for you to take on a couple of hundred dollar deductible on that\nBecause it one way or the cost of that policy you're the you're essential your own insurance company for the first two fifty\nOr five hundred dollars of items that got lost one broken whatever okay so would you had um a moving company C industry has got to be my next question industry has a lot of ...\nThat are sometimes are absolutely operated by the mafia\nOther times they're just really crooked people\nAnd then other times they're more in a gray zone they're just not any good and so there's a program that supposed to separate out the legitimate movers called the pro mover program\nHave you seen that on line is that it moved out or it's it's yeah it's a moving out of work moving out over here and so with a pro mover they agree to a\nEthics and procedure to settle disputes about your possessions\nBradley's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Bradley\n... um so I've got a question about the early on financing okay and I've got\nA house that has appreciated pretty substantially that I bought two years ago\nAnd how big rags relations to you\nYeah thank you I Will say that we got it for a great deal also an accounting we bought it and it was kind of do in the first time homebuyer do with us so we were actually able to get the home for Seventy seven thousand at three bedroom two bath two thousand seven built home for Seventy seven thousand\nWhich to us was a great deal in our area and the owners now appreciate it to about a hundred and ten thousand\nSo we're at a point now where we would like to sell but we're not sure what to do with what the money once we have it on hand so because we only have about fifty eight thousand left because we've got a substantial downpayment so we're left with fifty eight thousand to pay and\nThen after you know we're after expenses you may clear somewhere right around fifty thousand dollar exactly exactly right I Need to ask one question before we go forward\nWith those government subsidized first time homebuyer offers sometimes you have to be willing to stay in the house exactly or the amount of time to not trigger some kind of claw back\nExactly and it is a five year is what they had said but as long as the property as an hour if ... if it stays in our name then that's fine but if we were to sell it than we would have to pay back\nThree years that they gave us seven thousand dollars so basically we would have to pay got sixty percent of what they have enough\nOkay so that's worth doing if you're wanting to move on and you're getting so much money have you on a Saturday an alternative and that is turning a rom already into a rental\nRide so we did consider renting but we are planning to move about\nFour hundred miles no ... [laughter] right right so the really hard to maintain it and at the same time it was not actually like a government first time homebuyer\nCould have all these ...\nLet's say\nCheesy and live dot com\nPress one Israel your voters wide open to deadly drug gangs\nBut Central America in trying to get across Mexico Guatemala ... as part of the caravan shell CNN he's just looking for a better life\n\nOf Mexican authorities began to allow a trickle of the people to cross the border\nStarting with women and children to board buses for refugee camps\nNo one wins the latest mega millions drawing meaning that jak pipelines do a staggering one point six billion dollars\nOn Tuesday more than a week after hurricane Michael smashed into the Florida Panhandle destruction and let all the way to the Georgia border more than one hundred thousand Florida customers are still without power that according to the state department of emergency management you're listening to USA radio news ... high folks ...\nWhether you need flowers for joy for sad occasion\nPark square floor is a full service flour and gift shop\nWe offer beautiful and creative fresh floral arrangements for any occasion for more than Thirty years per square forest has been serving one soccer and the surrounding communities with our creative in in a floral arrangements that really stand out in any setting we pride ourselves on our good name and reputation and my business\nOr wherever forest knows what you're looking for because we listen to your place your order at four O. one seven six six twenty to thirty two or visit our website ... square floors and dot com or stopped by at Thirteen hundred Park Avenue Illinois and soccer\nAnd while you're apart square floor us visit Peggy staffers are met life insurance agent per car I'm Alive for business eliminate uncertainty and create a lasting peace of mind\nBy seven six two sixty three sixty six\nDeath of missing Saudi journalist in Washington Post columnist Jim ... claiming he died and the fist fight at the country's ... the White House is considering it's next move in response to the journalists stepped during a roundtable event in Arizona President Trump was asked about how his administration would deal with Saudi Arabia they've\nBeen a great allied amazed\nWe need them as a counterbalance to Iran\nSnaps it suffers leadership stuff a surplus situation to bed\nVirginia democratic congressman Jerry Connelly says it was not an accidental death\nThis wasn't a rogue operation where got out of hand this was premeditated Fifteen individual flew into turkey with a you know malice or thought they knew what they were doing\nEighteen Saudis are being detained as suspects in the killing Turkish officials claim that the decision was murdered by Fifteen minutes Saudi hit team which was actually flown to us than bill to private jets from Saudi Arabia and left the next day this was usa radio news\nBuy seasons change the Suzie insurance agencies commitment to win socket remains constant ally and I'm David Susie from the sushi insurance agency since Nineteen fourteen\nGenerations of people ended and says have trusted the sushi agency to protect everything important to them as part of the times an insurance broker Suzie agency has access to even more companies to help save the money and keep you properly insured great race and call the sushi agency today seven six two two to one eight ... online I sushi agency dot com\n... is still climbing the most are from Florida USA's windy king has an update\nThe worst of the storm hit in Panama City and the two major hospitals there are still not admitting patients only ER services are available at either facility ... bay county interested at least ... people suspected of looting in the area\nIn Callaway Aaron Guthrie had her baby was taken and victorious look for someone took her purse from her hands while she refers looping\nGive us a basket or to the U.N Nikki Haley is demanding the un secretary general take action against the Bolivian Cuban delegations after they disrupted USC bed to draw attention to the plight of political prisoners in Cuba event jailed for what the plan is Cuba's political prisoners\nDescended into chaos when diplomats from the two countries including Bolivian ambassador social already started banging on tables and screaming slogans in an effort to derail the event now I'm\nAnd that's now routes around in native\nSpeakers including former prisoners and relatives of those currently in prison none of the communist regime struggle to be heard over the noise in a letter to the un secretary general obtained by Fox News he said the behavior by the Cuban Bolivian diplomats was outrageous and called for action for usa radio news I'm Rick ...\n...

how to price they're learning how to market their learning how to sell\nAnd then they add cities around the country very heavy emphasis on the south south west and west and the reason those areas because those are areas of the country that developed along the automobile have\nThose areas because those are areas in the country that developed along the automobile have a lot of suburban housing a lot of uh subdivisions and developments built with very similar\nHousing plans and looks so they can more accurately price to house they're not interested\nAnd really high end houses 'cause they don't know exactly how to price them and how easily they'll sell and they're not interested in the houses that tend to be in neighborhoods let's say there in transition that maybe had been rough neighborhoods trying to get better or something like that\nBut it is the real deal\nAnd Tom is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Tom\nHi how're you doing stuff that\nCorporate thank you Tom how can I be of service\nWell about a year and a half ago I got us all stay in the mail for a credit card from a small business and I thought\nWell let me go and sign up for this 'cause I never have a backup card Kay she made it so I I when I got the cars started using it because it actually had a better cash that war than the one that was used in previous life so that one was gone fine\nOne afternoon I got an email from the car car companies saying well we've got your address change which obviously was a mine so I called him stop the stuff card know sent me a new one the whole smear\nAt that point I sort of the card into the two lifestyle and started using my original art at the end\nAnd at last September this last September I got the same message from the credit card company so I called them\nThey went to the old hands on they sent me a new card and then it happened again and uh also three times as happened it's been a different addressed in the mail and then the car to socialize tough for the company and they sent me on to the frog department that whole thing I did ask him I said no other cards I have\nA for a second level security where they would ask you a question life you know who's your favorite ... year old ...\nWho is your art rock group called the purple okay now I Know the code to get any of your credit\n[laughter] I'm not that one [laughter]\nBut isn't that awful that says that they they gave me some land is to say well people can guess that well maybe not but it's still should be a level of security that should offer\nLike there's an issue though that I Need to point out to you the reason the court issue or may not care as much where they business credit card\nIs business credit cards don't enjoy the consumer protections that a consumer card does under pre existing law and the card act was passed after the banking scandals\nSo the Congress carved out exception to consumer protections for business cards so as an example let's say a criminal did run up a lot of charges on your car and if they were successful you able to take it over and run up charges\nTheir credit card company with a business card can say oh well\nWe don't think they you Tom ... good precautions\nAnd so we're going to hold you liable for their charges or whatever which they cannot do want to consumer car so I don't like even if you're using a card for business purposes I like for you to get a consumer card\nAnd just use it in your business and pay for it from your business [noise]\nOkay so is it best course actually manage just 'cause I have this account closed ...\nIf you've been hit three times by people attempting to take over the account and divert the bills so that you don't know that false charges are being made\nI Would say three strikes and they're out okay somebody has somehow figured out how to crack in on your particular card and who knows how many others\nAnd I don't want you vulnerable since you don't have the normal slate of consumer protections you can add any consumer card and just as a practical matter pay for it from your business\nIs also the cause of needs to be in the business and them\nNo oh you're liable anyway you know when you get a business card\nYou know the ... one of the things you scientists you're personally liable regardless so they always pierce the corporate veil so you the company is responsible and you're responsible so it's actually yell theory or to consumer card in virtually every aspect\nYour new\n\nWill pull the United states from the intermediate range
