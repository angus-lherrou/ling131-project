investments changes as the child gets closer and closer to entering college\nIt's too complicated to try to figure out your own investment in the mix unless you work as an investment professional as your day job\nSo going in the age based portfolio is what I recommend\nWhat I've done going through the plans as I've looked at them to find the ones that are the absolute lowest cost because over let's say a typical investment cycle that someone's putting money on for a child's college the money sits in their roughly ten years\nCharles college the money sits in their roughly ten years\nBased on when people put money on and the money you put in through the years and so for that\nInvestment cycle but it costs to the investments matter enormously how much money you'll have there for a kids' college by the time they're spending it and for tuition other eligible expenses and undergraduate or graduate school\nSo my guide that I've just updated at Clark dot com is all about driving down costs period\nAnd the good news is that college five twenty nine plans have gotten cheaper and cheaper and cheaper with intense competition among those that are the direct salt\nBut once it involved commissions again I don't even look at because they're so on economic you should never consider them\nBut the great news is that when I first started writing about and reviewing five twenty nine plans long ago But West of those that were good for you to put your money on was teensy tiny\nToday in encompasses most plans sponsored by most states in the country and many states in addition to getting use of money tax free for college you get a tax benefit up front for participating in a plan\nAnd so check out my guide and it's something that I uh do partial revisions overtime and then do a major a vision to\nRoughly every Eighteen months and the reason there are times I Do partial revisions is to actually won a plan may change sponsors or the existing sponsor main lower costs or two\nI may come to believe that the decision I made about a particular state plan was wrong and I may downgrade planner upgraded a plan on further review but the idea of this is that\nYou have an opportunity if you can afford it to put money aside to pray at least in part the cost of a child's college education and have that done the most efficient way possible tax free growth of your money\nHaving said that though\nNever sacrifice your own retirement\nIn order to put money aside for kids college your retirement comes first\nThe reason why a simple there are no scholarship plans for retirement\nBut there are many alternative ways to pay for college including the most overlooked of all and that's going to a more affordable college\nIs the number one way to reduce the costs because the dollar never had to be expended for college is a dollar you don't have to say for it\nAnd again if the culture and your family\nIs college is not likely for a kid you don't want to save in one of these plans\nBut always save the max you're allowed to enter Roth IRA before you focus in any meaningful way\nOn a five twenty nine I guess the only uh\nAsked her to that is if there's a state tax benefit going into a five twenty nine if you can put in what will get you the maximum tax benefit state in addition to the tax free growth that would make it a one and then the raw IRA funding would be a one day\nBut anyway you can see my explanation at ... dot com their goal with my five twenty nine plan guide is this I Want you to be in a position\nTo review\nPick a plan\nFind it and be done\nIn less than Fifteen minutes this doesn't have to be hard it doesn't in any way need to be intimidating and you'll really be glad that you set up a plan with the goal of being to add to it\nEvery month if you can automatically to build up real money towards college\nJill is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Jill\nHi Clark how are you great Jill I Hope I can be of help to you\n[laughter] I Hope so I have a question about the online [laughter]\nI I've been listening to you at recently I took your advice and live a chunk of our savings to one of the online banks and like you think that's the name I Will and grace selected one that had\nA good interest rate and a five star ratings but my my nagging concern is that I didn't see a direct link to the bank so I had to Google it signed it and that set it up and it looks like it but I still have this nagging theater that one of these kind of going to go into town and\nMoney's got to a town right\nOkay I don't want to tell you what the hope is with a you looked at the bank Craig list with any of these lists um when if someone doesn't pay them referral fees\nThey're not going to provide a direct like they're going to give you the information but it's the best right out there but that's why there wasn't a hyper lengthy would take you right to it\nOK so doesn't in any way make that a a bad bank or one that you should be wary of it's just that since they wouldn't pay money any kind of commission is going to be a little more work for you to do business with them what kind of raid are you learning\nI'm killing a quarter\nTo quarter already now that is I think today the highest anybody's pay is\nToo okay yeah it it ... it was when I set it up and I guess my other question is since there's not a brick and mortar bank locally\nAnd I think there's things that are cases supposedly based on New York but are there are others that still safeguards that you should take when you have an online bank as I guess I'm not sure what I Would do all of a sudden I couldn't access my account the bank's website\nWhere you can always crossed validate that you're dealing with real people by going to F. D. I. C. dot Gov and checking to see that it is a real institution and that you're insured to the quarter million\nAnd as long as you have to cross reference you're you're good to go and online banks are going to be a bigger and bigger part\nOf our financial market in the United states because particularly people who have come of age and the last uh Fifteen Years\nGoing to physical bank branches just isn't part of how they do things\nAnd so the the future's going to be captured by online only institutions and what you're doing is just plain\nSmart\nI Hope so I Am certainly seem slightly money on the table and I appreciate all that good advice and\nCertainly things start to not leave money on the table and I appreciate on up here get advice and and that makes me feel a little bit better\nAnd I'm curious what were you earning at the place you had the money before\nWell I had it at a credit union and and actually they are currently pay two and a half percent but only on you know up to a certain amount of money so I was getting a good interest rate on some of my savings but there was a lot out there that I went the gaining anything on\nWell two and a half is really great that's fantastic um I didn't know any credit unions were paying savings rates that Hi Beverly with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Beverly\nHigh car carry you\nGreat thank you Beverly you got a question for me to save some money\nI sure do but at first I Want to thank you for what you do I\nWe all appreciate everything you do your kind thank you I had a question about trainers I had heard you on a more than a week ago talking about um H.
