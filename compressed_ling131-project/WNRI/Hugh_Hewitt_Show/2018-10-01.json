freelance in and letting it is on the weekends so\nSo you're a seven day a week guy working all the time yeah now you're allowing any time for yourself to just enjoy your your wife or you just working\nOn the summers are like an visit and then after that it slows down let's let\nGood All right so let's talk strategy so you have the weekend gig\nAnd you're self employed for that you're not working for somebody else you're you're burning completely as an independent contractor on the weekends right\nCorrect so have you set up a set up a simple find employee pension\nI'm I have and and now I I just heard about that and that\nWas a like a lot of raw and ah all ... um the ball and plans to describe it to that\nYes and see that something you want to do because the more money they you can put aside now makes it more and more possible for you down the road to be able to have complete financial independence which sounds like that's what you are really into\nUh-huh so let's go to the ... certain one that you would recommend for that\nYeah okay so for a set up I Would go with one or the ultra low cost companies who do you have your raw with\nThem and good\nAll right so I Would just be yourself with vanguard to to keep it simple right so let's go talk about your for three B\nYou offered the option of a raw for three B are only a traditional for three be\nJust the traditional\nOkay and do you know what kind of expenses that you're shouldering with that for three B\nOr I\nThink that ... or ... they just don't put any money into it than they already automatically just twelve percent and to us on this going on\nOut here on a free ride there that's great yeah it's it's it's ... some\nRight let's talk goals and the next five years what things do you because you've got you do the if you do the SAT you got this for three baby you're doing fully finding a raw what things do you want to accomplish before you turn thirty\n\n... cricket is the home um but now with on on on the next three years or so I I don't know I'm not I'm not trying\nTo spend money on a car I'm finally keep everything pretty slowly yeah maybe a save up for a house or the ... and said I was in the ...\nAll right I said for that then you want ... pretty much what I was just talking about with the online banks\nAnd right now you can earn too in a quarter percent uh it's not going to be our shattering but you're going to be earning money on your money and um you start building up that pile of cash and then he let's say an opportunity comes along to buy a home and you're right now is not a great time to buy a home\nYeah even though with the market crash\nWell we're not going to see if the crash yeah how was that was an unusual circumstance ten years ago when you were a teenager but we but we are going to see housing become more affordable versus income again because where we're at right now is not sustainable\nFor housing too so outstrip so many people's income so I Would buy your time I would keep stashing the surplus cash beyond what you do in the south the raw and through the employer a foreign thirty\nAnd put money into one of these online accounts and then when the opportunity presents itself where there's a good deal on a house you will have already done\nThe key work by living on less than what you make and saving as much as you can if you go to bank rate dot com and click on savings rates you'll see some of the opportunities right now that are in about two and a quarter percent\n... and if I'm repeating myself I don't know if I said this those rates are likely going up another quarter point over the next few weeks\nMhm ... do you think I should put it in that instead of like a finality zero the on\nYes because when your window is shorter infidelity zeroes or really a longer term play\nAnd up to a window of like five years that's why I specifically asked what do you hope to accomplish in your twenties\nNext five years it's too much of a risk\nTo put the money that you're going to want to use for something like a down payment on a house into stock type choices fidelity zeroes or one that it's a total us stock market index or another and international stock market index with no commissions no fees finality absorbing all those\nAnd so that's a great choice for money there would be a longer term holding\nBut not for money that you're going to use and the next several years gotta move well past five I'd say seven years or longer before that becomes a good place for you to pop your money and congratulations Derek for paying so industrious\nAnd being such a saver Nicole is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Nicole\nClark\nNicole you got a question for me about buying real estate\nYet so I'm a realtor and my home has roughly a little over a Ninety grand and equity and [noise] I was wondering\nAnd equity and [noise] I was wondering if it will be smart to pull some of that equity out and buy an investment property I really want to get into that side of things\nWell I you know I just alluded to it a second ago\nReal estate is um has moved beyond\nGenerally people's ability to afford to buy a home you're a real estate agent you're out there all the time in ... you know\nWhen a property is an unusually good deal there aren't as many of those right now right so if you were to put at risk\nThe equity you have in your personal residents to buy an investment property by a rental property it's gotta be one that the numbers work two ways one bit for whatever reason or circumstance\nIt's not in a position where\nIt is a an rarified error in terms of value\nAnd second that if you start renting it out you can be cash flow positive from the beginning\nOf the reason that's important is if you guessed wrong and the value does declined later after you buy it if you are cash flow positive on the rental you can ride that out\nOn the other hand if you're upside down where you're bringing less money each month in your carry on the property back too high a level of risk for you to have your existing equity evaporate into an investment property", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "city":
