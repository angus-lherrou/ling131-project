anything at all the research I've been doing\nWell how can I be of service with this upcoming adventure\nShow carpet but non poke around for rental car prices on the Internet on there and Costa Rico do boy found one on one of the way they look like a dollar a day oh yeah that's probably too good to be true of most of the others are in the ...\nOkay so Costa Rica comes with an unpleasant surprises when you rent a car\nOkay the government there it's one of the few countries on earth that the government makes you buy a whole bunch a pseudo semi fake crummy insurance type products with your rental so when you see a car\nInsurance type products with your rental\nSo when you see a car rental company for Costa Rica listing raided a dollar a day or five dollars a day or whatever they're just trying to more un and then for the government mandated semi insurance things they charge you a fortune\nSo at a loss leader and what have recommended in the past with Costa Rica is rent from a well known and recognize company\nBut before you even do that you want disclosure from them which they will have on their website what the mandatory a semi insurances are going to cost you\nOkay so if they expect the car rental in Costa Rica to be actually a fair amount more money than you have anticipated\n... closer to accurate\nNo it'll be more than that with all the junk they make you get okay but again there's a range on the junk fees like one company maybe two or three times the cost of another\nFor this stuff that the Costa Rican government requires you have you know normally when I travel somewhere\nI anywhere on the world I refuse all the pseudo insurance at the car rental company tries to get me to get\nBecause of the coverage I have my own auto insurance even outside the United states and then I have a credit card that covers the gaps and what my auto insurance doesn't cover none of those rules apply in Costa Rica\nInteresting so I tell you what I'd like you to do is go to like\nTrip advisor and read the briefings about renting a car in Costa Rica or just Google a Costa Rican car rental and you'll see the host people are put up about all the stuff that comes\nOut of your wallet for Costa Rican rental\nOkay what are what are the price or ingesting it can is as close\nI we Jess all in at the low end you'll be paying thirty five a day for a car\nWhile yeah it's a

because you knew they weren't going to rent a car for a dollar a day but you know they've got you they're standing in front of the counter and your dollar a day becomes who knows what with all the junk fees they add on\nAnd what are you going to do at that point so knowing in advance and knowing what's going to cost that's the right thing\nJenny joins us on the Clark Howard show hello

money back into the money market but I Would say even though your mortgage rate is so low\nIf you've got nothing else you're worrying about about paying bills that it would be a neat idea just to blow out the mortgage and live completely mortgage debt free but there's a\nSecond question for you before you got the polar greenlight what are you doing to save for retirement\nRight now I've got a a a full on China when my my company I'm putting Fifteen Percent\nPay off mortgage okay alright yeah wow and I hope that the you inspire other people here you are on the edge or being completely debt free and you're doing a great job saving for your future and for retirement\nSo that just write him that check when you pay off the mortgage one of the gifts that your bank gives you is you're going to have to pay them twenty or twenty five dollars to give you their permission ladder to send them to forty six thousand\nOkay and they call that the pay off a ladder and they've got to get the money on the exact the payoff letter will show you if you pay off this loan on such and such a date this is the amount you have to send us an every day after that you have to send us an extra nine dollars or twelve dollars or whatever\nAnd so you got to pay for that letter and then sending money\nOkay so go for it and then have that big party for that mortgage burning and congrats to you\nAnd anyone else who owns your home free and clear you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n\nNow but I Know this month a two pack of a nap and night vision had lamb says up to ten dollars off cause with ball gum longer nice then\nVisibility luckily our head lamps up superior elimination which helps reduce the chance of an accident the better drive safer with up to ten dollars off of to pack up and night vision had labs all the parts ... people that\nDon't know how to fit enough\nApart source for instance I Want to [noise]\nNow I found from Geico motorcycle it took this teen minutes to purchase the gas station egg salad [noise]\nEat the gas station egg salad and regret the gas station ... as you presented numbers to the board [noise]\nMoney so I can go to first first I get what I saw on the company I can give you the name of the name of it ... it looked very patches ... I called it better to have to make sure they will headache frustrating so I thought that was good\nSo I continue that show that an application and my question is they keep coming back other than that I had a shadow of el diet\nI graduated college in Nineteen sixty a copy of my college degree I said I don't have to find that they otherwise it will go up because that makes sense I get that question does that make any sense it is a scam paying his chemical\nNo every lander uses different underwriting standards and the one asking for a copy of a college degree from years ago yeah that's pretty crazy I've never had that come up after\nA year when people live for mortgages it's not unusual now to have a level of documentation as we provided that seems so intrusive and so unnecessary but it's how that market works now but for personal loan\nTo ask you all that kinda stuff seems really weird\nIt does and what I said what's your ...\n... they said we can't get database and you didn't graduate from what you said you did I think yes I did I think they had like make no I didn't go to college and get my marriage and now I don't want to college I went oh my God I\nCan't make it that I think that it doesn't seem like it was something wrong here you know and I get them to continue it maybe I should just\nKind of an interest rate or they promising you what they what they have a fourteen that true and what is your personal a line of credit rate is\nWhat is your personal a line of credit rate is at at the exact same\nOkay and where does Europe fit into borrowing this money our team members\nBecause like God I hate going getting ready to start off [noise]\nShe's moving to Europe ... huh so how she uh she's an adult you know alright ... okay laws ... well I'm gonna I'm gonna get a little I'm gonna\nBe a little too personal here but I'm just I'm just curious why are you taking out a loan at fourteen percent with that as a a pretty high interest rate right now are paying for\nHer credit if I couldn't get a lot like she has a cat and she called that actual paid a lot from heart job ... it'll be in my own that's\nAll right you know for you do that I Would like for her to test the waters and see if she could borrow the money at lending club or prosper\nOh actually I like it yeah although I didn't know you're going to get it\nThat's all right I'll put it on a in a minute I'll put you on hold and we'll make sure we give you this information winning carbon paper or non traditional lenders where investors see the purpose of alone and decide whether or not they want to find it\nAnd based on her credit score the rate is a is according to her credit score\nBut I I Would much prefer for her particularly if she's going to Europe she has a job that you think is gonna really happened I Would much prefer for her to be the one who has to pay the loan because if she says she's gonna pay you back and then doesn't\nI don't lander owner doesn't care you're stuck with that loan\nYeah I'm not that I think that what happened that that's not passing out of it\nBecause at the point in life you were at um [noise] I don't like for you to be taking on a new data obligation\n\nYou understand why right because I don't like that and I know you're you're doing something from the best of your heart and best of intentions for your daughter but gosh I don't want you to put yourself in harm's way\nOkay so at\nLeast at least let her try and I put you on hold we're going to give you\nThe information on these two lenders again they're prosper dot com and lending club dot com Jason joins us on the Clark Howard show Hi Jason o clock at the public thought well great to have you here and you are Twenty years old right yep\nAnd you're trying to figure out how to do

could generate nice income for you so if I get you to divert you're allowed to put fifty five hundred dollars into a Roth each year I get you to divert fifty five hundred dollars you've now wiped out a ... percent\nOf the money that you've worked so hard to say that you haven't wiped it out but you've diverted it to save for retirement and then it's not there to help you start your construction business\nYeah so when you are in your own business there are many different ways for you to put money aside for retirement there's massive flexibility for a self employed individual or small business owner\nSo I Know this is gonna sound backwards from what I always talk about in your case I Would stay single minded as an entrepreneur\nAnd keep living on much less than you make putting as much cash
