cause lots of great stuff to give away in fact when you get right back to the busy phone lines right now and we are going to Stephen enjoy first Steve is that\nIn I Believe it's rose there Hey Steve welcome to show\nA warrant great to talk to actually it's sitting there were up in the Hudson Valley a couple of hours north of the city\nOh okay I Know there's a roast on Long Island\nHappen to grow up I didn't know I Know\nI Know I remember yeah what can we do have a lot to me tell you start a we recently adopted a rescue dog to be a companion toward each year old should sue poodle who's a wonderfully sweet dog but we lost our other dog will Maltese two years ago suddenly\nSo we rescued this new dog he's turned out we did a DNA test on he's mostly Chihuahua and a little bit of beef Sean so he's like a Chihuahua and based on color the fact the combination of Barker he's a year and a half old uh he's great he's very sweet\nThey get along fabulously the two dogs love each other the problem is the main problem is\nHe's very afraid it's a fear thing a big dogs he's kind of hyper nervous a lot of the time so we don't know what his first year and a half or so was was all about\nBut when we go on walks boy oh boy if he sees a dog bigger than even several blocks away or if it happens to be right next to each barking like crazy out of control\nAnd we've been working with a trainer through the rescue place you know if it's when he's around it works great with the with the fire shelter stuff he tells sometimes of what\nWhat what are you at what are you let's say you're sitting at the park you have your dog he sees another dog what happens and what do you do or\nWhat we've been doing is we're really tried to get them away from the situation\nHow does that work out well how does that resolving\nA well he'll try to but we we try to get them away where he gets calm\nAnd how how does how does how does getting them away from the situation that's creating a problem resolve the problem\nWell the idea is to give him when he was calm give them a tree and you know it works great\nBut they don't listen listen to me carefully okay the dog reacts like ooh Joey sees another dog and he goes crazy with the trainers told you to do is remove them from that area and calm him down and give them a treat what did you just do\nAre you I heard before you it's reinforcing\nExactly you just totally dog that that's what happened here's what you need to do this is so important to understand that when you have\nA dog beach reacting you need not to react to a mini you react you creating more reaction on the dogs but the\nMinute ... you had to many your dog sees another dog and starts reacting you can't stop you pull back on a leash she as long as you pull back on a leash he's going to pull forward on a leash becomes a tug of war making ... that's how guard dogs are trained\nWhat you need to do is when you're walking him and you take 'em for a walk you should probably your trainees instructions and do your basic training dog needs to know how to sit down and I understand that but as long as you react\nTo the dogs misbehavior in some way where he is getting attention for it and it ... you're not going to resolve the problem here's the resolution your dog learns how to learn to understand that when he walks past\nThe big dog nothing is going to happen nothing good is going to happen nothing bad is going to happen\nNothing is going to happen so here's what you do\nWhen you're walking your dog and he sees another dog he's ... I'm assuming it's a Chihuahua mix on a harness and you're walking past another dog and he starts reacting rather than stop rather than say anything you just continue working if you want you can say it's not only concern and don't stop once you're on a block or so away passing\nHim a pat on the head of you want don't make 'em do any training at that point\nBut the bottom line is he starts to learn there's no need to react that way you're reacting to his reaction the resolution to behavioral issues get the dog not to react in the first place and the way to get the dog not reacted to let him know that\nThis is no big deal so your trainer is okay and I know what you're saying and a lot of training approach it that way but the ... let me tell you I have taken dogs out of the worst dog fighting rings in New Jersey and New York I have worked with dogs that have been on the streets in South central LA that\nDog fight every day in a way that is the resolution not being talked with them not being asserted with them not taking them to a different area but\nMaking them understand that walking past no dog nothing's gonna happen therefore there's no need to react disaster resolution I Would recommend Steve\nIt makes sense but I've just weren't question out there when he polling and pulling and barking like standing up and all this is like direct to get him to keep walking is basically dragging him along the street but he's not going to just walk it it's not as a gentle barking\nWhen we bought here's here's what you need to do you need to walk him in a situation where let's say you were I don't know what the type of area you live and maybe there's a a dog park or maybe there's an area where people walk their dogs when you started out working in an area\nWhere he's not right on top of the dock in other words maybe he's not reacting the\nDogs at all after you've done that for a couple of days and he's not reacting and get a little bit closer who's reacting go back to the for the desk and little by little when he realizes that nothing bad can happen he's just going to stop doing help he's pulling\nA little bit at this point in going to the other dogs you don't want to react that way anyway follow through Steve I'm going to put you on hold them in the central copy of how to get your doctor do you want to appreciate that phone call say about everyone in

claims on auto insurance\nYou now have a mark of shame it makes it difficult for you to shop around and is likely to lead to big increases in their premiums you pay with who you're then stuck with\nSo you want to use auto insurance when you've got something relatively bigger that you have to deal with not something relatively small\nBecause they'll burn you when you make that small claim it's worse even with homeowner's insurance but you raise that the doctor bill and if you\nHave a lot of assets you own your home free and clear which like a third of people do you've got things that are of

it\nAll right let me see your back and help these are good problems that by the way\nYes sir what's so I've got I've got a I've got\nTwo different for on kick out of from two different companies I've worked for the past\nUm one is currently sitting about Eighteen thousand some change and the other one around seven thousand um of course I no longer work for them and the company I currently work for does not offer a for a lot of chase so I guess the question is what do I do with this money that city\nWhere do you do have the option of just leaving it and were those big companies small or in between that you were with before\nOkay so the one with Eighteen thousand is on I'm most concerned with a smaller company and I'm worried that they go out of business what happens to that much for\nThe money would be okay and the four oh one K. but if it's a small business there's a different issue and that small businesses tend to have very high cost for one case right so I was scared that all that money out\nQuickly and move it to one of the low cost providers and have an IRA with one of them the three big low cost providers for having IRAs are vanguard Charles Schwab and fidelity investments\nOkay than we have them and let me tell you how many do not call\nThe administrator of the four oh one K. and say hey I Want to um move this money out and do an iron and they'll say great what address you want to send you a check never take a check because what they do is they would subtract thirty six hundred dollars from the check they send you\nAnd send it to the IRS says withholding and you have to make up that thirty six hundred in the next sixty days or you end up paying massive tax for not being able to make that up so what you do with whoever you would go with\nIs they'll do paperwork that will move the money directly from the old employer's plan straight into wherever you're going to have the IRA\nAnd an end you recommend an IRA or the Ross are it I'm not here for you to I just I Know I hear you talk about you know I just\nI said the story is you can't take money there was in a traditional four one K.\nAnd put it into a rock without having a big tax bill because all that money that was pre tax correct so you go into a traditional i._r._a. with that money not a Roth IRA okay and you can over time migrate the money\nFrom the traditional to her office you could afford to pay tax on money cheer\nOr you just know you got money that they are that's going to grow over the years\nThat you're gonna have to pay tax on Sunday then let's talk about the other one the seven thousand\nIs that in a big employers plan or small\nA it's a very large employer or their trail the stock exchange\nSo is a big employer the odds favor that that will be an extremely low cost plan probably lower than you could find in an IRA okay so are the only exception to that would be if they have that money administered\nBy an insurance company for them the four one K. or buy a bank\nIt's it's it's it's just through one of the three that you make a\nLawyer and you could just leave that seven behind him move the Eighteen\nOkay and then as far as contributing to that the and you're able to\nOkay and then as far as contributing to that ... and you're able to contribute straight to the IRA versus trying to go through that\n... through great question so let's say let's get this simple I in fact let me let me really think about those who is the company that administers the plan for the big publicly traded company used to work for\nIts vanguard so if you wanted to keep it simple um move both of them to vanguard and an IRA\nAnd just be done with the old employers for one case 'cause it was with vanguard the cost will be low enough as an individual anyway and then you've got the simplification of just having an IRA there and then at vanguard open a raw for any future contributions\nTo you all have the twenty five to grow in a vanguard IRA and then you open a new account with vanguard for raw in any current or future contributions you may go into the raw\nOkay and then those can be so just so I'm Sorry I'm not a hundred percent up to date on all these states but a raw is post tax correct\nExactly yeah and you're already going to have twenty five grand that center pre tax account you want to have money in a post tax accountant or raw truly great to have a mix of both but tilted more towards the Roth\nThis will be a way for you to do it you simplify your wife you just have an IRA vanguard or Roth IRA vanguard old money and the IRA new money and the Roth IRA and that would be a good way for you to build up money going forward\nChris is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Chris\nHey Mark Sykes taking my call\nSure you've got a puzzle you want to see if I can find the pieces for\nHis or a wife and I were looking at twenty Nineteen health plans I'm currently we're we're all on a family plan and under my health insurance however the like many starts search hurting a surcharge for a spouse that's able to get health insurance through their employer\n'em and using round numbers it's roughly fourteen hundred dollars a year so if I ... and then see myself in the premiums would be nine hundred versus including her which would be Eighteen hundred on top of that fourteen hundred dollar surcharge and\nSo she's nine hundred extra month plus an additional fourteen hundred dollar surcharge a year\nCorrect so she's ten eight a lemonade twelve twelve thousand something a year for health coverage through your existing employer ... how much is it for her if she goes on her employer's plan\nIt would be a hundred a year\nEleven hundred a year versus twelve thousand a year\nOr a no versus on twelve hundred additional on top of love for the family plan and then I say to that if we both take\nOur ... plans that they're both high deductible plans on line three thousand dollars but the company and ... the employees are two thousand a fleeting roughly a thousand dollar to cover for that ...\n... or hers is five thousand but that would cover one hundred per cent lunch that's met so it was the main course she'll
