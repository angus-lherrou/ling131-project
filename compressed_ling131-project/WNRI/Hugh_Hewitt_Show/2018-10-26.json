eight seven seven three seven four men men\nI knew so my question actually ah pertains to uh we use credit cards is a a payment system especially ones that give us good cash back towards that are on rotating categories and a\nWhile you have more relations than I Do I got to tell you a Jeremy I can't my brain cannot process rotating categories of rewards\nAnd it took getting used to and I will say that I think you refer to them as back in the law and cards I call it a couch cards because we use this one card a long time to go to buy a couch and\nSo I got I got an offer in the mail for ten percent cash back for a certain category so I I definitely jumped on that but my question is is all these\nNew cards at ease these categories are so my wife is kind of the gang and I'm the Yankees and I'm online payments here and so she's in the atmosphere so she would be using potentially apple pay\nA and I would be the Android Pay to the more frugal side there\nAnd my question is when you use alternative\nPayment processors or maybe those payment for those charges are not going to be reflected as the correct category and so my question is is is if you use apple pay or enjoyed pay when those charges go through or are they going to show up as apple pay your Android Pay are they going to show up at say a grocery chain where I get a certain amount of\nCash yeah they'll show up at the chain see with ... with apple pay an Android Pay what they both do is they create a safer payment environment\nBecause they're using far more sophisticated technology to transmit a payment than what the banks use\nWith their credit cards so it's more secure platform when she pays with apple paying you pay with Android Pay and all it is is is the trans it's the way the payment information is transmitted to the store you're paying so it should have zero effect\nOn you getting those reward bonuses and the rotating categories\nOkay great and you know that if there was any problem you'd know that right away\nYou know their first statement would show that and you and uh you probably have to call customer knows service and get\nCredited to the right category but I I've never heard of anybody having a problem where it did not properly migrate to the right category using a Samsung Pay apple pay Android Pay or who knows who else is pay\nOkay well great that answered my question than\nI have a great day Andrea is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Andrea how're you doing today\nAnd I'm such a big fan thanks for taking my call off\nSure was great to have you here you have something that isn't as great as you like you have student loans to deal with\nI here at the iron fell down here at my ears like around ... they had a ... year ... kept getting around carry finance bang currently\nI Am trying but I have a plan of all time because at my encounter that ratio and you know currently with my part time and I do need a diner\nOn male oh I don't know I was wondering what your thoughts are should I wait for trying to start re financing for my income cheered that ratio is not what it is now or should I take out you know 'cause I I had\nI my parents because I and and Taylor asking about like a temporary life insurance plan if I were\nNot expecting a crowd at like if I get I\nDon't want to be talking with them if you were to part at just wondering what ha quite thought all that\nAll right so let's go back a step Andrea your loans that you have that you had a since he got out two years ago where they federal or private\nPlane federal um I had about maybe a Eighteen thousand pry that\nAre and how much total in federal would you guess\nOkay don't cranes too much but it's about Seventy eight\nOkay so that's actually good do you want much more if not all federal and as little as possible private so the federal loans you don't want to comb main goal with the private in any kind of re fi\nOkay so the federal loans tend to have decent interest rates to you know because years would be a various rates went rates are on your various federal\nThat anywhere from like three and a half to ... point eight I think as high as\nOkay so the lower ones there's no way you'd want to look at re fi you don't need a co signer for any of those who ... who was six point eight by standards of recent years this was undergraduate loans not graduate\nAnd there are okay because the graduates are probably the ones that are six point eight\nBut that ... thing with the federal is you can take your federal loans and have them\nUnder the direct federal program known as revise pay as you earn\nOkay and under that program they'll loan payment you are required to make is automatically adjust it up or down based on your income so the fact that you're working part time you may not have any obligation to make payments at all and still be considered to be current\nOkay so the federal loans you don't want to take them and migrate them to any kind of private refinance your crime in addition with the federal loans what is it you do for a job what kind of the old one\nI'm not a veterinarian\nOkay I don't know is veterinary medicine a field that gets you loan forgiveness after ten years\nI think of as\nOkay so otherwise it'd be twenty typically if you're under revised pay as you are okay but if your income or doesn't climb by a very large amount and you're paying is required under revise pays you earn your loan balances forgiven eventually on the federal\nOkay so that's why you don't want to co mingled those at all\nI see okay\nOh mangled those at all\nI see okay\nAnd by the way I Know this means you're an ultra brilliant person because it's much harder to get into veterinary medicine school than it is and their traditional medical school\nI don't know that the brilliant part [laughter] so on the private loans when interest rates that they carry I I'm not sure if I could tell you that right off the path right so until you\nGet your arms around what kind of rates you have in terms on the private loans well I wouldn't do anything moving forward with doing any kind of re fi or anything like that but I the only loans you would want to consider refined are those private ones\nAnd maybe do wait until you have the full time gig as a veterinarian and then you don't have the income to support refine on your own without your parents and you don't have to get into that thing that makes them uncomfortable\nOkay you're going out there I go all the time should I tell the federal\nCompact loans on their own but again move them if they're not already move 'em into revised pay as you are\nOkay okay All right best to you as a vet I asked them at their everything you do sure by by Tom is with us on the Clark Howard show host Tom Hi\nTom

I. X. around it's not just for New York I think it's a number of markets around the world where there's big theater saying oh yeah yeah all around the country and\nUm and also in London and with them\nOr you each day you see a list of shows available and what deals they have available for those shows okay and I got one other one as well that is the one that I've talked about for a few years called Broadway box\nFor her have you seen that one I have not to Broadway box dot com and if there's a particular show you think hey I really want to go see this particular thing\nIf you're a member of the uh theater development find and you have the deals available for them and you look at today text and all that you can always compare those to Broadway box wherever a particular show you want to see in a performance you want to go to is the cheapest you just buy up there\nOkay great thank you very much All right I Hope you enjoy being able to take and all that theater\nAt is with us on the Clark Howard show hello ed for the car how're you doing\nExcellent yourself\nGood thank you you have something that it's getting really old in your life a home equity line right\nOr right down to zero for quite a while and it's coming from time to either get a new one or just tried it and it's life answer the question I have is\nFrom the credit score standpoint is going to help me or hurt me to go hand in let's say and get another two hundred thousand dollar home equity loan but never use\nNow is it alone or a line 'cause the distinction where the difference there's a line you can drawing basically with like a chat\nLine line and the interest rate floats so let's step away from the credit aspect for a second let me ask you this do you find that has been a useful financial tool for you to know that that's available in a financial emergency of some kind\nIt is although I doubt that I ever need to use it except for maybe like use it to make some other investments that pay a whole lot higher interest rate so that would be the only reason I might want to use it\n'cause I liked the idea of home equity lines of credit is stand by in lieu of keeping money and things like simple savings accounts or anything like that if you have assets and you keep them invested and if you had a sudden the financial emergency\nHaving to sell investments could be at a bad time and that's where a home equity line of credit I think can be very useful is for people who carry very little or no debt in their lives a home equity line of credit can be a wonderful tool\nAs far as how it would affect your credit how long you staying in the house here in\nUh we've been there twenty eight years all the time we got another five to ten\nOkay so you're not looking to get a new mortgage or anything like that I think having a home equity line of credit is a good idea as a strategic thing then in terms of your credit the history of the ...\nA strategic thing then in terms of your credit history of the home equity line you have will benefit you for years to come the fact that it's been there\nThe issue potentially is available credit and ratios in terms of use of available credit and that would put the argument towards you taking out\nA new ... new home equity line of credit but what will it cost you to originate that he lock that would replace it the one that's done\nThey set of facts are costing won't cost you anything I'd do it okay that's what I was thinking All right we'll best to you at what they are like\nRebecca joins us on the Clark Howard show Rebecca how are you doing\nClark umpiring thank you\nRebecca you're looking for new wheels\nWell I'm kind of warm I bought myself a luxury model car it's a chick Avon Thirteen guy got it and ... thousand twelve and had to keep it for five years but kind of come and gone quite quickly\nAnd I always get the urge for a new caught our eye in his bells and less falls on a tech arsenic object our son and a fourth and can we pay for our callers have shot and um it's just a lot of money can be tightened down\nOn a car and ... ... once you write that check it's gone except for the car you know we have the car but I'm thinking I'm leasing might be an option for me\nSo I had when you bought that car back in twenty twelve am I hearing you right you just wrote a check for it you didn't take out alone\nNow we've got ...\nSo it's a lifestyle choice if you're in a position that you don't need a loan for a car and you light new wheels routinely\nVats of circumstance particularly with luxury vehicles that it may make sense for you to lease instead of by because with the luxury makes they don't like to out now discount the vehicles because they're trying to maintain a cache of brand worth\nSo with all often do is they'll factory subsidize the lease and where you get the deal on the luxury vehicle is in a way you usually for three years they want to turn you into another vehicle in a three year window\nRight and so a book cause for you is not a dollars and cents question it's more a lifestyle question we sing on many luxury makes would be the right decision\nWell for my next question if I decided to go into ... the next time I Want a new car to I found my car out right and then I go with them on because I'm not you handle your spark back on the price of the car and not the not the monthly payment ... [laughter]\nSo right so Carter when you when you get the deal are involved in the trade in of your existing vehicle it really comes up the works at fogs it up and it's hard for you to know what you're really paying as a cost of that place\nAnd ... says are complicated anyway so if you keep the idea of trading in your car has a separate concern here's how I like you to do it do you happen to live in a part of the country that has ... yes\nIf you go to ... when you're in the cycle of thinking you want to lease a vehicle ... we'll give you a guaranteed price they'll buy the vehicle from you for a week so you go start negotiating on your lease for the one you'd like to waste\nAnd make the deal on what the least is going to be when you're going to have to pay up front or what your monthly will be on the ...\nHow many miles you'll get under the allowance and all their particular price points with that ways and then and only then you say well I'm going to sell my old car to harm Macs what will you offer me for the car", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "city": "Woonsocket", "day": "26"}
