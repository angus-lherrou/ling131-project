person who wants to take exception with meat packing on Missouri\nSafety were misinformed here's what I like\nWhat was that a little background for some people didn't hear me before well no we're we're talking about I got really upset when Missouri\nPassed a law that makes it a crime to refer to things uh by words that might have meat and to them and the only exception is if something came directly from animals flash it can be called meet\nAt is pretty much right but I guess as a livestock producer Missouri\nI don't on laboratory grown meat late to train in a petri dish or lack of a better term should be ... to me that's not a real nice product that is a science fair project so [laughter]\nOkay so I got to tell you a funny thing with is a friend of ours was at a lab in California\nWhere she had an lab grown chicken there was genetically identical the chicken and she said it not only did it you know the food in front of\nHer look like chicken it tastes like chicken and it was genetically the same as chicken and that whole concept is where this could be\nAnd if you take the Missouri thing to its whole extension that would not be able to be called chickens I don't know what you'd call it\nIt has to say according to the mall and I think ... ... where to get more specific\nBut according to the ... on a case like that it would have to stay in a label on the label and the name of the product laboratory grown\nChick fil a still call it ... and I think that it would have to say laboratory grow to where it's not fake confused with me that was raised on they are\nNow under the under the Missouri law though you can't even use the word meat so let's say somebody ... lab grows\nAnd it's completely genetically be flight from a cow meat from a cow you wouldn't be able to call like meat at all it would uh I don't know what you'd call it you call it lab grown non meat meat I mean I don't know what would\nYou know and that's the idea the livestock producers in Missouri and ... and other people are pretty much too fast but his wall being passed and it was ... at the national level have something similar to\nIt so the laboratory drone product is not Paul leath fixes his destination of late and this goes back to a nice lady five wall that they\nHad in those areas late late has to be late to find as they had them all products\nAnd lab grown even if it's dramatically and\nGrown it will have to say laboratory ... laboratory for dish for water\nSo how long you been in the cattle business\nAll my life I'm a little bit older than you\nCould you have ever

ever listen\nTo you great to have you here and you have a question that is a dilemma that people posed to me from time to time\nAnd I'm going to let you tell your story but basically the ideas when do you use your savings to extinguish debt when do you keep both debt and savings\nRight [noise] so like Britain and I bought a house together last year and because of job stability and his heart he um took out a thirty year mortgage Clinton tension or I'm pulling it off as quickly as possible and advertising over twelve years\nHopefully down to tone [laughter] oh okay but how does his job as he wanted to share that concern there in case we needed to a lower those experts on that\nSo now because I sold my house I hired extra cash that they have all that we are looking or cutting down on as a lump sum on the markets to try to get\nRid of that soon we have no other data to fully fund or ... or ... and a traditional i._r._a. as well so we were just wondering if that was a good idea\nWell [noise] okay so you know mainly nervous suffered as er MK for her and emergency\nRight right so you make me nervous only on one basis and that is that this is unbalanced end the relationship\nBecause these are the proceeds from a house that you had\nTo be taking that cash and putting it into a house that you two have together and it's a boyfriend girlfriend thing and not a husband and wife so I what makes me nervous as\nYou put it into a joint asset this money that right now is completely yours correct so that so if you ask me um you can tell I'm getting nervous here is this to you\nBecause I Would I Would tell you that that makes me nervous for you if you look at the two of you is just a unit and stay unit that's your whole deal\nAnd you are going to sacrifice what you had from the sale of the proceeds of your prior home so that your life together is better financially\n[noise]\nWhat happened what happens if the relationship doesn't work out like you expect and hope and you put all this money on to something then he's going to expect half the equity at that point\nWell except that there would be a record that I haven't made any money so if they ever did happen that legally we have that issue handled\nI I don't think that does handle it I think I think it would have to be some kind of note that he would do with each other\nOkay I ... I hate this I hate being negative like this but I just you asked me the question\nAnd I need to protect you so if you would said hey we had this house together before we sold it we have the cash from it and now we're trying to figure out what we should put it towards the mortgage we have\nI Would be jumping right into well you got this you got that and the other\nBut in this case he made me a worry a lot about you because it's your money you'd be putting in here\nSo I Would want you to have a written agreement with each other and said that money is your money okay and that when you go to sell it that that would be your money and now let's talk about whether you should uh go on this trend line to pay off this debt so quickly\nWhat other stories are there in terms of debt and both of your lives\nNow than we have a we have three vehicles between us they're all ... wonderful um I own a small business with no ... I'm not great on credit cards off every month\nI Love all that so the the rainy day you got in case the unstable job comes on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you went out right when socket\n\n\nUsa radio news I'm Rick visit the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court is near certain as three undecided senators saying they'll vote for confirmation one of them Maine Senator Susan Collins who says there's not enough evidence to support and sex assault charges against Kevin there or\nI Do not believe that the charges pen barely heard bad judge cabin or friends ...\nWest Virginia democratic Senator Joe Manchin posted to Twitter that he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh Senator Jeff flake told reporters it unless something big changes\nThat he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh Senator Jeff flake told reporters it unless something big changes he'll vote to confirm Chicago jury finds officer Jason Van Dyke guilty of second degree murder and the twenty fourteen shooting was Seventeen year old as attorney says Van Dyke and his family are relieved he's not facing the death sentence\nYou know it's an emotional moment with him and his family in a forward to say is that guy is the toughest man I've ever\nSentencing is that correct over thirty first you're listening to us a radio news balance of\n[noise] when you want an action hero or a model comics when any protection from a downpour put on a raincoat\nWe didn't want to see someone who's on one or the ballpark\nBut when you have been injured and all you need a trial lawyer there's only one lawyer needs to go to him at his Marshfield Smith much has been appearing in state and federal courts representing individual\nWith an engineer he also has been settling cases ... traces and mediation when you are in need of a trial lawyer as opposed to a national hero fade haberdashery or a professional athlete then there's one celestial attorney mark hills Smith Esquire\nLocated in Smithfield call for on some six nine forty one twenty four in Providence on ... street goal for a one to seven to forty thirty to visit his website both high lawyer dot com or email market L.

David\nI played football wow\nSo do you know what talent I have that I could do on any athletic field a no no\nThat's right because there isn't any [laughter] I'm impressed but you're good enough that you could get a a full ride athletic scholarship that's wonderful to hear\nThank you so um when there's a scholarship you're telling me that none of the five twenty nine money you had to use 'cause you're on a full free ride Yes sir okay so your grand dad has some choices uh-huh\nFirst I should ask what are the odds that you're going to go to graduate school at some point after finishing undergraduate\nUm there's still a chance um I'd say it's probably less likely but there's still a chance I Would pursue graduate school\nAnd the reason that's my question is that then it's it's easy you they can't just sits there and then when you were to enroll in graduate school if you did then you're going to need to pull on the five twenty nine money and then you're available to you tax free\nWill cause you're a scholarship athlete there's this special provision in the five twenty nine rules that your grand dad can withdraw the money or you know ten percent penalty\nBut he would have to pay tax on all the earnings for five twenty nine it's had\nOkay and it could be his money could cause the actually the owner of the five twenty nine account polls without it it's their discretion what to do with money which comes to the next point are there any other grandkids who have yet to attend college\n[noise] um yeah I have three more younger siblings\nSo the best move by your grandfather is to change the beneficiary designation to one of your younger siblings it maintains the tax free status\nAnd then the money can be used for your siblings college and you get the full benefits or the earnings that have occurred over the years being spent tax free on school okay\nAnd so that would be in a case where you think grad school is not a big priority not likely moving the

collectors are after him for\nAt this point what I added up about ... the four thousand which is a lot less than what he initially road and I don't know if that's because the collection agencies are settling for less\nI'm from the original bill that I thought it was over a hundred thousand and now when I asked him about it it's about eight or ... thousand um which is still a lot of a lot of money um I just wonder how how to start rebuilding his credit\nRight so if you want to help rebuild its a separate issue than the homeownership okay and that is for you to join a credit union if you've not done so already and a number of credit unions have something that goes on the generic term fresh start program\nWhere he can open a savings account the credit union and with that savings account in place some may require a CD instead of a savings account they always show him a low credit limit we use our MasterCard\nAnd most credit unions they'll report that as any old credit card to the credit bureaus which will give him a straight line payout to establishing a good current\nPayment history with a credit card\nOkay wonderful as far as medical dads with them being that large yeah it really is something you're going to have to let the clock run\nIt shouldn't be just not do anything about them at that point and let them but but then it just it where they are and eventually\n... seven years they have to go away okay and the seven years is not from when the originally they were turned over to the collection agency sir when the bills were originally occurred at the time of the accident\nOkay and the great news Christ in is that he has and you're telling made a good recovery from what could have been a a really bad result from that motorcycle accident\nAnd as far as the
