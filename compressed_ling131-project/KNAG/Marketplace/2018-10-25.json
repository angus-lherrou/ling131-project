twenty five to thirty percent more so we're looking at forty to fifty thousand dollars extra cost\nAnd twenty five percent tariffs on steel and aluminum the pipes are made from steel\nYou seeing actual quotes from our company so we buy the steel pipes saying that they've also increase the price for twenty five percent\nThese price hikes are getting passed directly to consumers in the form of rate increases on their water bills\nSo we're seeing ... about a two percent increase primarily due to the increase in our materials cost\nThe company that produces the little water purifying resin balls is called pure light it sells to municipal water systems around the country that serves millions of consumers\nIt is a U.S company but it owns a factory in China Jacob Brody is vice president he

reasonably conclude we could get out of it just as fast but as marketplaces song reports game theory suggests otherwise\nGame theory is the way scientists and mathematicians think about human behavior in interaction which should I Do based on what you do should I trust you and what do I do if you break that trust\nBefore this trade war the U.S and China had some trust both were members of a free trade club known as the world Trade Organization and then trust broke down trade professor Jennifer Hillman at Georgetown Law says a decade ago Beijing begin requiring U.S companies there to hand over their secrets\nThey're forced technology transfer violates the commitments China made when it joined the WTO that its level of IP theft is a violation of the intellectual property provisions\nWashington meanwhile broke trust by taxing Chinese imports this year\nUnder the WTO rules the United states is not allowed to unilaterally just ratchet up the tariffs on China\nGame theory suggests a couple of things one is it's hard to establish trust one has broken into a trade war is actually a rational thing for countries to do it in their self interest here's how\nNYU business process I ruined sooner ... says the U.S interest is to tax Chinese imports whether Beijing responds or not either way Washington makes money\nThat China and poses to address the US's best responses

cooperation and free trade is the exception\nBoth countries imposing tariffs is the ... equilibrium of the game\nTo sit in origin this means a trade war could go on a while as in ten years now game theory does allow for things to get shaken up but it takes something dramatic to disrupt things said political change\nCould be the election of a new president and the United states now that unfortunately has to be coupled with a similar willingness to negotiate on China's buck\nOr outside parties say other countries of the WTO could bring the U.S and China together and create space for trust his Jennifer Hillman at Georgetown Law they could say listen here's a new trade agreement that takes away tariffs provides a new customers for your exports and outside third parties will be the free trade police\nGiving a little bit of political cover to China to say we need to make these reforms in order to remain a member in good standing up the WTO we need to do these reforms\nAnd it
