Richardson from Edward Jones and Catherine Rampell from the Washington Post our in our studios in New York City everybody\nHi Kay guy so let me start with you uh and and ah in the process of asking this question I'm going to point out that we're going to be hearing from a Tracey Samuelson in about six minutes or so on some of the details of the GDP report as it deals with trade but a\nThat we're going to be hearing from a tree she should emotion in about six minutes or so on some of the details of uh the GDP report as it deals with trade but a very quick pass on his GDP report it is a good number\nYeah the headline number is good there are some underlying parts of it that are a little bit troubling including the fact that business investment I had had slowed\nYou know there is this risk that the boost to a capital expenditure as was pretty front loaded this year as a result of the ... and we're seeing a slow down I'm so that is a little bit troubling but generally the headlight number was good consumers seem happy\nMeal it it occurs me actually just thinking back to our open the show but I should have said there is that there are three fourths right economic growth the trade war and also the tax cuts 'cause there was a tension there between the trade one of the tax cuts in the stimulus and the and the ... stimulus if you will of what's going on\nLet's boil it down to two things uh one is higher interest rates which the stimulus feeds into and stronger growth and right now\nFor a short period of time maybe we're at an economic sweet spot for the economy can still grow but inflation is still very moderate in fact below the Fed's target rate of two percent in this latest GDP read\nAnd so right now um things are looking good economically speaking in as good as Katherine said because the consumer is good I I hear some trepidation do when you're ...\nYou know there's no such thing as a perfect the economy and part of the reason that markets were worried this week and we saw that in the stock market this week is they're they're the three persisting concerns slower global growth higher interest rates\nAnd ... concerns those are going to stay with us until they're resolved and so you'll see the push pull in the market between really strong fundamentals and I'm very worried outlook for ... investors\nResolved and so you'll see the push pull in the market between really strong fundamentals and I'm very worried outlook for ... investors ahead\nOkay Katherine not to point out the president's ah economic inconsistencies but it there's a ... point them out well well uh [laughter]\nSo so here's the thing just on the street and tariffs and he he came out this week in in a tweet at some point Monday Tuesday and said we're going to get billions of dollars into the United states because of all these jobs not mentioning that consumers are going to pay those terrorists but then he turns around in an interview with the wall Street Journal and says tariffs we don't have any terms on this economy I don't I don't understand I guess is what I'm saying\nWell and in that very same Wall Street journal article he also talked about how useful the terrorists had been no like basically in the same breath ah you know on the one hand he's saying we have these tariffs on the other hand he's saying the terrorists are exist\nIt can make your head spin a little bit and you can understand why it has been so difficult for some of our trading partners potentially to negotiate with the people who have been dispatched to negotiate on behalf of the United states\nIf they don't really know what the president wants the president is inconsistent about not only what he wants but actually what he's already been doing then that can be that can make it very difficult to make any sort of progress and you know when I've talked with\nA business groups when I talked with business owners they have expressed a lot of concern about the the uncertainty that comes from the fact\nThat Trump does not seem to have a particularly sophisticated understanding of international trade or clear goals for that matter about what he's trying to get out of these negotiations\nMillet other on them from the wall Street Journal interview and and uh one has to say it's a goal right is to put pressure on the Federal Reserve he once again called the fed uttered budget Powell a his biggest uh economic problem I'm even as a German ... told me back in June even as the fed doesn't pay any attention with President says one does wonder if you know\nEconomic problem I'm even as a German ... told me back in June even as the fed doesn't pay any attention with President says one does wonder if\nNow with some signs perhaps the economy might not be a all that it will be for too much longer um and the fed might be thinking about raids what does this kind of pressure you suppose due to the ...\nWell you know it makes a hard job even that much harder right so what that is really concerned about is how to keep the economic bull market running how they keep economic growth in and stop lung stone normalizing policy because women mess\nAnd we know that it will be a land eventually the neck and recession hits he wants to make sure that he has to look at is this fully ready to to stop\nA the slowdown is possible and that means raising short term interest rates it's a very effective tool the fed has been using it for years and they want to make sure that tools ready for the next recession\nAnd they want to do so in in a context of economic growth and so that's what's happening here very moderate increase in short term interest rates from zero right so\nAlong that path any political ... political realization of a very moderate increase in rates makes the heart his job all the more tricky and that's what a has to be negotiated going for a port\nBill Richardson a at the end we're Jones Catherine Rampell the Washington Post on a friday I'm In New York city don't you think ... thanks guys have a nice weekend on Wall street today down day that ended up and down weak and let me say one more time I think\nLike the fourth time as we said this this is normal this is what's supposed to happen markets go up they go down but it has been a while some things have felt this chopping run will ever details when we do the numbers\nAnd [noise]\nThings have felt this job he right will have the details when we do the numbers [noise]\n\n\n\n\nAll right back we're going to go to the GDP report from this morning because you know a list economic indicator and all that is Catherine and you'll and I were saying it's pretty good number credit where credit's due\nBut you dig a little deeper as we want to do around here and you could start to separate what is boosting economic growth consumer spending for instance from what is not helping growth all that much at all one of those drags last quarter was trade marketplaces Tracey Samuelson explains what's going on there\nSo how much faster with the economy have grown without this drag from trade\nYou would have seen a much larger growth rate probably closer to over five percent\nAt the end but you know is chief us economist at ... ...\nWhat you saw was exports down pretty sharply imports were up pretty sharply\nTogether that shapes nearly two percentage points off of GDP Growth but he says imports were driven by a strong dollar which is making foreign products a good deal plus she says companies were replenishing their inventories filling up their shelves head of the holidays\nThey may also be trying to get ahead of tariffs on Chinese imports that are set to jump from ten percent to twenty five percent in the new year\nBetter ... now and have it ready to sell rather than having to purchase more that cost more down the road\nThis macro economic data matches what we've been hearing from public companies as they report their quarterly earnings Matt McDonald is a partner with Hamilton place strategies which analyzed transcripts from recent corporate earnings calls\nTrade discussion has edged out tax or farmed for the first time and when they're talking about trade there almost all talking\nThink corporate earnings calls the trade discussion has edged out tax reform for the first time and when they're talking about trade there almost all talking about tariffs\nFor example Ford has estimated that Trump administration's trade policy will cost the company a billion dollars this year in part due to higher still prices and tariffs on imports from China\nThat does feel like from both the way companies are talking about it and from what we see in the GDP numbers that the impact starting to bite\nStreet and city I totally did not know that folder but you know the day that gets stored up in the cloud as the saying goes well it turns out all the big tech companies Amazon Google all the big ones they back up their cloud servers on magnetic tape\nIt seems so old school right but there is a problem and it's not what the tape just two companies make the tape it a big chunk of the Internet is backed up on too\nSo old school right but there is a problem and it's not what the tape just two companies make the tape that a big chunk of the Internet is backed up onto and each wants the other out of the business through decker is the ... reporter for Bloomberg walk in the program\nYeah how are you doing today guy I'm well thank you are but I I I Will be completely honest and tell you that I read the story and I said they're still using tapes for cloud backup explain to me how this works\nYou know old school sometimes is the better the storage on on a cloud obviously is just basically somebody else's server but you when you need long term archival storage you want something separate it from the Internet and you want something that's going to uphold massive amounts of data even more than a server and that's where the tape comes in\nAnd the experts say the tape is the medium of choice because\nIt's cheap it's good and it's it's reliable and its stores a heck of a lot of data\nYeah Gen cheapest important with all that that are right I mean ... I don't even know what gets bigger than terabytes but we have a lot of them\nYeah at ... terabytes is equivalent to about a million books I'm right now a a single LTS seven linear tape can hold about Fifteen terabytes so that's about Fifteen million books on one tape on one card\nGosh okay now there was a corporate store you're right there's it Sony and Fuji film or the makers of this tape that everybody now uses and we'll be using for awhile and they're sort of at loggerheads here explain what's going on so there's a basic\nStandardized technology that was developed by IBM H. P. and quantum it's called the linear tape open there used to be six manufacturers now there's two\nThose two have said oh you're using my patents in Latin inventions and the other one says no you're using my patented inventions and each one has filed complaints at the international Trade Commission and here in Washington trying to shut the other one out of the U.S market\nPotential courses that if there's only one supplier of this tape\nAnd each one has filed complaints at the international Trade Commission in here in Washington trying to shut the other one out of the U.S market\nPotential courses that if there is only one supplier of this tape and we're using it tobacco basically everything that's an issue\nAnd that's the concern of the hardware companies um they have filed some papers with the IT ceasing please don't shut either of them out or we want to have multiple suppliers\nUm both of them by the way our in Japan and also there are concerns about what happens if there's another earthquake what happens if there's another Saddam me that shuts down operations\nGive me the upshot of all these ah shoots encounter suits and decisions and whatnot we're dependent it seems on backing up basically the entire Internet\nOn on just two companies trip that that seems like a challenge it it is there are some older versions of the tape but the hardware companies they want the newest version they develop the standard and she put ever more stuff on these tapes so if only ones and\nThey would either have to pay higher prices for one or they would have to use these older tapes that have less data\nIt's so interesting because you hear people say oh it's up in the cloud all the time right and you think of this ephemeral thing but it's actually really tangible a physical product\nWill think about it I mean if you have software and there's a bug that's introduced into that software that bug will go on and on and on\nBut if there's a physical version of it on tape than that but doesn't touch the tape and that's how you can recreate it and and so you know I spoke to a number of people during the reporting and my story and they were all saying basically this is what keeps the world's running wow [noise]\nSusan Decker she's the patents a correspondent at a Bloomberg Susan ...\nAt a Bloomberg Susan thanks a lot of pressure to\nFrom the American pet products association comes to set up for this next story in two thousand Seventeen we that as Americans\nSpent more than sixty nine billion dollars on our pets will disclosure part of that came for me about six billion ever do give or take went for services like grooming and training which gets us to the point to a series we do called my economy help people's personal economies are doing away from the big economic headlines here you\nMy name's ...
