three glimpses into his thinking on monetary policy interest rates in other words\nAnd what the Federal Reserve has been doing with them namely as marketplaces Mariel cigar sitting right there just said raising them three times this year if you are counting and we are and so is the president which gets us to this first of all this from the president last night in Erie, Pennsylvania apologies by

it's a despite that we're doing very well but it's not necessary in my opinion and I think I Know about it better than they do believe\nSo if your business and economics journalist what do you do with

have the tools to do that we have a statute that allows us to do that in in a way that is independent of political considerations I'm strongly committed to it and so on my colleagues\nSo where does all this going well there's a mention here that this whole thing we've been talking about the past what five six and a half minutes whatever markets tumbling rates rising the fed doing what it's doing a president doing what he is doing it's all anchored all of it in the knock on effects of one economic reality whose name\nIs inflation the fed as we told you would like to see prices rising by about
