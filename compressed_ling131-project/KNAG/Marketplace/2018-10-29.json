infrastructure our road specifically are in bad shape typically the money to maintain and sometimes even improve those roads comes from gas taxes California is one of several states that increased it gas tax not too long ago to get more money\nTo make more repairs but as often happens with new taxes not everybody is happy about 'em and they have taken to the ballot with the anti tax proposition six coming to California voters a week from tomorrow\nBut as much Jed Kim reports now from the streets of LA changes in what kinds of cars are on the road might make a real gas tax difference\nElaine

hole\nBy raising the state's tax on gasoline from Eighteen cents a gallon do thirty cents\nAlmost immediately a group formed to put forward proposition sixty over to the increase and require all future hopes to be approved by voters rather than legislators\nCalled the ... is chairman of the yes on prop ... campaign he blames the poor infrastructure situation on mismanagement politicians have more than enough money to fix the roads they just keep diverting the money\nSo we don't need to add the cost of living burdens to working families to fix roads they should be putting the existing gas tax into roads rather than increasing it\nBut even if the gas tax word to stay the same it wouldn't be able to keep up with the demands for one thing these Texas haven't been indexed to inflation

player\nSo you're waiting rooms with the training room right that costs are over there the beautiful weight rooms and drug so this is a big boom you're supposed to start asking questions but I'm going to cause it's like this is the heart of the players right this is where the rubber meets the road um so what keeps you up at night but what's your worst\n[laughter] my ... my the thing that keeps me up right now is that the the greatest player in the NBA LeBron James decided to come join us\nAnd and be part of what we're building and we've missed the playoffs every year for five years so this is not what the brand was meant to be and that's what what\nAre fans deserve to be back to what they're used to in in terms of Lakers basketball having the best player has brought us back it's it's it's

basketball operations what I felt was and why I had to make the change from our existing general manager and my brother Jim who oversaw basketball was that there was no identity of Laker basketball\nThey're really interesting 'cause liquor basketball as like a brand name\nExactly and and you can't establish anything when you're changing coaches every eight months so we've had three coaches and three years\nYou know and each one a great coach in themselves but you can't change your roster overnight and so the ... everything was not matched up right and we were struggling with no identity\nSo this goes to something which are marketplace all the time you were in uncertainty and and not only does regular business with them through new show true to the sports business in sports teams and the woman learning new sports team right on through he was going\nIt was killing the brand and it was you know when my father passed away than commissioner David Stern called me and he said\nJeannie don't let the team fail like don't let go do run into the ground losing a yo yeah when we looked like\nIt it would you break your dad's heart and so you know and it was difficult because I wasn't in charge of basketball my brother was and I asked him how long is it going to take you to get the team on track and he gave himself a timeline which\nAs as time went on I realized it wasn't going to happen and that's why I had to make the change that I did but I you know I took that to heart and I wouldn't I wouldn't let this you know my dad had six kids and I think the Lakers were his

know my dad kinda set it up for us but ultimately he gave me the authority and the power\nTo make any changes that I saw a necessary one of the key components of that decision making process was a conversation I had with Kobe Bryant he said what a player\nAn all star player who's you know a free agent is going to look at an organization and how it operates\nAnd making sure that there's somebody in charge who has authority to accomplish what the goals are meaning you've got you've got to get the organization in the right position before anybody will consider\nInvesting his career in what you're doing right now nobody knows what you guys stand for\nSort of becomes a poke in the question about it and making the change from prior management and your brother you should wear the number of
