thousand sixteen election\nFifty two percent of Americans think there is going to be a recession sometime in the next year but that is down as well another thing we learned is the big picture aside Seventy seven percent of Americans say they are financially secure or somewhat financially secure right now\nWe wanted to know what that actually feels like what financial security means to people so we called up some of the people who took a poll and we asked him\nMy name is ... ... ... and I am in Charlotte North Carolina\nMy name is he do you keep Christopher ...

party lines a majority of Americans say we are in a trade war they're not especially worried about it just ... percent say traded their topic and I'm a concern\nBut on the theory that nobody knows which way the current us Chinese trade relationship shall we say is going to go what might get more people more worried\nAbout one way things could get nastier is if China started selling off some of the American debt that it holds so marketplace Tracey Samuelson looks at the likelihood that might happen\nThe U.S government spends more each year than it brings in in revenue and to come in that shortfall it borrows money selling treasury bonds China owns more of these treasuries than any other country at one point two trillion with a T dollar\nSelling treasury bonds China owns more of these treasuries than any other country about one point two trillion with a T dollars and this has been a source of anxiety long before the current trade war here's Hillary Clinton on the presidential campaign trail back in two thousand seven\nWe are now dependent upon China and how do you get tough on your banker thing is\nChina's stockpile of treasury bonds is a very small fraction of the total us debt about five percent Mary Gallagher is the director of the center for Chinese studies at the University of Michigan I think\nThe notion of China as our banker is overblown both in terms of how much debt is actually owned and also whether or not their alternative buyers\nBut lots and lots of treasuries hasn't actually been buying many more in recent years so the question is really would China dumped the U.S debt it owns as a weapon in the ongoing trade war you know flood the market with lots of bonds to try and mess with US Economy Gallagher thinks maybe anything is I think possible\nGiven the fact that the trade war is more pointed then I think people initially expected\nBut selling off a bunch of treasuries would likely mean selling at a discount meaning losses for China a fire safety reasons but I was ... will be all when we're at UC Davis thinks China would have to be provoked to resort to that if I'm lucky that the Chinese would auction\nReached by phone a lot of the\nActions which ... short term as bond prices fall the yields or interest rate the market demands would increase that would raise borrowing costs on lots of types of loans Brad sets are with the council on Foreign Relations says that only reserved to the rescue\nThe Federal Reserve has all the tools needed to limit the damage to China to cause through sales\nThe fed could tweak its plans to raise interest rates\nHas all the tools needed to limit the damage that China could cause through sales\nThe fed could tweak its plans to raise interest rates in order to offset any fallout from
