them bring with them more wailing and gnashing\nOf teeth then these two seemingly simple words currency manipulation the subject comes up every six months Treasury Department is required to put out a report listing those economies that are manipulating their currencies to gain competitive advantage but really here\nWe are talking about one economy right China that as we told you last week the Treasury Department did not repeat not\nSay Beijing is manipulating its currency\nBut that did not end the wailing and the national over the weekend treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said he might actually consider changing the rules the department uses to decide whether countries are playing fast and loose with the foreign exchange markets so we asked marketplaces Tracey Samuelson why all the

unless\nThis is not something that very many countries have done historically and not something many countries are doing today\nDavid Steinberg is a professor of international political economy at Johns Hopkins but if you worry as the president does that other countries so more to us than we do to them then you worry about the ways that exchange rates can make those foreign goods even more appealing Matthew Goodman is with the center for Strategic and International Studies\nThere's a close relationship between currency and trade policies\nThing as good as China isn't currently devaluing its currency for competitive advantage\nThey don't you know clearly meet the test of manipulation of the moments\nIn any way the label just doesn't pack that much punch feels legal at the University of Maryland\nIs kind of a strange tool because if we deemed China to be a currency manipulator the result of that is and we have to have talks with China about it but of course we're talking with them already\nThen there's the politics Derek scissors with the American Enterprise Institute\nRemember the president said he would call China a currency manipulator on day one we've now gone through four rounds of reports where they haven't called them a currency manipulator and you know their reasons for that but that's not what he campaigned on\nWhich could put him on the defensive on the next campaign trail I'm Tracey Samuelson for marketplace\nDetour now to personal finance and that all important credit score the way a heavily on people's economic wellbeing psycho would you short for fair

for people who don't have much of a credit history to begin with or who maybe didn't have the greatest credit in the past marketplaces debris British or it has more now on who stands to gain from

this are those folks who have marginal credit scores or who don't really have much credit\nBetter scores can save people money they affect your insurance your car loan your mortgage now the question for any new type of credit squared though is is it accurate Jonathan glow he is a principal a consulting firm ...\nSo it's very easy to create credit scores when the economy is going well and default or very low where the robbers going to hit the road is really when we hit the next rough patch\nThe next recession is when you find out which loans should not have been made in New York I'm Sabrina short for marketplace that always the way on Wall street today that name is volatility will have the details when we do the numbers\n\nIn case you somehow haven't been keeping track Fifteen days until the mid term elections\nAnd while acknowledging that past performance is no guarantee a future results if the next two weeks or anything like the past couple of months who boys a lot of political money going to be spent the center for Responsive Politics figures five billion dollars from all sources is going to wind up being spent on the two thousand Eighteen congressional elections a lot of it coming from\nWell shall we say the upper end of the income distribution marketplace adjusting who has that one\nOne of the reasons there's so much money flowing into these midterm elections is because billionaires alleging more of their cash and politicians\nThis is something that sort of arose out of in North as fortunate as being made\nFor the last few decades\nThat stand for political scientist Adam ... he found that the total wealth the Forbes four hundred jumped eleven to fold since Nineteen eighty to the amount will be people spend on politics has gone up in proportion historically he says\nPretty clear that there was a lot more money coming from very wealthy conservative\nLike casino mogul Sheldon Adelson he's thirty four billion dollars and he's a staunch supporter of Republicans and pro Israel issues after getting Donald Trump twenty five million for his election he doesn't watch from the front row as the president celebrated the opening of an embassy in Jerusalem\nThis year it'll send and his wife ... eighty seven million dollars to conservative groups and candidates but lately but like I said many billionaires are leaning another way\nAnd over time it's been trending pretty clearly towards more money going the darkest concerts\nGroups and candidates but lately ... says many billionaires are leaning another way and over time it's been trending pretty clearly towards more money going the darkest conservative candidates have earned more billionaire donations the data from the center for Responsive Politics show Democrats are catching up\nBy like I said that's because a lot of newer billionaires come from more liberal places like Silicon Valley Dustin Moskowitz the billionaire cofounder of Facebook gave over five million the groups like move on dot org and a group dedicated to winning Senate races others say the polarized political climate over the last two years his let more people in general to contribute\nI feel this is an emotional need for people to engage\nThat's ... next year in America that's the political action committee run by one of the biggest democratic donors Tom's dire hedge fund billionaire from San Francisco you might know style from his controversial ad campaign to impeach the president which hasn't been uniformly popular with Democrats\nA Republican Congress ones impeach the president before ... and two days dire as political\nGroups are spending a hundred and ten million dollars I'm liberal causes an east coast billionaires are spending a lot to Boston based hedge fund manager sets Carmen recently announced you donate twenty million to help like Democrats after years of supporting the GOP\nFor New York city Mayor Michael Bloomberg pledged a hundred million to help elect Democrats that could prove useful as Bloomberg eyes a democratic presidential bid and twenty twenty\nContributions like Bloomberg's are pretty easy to track but then there's what's known as dark money\nThat we're seeing the spending side that we don't necessarily know who is actually behind it and a lot of the cases\nAnd I'm a ... a research is dark money at the center for Responsive Politics a huge chunk of the spending goes to advertising and depending on what the ads say she says their funders don't always have to be disclosed\nSo it makes it hard to tell whether it's a billionaire spending or a corporation or anyone else\nFor sure so to the to the other half of the question then why did the Federal Communications commission what Sinclair do this show many times\nThere is no simple answer to that I mean that the FCC comes under a lot of criticism for allowing too much consolidation has been a problem under both Democratic and Republican administrations\nUm they have allowed a number of enormous monopolies to form now I should say that I'm In the late nineties the FCC did investigate Sinclair for this a sort of fraudulent divested her strategy\nThey ended up finding that Sinclair had violated some of these rules and they were not making good faith truly independent divest teachers and um they find the company brace herself forty thousand dollars which is really not a lot of money to a large corporation like since\nI've as teachers and um they find the company brace yourself forty thousand dollars which is really not a lot of money to a large corporation like Sinclair\nA word here in defense of the Federal Communications commission or Sinclair as one of the Tribune media for a while they had a deal and just recent well a number of months ago but recently in relative terms or the Germany ... pi set in essence I'm not going to let that happen\nThe Tribune merger was sort of a fascinating little window into the business in regulatory environment that has sprung up under President Trump there was this real sense that the merger would just get waved through because Trump is a big supporter of Mr Smith end up Sinclair and he was tweeting positive statements about the company\nAnd several weeks ago I G pie announced while we're not going to approve this deal we have major concerns in effectively killed the deal referred it to a legal hearing within the FCC which sort of doing that\nBut what we've learned since then has Sinclair was basically behaving in such a way that it was a foregone conclusion they did not even make minimal effort\nTo appease their regulators and get their deal approved and they had had\nSuch success for such a long period of time for the odds were in their favor\nThe trick had worked in the past the number of regulatory experts I spoke with said well it's sort of one thing to try and pull off that trick with the ... when you're a much smaller company but once you are the largest company in the country and you are about to become even larger\nThe government's going to take a closer look and even in this incredibly friendly environment what they were trying to do with so brazen that the FCC had to put a stop to it\n... stuff writer for the New Yorker reading most recently about Sinclair broadcasting company also you hear a lot of fun it would have to do is I\nThe theory that knowing
