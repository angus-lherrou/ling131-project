I Would have bought ... because even though we paid an extra price that we\nDidn't think we should have paid it put us into all so many places I forgot number how many branches we got but in those days you got the one down the street from my house where I bank I mean right and which country you're in California we've gone from seven or branches to a thousand I think it was a fabulous platform for Jake more to grow so I still would have done that one\nAre you satisfied that um we have the protections in place now\nTo avoid something like that happening again yeah you should never be satisfied and I I mean explain that ... ... regularly should I say they really should be happy and take a victory lap I gave you just do leeman redux\nIt wouldn't happen they would have had not twenty below the capital but fifty because of the regulation yeah sort of play they would have had a lot more liquidity a lot more transparency if it did go bankrupt at the moment of bankruptcy it would have created another hundred billion dollars of equity than most over cap wise for him in the world\nThe government can run it and do whatever they want that but I think it was an orderly unwind yeah but ... it was a disorderly unwind were asked us was thrown\nI Want explained that ... the regular should I say they really should be happy and take a victory lap I give you just do leeman redux\nIt wouldn't happen they would have had not twenty below the capital but fifty\nBut because of the regulation yeah sort of play they would have had a lot more liquidity a lot more transparency if it did

assets\nThat was all ... so the capital liquidate the banking system is stronger\nBut with the way you look at risk I I don't just guess what the future as I say what is the worst you could possibly be and can we handle it\nAnd to me family means I guess still sort of my client does not mean to have to run and panic\nBut not always be quite as that question where's the next problem coming from it will be different from the last problem cyberattacks on other institutions clearing houses and I'm not worried about shadow banking but they're always going to be issued a shadow banking so if you're a regulator you should be really cautious about what's happening away from banks\nAre you worried about you know given all that cyber and all of that are you worried about um the fed and its actions are and are you worried about or politicians and them stepping up\nYou know I'm not worried about both we plan for both not being exactly what you expected so I think the fed is doing the right thing and raising rates the economy is quite strong\nAnd they just think it was just normalizing it but you know is it possible that down the road something happens it's too much inflation if that's going to move quicker that's possible so I'm not predicting it but my in my company could easily handle it but it is possible just likes them just like\nThe terrorists can cause problems you don't anticipate today just like cyber can cause problems\nAnd are you worried about a politicians and them stepping up\nYou know I'm not worried about both we plan for both not being exactly what you expect it so I think the fed is doing the right thing and raising rates the economy is quite strong\nAnd they just think it was just normalizing it but you know is it possible that down the road

like\nThe terrorists can cause problems you don't anticipate today just like cyber can cause problems just like China can cause problems I mean you always got to be looking to figure out and make sure you can handle bad outcomes\n... jumping ahead of my list of questions because I Want to get the terrorists in the second ... but but look let me back you up for a minute on the healthy economy and I'm not going to argue that the headlines ... jobs GDP all of that good stuff\nBut as you said are on the forty whatever it is floor of this building looking out ... literally yet at the American economy there's income inequality there's wage stagnation which has just recently started to pick up and I mean there are some not small problems yeah\nSo the American public's understand that this is the most prosperous economy world's ever seen you have to wait a minute I mean I I I went to it but the good in the back so exciting so the good as we have wonderful neighbors in Canada and Mexico are we've got all the oil is food water energy we need\nWe have or what the founding fathers gave a freedom of religion and freedom of speech and freedom of enterprise the best universities that why is the capital markets and yes it can be quite a real issue and we studied it and they're fixes to it the economy's been going in Munich early and ... and it was driving low wage growth less small business formation\nAnd all these other things that we need to fix okay but law and the ... the American public will do everything we talk about their or fixes for we put her mind to it\nAnd kind of dropped a Democrat or Republican view of it\nI appreciate the positivity generally I Do have some reality are right we have serious problems with many other country\nReligion and freedom of speech and freedom of enterprise the best universities that why is the capital markets and yes income inequality the real issue and we studied it and they're fixes to it the economy has been going in Munich early and it's ... it and it was driving low wage growth less small business formation\nAnd all these other things that we need to fix okay but load and the architects of the American folks do everything we talk about their or fixes for be put her mind to it\nAnd kind of dropped a Democrat or Republican view of it all I appreciate the positivity generally I Do if there was some reality are\nRight we have serious problems with many other countries in this global economy we are pulling back from the international arena the president said in the at the un across town a couple of days ago it as America First right so\nDo you reconcile that with what you call for in your letter which is intelligent thoughtful analytical and comprehensive policy\nWhere virtually have slipping a bit so that we have not had war we countered Mexico's Eighteen forty eight\nMexico's extreme quite well and we should treat them very respectfully\nBut you're absolutely correct this trade issue a medical a skirmish yeah yeah and it will so what people are afraid about is that it will get worse into what we call trade what so what do you see that it's going to make it not get worse from a skirmish 'cause it sure doesn't look like anybody's back into that look we advise the president that while you were young while you were you\nYeah we have and I know lots of us have done it and I'm most was said that we understand the issue to China and he's right\nNon tariff barriers tariff barriers will property all intellectual property is owned enterprises subsidies et cetera I'm hoping the other day the president succeeds him where he wants to do and I say hey your method worked I'm just worried that the method can cause more problems so she'll put on your your most objective Jamie\nDiamonds self here for a second an answer this question or is it possible that you have too much power in this economy you\nSo I mean there are all in a lot of leverage zero or twenty eight million companies in America\nI'm most was said that we understand the issue to China and he's right\nNon tariff barriers tariff barriers will property all intellectual property is owned enterprises subsidies et cetera I'm hoping the other day that President succeeds him where he wants to do and I say hey you know your method worked I'm just worried that the method can cause more problems so she'll put on your your most objective Jamie\nDiamonds self here for a second an answer this question or is it possible that you have too much power in this economy you\nI don't think so I mean there are all in a lot of leverage zero or twenty eight million companies in America\nI mean you know we we are one actor of many in this economy and there are a lot of other big banks are a lot of them I I'm going to be could be one of the Chinese banks folks I I don't say that lightly\nThey they are already they have a bigger home market they make more money they were worth more than the market value there's so many Chinese banks make more money than we do\nThey have aspirations and they showed their going overseas and they should they find their Chinese companies overseas and they should and they will be competing with us in a lot of things we also proud to compete one day with alley pay and we chat ten cent and\nSo I I look at the world on this ... this is Graham say no we're gonna have competitors I
