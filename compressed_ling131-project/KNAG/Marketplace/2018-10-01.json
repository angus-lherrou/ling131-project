this we will have a result of much more happening right here in the United states it means\nMore than anything else far more American Jobs and these are high quality jobs they're also strong provisions to enforce what's called the rules of origin requirements this will incentivize billions of dollars a new purchases of us made automobiles\nAll right so you heard the president let's unpack this agreement a little bit new name and all we've got marketplaces Scott Tom Hi Scott\nManufacturing powerhouse uh that's the president's phrase that's what he said this new trade deal is going to create in the U.S [noise] so let's talk jobs first um east is really going to create new jobs\nAt the very least it it's unclear so it looks like automobiles auto jobs at the center of the rhetoric of everything a and B and and we're a lot of the jobs involved are so few simple let's say you assemble cars and trucks to sell here in North America you might be Toyota or GM or BMW\nRight now sixty two and a half percent of your content has to be from Mexico where the U.S or Canada that's to avoid tariffs under the current deal or else it's taxed\nSo this new deal written after two point oh whatever yup was set up to ...\nFirst um east is really going to create new jobs\nAt the very least it it's unclear so let's take automobiles auto jobs there at the center of the rhetoric trickle of everything I envy and and where a lot of the jobs involved are so few simple let's say you assemble cars and trucks to sell here in North America you might be Toyota or GM or BMW\nRight now sixty two and a half percent of your content has to be from Mexico or the U.S or Canada that's to avoid tariffs under the current deal or else it's taxed\nSo this new deal written after two point oh whatever you have to set up to Seventy five percent of the ideas well let's make North American cars even more North American ... now here's the problem\nThe problem is the sanctions or the or else that you have to do these chores or else I'd take away your phone right we see that in my house while the or else here is the terror of two and a half percent so if you make cars in Mexico where it's cheaper and have a lot of auto makers dug their way out of the great recession\nYou might say well you know instead of messing with my supply chain in finding parts in Indiana where it's expensive and his bureaucratic\nI'm just going to eat the tariff of two and a half percent in since uh non compliant anyway I might source more my parts from low cost places like China I'll just get around it so that makes for more jobs in China and more jobs in Mexico\nOr let's say OK I followed the rules I have more U.S content for more U.S suppliers that's probably going to be more expensive so my costs go up my prices go up I Can't compete I might sell fewer cars and sales go down and I lay off people so several ways this could backfire as far as jobs\nWhen we talk about jobs one of the big focus here has been high wage jobs and there were a young age and in this to create and protect out of jobs that pay at least sixteen dollars an hour ... fit in\nThey're still says a large percentage of each vehicle has to be made my workers who make sixteen bucks an hour or more so what uh companies do when we just got pushed up\nExpensive so my costs go up my prices go up I Can't compete I might sell fewer cars and sales go down and I lay off people so several ways this could backfire as far as jobs\nWhen we talk about jobs one of the big focus this year has been high wage jobs and there is a provision in this to create and protect other jobs that pay at least sixteen dollars an hour [laughter] what fit into that\nSo there's still says a large percentage vehicle has to be made my workers who makes sixteen bucks an hour or more\nSo what uh companies do when we just got pushed up will sometimes yes the hiring more workers who make more money sometimes they say you know what\nIt's time for me to want to invest in Warsaw afterward and more robust and more automation to replace people and as the cost of worker goes up and the cost of automation goes down there is no guarantee that employers are going to respond the way we think they might\nWell so looking a little more broadly doesn't take up all of the terrorists against Canada and Mexico you know they're not all off the table and it's a little thing what's here and what's not\nYet so right now we do have tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum those are those are announced those are in place and the justification is because of national security so Canadian steel Mexican steel still subject to that and it's more complicated but there could be similar tariffs on automobiles\nComing as well we're waiting for the Trump Administration and that that's on a separate track but for right now yeah steel tariffs are still in place in North America\nIs interested in here in D.C today what are the chances this all gets approved by Congress\nWell good luck Lucy predicting now a vote on this would come next year after the midterms when there's a good chance the Democrats could we will take the house rights and historically Democrats have been more anti trade deal now this deal is more complex and might have pieces that Democrats could support but whether they're going to give the president a victory that's a different question\nMarketplaces ... thank you very much You're welcome NAFTA has had\nBut for right now yeah steel tariffs are still in place in North America\nAnd filing is interested in here in D.C today what are the chances that song gets approved by Congress\nWell good luck with your predicting a vote on this would come next year after the midterms when there's a good chance the Democrats could we will take the house rights and historically Democrats have been more anti trade deal now this deal is more complex and might have pieces that Democrats could support but whether they're going to do the president a victory that's a different question\nMarketplaces ... thank you very much You're welcome NAFTA has had a long history question for yet who was the first president to talk about that idea we've got a video with the answer just go to market place dot ORG and click on a little tab that ... mentioned on air\nNow we're going to stay with trade and the U.S MCA the White House says the agreement is day quote we in for American farmers ranchers and agribusiness well someone in that category is Patrick Smith he\nRuns lost his ranch is in ... Washington they grow apples and also hops you know for beer Washington state is a big producer of both those crops and Mexico and Canada are big buyers we've had Patrick on before to talk about all this so welcome back\nThings will be glad to be here All right so based on what you know so far um how does this do you look\nOn so far I think there's a lot for farmers to be excited about in this deal farmers of course to deal with a lot of uncertainty already and so taking away some of the uncertainty regarding a couple of our most important trading partners is welcome news for most of us\nDo do you think the people around you um are you know X hailing a little bit today\nI Do I Do I think um you know Mexico's is a very important market for\nUs agriculture in general and in our region especially fresh apples and\nWith the back and forth on trade\nSo far I think there's a lot for farmers to be excited about in this deal farmers of course to deal with a lot of uncertainty already and

little bit today\nI Do I Do I think um you know Mexico's is a very important markets for us agriculture in general and in our region especially fresh apples and uh with the back and forth on trade over the last few months Mexico hit established to tariffs on us apples\nAnd yeah so now Apple's in this deal\nHas no tariffs applied to them and I think for us up here in the\nIn the central part of Washington state that's a big relief\nDon't last time you're on the show you talked about apple exports slowing down do you do you think that maybe this deal you know speeds up apple exports this year as that ship friday sale\nI think we're hoping that export levels will return to where they were earlier this year you know we were having a really good movement into Mexico and the first four or five months of the year and then this summer after the terrorists were\nImposed that movement slowed down significantly and so hopefully we do see a return to those levels from the first half of the year and we're hopeful that that will get there in short order\nWe look at this are you sitting here thinking this is Jess ... again or are there differences that you see I mean how does this plan for you on the ground at the same thing with a different name\nIt does kind of looked like that from our end right now I'm I'm sure that there are some differences for maybe some under other industries but for for us in our businesses um\nHops in Apple's this looks a lot like a what we've had last few years and and that's good\nFrom the first half of the year and we're hopeful that that will get there in short order\nWe look at this are you sitting here thinking this is just nasty again or are there differences that you see I mean how does this plan for you on the ground at the same thing with a

in Apple's this looks a lot like or what we've had last few years and and that's good\nYou know are you still concerned about trade in the rest of the world trade with Asia for example or has this given you enough breathing room that you get to sleep easy ...\nI think we're still hopeful that this is one step toward maybe normalizing a trading relationships with Asia with Europe Mexico and Canada of course are two very very important markets for us but we're moving apples and hops around and around the world and would like to see\n'em you know more of these types of deals come a similar to the Trans Pacific partnership a that we've uh pulled out of but more of these types of deals would be very welcomed by most of us and in our industries\nPracticed questions and experts support on
