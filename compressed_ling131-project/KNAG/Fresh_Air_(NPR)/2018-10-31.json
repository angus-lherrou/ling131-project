Nineteen nineties the period when Jonah Hill was a self described not great skate border but hung out with a group of much better skate boarders\nThe film isn't autobiographical but it draws on his memories\nThe film was told from the point of view of a boy played by the eleven year old son ...\nWho wants to be a skateboard or and be accepted by the older skaters he admires\nThe take life threatening risks with skate tricks and stunts and spend the rest of their time smoking drinking and trash talking the skaters are played by pros but the skaters they play are unlikely to get anywhere they have no money no connections\nJonah Hill welcome to fresh air congratulations on a movie what did skateboarding mean to you when you were in your teens\nAre no ambassador for skateboarding\nAnd skateboarding is so sensitive\nTo being portrayed in film by outsiders and that's understandable because it's often for church but when I was\nMaybe nine or so skateboarding gave me a real sense of especially more in my early teens gave me a real sense of community outside of my home\nAnd I think a lens that I ended up seeing a lot of life through which is you know taste in music close um treatment of authority\nThat I ended up seeing a lot of life through which is you know taste in music crows um treatment of authority and just a sense of perverse closeness I don't know just laid an imprint on me so\nI'm the group uh skaters who you were friends with us or aspired to be friends with what was that culture like\nIt was a lot of different things you know I was always terrible I always wanted to be great I think I still would trade a lot of achievements for certain skateboarding achievements that just I don't think are physically possible for me at this point at thirty four I filmed a lot\nBecause to be great at skateboarding you have to be willing to slam on your face down ten stairs on concrete over and over and over and over and over again and there's something\nPunishing about that in self punishing about that and there's a great reward that is true we earned even if it's just for you where are you willing to do that when you wanted to skate\nVery briefly in a time where I think I invited pain but I quickly grew out of inviting physical pain in my life and more\nEmotional [laughter] good for you\nYeah I'm\nI'm at my scars are stars are inside [laughter] ... yeah it's just a general recklessness which are related to you and I related to this kid's loneliness and so even though this isn't my story\nI wanted to show someone going through deep pain and a real sense of hope through community even if that community is just has deep flaws to it like small mindedness prejudice massage any that\nFor this kid it's still provided something hopeful and perhaps these young men will grow up in and learn some of this stuff\nWould you have a dream of getting on a skateboard now [noise] ah\nYeah I Dream about it every night I honestly Terry when I tell you I Would trade a lot of my life to be able to do certain tricks\nRight okay I shouldn't use the word dream would you unreality [laughter] every considered an escape or now I landed\nA cake

known for starring in movies like Superbad money ball and the wolf of Wall Street I Want to ask you again about all The Simpsons scripts that you wrote when you're a kid did you ever try submitting one of them\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting them\nWould you be willing to share a story line or a joke from one of your early script\nHere's what I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was in a file since a young age and my parents were incredibly ah let's just say how would I put it\nThey encouraged me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film so perhaps ignore the content of certain thoughts but I maybe should have waited to see till I was older so\nSaw how interested I was in film so perhaps ignore the content matter of certain thoughts but I maybe should have waited to see till I was older so I had seen the godfather to really young age 'cause it's my dad's favorite movie and I wrote a Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten and then I think is a I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the analogy between the characters from the godfather and the ... and The Simpsons were clever for a nine year old [laughter]\nWho is who Marge was Don Corleone [laughter] because as a nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer so she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the dawn\nNo excuse me she's Michael so OK okay barges Michael a grandpa Simpson is is done he dies right away though so Marge is Michael weight as Homer fan\nNo Homer see that would be but that would make margin Homer siblings so even in my nine year old mind I knew that was not going to work so Homer is a K [laughter]\nI like Ike Lewis Diane Keaton like [laughter] what are you going to go legit you know [laughter] but ah Lenny and Carl homers friends from work were Lenny was frayed auto and call was sunny\nAnd I don't know I mean it's not actually clever but for a nine year old I was like wow it's interesting that you have the um fishing or the or or even I guess the wherewithal to know who would be the character equivalent of who tend\nTo think of that story and character in that way and to make connections between things that I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were the\nAnd to think about story and character in that way and to make connections between things that I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were beyond your age as a kid that your parents let you watch because you love movies so much\nI'll tell you story that I I find interesting because\nI mean I saw everything I devoured film I continue to I Love it so I'd ran through so many films and I would go to the newsstand and you know your parents take you to the magazine stand when you're a kid and you flip through magazines or if there's a magazine see on the corner and they're out another place or something\nI Would look through the film magazines I was just so interested so I Would ask them often can I see this film can I see this I mean most of the time they say yeah so basically it came down to two films that I wasn't allowed to see [noise]\nUm they said we are ... you don't even realize how lucky you are you cannot see kids and you cannot see a clockwork orange\nWell kids is all about kids similar to the kids in your movie\nIt's a seminal movie in my life kid is a huge influence on me as a filmmaker but this film is in the opposite of kids where kids is so beautiful and it's ... and it's the world ending tomorrow burn the world down and this film mid nineties is all about connection and hope\nEven if it's dysfunctional connection and hope and\nThose are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my mission to see both of them right away I think I was eleven or twelve how did you do it\nUm a friend of mine who ice skate boarded with who was older had both cassettes at his house\nAnd I saw kids and I was like I Love skateboarding I Love New York this is about kids skateboarding in New York I completely was too young to understand the AIDS subplot or main plot I guess and so I completely wasn't affected\nNew York I completely was too young to understand the AIDS subplot or main plot I guess and so I completely wasn't affected by that so I was just like this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life it wasn't till I was older than I understood\nThe HIV aids plot ... part of the film because it went over my head so I just took wow this is subversive and this is dangerous you know [noise]\nAnd then I saw a clockwork orange and I had to go to my parents like a shell of a child and be like you were right I saw it [laughter] any disturbed and I need to talk to [laughter] I was like\nYou know like a lot they want to do is tell them that I disobeyed them but I was too shook up not to speak to them about what I had seen what shape you also about the film\nI think the raping ultra violence was just too of course it was too heavy so so hard to watch as an adult let alone a kid what are your parents say to reassure you\nWell first of all they were like you should listen to us because we're telling you this stuff for a reason yeah and then of course didn't for many many years and realize\nThey were trying their best I think ultimately it did make me braver as an artist in life because I Do think about that and I think ultimately there's something about me that draws me two\nThings that are difficult and maybe I'm uncomfortable with comfort and I think my acting career says that when I really dissect it as well\nI guess this Jonah Hill he wrote and

called mid nineties and set among a group of teen skate boarders in the mid nineties\n[noise] you know it's been interesting to like first see kind of like I'm coming to manhood on screen 'cause she was started in your teens I'm super bad you a lot in your early twenties yeah and\nIt's like in the past I don't know bunch of years five six seven years you started playing more dramatic roles\nYou know in films like Wall Street and Moneyball how did you get the word out to film directors that you were interested in making that transition to more dramatic lows [noise]\nIt's just by choices you know um I had seen the puffy chair which I loved and I reached out to the ... brothers after super bad came out and I was like I Would love to work with you\nAnd they gave me this part and Cyrus which is a film that I Love is that um was great experience with John ... told me and then in ...\nJust part in Cyrus which is a film that I Love is that um was a great experience with John ... told me and then in ... and then Bennett Miller was making money ball and Catherine had talked about me to ban it and then then it's off Cyrus and cast me money ball\nAnd then in the interim or\nI continue to do some comedy films that were funny and fun\nAnd then uh\nI had heard about the wolf of Wall Street and I asked you audition\nAnd um\nI knew that was going to be a fight to get that part but I I knew I wanted that part really badly and then when I wanted to write and direct I think I had a lot of opportunities to do that if I wanted to make a mainstream comedy\nUh\nAnd when I really thought about it I was like wow things in my life are happening that are intense\nAnd am I going to be happy\nJust doing what is expected of me or what my heart really want so I have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out how to love who I Am\nAnd I have to figure out what my voice is as a filmmaker and when I looked to my heroes like Mike Nichols or Barry lemon center people that started out in comedy and ended up having great filmmaking careers\nI looked at their first films and a lot of times they came from a really personal place and they weren't just funny they were they felt like life and they felt like all the pain and joy of life\nWhy only hear a scene from a loaf of Wall Street which was directed by Martin Scorsese\nWhy don't we hear a scene from a Wolf of Wall Street which was directed by Martin Scorsese\nWritten by parents winter who was also the show runner for the HBO series Boardwalk Empire\nAnd so this this this is a movie that I'm a based on the story of Jordan Bell Ford who

wash\n[laughter] okay so that's the thing that Leonardo DiCaprio\nMy guess Jonah Hill from the wolf of Wall Street um what did you learn from working with Martin Scorsese on off of Wall Street\nIs going to see so many things I guess the main lesson I learned was that it's okay not to judge or characters to just show their behavior as people and the characters in his films often do really ugly things\nAnd you still find humanity and then and\nI like how unabashedly an unapologetically he shows human behavior for better or worse\nWhich is something you've tried to do in your new movie which is I think something that really\nTo meet in art in general and something I'm\nGoing to strive for do if I'm lucky enough to get to make another film and something that I\nSpeaks to meet in art in

incredibly boring to her kid\nHe like an old man but he's still a little kid so the fact that he has to listen to NPR it's incredibly boring to kid even though he's so aware to talk about the show with such detail and understanding\nBut that actually that character came about years and years ago I did the first time this is my fifth time and I guess I hosted first for super bad so I was
