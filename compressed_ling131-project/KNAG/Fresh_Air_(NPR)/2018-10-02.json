your story that you helped break the you consider the most consequential story of candidate or President Trump and his administration ...\nI mean there there are several um stories are obviously many stories at the Washington Post broke that I had a a hand in one way or another uh ... obviously working very closely with some terrific an amazing colleagues here\nI think the one that jumps out for for many people as the story a that said that that former national security adviser Mike Flynn had not been honest about his conversation with the Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak\nWe wrote the story saying that he in fact had discussed the lifting of sanctions on Russia in those conversations and then lied about it to the White House or to news organizations including our own and to the American public\nUh and this was the sort of just one of many huge stories that we broke during that time and a couple of others that I was involved in include\nThe revelation that the CIA had reached to a ...

trying to help elect Donald Trump\nAnd then later when Trump was in office I broke several stories about his rough conversations\nI mean not that part of it felt great um I mean for me I had I had actually known Flynn for\nFor a long time probably a decade or so had interviewed him many times I'm overseas and at the Pentagon and other positions\nAnd always liked him I took no pleasure in his ouster in his his resignation um and what came next for him I mean that didn't that didn't make me happy but at the same time it just the I yeah I mean it was\nAs a reporter\nThere is there is nothing

stories about candidate and President Trump and the Trump Administration stories that have been reported by Miller and other reporters at the Washington Post\nYou know you're right in the book that Trump has avoided consequences for offenses that were long considered politically fatal often by lying in the face of overwhelming evidence Flynn however had no such immunity I was interested in that you used the word lying\nWord lying when used in the same sentence as Trump is very controversial in the journalism world because lying implies intent\nYou know a false hurt it is when you speak something that isn't true lying implies that you know it's not true and you're saying it anyways so people are just weighing\nLuck is is worthy of using the word lie or not so you've used the word lie so I Want to ask you about how you decided to use it\nYeah I mean I feel like\nWord lying lying when used in the same sentence as Trump [laughter] it's very controversial in the journalism world because mine implies intent\nYou know a false headed is when you speak something that isn't true lying implies that you know it's not true and you're saying it anyways\nSo people are just weighing lack is worthy of using the word lie or not so you've used the word lie so I Want to ask you about how you decided to use it\nYeah I mean I feel like um it is a difficult decision and we don't we don't throw that word around lightly we um we often get criticized at the post for being\nToo reluctant to use that word and I think that's true with other news organizations as well but at the same time I mean we're here at this moment are you know we have a fact checker at the Washington Post to his documented\nFive thousand or more fall swords from this president since he's taken office many of them are false words that he repeats despite repeated corrections public corrections repeated efforts even by his own staff\nTo um to correct his misstatements I mean there is an intent I don't think there's any doubt that there is an intent or that it is part of\nIt's part of Trump's per se ... very complex personality it's part of it and it traces back to his origin as a as a as a public person um I mean we have run fascinating stories here at the post about\nA times earlier in his career when he would adopt phony persona and call reporters for Forbes on the phone and try to lobby them into inflating his net worth for magazines in magazines annual rankings I mean there is a there is an intense here and I don't have any doubt about that\nUh that it is part of\nIt's part of

earlier in his career when he would adopt phony persona and call reporters for Forbes on the phone and try to lobby them into inflating his net worth for magazines in magazines annual rankings I mean there is a\nThere is an intense here and I don't have any doubt about that or or real any hesitation when appropriate from using the word lie\n[noise] after Flynn resigned under pressure\nUm each spoke to Devin noon as the Republican chair of the house intelligence committee and you say that what he told you was basically the opening of what became an ongoing CJD by Trump and his allies to discredit the FBI what did he tell you\nThis was at a time when we're trying to figure out well we know that Flynn had discuss sanctions would the Russians was basically cutting a deal behind his government's back with Moscow\nAnd not just raised a lots and lots of questions about what who else was in contact with with the Kremlin during the campaign if anyone right so we're we're digging by our news organization and many others and this was a conversation with the chairman of the house intelligence committee Devin Nunes has\nWho has who is read into all of the most sensitive intelligence on questions like this\nAnd I was asking him you know what else is there we are seeing lots of indications contact between Jared Kushner and and officials for Moscow and other members of the Trump Organization we already knew about Paul Manafort of course\nAnd he says that the FBI has been looking at this and all and it's all a dead trail and I pressed him\nOur news organization and many others

abundant evidence of contact you could say that that was incidental and meaningless and harmless but you couldn't say didn't exist but\nHe says it you know when I pressed him not even pizza boy delivery contact\nAnd it just struck me at that time that that was\nSo implausible um that he was you know he was trying to throw sand in our eyes basically uh in my eyes as a reporter he was trying to um protect Trump and that that was um more important to him and that conversation then or adhering to the facts that had already been established\nMy guest is Greg Miller who covers intelligence

I'm not going to trust and not having an anonymous source [noise]\nUm so what are your rules what are your guidelines for using an anonymous source and for how to use them and and and also like who knows within the editorial hierarchy at the post who those sources are so they can be confident and do any fact checking that's necessary\nSo that's a great question Terry and it's really been a really important one at this moment because we do depend on anonymous sources um for a lot of the stories we do and frankly if we weren't able to use anonymous sources\nWe would really be unable I think to give our readers in the world an accurate picture of what's happening in the U.S government inside the Trump Administration inside the CIA or abroad\nAs Bob Woodward says over and over\nSo they can be confident and do any fact checking that's necessary\nSo that's a great question Terry and it's really really important one\nAt this moment because we do depend on anonymous sources um for a lot of the stories we do and frankly if we weren't able to use anonymous sources\nWe would really be unable I think to give our readers in the world an accurate picture of what's happening in the U.S government inside the Trump Administration inside the CIA or abroad\nAs Bob Woodward says over and over again I wouldn't really say anonymous source the reporter knows who the source as it's the readers who are kept in the dark about the SARS but it's not like you know ended up leaving yelling you the information\nThat's absolutely right the sources are not anonymous to us\nUm these are sources that we know who they are\nUm many in many instances their sources we have known for many years and have developed trust in because of how reliably they have given us information um and you know frankly even in that case when we're writing sensitive stories I we talked earlier about the the Mike Flynn story and how we ended up\nHaving nine separate sources there's no magic number nine was not the magic number we had to get to to be able to go forward with the with the publication of that story could have been two or three it's more about the caliber of the sources their their positions and whether they have access to the information that they are providing\nA how trustworthy are they how much do we know about them inside inside the Washington Post there are lots of conversations at varying levels of specificity about that sourcing\nSo sometimes you might be asked well what is the position of the who what where is the source and coming from from the story um who are we talking about here and you can you can basically described their positions in government\nSometimes if it's highly sensitive senior editors are going to want to know more they're going to last\nSources their their positions and whether they have access to the information that they are providing\nA how trustworthy are they how much do we know about them inside inside the Washington Post there are lots of conversations at varying levels of specificity about that sourcing so sometimes you might be asked well what does the position of the who what where is the source in coming from from the story\nUm who are we talking about here and you can you can basically described their positions in government\nSometimes if it's highly sensitive senior editors are going to want to know\nMore they're going to want to eat identify your source and that you know that sometimes can get a that can get touchy depending on the nature of your agreement with sore say or source be\nBut it's something you know ultimately despite you know we we all of these accusations and criticisms that's our reliance on anonymous sourcing\nI mean the the records of sort of holds up the stories that we've written over the past two years attributed mainly to anonymous sources have almost all proven overtime to be accurate I mean there might be mistakes at the margins here or there were a news organizations aren't perfect and ... and we do make mistakes\nBut boy we've gotten a lot right\nUm and I know Marty Baron the executive editor at the Washington Post talks frequently about\nYou know the post and other news organizations um are always trying to get it right\nBut at this moment in our history where we are under such attack all the time and accusations of fake news\nYou know there's extraordinary care given to getting the facts and even the nuance exactly right\nIt it's really it would really be damaging to not just the Post's credibility in my credibility as a journalist but to the broader um journalistic community if whenever we get things wrong there's a lot riding on the media right now\n... um are always trying to get it right\nBut at this moment in our history where we are under such attack all the time and accusations of fake news\nYou know there's extraordinary care given to getting the facts and even the nuance exactly right\nIt it's really it would really be damaging to not just the Post's credibility in my credibility as a journalist but to the broader\nUm journalistic community if whenever we get things wrong there's a lot riding on the media right now in its ability to do its job and do it well and do it right let me try to give you one more example of\nThe reporting environment that we're trying to operate in just how much pressure we're under as reporters how much pressure our sources are under a as well um there came a time this past year when the Justice Department in Congress released the memos that former FBI Director Jim Comey had kept\nEvery time he met with Trump every time he meets with Trump something happens troubles him he goes straight to his computer types up a memo to record what ... what transpired\nOne of those talks about a conversation he had with Trump in the oval office and most of the coverage about that memo focused on their interactions about what Trump wanted him to do in terms of backing away from the Flynn investigation but\nTrump is also complaining to call me in that in that setting\nAbout the leaks that are plaguing him at that point early in his administration he's complaining about how are people Howard news organizations learning what I'm saying into this phone and he points to the phone on his desk in the oval office\nHe's complaining about stories and he's talking as I read this memo I realize he's talking about me he's talking about the stories that I had written for the post combing is talking about yeah\nAway from the Flynn investigation but\nTrump has also complaining to call me in that in that setting\nAbout the leaks that are plaguing him at that point early in his administration he's complaining about how are people Howard news organizations learning what I'm saying into this phone and he points to the phone on his desk and the oval office\nHe's complaining about stories and he's talking as I read this memo I realize he's talking about me he's talking about the stories that I had written for the post\nCombing is talking about yes I agree with you sometimes it's great to put somebody's head on a pike as an example the Trump goes on a joke about putting\nTrump goes on to put joke about putting were to say he believes reporters should be put in jail or in jokes about how once reporter spends a little time in jail they make a new friend suddenly they're willing to talk\nIt's a really disconcerting moment for anybody in journalism anybody who cares about journalism um but for me it it was just eerie um to to think that he's talking specifically about stories I had written for the Washington Post\nThey're talking about heads on pikes reporters in jail chasing down sources it was it was unnerving it make you afraid\nWell\nLet me let me ... it\nIt made me afraid I I was confident enough in my ability in in how I approach sourcing that I wasn't worried about that I work for a news organization that has my back um and that's a good feeling\nBut it is frightening in a way Terry and I remember talking about this at home um when I saw this memo describing this document to my wife and what what's in it and our seven\nWell let me let me put it whether it made me afraid I I was confident enough\nIn my ability in in how I approach sourcing that I wasn't worried about that I work for a news organization that has my back um and that's a good feeling\nBut it is frightening in a way Terry and I remember talking about this at home um when I saw this memo describing this document to my wife and what was in it\nAnd our seven year old was at the table with us and he heard me talking about it and using words like jail and he's following this conversation that I maybe it was being too careless as a parent and bringing the subject up in front of him but he started to cry\nOr he started to get really worried and asked whether I was going to be put in jail\nUm it is frightening it's um we're just trying to do our jobs um we're just trying to get to the truth we're trying to fulfill the role that the founders and vision for for the media in this country and it's an important mission\n\nIs it too and they stick with you for the
