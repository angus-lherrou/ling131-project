work with smaller samples otherwise it takes a kind of ... stone that I think she would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it\n[noise] I'm\nWondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his songs or read his homes there was this really dark quality but there was this like kind of\nExistential distance from it at the same time and it transcend than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is troubling you by the idea of you you reading poems yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality who is expressing at the same time\nTo his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality is expressing at the same time and that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which he talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that ah that this is\nThis is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nI appreciate you saying that as the sun but as a fan of your father's work I Would say that he performed his work in concert to large crowds of people and there are so many performers who have performed his songs so they haven't met that have his work as a life outside of his mouth\nAnd ... and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room\nQuietly reading his poems so I go and then when you get on their record as saying you know and I'll go one step\nFurther with what you're saying just because I don't believe that the contradictory in a sense I mean this is a man who's put the word hallelujah\nOn many on millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men or that of course when it's attached to song it's supposed to lift and uh and exist away songs have always existed I just mean that there's something about\nReading the poetry that I'm feels instructional or\nHas a kind of rigor
