going to make a film about Neil Armstrong and ... what [laughter] why would someone who sell absorbed in movies and jazz and musicals make a movie about ... an astronaut in space\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Damien ... who directed the new movie the first man that Neil Armstrong the space program in the sixties and Armstrong's walk on the moon he was the first man to walk on the moon and Damien ... also wrote and directed not on land and whip lash\nWhat did you have to experience yourself in order to convey the experience of being in a spacecraft that's out of control did you do any simulation exercises just you know you can viscerally experience it and therefore portraying\nWe tried to shoot in in a way where we and the actor\nFirst man that Neil Armstrong the space program in the sixties and Armstrong's walk on the moon he was the first man to walk on the moon and Damien says al also wrote and directed not Iran and whiplash\nWhat did you have to experience yourself in order to convey the experience of being in a spacecraft that's out of control did you do any simulation exercises just you know you can viscerally experience it and therefore portraying while\nWe've tried to shoot in in a way where we and the actors could be experiencing some version of it you know so instead of using green screen or kind of relying on digital effects to to sort of paint the picture we we used full scale replicas of these capsules they were the you know sort of exactly the same size all the details were\nExactly the same our production designer Nathan Crowley did incredible job sort of rebuilding these things\nAnd we ... we would mount the you know we wouldn't fly them into space but we would mount them on the most control systems gambles that basically wouldn't move and rock back and forth quite violently if we needed them to\nUh and we would set those up against a ... D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see off to set you look out the window you see space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had to kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors and for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital\nBy over and over again you know our deep you had to kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire\nSort of experience for a for the actors in for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it onset if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to a to give that sense than\nThan the audience is going to feel at the actors are gonna be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be real the shaking will be real even some of the terrible the real the knowledge that will be real and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight sell uh Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that\nLooks real answer that he's really experiencing all of the uh distillery in Haitian and just physical jostling of all of this yes\nYou know we didn't literally a spin Ryan in the capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to a Neal and Dave Scott you know uh [laughter] but we a ride and I both wanted to try to make this physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody throw lap and question [laughter] not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because he started to uh apparently started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to uh\nNight it was getting ... from where we had to take a we had to take a moment no it got us actually all very uh\nBut we a ride and I both wanted to try and make it as physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody throw up\nOur question [laughter] not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because he started to uh apparently he started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to uh\nLast night it was getting ... from where we had to take\nA we had to take a moment no it got us actually all very a a word for a second or his rise the type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much of himself as as you can\nDo I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you a rest and uh you know have you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to Ryan that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting ...\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is the noise I mean you're hearing alarms go off in hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quite at all inside the space caps on a recent lessons and\nSaid can you talk a little bit about that sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about\n[noise] yeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was put in space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of ... you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space I'm In juxtaposition with ah just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know this is an hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of ah making its way up there so something\nYeah well I mean I think one of the great opportunities was put in space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of you know soul sucking void you know that that that is a space I'm In juxtaposition with or just the crazy\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a sort of you know this is a hyper speed kind of be me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of are making its way up there so something like a\nLike the spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we want it to kind of a try to hit and an emotional reality for that are in the sense that we sort of would augment the sounds you would actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually remind audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks\nA little groans and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire just whenever possible remind them that this is\nThis is a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something that are just delivered from the future you know their piece together by rabbits by wire and often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight massive puts together\nA press state meant about the deaths of the men on the flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\nMhm um and so you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space hoping that land on the moon but if they don't that's I guess they download masses preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release eulogy um didn't get that out\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight massive puts together\nA press state meant about the death of the men on a flight because they're planning for possible catastrophe\n[laughter] um and so you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space hoping that land on the moon but if they don't just in case they download masses preparing you know basically a eulogy a press release eulogy um did get that actually happened\nYeah yeah I mean you can find the uh ... you know you can search it on line in a van of moon disaster um and ah what sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy a and so the sheet of paper you see a you see a a\nYear and Heinz who plays ... movie holding is is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh uh the actual sort of format in and paper um [noise] uh that you can uh again that you can find on line and and the wording is is word for word um and it's a really I mean it's it's a\n... actually really love that that speech because uh you know think thank God it was never given\nBut in a way to capture relates in such a poetic beautiful way the willingness to sacrifice and and this kind of a reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a ... a a line in the in the speech that says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the at the moon will know that there's some part of another world that is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what the intent of that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time this incredible kind of hope and this sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what these sort of a risky costly brave ventures a could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI was wondering if the astronaut Neil is Neal\nIn the speech says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the at the moon

[noise] you\nKnow I I um I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues was just how close to death they\nAre live their lives and and seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots are astronaut you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations that they sometimes have to have a any sort of service for country often involves you know at least that risk and it's it's something I think it's helpful to to remind people

Nike\nOr the controversy about the flag material in the movie you know I think those are\nPretty much exclusively among the people who hadn't seen the film and I have to say I understand very much the emotions that something like that or get aroused I think are obviously the moon landing was an American achievement\nAnd an incredible one and the flag on the moon was a very important part of that

which is why we we show it we show it several times so the flags standing there on the moon on the lunar surface in terms of actually uh you know mapping out each of the mission and mapping out you know and and showing\nThe you know the the physical sticking of the brought into the into the lunar soil and propping up at the flag a we made a choice entirely anesthetic choice not a political one to a focus on\nNeal's private moments on the moon or during that time you know the the movies about the ten years leading up to the lunar landing um and so we only spend about eight minutes on the lunar surface we really wanted to\nSpend that time to look at things that people didn't see things people didn't know about so what he himself would be seeing as he first kind of emerged from the lunar module before the cameras even gone down and then after his famous line or his an sort of plan to walk off to the little west greater during which point he is spent time alone\nAway from any cameras a and so that's a part of the moon walk that no one really knows about it I didn't know about before researching this\nUm those are the things I think they were really important to us in terms of uh in terms of process of what we show 'em but certainly showcase the not only the American flag on the lunar surface but just the ways in which this program was a product of America and paid for entirely by American taxpayers\nThat was something that was incredibly important for us to show that I think we we we do show and do justice to throughout the movie\nAnd I guess just gave me inches

is music he plays on the way to the moon things where you're referring yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah\nSo it's it's a less Baxter piece called lunar Rhapsody yup and what I find really interesting about this is that you know this comes under the category about of of John where that's been described as exotic uh but you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way\nWith all due respect to Neil Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices Sarah I'm In is incredibly like Flora and piano\nIf it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty ... and having that kind of transcendent experience of like being on your plate of the moon and plane was like really corny\nCorny version of what you know lunar might be it just strikes me is so it's just so strange I I as somebody in the I Know how interested you are and music and how like you play music so\nHow did it strike you know I was a ... you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know those are learned about when learning about Neal\nKind of transcendent experience of like being afraid of the moon and praying is like really corny [laughter]\nTwenty

you\n[noise] I was a I was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I serve learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually in the rye and himself it stumbled on a you mentioned in Japan since book\nThat Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a so Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous tracts of music that uh that Neal and some of the other astronaut to play during the course of their mission they played a piece from by divorce shock and\nAwe and whatnot but this you know strange little less Baxter tune or something that was actually a the ... or listen to together that they loved together when they were young and in love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nA in space and as I learned someone who was you know or who was a having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kind of unexpectedly play this track that really no one\nListening no end in mission control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real connection to except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know time space and and the sort of cause most to uh\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nI think well why don't we hear a a little bit of that\nFamily level in a marriage level um would kinda unexpectedly play distracted really no one\nListening no wonder Mitch control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real can actually do except for the the person he loved except for Janet I'm that actually found really moving and felt like another way of of time or the ... you know tiny space and and the sort of cause most to\nYou know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nI think why don't we hear a little bit of the record that we've been talking about which is called RNA Rhapsody\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nOh [laughter] oh [laughter]\nOh [noise]\nBoth\n\nEdwin Rhapsody which Neil Armstrong played on the way to the moon in ... in the new movie first man which has directed by ... lots of direct did la la land and ready to and also wrote

directed by ... who also directed a lot of land and where did too and also wrote and directed whiplash [noise]\nUm and I found remarkable was that you were working on land before first man but a lot of land wasn't turnaround sound like you hadn't really began shooting it right\nYeah I I first met Ryan or to talk to him about first men are and ah so you know that that was you know a few years until ... kind of languishing you know life is sort of you know just\nA a you know [noise]\nI've been trying to get a made for a while and with no success and and uh through a lot of stops and starts and and uh and during that time I uh I made whiplash and then during the day after that I was given this book a first manned by Jim Hansen and\nFell in love with it and and and went to Ryan and said hey would you be interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and ah by the way I also hear ah you're into musicals you as a musical script and I said oh yeah you like musicals city I Love Gene Kelly and\nWe talked about Gene Kelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first man but a lot of land\nBut as soon as well and was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into this\nSo I'm finally what brings you the most joined the most anxiety and doing a movie like
