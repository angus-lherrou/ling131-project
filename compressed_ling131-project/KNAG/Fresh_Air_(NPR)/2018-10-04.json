not a secret fantasy and it to me I didn't know about it I thought that we had decided together as a couple that we would definitely draw the line at\nScience fiction\nBecause there's all this preparation and instead he lifts up a hyper during the ... needle and an interim muscular needle and you know spears it into her but and then you got wide and you see wow that is not a sex scene that

it's not the moment that you dream of when you dream of having\nA baby and what that is going to be light it can lead to that moment but that process is just so so different\nYeah it it's pretty alienating in the body department I mean and then of course it's even taken to a new level when\nInstead of having your husband insemination you're you're lying in a you know kind of a stir ups and having a you know endocrinologist between your legs are with some strange catheter device saying okay let's get pregnant\nAnd uh it's not your husband it's the doctor [laughter] that's pretty strange too\nAnd you shoot those scenes in Mr ups [laughter] and the fertility clinic from the point of view Catherine Hong figures yelling doctor you're seeing her legs on the steps through her point of view of yeah it was going to use so many women have had so many times [laughter]\n[noise] um yeah and um I actually have um the doctors don't come off very well on your movie was that your parents I

doctors don't come off very well on your movie was that your parents\nI actually had great doctors it's a very bizarre job um I loved NSO hair who played Dr ... and uh\nHe it's a weird job because there is a salesmanship I mean first of all you know it's not an indictment about fertility industry um because the fertility industry makes amazing things occur but it's not an easy fix\nWell that leads to another scene that I Want to play the Catherine hon character is a writer\nAnd she has a new book that's about to be published a novel that's called women's studies\nAnd her her agent closer and said have you seen the cover and Catherine hunts has no no no and so she runs through her email to open the PDF of the cover and she looks at the cover and she's horrified because the covers of

you were trying to conceive in your early forties and wondering if it was just too late if you'd waited too long did you play both parts here in\nYour own mind yeah\nMean blaming myself yeah do you like the body and Catherine my and catch on in your head having that argument with yourself yeah I think I was I think that that's fair a kind of um\nYou know how did I end up here I mean her blaming second wave feminism for her I mean it's such a\nDemented thing to do but then I sort of understand what she said I remember my producer was trying to follow the the logic of the writing and she was like well I'm she's sort of leaps to that and I said you know it's buttering this isn't like a rational this is a kind of\nUpsets buttering person then this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why she feels betrayed by some\nWe're blaming second wave feminism for her I mean it's such a\nDemand and thing to do but then I

this isn't like a rational this is a kind of\nUpsets buttering person then this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why she feels betrayed by some notion of like a\nYou know be independent and you don't need you know pursue your career and it's not like Lori time ever said that exactly you know she really can't be blamed but I Know what conference character is talking about some sense of\nLike a licensed to pursue your\nOr to pursue the other part of your life not the wife part not the mother part but the other part and then suddenly\nShe feels like the rug has been pulled out from under her and this thing that she um delayed is now possibly not available to her I think for a lot of women\nWhen you're trying to reach a certain point in your career there never seems to be a great time to take time away from that\nTo you know get pregnant and and raise a child and take some time either a little are a lot away

sort of maybe as you were getting at in our last interview ten years ago my own weird family also played an impact which isn't really\nYou know that marriage and having babies didn't look so good from my childhood point of view [laughter] so maybe I wasn't rushing to do it anyway um but back combined with the\nYou know pursuing a career and being a writer I was a performance artist and then I I was an actor I was performance artist I was making theater I was you know then I decided to go to graduate school and film and trying to make films and it was all very consuming and not\nConducive to

that Temer Jenkins also wrote and directed the savages and slums of Beverly Hills\nSo we've spoken after each of your future in films and in two thousand seven when we spoke after the savages and you were forty and talked about how you are trying at that point to have children with your husband\nYou said so you know I guess I'll be an older parent because you are already forty your father was Twenty years older than your mother so he was an older parent and he raised you part of the time as a single parent not a very good one maybe but [laughter]\nUm what was the experience for you like having a parent who is older than most of the other parents\nYeah I mean he was also and he was only ... here yeah yeah he was from another time it was like having a Damon Runyon character is your dad I mean he was um he was old fashioned anyway\nUm and it but it was really different I remember people saying oh I remember being with my dad at a grocery store in Los Angeles and I think somebody said something about\nNot a very good one maybe but [laughter] um what was the experience for you like having a parent who is older than most of the other parents\n[noise] yeah I mean he was also and he was many many other hair here yeah yeah he was from another time it was like having a Damon Runyon character is your dad I mean he was um he was old fashioned anyway [noise]\nUm and it but it was really different I remember people saying oh I remember being with my dad at a grocery store in Los Angeles and I think somebody said something about\nOh you know well you know oh honey you know well you just give that to your grandfather and I started to correct the person uh I think it was you know a cashier and I said oh that's not my grandfather and I feel like my dad sort of shut me up\nLike he didn't want to get into it and I and and then it was sort of ... I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but and maybe the idea of having a mom that was Twenty years younger than your dad I don't know but yeah he he also felt like he was out of time he was sort of\nYou know he was a bubble and we lived in Los Angeles and everybody seems sort of modern and in the seventies and she just seem like I said like smoking is Paul malls and his sued and and had a compulsive gambler he was really like a character so you make three feature\nFilms two of them are about being a daughter and her new one is about becoming a parent uh your first one slums in Beverly Hills is when\nYou live with your father and he moved you and your brother to Beverly Hills\nAnd he was broke basically [laughter] but he wanted you to go to good schools so we'd find like the cheapest places he could possibly find in Beverly Hills for you to stay so you'd have a good ZIP Code and can go to a good school there and it was just like a weird weird existence\nGambling he was really like a character so you made three feature films two of them are about being a daughter um new one is about becoming a parent uh your first one slums in Beverly Hills is when\nYou live with your father and he moved you and your brother to Beverly Hills\nAnd he was broke basically [laughter] but he wanted you to go to good schools so we'd find like the cheapest places he could possibly find in Beverly Hills for you to stay so you'd have a good ZIP Code and can go to a good school there\nAnd it was just like a weird weird existence your second film the savages is based on what happened when your father had dementia and you had to move him to um a a a nursing home\nAnd he was not as usual he was not appreciative of what you were doing [noise]\nI'm In part because of the dementia in part because he's just not\nYou didn't depict him as the appreciative type\n'em right and there was a strange men need between you know between the actor and a father and also between the character and her brother so unusual coming together and of course the new movie is about you know a woman in her forties trying to to have a child through whatever means necessary [noise]\nUm and so no matter which way you kind of turn the camera what you've been looking at in your movies is um\nIs family and you know\nThe complications of having one and wanting to have one\nAnd I'm Wondering if you think having such a complicated childhood yourself because of living several years with your father and not being well Parenthood during that time has made you so focused you know on the idea of family\nYeah I mean I I must be I mean it's hard to know exactly what\nDoing it in your movies is um\nIs family and you know\nThe complications of having one wanting to have one\nAnd I'm Wondering if you think having such a complicated childhood yourself because of living several years with your father and not being well parenting during that time has made you so focused you know on the idea of family\nYeah I mean I I must be I mean it's hard to know exactly what goes in to it but I guess I Am I mean our family was super fractured and there were multiple said you know there's actually four children and\nUm we you know didn't live with her mother we live with our father than we live with their mother a little bit then we moved to Cambridge and my big brother became my legal guardian he adopted us I mean we were pretty we we did a lot [laughter] what what is your mother today Iran Germans [noise]\nUm when I was a teenager or at that point I had I was living with my dad for ten years and my dad\n... we moved away from living with my dad plus he was old PS but anyway and I had a little brother and we moved to live with my mother and that was very unstable and kind of crazy and then my oldest brother who's ten years older than me um had been\nA living abroad and he returned he was living in ... he was living in Bali actually and he returned\nTo uh go to graduate school at Harvard\nAnd he came to see me and I was living with my mother and he was concerned about me I was a teenager I was pretty depressed and\nI was working in a dry cleaners in Philadelphia and going to lower ... high school for a second and then um he was worried about me and he said that he was moving to Cambridge to to go to school and\nDid I Want to\nA living abroad and he returned he was living in ... he was living in Bali actually and he returned to uh go to graduate school at Harvard\nAnd he came to see me and I was living with my mother and he was concerned about me I was a teenager I was pretty depressed and\nI was working in a dry cleaners in Philadelphia and going to lower ... high school for a second and then um he was worried about me and he said that he was moving to Cambridge to to go to school and did I Want to\nMove with him\nHe's sort of save my life how did he said it's because I he paid attention well then I didn't move in with him and then my little brother we all lived in Harvard housing and they um student housing at Harvard and he sort of ... became our parent\nHe paid attention to us like we had very narcissistic parents we know we were just no one was paying attention and suddenly and it was very chaotic and\nCrazy and then suddenly we were living with like little monks we're so happy my brother [laughter]\nYou know getting a PHD and uh and me and my little brother lived and the Harvard housing and we lived on food stamps and student loans and my brother took out and [noise] um\n... you know we our lives improved and we became much better students [laughter]\nSchool\nWhich was ironic because of course everybody from the outside thought oh they don't have any parents must be wild over there but we were the opposite we were really like monks we were so happy not to be in a chaotic place that we we weren't like the wild family we were like the we were trying to find sanity\nWhat's an example of a chaotic moment in your childhood\nUm well you know who's this\nYou know we our lives improved and we became much better students [laughter] school\nWhich was ironic because of course everybody from the outside thought oh they don't have any parents must be wild over there but we were the opposite we were really like monks we were so happy not to be in a chaotic place that we we weren't like the wild family we were like the we were trying to find sanity\nWhat's an example of a chaotic moment in your childhood\n... well you know ... the stuff in California would be my father's relationship to every landlord that we had in LA because we there was always some drama with the rent and having hostile relationships with our landlords\nBecause my dad although we didn't know why you know the landlords were nice to the kids but I mean now I'm like oh they didn't like it was because dad was probably late with the rent\n'em so there was that there was a kind of general dysfunction in any building we ever lived in\nUm um and then when we lived with my mother she was I guess she was on her second marriage and her second husband was an alcoholic and it was very chaotic and there was never food and the refrigerator but there were things like cocktail food like olives and\nThings that you would put in a ... marriage you know cherries and ah maybe some parmesan cheese but there was never food food it was very cocktail oriented and then\nUm yeah there's a couple of examples so when you were living with your brother\nWas it was at Harvard and on on the ...\nYeah it was Harvard housing it was not on the campus but I'm close to it yeah it was in between Harvard Square and Porter Square off mass of mhm so what is it helpful to you to be in an atmosphere where there were a lot of college students [noise] yeah it was really\nYou would put in a ... marriage you know cherries and ah maybe some parmesan cheese but there was never food food it was very cocktail oriented and then um yeah those are a couple of examples so when you were living with your brother\nWas it was at Harvard and on on a ... yeah it was Harvard housing it was not on the campus but I'm close to it yeah I was in between Harvard Square importer square off
