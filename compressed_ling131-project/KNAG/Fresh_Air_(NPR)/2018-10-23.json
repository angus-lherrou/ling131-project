Trump's first press secretary Sean Spicer on Saturday Night live\nNow she takes a different direction in the new film can you ever forgive me which is based on the two thousand eight memoir of the

is based\nOn a memoir by Lee Israel who when she started being unable to sell new book ideas decided to forge letters by literary greats and make money selling those four letters as if they were originals\nSo something else you've very famous for as your role and bridesmaids and the most famous or maybe I should say infamous scene when\nThe right on the bridesmaids get food poisoning as they're trying I like really expensive fancy bridal dressing yet um you know bridesmaids dresses and they get like super sick and of course there aren't enough bathrooms so you end up sitting on the bathroom sink in your expensive gallon that you're trying on and the whole scene is very intentionally gross\nAnd I'm Wondering how you felt about that scene because part of a of the scene part of a point of the movie is that you know women can do gross had comedy just as men can and it really wasn't the point of it oh okay ... none of us felt that way about it and that that ...\nJust as men can and it really wasn't the point of it oh okay ...\nNone of us felt that way about it and that that scene was actually kind of in jak did into the film\nKind of late into the process and I think at first everyone bristled data and thought we don't want to do this grossing for the sake of gross it really isn't any of our humor we didn't find it funny\nBecause it did feel like for lack of a better way to determine ... more like a guy move and do you remember us talking about it and they said what are the only thing that appeals to me does seem funny and kind of [noise]\nThe the type of thing you watching go thank God it's not me I said if we just play the ... the horror and the embarrassment of it\nBecause it's weird things like this do happen and I said if it's less about gross for gross and more about oh my God I Can't make the euro swallow me up\nAnd if you play I think how maybe more women would do it in terms of it was horrifying not we weren't going like you have to look at this we were all desperately even though we were friends with in the movie saying like\nOh my God look somewhere else like we couldn't escape it and then I and then I think we started to reconcile with the facts of like it could be funny for the sheer sake of being like what is the worst thing that could happen to you and\nAnd how do you kind of like just like a horror movie get through it\nIs interesting to hear you say that 'cause the second half of my question [laughter]\nWith him to be OK some women found that liberating that you know women can do grows out humor like men but then there's the question do women want to establish their quality and by doing gross out scenes and so here's one was really interesting 'cause you're saying that's that's not really what was intended but it wasn't intended and it was\nReally talked about because I'm I'm I'm not one for bathroom humor or stuff like that\nWhat was intended but it wasn't\nIntended and it was really talked about because I'm I'm I'm not one for\nBathroom humor or stuff like that I think sometimes there's that horrible and wonderful feeling you get where you're so embarrassed for the character mhm and I think that's showing the character kind of going through such a vulnerable humiliation that\nWe can all laugh at it because in some way we've all done it we've all fall and said the wrong thing had some\nShaming thing done and I think I think at least for myself that that was the connection to that's a real human experience even if that particular action hasn't happened to most people\n[noise] Melissa McCarthy something else that you're famous for is I'm insults\n[laughter] insulting window [laughter]\nNot real life or maybe in real life I wouldn't know no I don't know what are you not [laughter] but the most famous\nExample of that is and this is forty and there's there's a feud between your teenage kid and ... and Leslie man's teenage kid and this becomes a feud between the three parents and they're all called in to meet with the principal\nAnd the the the other ... couple have threatened you so you're all just kind of going at each other in the office so yes let's hear that scene it starts with you\nThese people are liars he said that my son was an animal and then if I didn't keep him on a leash that he would hit him with his car\nDid you say that that's that's ridiculous\nWho talks like that you do hit him said or you know what I said was that we need to keep an extra ... kids because with all the technological advances having to learn to use them responsibly no no when he well he said to me was he called me and what language\nCatherine language and show me how to relate what these do not balls\nKnow what he what he said to me was he called me one language Catherine\nLanguage I mean I can relate to what they do not balls said to me unless I say it\nCan you please not talk like that Catherine music manager her thing next door so\nMusic man maybe if I looked more like this fake couple let's say through a bank commercial that's what you look like like your bank commercial couple none of this talk if productive I Would like to read and my legs and kick you out in a jar with my ... bone\nYou just really scaring me this is what happens in your corner rat\nYou corner me I Will chew through you know she was from you\n[laughter] okay and then as the credits roll at the end of this is forty uh it's just you kind of ... improving insults in that scene in it and just go on and on with more over the top insult is that's something that you're famous for outside like in the real world being able to [noise] to do really funny and solve\nNo I Know I Do not go round insulting people um I Hope ever [noise] um\nI don't know if it's a cathartic part of the work that you know you do something so kind of like yourself and maybe it's why I don't do it in life I get it all out on on screen but [noise]\nYeah one of the first time I watched that back I kept saying I didn't say that I never say that and the first time a sitting with with that said we're watching you say it you said all of it and I\nI didn't remember saying most of it which made me feel slightly crazy and I was just trying to say ... anything that came off the very top of my head I hadn't planned anything\nSo um you know maybe it was just that so much kind of free free word association that I didn't kind of logging into my memory how'd you improv insults before yes I've had uh\nWord association that I didn't kind of law get into my memory how'd you improv insults before yes I've had a\n... and only have played a lot of kind of very assertive um characters that you know I think in the heat\nOr especially part of part of the\nPart of the characters DNA was just it you literally say anything just to kind of ... ... people down and I think kind of try to stand her in her own authority so it was a big part of that character you know you're very impressive detective and that very aggressive detective um\nThere is a fun to it I mean I Would never want to do it in real life but it's part of the fun of getting to act you do\nThese things that you would never do your Boulder you're sure you know you're you're just ripping insults at someone and uh there is if there is a fun to it because hopefully you know you you don't do it in your real life [noise]\nAnd I guess as Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new film can you ever forgive me we'll talk about growing up on a farm after a break and John Powers will review a new BBC series that drops on Netflix Wednesday

Melissa McCarthy she stars in the new movie can you ever forgive me when we left off we were talking about her early stand up comedy career\nSo um did you perform at gay clubs I did duplex is one of my favorite places to perform I just loved it also because [noise]\nYou know the heckling wasn't there which is really why I stopped stand up I didn't do it that long I think people think I did it longer and probably better than I did I didn't um\n[noise] when you went into a regular comedy clubs something that I really didn't like was there's this element there was\nAnd probably better than I did I didn't um\n[noise] when you went into a regular comedy club something that I really didn't like was there's this element there was always one\nSo he's the one guy that always really did literally seem like do you just go clubs club like are you actually the same guy [laughter] and it was the always the kind of you know I Wonder if you weren't even fully up on stage yet and there's always somebody like your top off [laughter]\nAnd you're just like what like what does that ever worked for you has any woman ever been like oh my God I wasn't thinking of it but you know what I'm going to take my top off [laughter] like I just every time or something in that vein and especially when you're starting out you have you know your four and a half minutes\nAnd the only way to stop someone from yelling and heckling is you have to really shut them down like truly shutter now not just like OK buddy you know got it they're going to keep doing it and they're going to keep doing it\nSo in order to actually make them be quiet you would have to kind of truly humiliate them not in a joking way because strangely just trying to indicate to them that like I don't want to do this I don't want to have this back and forth with you and I'm not going to take my shirt off because I'm not insane [noise]\nSo I felt I had to get so mean and so cutting and actually really make the person so embarrassed that they stopped talking what was one of your favorite insults that you gave on stage in response to Hitler God\nI don't think it was my favorite I think the more at work the more I hated it um\nIt usually would dissolve into some kind of thing about are you here with your girlfriend and then oh you're not how was your mom's basement you know I've always kind of go down that road like this so surprising like can I get a show of hands for women who who is in crazy about this\nBut it always kind of go down that road like this so surprising like can I get a show of hands from women who who is in crazy about this guy has to take his shirt off and like and I would do votes in the talking about like wow you have no takers and it would dissolve from there but afterwards and then\nOn a selfish note I also thought out of four minutes I've taken two minutes doing something that makes me feel bad about myself no you feel terrible 'cause you'd watch the person finally\nBe truly embarrassed enough to stop talking and then you're looking at this guy who even though I think she's a jerk and should have been quiet to begin with now he actually feels like to his core and then I'm supposed to somehow transitioned to like\nSo I was walking down Madison Avenue and you're just like how what first of all there is no real good transition there and then now I've got two minutes left\nAt the Oscars if you go over time they're going to play you a stage is there somebody there was a comedy club owner like tapping his watch and sang times that I saw the light oh ... ever present uh not to ever\nNot be heated light that the first time I I went up I didn't I didn't know what the white men flashes climbs up yes and when that light flashes it is literally like finish your sentence and get off stage you have ten seconds before you know\nThe stage explodes it is really a big deal it's a big deal to the owner or manager who's ever running the night it's also a huge deal to the other comics ... ... you don't get to suddenly do eight minutes if we all get four that's like a oh my God it's a really big deal yeah\nCertainly another Naples time you're stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they are going to get less but the\nFirst time I did stand up right there was people actually last\nI have all the time you're stealing it yeah you're taking it out or they are going to get less but the first time I did stand up right there was people actually laughed at something\nMuch to my surprise and as they laughed he flashed the light from the booth\nAnd I thought it was kind of a non verbal um applause from the manager kind of room shot like yeah I thought I thought he was saying like at a girl you know keep it up because I I didn't know why he was it was the first time that I'd seen him flash of light and it happened right on the laugh\nSo then he continued flashing it which I thought he meant keep it up it's going great so I kept talking in the late kept flashing and I thought boy this guy really likes me he's really encouraging me and then I\nI got up to finally did get off the stage I Can't remember if he came out and was like his arms were flailing or finally I was just like I don't know is to say I've been up here for like nine minutes\nAnd uh I came off and I just remembered him screaming at me up in a hallway asking me what's the matter with me have dumped can I be and I was like I thought you were encouraging me which I think blew his mind that I was like so naive I was yeah that I truly didn't know\n[noise] so you know one of the women who has taken on like producing and and writing films and has been an attempt to make sure that you can act immaterial that means something to you that you care about and give yourself good rules because\nYeah I think it's often hard for women to get good roles [noise]\nI think it is and I think you know I don't think a day goes by where I don't realize how lucky I Am and I never minded how much extra work I always thought I Want to be a part of making\nThe I Am and I've never mind it how much extra work I always thought I Want to be a part of making these three dimensional flawed you know often challenging but to me really real women I just thought so many things I read ... kind of\nI don't even know what in the in the breakdown you would describe them as pleasant I was like I don't know how to play pleasant like ... who who cares there's nothing to sink your teeth into it's like the perfect\nClothes and they look really nice and they have a nice relationship and their houses I was just thought oh my God like who who wants to watch that I don't I didn't want to play it\nAlso thought all the people I Love and like are\nFilled with quirks and eccentricity use and isn't that why we always love or even just like people take we're we're a bundle of all these different weirdness is\nAnd so often I I've I felt that everything I read for female character was really blend in and often a bummer just kind of everyone's having fun and then in would come the woman to go like\nCarl [laughter] ... you know\nI thought oh my God how many times can I just randomly walk into a room and say the guy's name I'm like why doesn't she ever walk in and go like what's going on this is fun [laughter] why she always a bummer I just ... I didn't know how to play it I felt like I don't have the skill set to play this because I don't know why she's doing it\n[noise] I'm Wondering if you feel that you've been affected by the me too movement which you know I mean like Harvey Weinstein fell several actors their careers or at least temporarily ended because they were outed for assaulting Oregon Ratzinger Munnell behavior yet to two women so like a\nAs somebody who is both you know as an actor a writer a producer\nOregon Ratzinger Munnell behavior yet to two women so like a as somebody who is both you know as an actor a writer a producer has the kind of change and climate been meaningful\nFor you can you feel the difference do you feel that women are being more empowered in Hollywood now\nEvery little in ... I Will take every centimeter forward it will take I think the more we talk about it and the fact that it is becoming less acceptable\nYou know I think I think the treatment of of women just can't be dismissed you can't treat half the population\nSo poorly and have it be like me you know boys there has to be repercussions and it's happening in all fields which is what I think is so important about me too it's it's branching out to every one it's all women that need help that need money for representation it's saying that we're all in it together and\nI think the more we we linked up and in ... strength and numbers\nIt can't be for the worse\nWhen Melissa McCarthy I Want to thank you so much for coming on our show I've greatly enjoyed it I Love you and your new role and can you ever forgive me and let's continue the conversation some other time\n[laughter] I Would love to this has been a just a dream I Love the show so I think so much for having me on\nMelissa McCarthy stars and the new film can you ever forgive me as a writer turned literary forge or\nAfter a break John Powers will review a new BBC series about a police bodyguard assigned to protect a woman politician who may be a terrorist target it drops on Netflix\nIt's talk as fresh air today a conversation with Ari Berman author of give us the ballot will talk about the twenty four states that are implemented new restrictions disproportionately affecting minorities\nAnd also tell us about the seven states where efforts are being made to expand voting rights voting rights and voting restrictions today on fresh air at one on cayenne a news talk and again tonight it's six on all the stations of Arizona Public radio\n[noise] this is classical ... eighty eight point seven Flagstaff K N A Ninety point seven show\nGay too low Seventy ex Kingman K. two to eight ... a piece and gay two seven three am cottonwood K. to eight seven hey I've earned income Joe hey do nine one AL Prescott K.
