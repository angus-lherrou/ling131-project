but with the me too movement it's spread beyond campuses\nWhat do the Kavanaugh hearings and confirmation tell you about how far that new understanding has spread\nI guess what I'm asking you is this if if the Republican senators and the Judiciary Committee had gone to college campuses what'd you think some of the things are they would have been told about ... what did you take into consideration before voting\nThings that they might not have thought of in part by us the Republicans on judiciary were men a lot of them are older men if you know their college days were very different in terms of

in the three years you were talking to people on college campuses\nThis is fresh air let's get back to my interview with Vanessa ... is author of the new book blurred lines sex power and consent on campus\nSo let's talk about the definition of sexual assault and how that is maybe changing what what was the kind of common understanding of the definition of sexual assault in the three years you were talking to people on college campuses\nThere was a huge shift in the definition of sexual assault from like two thousand and fourteen to Seventeen while I was there and I watched as it happened um many students said to me that they weren't sure if groping\nCounted as sexual assault maybe it had to be penetration 'em\nBy the end of the three years that idea was completely blown up the water 'em and I even had students say to me\nYou know sexual assault is maybe even the way you speak to people the way you abreast on people in speech and make them feel like justice or like dirty like a sexual object I mean they were thinking through this idea how far can we actually take this [noise]\nSo um it is there are no commonly held understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is now\nI don't think that there's a national understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is I think that um people who are in line at about this issue I understand that it doesn't have to include penetration um but I think that\nPart of why good part of the country is in line with Trump on this issue\nSo um it is there are no commonly held understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is now\nI don't think that there's a national understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is I think that um people who are in line and about this issue I understand that it doesn't have to include penetration um but\nI think that part of why good part of the country is in line with Trump on this issue is that we don't have a national definition [noise]\nSo um you also say that the definition of consent is being redefined and the slogan needs to be no means no but now at the yes means yes what's the difference between no means no and yes means yes\nWell there's a huge difference something like asked means yes is okay until you get some sort of yes you don't really have permission to touch somebody now\nA yes you know in the college definition could be verbal or it could be um they like to call it acts unmistakable in their meaning which I suppose means I'm mon are grown are pulling off clothes etcetera\nAnd from looking at this and researching it I didn't agree with this at the outset but I came convinced that this is a\nReally good standard for young people and perhaps for older people as well certainly anybody who's\nIn a workplace you might have a crush on somebody else you know you got to ask a question 'cause you could be misinterpreting signals people do that all the time so why\nWere you resistant to this yes means yes standard\nI'm looking at this in researching it I didn't agree with this at the outset but I came convinced that this is a really good standard for young people and perhaps for older people as well certainly anybody who's\nIn a workplace who might have a crush on somebody else you know you got to ask a question 'cause you could be misinterpreting signals people do that all the time so why\nWere you resistant to this yes means yes standard and why did you change your mind\nWell I'm an adult you know I'm In my forties and I know that that's not the way sex usually happens means sex is something that ... broken that's kind of energy between people and more exciting in some ways when it's like that\nYou know we see a lot of young people who are having sex with people that they met on dating apps they barely know these people home that's part of the\n... part of the charge but and I I'm not so doctrinaire that I think that you should have to say yes to each escalating base or sexual act which is the way a lot of people think of yes means yes but I Do think that a question is not that big a deal\nI'm In Gen x we had the question you know should I get a condom which was always\nKind of a a question about protection but it was really a permission question um they really have to be an extra question\n... you read that the strongest argument for affirmative consent for yes means yes is that it frees girls from the cage of socialized politeness when he me\nWell one of the complexities of sexual assault is that\nI'm In Gen x we had the question you know should I get a condo which was always kind of a a question about protection but it was really a permission question I'm there really has to be an extra question\n... you read that the strongest argument for affirmative consent for yes means yes is that it frees girls from the cage of socialized politeness when do you mean\nWell one of the complexities of sexual assault is that girls don't always saying no um they certainly don't say it that way no get away from me I'm pushing you away right they say well maybe another time\nUh I don't think I Want to do this tonight until band up\nGiving up um you know some of the most interesting work that's being done now in terms of trying to fix this problem is about\nGirls understanding the signals from people who might in Trenton them harm and removing themselves from the room before anything actually happens because people understand once they're in the room it's really hard to get out\nWell you know the thing about yes means yes there's a lot of people say oh that's so awkward to kind of have these like\nRules like almost like a questionnaire like I authorized huge too like you know take off my shirt or whatever um but it's equally awkward I think for the woman to be in a place where the man is making all these advances\nAnd you have to say no no no stop no I really mean stop no okay I'll leave no it just put the responsibility on her and it makes it like really awkward\nAnd it's not a shared awkwardness it's like one person having the full burden of the awkwardness exactly so this is a little ... okay\nHave these like rules like almost like a questionnaire like I authorized huge too like you know take off my shirt or whatever um but it's equally awkward I think for the woman to be in a place where the man is making all these advances\nAnd you have to say no no no stop no

awkwardness\nExactly so this is a little dorky okay but it definitely changes things I mean I went to a dance party like to go out and dance and I\nRecently you know guys try to come up and downs with you and you try to get away and this guy came up and he was about to put his arm around me and then he said is it okay if I put my arm around here and I said no\n[laughter] I mean why his arm around me and he said oh yeah I get it cassette and I totally get it I understand I'm Glad I asked was that the first time that happens here\nThat was definitely for starting up for it to me I mean I ... yeah I I didn't think that that men intended me harm but I didn't want his arm around me I had no interest in him and Mary and I'm I was just there with my girlfriends having a good night and dancing

up when I spoke with the young women 'cause they completely believe that it's empowering but it's an issue that came up a lot for me because I found myself really torn between those two ideas is

from second wave feminism item my knee jerk reaction is like you guys were calling the self object vacation isn't that just a\nA ruse isn't that just somewhere justifying on this kind of\nWay that you're you're presenting yourself but after speaking to so many of these students I truly change my mind about that because I realized like this is how they grew up you know these kids that I interviewed in college just graduating now you know Brittany spears was like\nIt they were they were just tiny when Brittany spears without the culture has been so saturated with sex the entire time that they've been growing up they've been growing up around pornography around fashion that is much much ... than anything that I grew up with so\nThey don't have the same ideas about oh if I dress
