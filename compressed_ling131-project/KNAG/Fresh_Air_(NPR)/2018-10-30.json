I had had said that um he believes the Jews were committing genocide against his people ... genocide is what happened to the Jews in Eastern Europe during the Holocaust do white nationalist believed the Jews are committing genocide\nDoesn't allow for it uh he's he's one of the most popular people on gap Richard Spencer the white national spends a lot of time there have there is a very high representation of white nationalist racist\nPat popular people on gap Richard Spencer the white nationalist spends a lot of time there have there is a very high representation of white nationalist racist ideas on gab and I think the danger of a place like gab um and also the danger of of other social media network is that\nIt allows for people who already have some of these ideas to sort of cultivate their own reality and\nThat was when he went on gab he saw the messages of only the people that he followed which is essentially one wrong news feed of confirmation bias and that those are the messages that he was getting he was reading again and again about the care caravan about the invaders about the threat to America and\nSo then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and watch my people get slaughtered and that's because that's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the\nWhite nationalist site storm front to the shooting at synagogue I'm In ... is the site that we'll be talking about in the interview were about to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founders son\nSo she'll ... what are you reading on storm front now\nThere's some really vile I'm sort of celebration of what happened uh there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero I'm a racial warrior uh and and hold him up in those ways I Would say that the largest reaction on storm fronts um\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh you know several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on storm front over over the last decade and and the reaction is mostly that\nWell this probably isn't quite the way to go about it that he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the people who are really to\nHe went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself\nBut our our global with and are Jews who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect but every now and then somebody is going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so you have you spoken with either done or Darren black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular um you know and and I think that he's\nHeartbroken at and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens he feels in small ways Gulf War and he wanders um\nYou know how much of the re messaging that he did it in terms of white nationalism plays into\nYou know incidents like this I'm Derek was central to creating the phrase white genocide and to to popular I think the movement to then have somebody go into a synagogue and murder eleven people and leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself\nSpread again and again on the radio um for years and you're young wife is a I think it's it's haunting\nYou like Sasha low is the author of the book rising out of hatred about Derek lack a former white nationalist whose father Don black founded the Internet's largest white nationalist site storm from\nWhen the book was published in September I spoke with Derrick black and ... will hear that interview after a short break this is ...\n...\nFor gay and are you from ... lovely warning will just\nRunning for gay and comes from ...

families and individuals vary marks and Chevrolet Cadillac real hometown value it's six twenty three pressure continues\n\nThis is fresh air the social media posts and statements made by Robert powers who shot and killed eleven congregants at a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday echo the views of the white nationalist movement\nWe're going to hear an excerpt from the interview I recorded in September about that movement with Derrick black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we known sing those views when he was twenty two he helped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers\nTheir ex father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm front\nDerek Black as the subject of the book rising out of hatred by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli sass low who we heard from earlier in the show\nI interview with black also included fast though the first question was addressed to dark black so you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than white national\nNot nationalism kind of turned it down to you it's like it's not that we are better than but we're all better off being separated by by race\nIs like a ... term white nationalism in so that was his thing\nHe didn't invent it but he was for it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he founded storm front called it a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction\nThat really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he found that storm front and called it a white nationalist community and he saw the distinction between white nationalism in white supremacy as being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that that was a not\nAbout superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody and that that's the that was what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's it's totally irrational I how exactly do you think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nFor a second I've always wanted to know\nThe early people who re branded white supremacy to white nationalism whether they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable whether they really believed that there was a difference between the white supremacy and white nationalism\nThey really did believe they were not\nDoing bad things to other people that the uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and it may be unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better\nUm the the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and it made it much more difficult to speak about race when their job was just to\nGive people a space to say racist ideas in a more explicit proud a confidante way\nIn central is everybody is basically all white people are basically racist they're just afraid to express it to let's give them a language in a safe space\nInception was everybody is basically all white people are basically racist they're just afraid to express it to let's give them a language in a safe space\nSo they they don't like the word racist I think that's a made up insult toward the lay claim to word um\nRacial is racial out over the years if you look at the language in terms of how\nMany people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist to white power\nTo white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that's complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy\nIs that white nationalism I think effectively identifies a movement of people who are actively\nPursuing in and cause of separating or\nYou know races into into different homeland and white supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is\nSo if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguish the movement in the same way because much of much of the country was founded on things that are white supremacist and many of our structures\nAre based on white supremacy so that's the distinction distinction sometimes in the language that I think is still effective and useful for us as we talk about it\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black a former young leader of the white nationalist movement who has since renounced the use and Washington Post reporter Eliza ... who wrote a book about black called rising out of hatred we'll hear more after a break and Terry

the victims and who they are exactly in the end of this was a long process but um immigration was just going to out number white people in other countries and that that was a threat to all the normal why people who are listening to the radio show or posting and the comments section\nAnd that quite unlike what they were being told they were the aggressors that they were the people who are making society worse\nGetting back to being attacked it's not like all the immigrants are going to take our jobs are they going to speak a foreign language we're not going to understand at an American culture you know wouldn't be quote unquote pure you're talking about like genocide like they are going to kill all of us we will no longer exists\nI'm Talking about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme than it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kids in the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had\nBecause society was trying to undermine their opportunities and to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against at every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that the entire ideology and point to the ideology is built on a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on what you mean that you want to separate people have different race\nOn a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on what you mean you want to separate people have different races into different places like ... percent ... percent white is okay what percent native is okay what ... percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that and it raises a nebulous thing that that that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining\nThere was a really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never public\nUh and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this issue how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to are we going to do this or that and one of those was how do we go into define who's white because only a white person could be a member of storm front but there's no biological definition of white\nAnd so that was very clear there's no way to save the what's the twenty three and me a definition even if that had been around at the time\nAnd there's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white in and were something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to ... who is white was that you had a\nGenerally be considered visually white by most people in America and you personally had to to find yourself as a white person and if you did that then then you're white and that was the only way that they could come to after thousands opposed to define what is a white person even mean\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick black

have been home schooled so you were pretty isolated from any beliefs outside of your family is racist views\nUm but then you went to college and from the way he describes it in the book was a pretty liberal college in Florida that were Jewish people there you initially tried to hide your identity and then figured you might as well [noise]\nLet people know a before you were ousted by somebody else you placed a magazine [laughter] you place to publication with an article by you and the gym so that people would find it and realize oh God that's Derek Black\nSo after you kind of out of yourself and after having befriended people who would you know Jewish and gay and who were very upset when I found out who you really are um you had Jewish friends who reached out to you\nEven had a girlfriend who ... who didn't initially no was Jewish um what what are some of the things that Jewish friends said to you\nThat made sense to you that you hadn't been exposed to before and you thought maybe there's some legitimacy here\nBut I think it's very interesting that I'm Matthew Stephenson and Moshe Asher with the people who invited me to Matthew about dinners took the strategy that I think was very very smart of ...\nAre not talking to me about it ah I went to those dinners for two years and the white nationalism never came up well every this other thing that we were possibly interested and did a and I think the Matthew said that the reason for that or was that it\nHave been a not as effective at allowing me to see him and dinners as people that when my family is talking about something anti Semitic that we're not talking about something after we're talking about him or talk about his life in this\nAs as people that when my family is talking about something anti Semitic that we're not talking about something after we're talking about him or die but his life and this is very human and he wanted to demonstrate that and even if nothing else came from it it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about when we were thinking about Jewish people\nAnd effective like actually actually meeting Jewish people in having Jewish friends did you see you know\nJewish people in general as being human in a way that you hadn't before\nYeah I think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that\nThe Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism was a little bit loose and nuts and unnecessary\nUh that didn't undermined the firm believer in racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups that are already believe that that oh of course Jewish people or white or so it didn't undermine all of white nationalism but it I think it was actually pretty early where\nEither this is this is crazy we need to stop attacking Jewish people back off\nIn addition to being the story of Dexter information I mean I think the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on this campus who invested themselves in trying to affect\nYou know profound change and they did that and a lot of different ways I mean there was\nA civil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school and sort of cast staring out and made it clear to him how how awful and how he'd for and how hurtful this ideology was and it was also students like Allison eventually his girlfriend who ah\nWho won one is trust built in a relationship but also armored herself with the facts and sort of like\nPoint by point went through in and uh and showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and and then there were also students like Matthew in most Shea\nAnd uh and showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and and then there were also students like Matthew and most Shea\nWho in a remarkable act invited Derek over a week after week after week not to build a case against him but to build their relationship hoping that\nJust by spending more and more time with them he would be able to begin seeing pass the stereotypes to the people into the humanity and and hoping that a relationship in of itself could be transformative\nAnd I think it's important to note that that did not happen quickly and ended they knew the full horror of a lot of the beliefs of this ideology and the things that Derrick had said Matthew in ... in between these dinners would sometimes go back through Derek old messages on the storm front site\nAnd they would see the horrible things that he said about Jews and and those kind of case yeah\nJews warm their way into control over our society Jews must go all Jews Moscow and you're in the white nationalist ideology in like the awful pyramid and beliefs Jews are at the top as enemy number one and because I think white nationalist believe\nThe Jews have propagated a scheme of multiculturalism and are\nAre are sort of the number one enemy of what white
