David Barstow congratulations on this extraordinary piece of reporting and welcome to fresh air it's such a pleasure to have you here give us a sense of Fred from Donald Trump's father's real estate empire when it was at its peak\nFor Trump was a remarkable builder and in New York's the strategy was ... who who build and sold his first home for huge huge\nA couple of builder and in New York's history he was the guy who had built and sold his first home before he reached the age of twenty by the time he was in his mid thirties he was building hundreds of\nHomes a year by the time he was in his mid forties he was really one of the biggest developers actually in the country and what he specialized in\nWas building middle class housing um his homes which he built in his apartment buildings which he built and\nAlmost entirely in Brooklyn and queens we're kind of these no frills\nHuman rights into this um sort of settlement of 'em in this case it kind of mythology of a man who had at least in his telling of his story the famous line that he's always said is that you started with a million dollar loan from his father\nHad to pay back with interest and then he parlay that million dollar loan into ten billion dollar empire that remained\nFor the most part the dominant narrative that she sold certainly you know to make themselves a celebrity and to gain a power and ultimately it's what he campaigned on very heavily\nTo win win the presidency and so this story really die sex that narrative and I think more than anything else offers readers now based on the actual facts um and based on actual documents an entirely new financial narrative the forty for president\nWell let me reintroduce you here if you're just joining us my guess is Suzanne ... and David ... of the New York times who wrote a remarkable investigative piece on our President Trump's inherited money from his father the loans you got from his father the tax evasion schemes the family had\nAnd that was published a couple of weeks ago you can find it on line we're going to talk more about how Donald Trump engagements\nAspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father after we take a short break this is fresh air\n\n... comes from the citizens fleet elections commission providing unbiased voter information out to register election dates and deadlines who's on the ballot and where to vote vote

resources\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest or New York times reporter says and crack and David Barstow two of the three writers who reported just a couple of weeks ago on how a Donald Trump engaged in suspects hack schemes as he reaped riches\nFrom his father and deconstruct the whole Donald Trump myth about how is the self\nMade millionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money Fred Trump Donald's father funneled to him and his other siblings and how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes\nMaking Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax games we talked about I'm Fred Trump made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that you got a million dollar loan from his father and help parlay that antennas\nInto his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws\nAh we were able to document in real dollars sixty million dollars in loans no one million I'm In today's dollars of quits two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars and direct welfare we saw\nTransferred to do what we what we also saw this important also is the images um these were loans that were never repaired even who would take her out [noise]\nUm we were looking at one particular your was like every\nLoans that were never repaid him and he would take out [noise]\nUm we were looking at one particular year was like every month\nHe's going back to that and he's barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks and then a million dollars it was just like a monthly run to to Fred Trump to get more money and we saw especially that the flow of loans increase\nAs Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream that went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then off being off to the races [noise]\nThese were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that was on loan from his father\nYeah he is the money for\nMany of his adventures he had Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support that it was used to support his ventures in Atlantic City\nAnd elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars in debt and this is the time he not only the banks hundreds of millions of dollars\nUm he was in debt to his father was going to get his father is very crucial times\nFor more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and end up in debt in a lot of instances instead of making a fortune ...\nAlso see that when he fell you know when he would fall down the safety net was there that Fred Trump safety net was there to catch them there's one spooked just\nIt also see that when his so you know when he would fall down ... was there for Trump's safety net was there to catch them\nOne spooked just almost unbelievable moment in the store and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this was a time\nIn the you know the backend of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of his company has their either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos that they're facing a debt payment\nAnd Fred Trump has a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casino chips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money ... million dollars worth of it was three and a half million dollars worth of casino trips\nAnd at this period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see\nAnd Donald Trump at this period has a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's will centrally and do well and it was caught a soldier that will it's taken to Fred Trump's house in December of Nineteen Ninety\nAnd Fred Trump immediately sees this caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire and potentially put at risk\nAnd Fred Trump immediately says no he freaks out and he makes a call to his daughter who is a federal judge in a lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months is drafted that removes Donald was the sole executor fried Trump's will inputs Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new well is dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life\nAfter all his father has done for him that he makes this move it's incredibly dramatic move and scarring to the family what he did\nAfter all his father has done for him but he makes this move to incredibly dramatic move and scoring to the family what he did so what you're saying I think is that at the end of ... life were toward the end of ... life\nDonald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump bailing himself out and Fred Trump Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had helped with so much money for so many years\nWhat we know for sure is that Fred Trump perceived to this is an attempt by his um to gain complete control over his state and potentially to use\nThe umpire for Trump doggedly patiently built over many decades to use that as far as I'm potentially as collateral to help bail Donald Trump out of his own financial difficulties\nAnd I guess or New York times reporters David Barstow and Suzanne ... after a break we'll talk about another scheme used to transfer of wealth from Fred

R. S.\nBut um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely got away with that so it's true that the IRS actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe describe in the story and in fact the IRS ours did push back some and especially on the lower valuations they've placed on buildings and made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning if ... million more bucks\nOn that return but the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got\nAn agency that is pretty over matched\nOverworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families who hire the most expensive legal on accounting helping who engage\nIn these very sophisticated maneuvers to avoid or evade taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an odd or they're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more meanwhile they're walking\n... is perfectly when the moment when he was just taken possession of twenty five percent of this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way not a word of that made its way into the book the art of a comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice and the song money money money money\nThat happen in two thousand and four\nI'm right as the sale had gone through the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Trump and yet when you watch that opening scene\nIt's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane is there that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene that Fred Trump built and paid for [noise] I'm Wondering\nHow you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the Mets have how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making abilities\nAnd so many people still believe the mess and Donald Trump is still putting forward in that it's interesting when I think about that I think\nYou have to sort of I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stock\nAnd I think that we've ... I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first step in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think that the power of the story is\nYou know I think the how careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents hop\nI think the whole careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents up I think it's really hard to refute the story um it's harder for you because it's absolutely true in the documents are there and in a lot of them are the source documents of the Trump family themselves\nUm but I think it will take time for this to sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um but I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot
