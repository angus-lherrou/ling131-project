the media I'm Brooke Gladstone over the past decade Elizabeth Warren has become a progressive I Congress\nPerhaps the most powerful like the voice among the progressive right now I Love a little bit more than me and my friends I Love her to be anything left to be a female those Boston\nBut the senator has struggled with the personal issues since she first ran for office in two thousand twelve\nThis war and I want to start with questions about your Native American heritage near the knowledge that you listen to yourself as a minority in a faculty or directory in Nineteen eighty six you continue to list yourself or in those directory so Nineteen Ninety five [noise]\nDo you consider yourself a minority and if not I have to answer this question many many times and it starts with the fact that from the day I was born until the day my mother died she told me about who I Am who we are from my brothers are like family\nJust picking up a box personal family lore small set of data points and yeah the ones on which ones opponents most notably President Trump announced she set\nBecause their votes where I was an Indian that she was Native American\nIn July he escalated\nI won't give me a million dollars for your favorite charity paid for by trouble\nIf you take the test of the shows you earn it here\nThis week Warren responded by way of a five and a half minutes pre campaign video in it she speaks with Carlos Bustamante a Stanford genetics professor who examine to DNA\nThe hunger genome we did five five segments of Native American ancestry with very high confidence taxes yeah that's what we have a Native American ancestry\nDid five five segment of the Native American ancestry with very high confidence that is what we have a Native American ancestry and you're\nThe response was probably not what Warren had anticipated she came out and thought she scored at first and showed us the media\nAnd it's sort of the men and got old Trump pay off the million dollar bet at all of a sudden algae is at war with the Cherokee Nation saying that her use of the DNA test is inappropriate and quote undermining tribal interests\nFrom both the right and left appropriate accusations that she's not native enough that she is reinforcing biological essential Islam that she's falling for a Trump trap before the midterms\nThat she's trying to claim native identity without ever defending native issues that she allowed a university to use her to bolster its diversity bond sides\nA political miscalculation but also a stumble into controversies that extends far beyond politics\nThere is a running joke in Indian country where people say oh yeah some other person told me that they have a Cherokee great grandmother a Cherokee princess and their lineage and so when we're out in the world and we meet people and they say oh you're native oh my great grandmother was Cherokee our first response was to try not to roll our eyes\nKim told there is a professor of NATO studies at the University of Alberta and author of Native American DNA tribal belonging and the false promise of genetics science\nStory for us as a much longer time line that I think many Americans understand\nElizabeth Warren's appropriation of native identity despite her disclaimer is I don't mean to sound cliche but everything that's taken from indigenous people will be an actual land and resources or be it you know an image that can be marketed and used for a football team or taking\nFrom indigenous people will be at actual land and resources or be it you know an image that can be marketed and used for a football team or taking claims to ancestry and making those part of the identity that one is a spouse into the world\nOur understandings of kinship and family and tribe or not governed so strongly by the idea of having distance unnamed ancestry\nWe have a much stronger sense of what it is to be Native American that is governed by our family relationships by lived social relations that matters to us\nWe now in the fifties Watson and Crick discovered the double helix structure of DNA and ever since talk of blood is lineage and fate have given way to conversations about mitochondrial DNA and all the rest\nAt the same time there are old metaphors that persist you can still be related either by blood or by marriage so talk about how the contrast between scientific jargon and traditional blood talk\nPlays out in native culture\nI caution people against equating blood with genes these are pretty different ideas when you weren't looking at tribal citizenship rules even if they talk about something like blood quantum\nThese are fractions on paper that point to very particular ancestors the dog's allotment acts at the turn of the twentieth century distributed hundred and sixty acre parcels of land to heads of households and of course only men and subtler ideas a family at the time to be has household\nThey would get another eighty acres if they had a wife women become economically tied to men that's not how it was in many indigenous communities women were not economically tied to men and then the man gets another forty acres for each child but\nThat's not how it was in many indigenous communities women were not economically tied to men and then the man gets another forty acres for each child but in order to manage those land allotments\nYou had to have a register of Indian swelled tribes and first nations and other indigenous communities didn't necessarily have lists with names of their people in their can these are fluid kinship groups right\nBut now we live with the legacy of those registers and that's how tribal enrollment has governed ... what we care about is proving that you are descended from somebody on the base role that was constructed during that time\nAnd by the base role you're talking about families that were listed at the end of the Eighteen hundreds yeah\nWhen you see on the back of my traveling Roman card that I'm One thirty second this one's sixteen this one quarter of this tribe those are all particular ancestors that they're pointing to that one quarter shy and Rob a whole blood quote unquote is my grandfather Randy tall there\nIt's not as if blood the physiological substance is being examines\nWe're really talking about symbolic blood and were pointing to named people and so this is the problem with Elizabeth Warren taking a DNA test that's pointing to some distance probable unnamed ancestor that nobody knows who they were affiliated with or who they were\nFor us it's who is your mom who's your grandmother who's your great grandfather who your cousins or your aunt and uncle's\nYou say your daughter doesn't get to be a citizen of the tribe because of these blood quantum rules\nSo in my tribe the ... they will enroll you if you are descended from somebody on the base role but in my tribe in addition they have a requirement that you must meet a total one quarter Indian blood quotient\nThey will accept the blood there's always scare quotes around that word from multiple tribes so even though I don't have one quarter quote unquote Dakota blood I have ...\nScared quotes around that word from multiple tribes so even though I don't have one quarter quote unquote Dakota blood I have shining a rabbit hole blood\nThat's where you begin to see the racial inflection I think\nSo my daughter if you were to calculate all her ancestors because I'm supposedly thirteenth thirty seconds Native American my daughter would be one half of that because her father is non native\nNow if my tried decides to move to a one eighth total Indian blood rule instead of one quarter my daughter and her a couple of cousins who can't get enrolled will be able to get enrolled and we debate this every year we've got you know debates and conversations on our reservation should we go from one quarter total Indian blood down to money\nAnd I think eventually we will you do see tribes across the country moving away from a blood quantum standards more towards ... percent rules to try to make our rules more inclusive but that's up to us to debate we don't need the rest of Americans telling us what we should do and how colonize we are by race everybody's colonized by race\nTribal governments and tribal communities are doing the best we can to try to tweak those rules to include our traditional notions of kinship but within a structure that has been deeply shaped by colonial power word severe power imbalance with the U.S federal government\nDo you think that Warren was basically played by Trump drawn into this because it doesn't seem that she got any kind of educational or financial advantage by her association with the Cherokee and it may have been part of her family lore\nDo you think that she just got played into a discussion of race and and\nBlood then the women then\nIs something ... she got some set in the New Yorker you know all the things that Trump loves to talk about in order to defend herself against his ... you know I don't think he has the\nTrump loves to talk about in order to defend herself against his ... you know\nI don't think he has the intellectual ability to play somebody who is as intelligent as Elizabeth Warren ... I mean really I [laughter] she has for her entire life like many people in Oklahoma in the south and in the east of the U.S [noise]\nLived with this myth of an Indian and her family tree and I and that's really important to those people she's probably really invested in defending her family story I've seen people break down crying when they find out that they don't have a Native American ancestry this is a cherished idea for a lot of non Native Americans\nYou know certainly for African Americans even though there's very much a historical and understandable desire to be able to lay claim to identities that are not just about race has cast mhm it's also the case that particularly at a place like the United states and twenty Eighteen that's deeply polarized\nRace has cast mhm it's

accidental brothers\nAccidental brothers follows the life history as of two sets identical male twins who were born a day apart in Columbia South America in Nineteen eighty eight one pair of identical twins was born in Bogota the capital city and the other born in a small remote town a hundred and fifty miles to the north\nBut one of the little babies up in the north needed immediate care at a good hospital so his grandmother brought him down to Bogota at the same hospital as he got the twins were born\nAnd somehow an amazing twist of fate got exchange was one of the other twins so the wrong baby was brought back to the small town a week later\nSo they were essentially raised as two sets of fraternal twins when in fact they were unrelated and they didn't know this until they were twenty five when the brothers up north moved to Bogota\nAnd somebody confused a twin one pair for twin and the other\nI went to a Bogota two times to study them and they are wonderful guys\nAnd there were similarities in many personality traits between the real identical twins despite\nTimes to study them and they are wonderful guys\nAnd there were similarities in many personality traits between the real identical twins despite their separate rearing but you could see that the effects of the different environments had a role\nThe twins in the city had gone to high schools and colleges the twins up north didn't go past fifth grade but I have to say that living with them you could see the similarities really popping out and the medical life history is amazing\nThe one twin born in the city and raised in the city was basically symptom free as was his identical twin brother raised in the north\nThe other twin who was raised in the city who was not born there had a long list of medical complaints as did his twin brother up in the north so even the different environments and the different access to medical care did not make a difference in their medical histories and physical health
