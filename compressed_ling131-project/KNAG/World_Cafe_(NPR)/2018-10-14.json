and that's why we depend on money as a quick and easy medium of exchange\nOnly problem is says now or no matter what we learned in school the anthropological record offers no evidence up simple barter anywhere in history\nYeah so the ... story is a an origin story for money that you know has a very long history Aristotle actually use that story to try to understand himself where money came from and what the kind of good and bad functions of money could be\nAnd in the nineteenth century as economics is becoming professionalized economists picked up this barter origin story for money and kind of set forth into the world\nUm the thing is that we just don't see that situation ever happening if you go to a New Guinea village and the highlands and see people exchanging shells for pigs\nYou might think a ha there it is this is for instance you attack a plated string decorated with calories and other precious objects which was used by the Danny people in New guinea to determine and to pay for the exact price of a pig\nThat's barter but but what you're really seeing as part of a much more complex series of relationships that people are engaged in that generally have to do with\nSome pretty serious social concerns concerns over birth over marriage over death over the continuation of a lineage or a tribe where the pig in this case isn't just any old pig being exchanged and I always think

mechanism the way that the barter story assumes so how did this border mythology or become so nearly universal why is this news to me\nVery often origin stories are serving contemporary interests so if we want to believe that the market as it exists today and that money as it exists today is natural normal inevitable\nThan something like the barter origin story helps us justify it continued existence helps disabled look you know this is a rational response to the problem with a double coincidence of wants which is what economists call that problem when you know I've got fish and you've got apples and you don't want my fish and I don't want your Apple's so it's great to justify current conditions\nBut when you start kind of cracking it open and starts at appealing back the layers and
