that are three point seven billion years old a separate group of researchers found that hard to believe they think that the rocks might just be old rocks NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports\nWhen and how life emerged on our planet is a mystery but some fossils are incredibly old\nThe most widely agreed upon evidence for the earliest fossil life on earth is found out in Western Australia\nJoel Horowitz is a geo chemist at Stony Brook University in New York he says the rocks in Australia date back about three and a half billion years they contain cone shaped structures created by masses of microbes growing up from the floor\nWe're actually seeing sort of the total community that has basically been turned into a bunch of minerals\nBack in twenty sixteen researchers revealed they'd found similar mineral structures in Greenland\nThat was a real shocker because the rocks in Greenland where even more ancient two hundred million years older and they'd been more cooked and tortured by geologic processes that should have destroyed any signs of life\nYou know my thought was boy someone should fall ... [laughter]\nHer wits and some colleagues did follow up and now in the journal nature they say there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures aren't really shaped like the cones\nSay there is no way these things are fossils a deeper look into the rock shows that the structures aren't really shaped like the cones that microbes would make\nInstead what they look like our swath of a better word that colonel ... ... they're stretched out ridges that extend deeply into the rock\nThe scientists also studied the rocks chemical composition Abigail all would is an astrobiologist\nAt NASA's Jet propulsion lab she says they use the proto type of an instrument that NASA is planning to send to Mars to look for signs of ancient life she says the chemistry of the Greenland rocks did not support the idea that microbes had left their mark\nIt pointing and it's all good morning from the perspective of\nWhat it means a lot on non\nShe says if life could have gained a foothold so soon after the earth formed that would have suggested that life can arise and take hold quickly anywhere it's given half a chance\nNow the researchers who made the original claim about the Greenland rocks are vigorously disputing this new analysis they still maintain that they have found the world's oldest fossils so far relatively few scientists have studied these rocks\nThat means it's a pretty sure bet that this won't be the last word Nell Greenfieldboyce NPR News [noise]\nAnd you're listening to NPR News I feel sure are still so Sean hundreds of thousands of veterans who've received less than honorable discharges have been denied VA benefits\nWere a hundred and Fifteen billion while and fierce arrests are hard enough and reporting from Brussels thank you sir oh You're welcome Mary Louise\nSo what would a hard Brexit means for British and European economies\nGeorge Parker has written about this she's a political editor of the Financial Times joining us from Brussels where he is following the negotiations will come back to the program color if there were to be no deal at all what immediate changes would take effect on march twenty ninth when the u._k. leaves the\nWell they could be quite severe it all depends on what kind of no deal we actually end up with if it was a totally chaotic an acrimonious no deal with\nEverybody ended up throwing places each other in person left to you in very but don't you and indeed than you could see some very serious impacts of the border so you would have a ... you'd have checks on all goods coming in and also the u._k. which doesn't help for the moment that we could do to huge queues to the polls coming into person\nYou would have a immediately you'd have to check some old goods coming in and out to the u._k. which doesn't happen at the moment that will quickly to huge queues at the ports coming into person and very quickly the companies in person which rely on seamless flow of goods across the borders in Europe they would run out parts factories were closed down\nOn the bank of England is focused this could be actually a very detailed chicken damaging ... for the British economy which could last for months there's all sorts of contingency planning guy on the u._k. in case this happens talk of stockpiling of medicines\nThere's the fresh food wrote could run out very quickly there are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool it will be quite bad and the pursuit company will take a very big his\nSo you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves the lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been a some sort of stockpiling some certain types of medicines\nOnce you introduce border checks the place where there are no border checks for the moment you can have she's running for miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile cues things just wouldn't be coming through so so there are concerns that they will be shortages set in the in more distant parts from the poor so\nPretty serious sets us in our ears are being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasuries made an estimate of what was happening in the medium to miss Britain was to leave without a deal and that would basically once the initial shock of cost you would end up with just a lot more bureaucracy and red tape out the board is not without to business costs\nIt would make it ... percent or less attractive place to invest because of a you have less access to the European market to potential for terrorists as well so the u._k. treasuries estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about eight percent smaller than others\nPotential fatalities as well so the u._k. treasuries estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about eight percent smaller than otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big hit as akin to sort of an aircraft\nGradually losing height you wouldn't necessarily know to immediately but I have a time person will be a poor place and otherwise it would be\nSo if those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe if the u._k. leaves have had a deal\nWell for the rest of your this has always been something that you're a skeptic some person of clung to the idea that Europe wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because person as a major destination for European ... so they will be an effect on all manner of European produces whether it's um and they won produces in France cop she says in Germany\nAnd you name it they ... they will be effective because UK off to breaks it will become the biggest single export destination for all the all the European Union countries but the point is an asymmetric shock waltz it's true that some of the European countries would suffer as a result of new deal the biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from the deadline does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or this is sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\nI think it's more of a lot to be honest I I mean we all quite the Y. yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's another couple of months ago the differences between the two sides and not really as big as they are often presented a by the politicians\nThere was another potential problem which is that if the reason why the British prime minister doesn't deal in Brussels she then has to sell it to a very divided policy back in London and I think actually negotiating a deal inside the British Government could actually be the positive then negotiating a deal with our European partners so\nAnything could happen but I think my ... still despite all the negative noises around\nBecause actually be the pause it than negotiating a deal with our European partners so anything could happen but I think ... still despite all the negative noises around as a common sense will prevail on that will be a deal at the end of the day\nGeorge Parker is a political editor of the Financial Times thanks for joining us as always pleasure\n... ... ...\n...\n... you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nWhen most people make a mistake they say\nI'm Sorry but what should accompany do when it makes a mistake a recent study looked at the economics of apologies Stacey Vanek Smith host of the podcast the indicator from Planet Money spoke with Benjamin whoa he's an economics professor at Vassar about why saying sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nYou did this like really really interesting study as a way to study apologies\nThe study was partnered with Hoover so we look we focus on the Ninety five percent ... of lightness all the most extreme ... most late rides there's about a five percent chance that you never come back to her again\nAnd the question is how can we repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between ... and its broader we tested different kinds of apologies\nAnd we found the right kind of apology could basically increase revenues that one to two percent of the wrong kind of apology could decreased revenue so I went to two percent which we tested apologies in of all sort of commitments to do better or or not what we saw is that a commitment to do better in the future it's it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology\nAnd we found that basically two or three months later these commitments have you been in the future actually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to do but in the future and then the ... he didn't do better because then maybe maybe for some of them had another bad experience and I as a result the those people punished\nYou might commit to do about the future and then the ... he didn't do better cars than maybe maybe for some of them they had another bad experience and I as a result the those people punished but more than than the control group that got no apology at all did they ever have a good effect\nI'm not in our data so [laughter] I think they they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect or or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet still seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability\nI think part of it is that our brains sort of works on scripts interest X and so you know entering a relationship with a company we sort of like the same sort of scripts and risks triggering her brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company\nSo what were the what would the apologies that really worked for ... like what was the magic\nThe magic was money [laughter]\nYeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um\nThat we tested apologies with or without a coupon and we we which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones who sort of increased revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or with their certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out the best language but we found that there was no statistical difference between the different languages his money it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that actually might may not find a bit was a message to sort of committed to do more in the future\nDo you think this like carries over into personal relationships thing that I'm so sorry that I like whatever was late meeting for ten bucks [laughter]\nYou know she was a box of chocolates right or here's your editors and flowers flowers and candy and so it\nTakes on a whole new significance um does it hasn't changed the way like you apologize\nHere's your editors and flowers flowers and candy because I always take\nOn a whole new significance um does it hasn't changed the way like you apologize [laughter]\nPeople thought always wanted to ask you this question how do I was curious I think the main ways change with that because all my friends and my family and do that I study apologies than they are always ... I might be skeptical whenever I Apologize so after like go an extra mile to sort of sound like Ernest insincere remorseful because people are always like oh you're just doing that because of your paper\n[noise] no apologies for telling you that was professor Benjamin Hope speaking there with Planet Money's Stacey Vanek Smith [noise]\nSupport for Planet Money comes from the alliance for lifetime income a nonprofit composed of financial services organizations working to educate Americans about options for securing protected lifetime income in retirement\nAlliance for lifetime income dot org [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\n[laughter]\nThis is Katie you Arizona Public radio good afternoon at five forty eighth on Wednesday October seventeenth I'm Ryan ... thanks so much for tuning into all things considered this afternoon\nOn before ... comes from dawn to go to restaurants the Italian oh fine dining restaurant in Sedona Jeff leases on her scenes or dinner nightly from time we live jazz seven nights a week to week a restaurant the Italian of wind lifted menus available online\nSaddam in Duluth adopts huh [noise]\nThe creator of the net flicks comedy series so jak horsemen Raphael Bob Blacksburg bow jak as an animated comedy with the cast of humans and animals do jak as a horse was depressed alcoholic sexist former sitcom star the serious\nJack is an animated comedy with the cast of humans and animals do jak as a horse depressed alcoholics Texas former sitcom star the series satirizing\nHollywood and pop culture and the new season is set in the era of the me too movement China [noise]\nFor here is up in about ten minutes right here on ... public radio\n[noise]\n\nArizona Public radio in Flagstaff I meet ... showers lingered the seats\nFrom Arizona Public radio in Flagstaff our meter I'll just leave but when if you ... hours later this evening mainly\nAcross our northern Arizona and the four corners region otherwise ache Wyatt\nNight ahead it with a dense patchy ... odd for me once again maybe along ... into our Thursday morning sun will break through tomorrow little bit warmer for the region few showers for the four corners tomorrow fifty in Flagstaff at the eight page Prescott sixty\nShallow fifty eight and king in Seventy one\n[noise]\nComposer Philip Glass believes that good technique is the foundation of composition\nThe technique he uses and many of his works is called minimalist [noise]\n\nIt's not a word he prefers when describing his music but he says that he's used to it on the matter what you call it there's nothing quite like it [noise]\n\n\nYou'll hear why his minimal ism is so highly regarded later this hour I'm Garrett McQueen the violin concerto number one by Philip Glass and much more coming up on music through the night\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Jim hog the Washington Post has published a final Columbine ...

going on there if she if this turns over and they win the house Nancy Pelosi will be speaker of the house\nMcAdams insists he keep his independence in Washington\nWhen I see is if the Democrats do take back the house is because a lot of people like me who in their elections and these are people from party does not come first or the solutions comes first\nAs Democrats last election after election in recent years the main casualties were moderates like McAdams but many of the candidates and the swing districts the party is trying to flip this year don't fit in with Democrats national

acres in some cases that are fully tenant did and there were only a limitation is available parking\nSo they're losing one anchor store but they've got others American what would they do it to share space\nThey're likely to break it up and turn it into other specialty retail or add to their experiential opportunity in the form of added food offerings things of that sort okay and then there are B
