Portland, Oregon hey hey how's it going there good so why\nDon't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been what Twenty years since there last basketball she wouldn't\nYeah so they had it for a ... and it was very short list ...\nThe biggest hurdles for any new comer yeah um you know I I did a lot of research last year Nike hat about sixty percent of the league wearing their shoes lassie okay step in and combat that it's pretty tough to find okay [laughter] yeah they do have they do have a huge budget an allowance for corporate standpoint and they signed\nSixth of the top Fifteen draft picks this year along with an all star in the end to park his cousin so you know in terms of offers they've been extremely aggressive and that's that's a big part of how they're looking to make their imprint back\nBig and the gamble is this for a company like you said the markets already pretty saturated is this a long shot to get back into the basketball she business\nIt's incredibly aggressive um the big the big hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been\nNot as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have\nIt's really tough to say how these guys will pan out and there's so many cases of guys that were drafted high that\nYou know we're bus that didn't pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media if you've gotten a chance to check out Pomona hoops on Instagram they are unlike any other brand and it's kind of wild wild west and they'll post whatever and it's very on corporate life but I think people have taken to that meant made it kind of fun\nYou see the wild wild west is it more important in some ways how these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting and she made them what they do on the court\nThat's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the stats in terms of high school kids they're watching less and less of a full through our game and they're really kind of immersing more on what these guys are doing away from the game and and they're seeing snippets of highlights on Instagram and things like that but I looked it up the other day and out of the nine guys at Pomona signed\nThey have six and a half million combined followers on Instagram so that's a huge base as the brand of starting out you know I think the brand itself is only had a couple of hundred thousand followers and so\nThey're really lenient on their players counts and ethical big part of their strategy with their shoes that they don't want shoes that look just\nYeah that's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the stats in terms of high school kids they're watching less and less of a full through our game and

of the nine guys that pulled aside and\nThey have six and a half million followers on Instagram so that's why this huge base as the brand of starting out you know I think the brand itself has only had a couple of hundred thousand followers and so\nThey're really winning in on their players counts and ethical big part of their strategy with their view is that they don't want shoes that look just like a standard basketball shoe they're trying to create stuff that maybe has a little more lifestyle to it that guys can be showcasing in different ways on their own pages and so that's going to be a

Washington's archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl\nWorld has been under tremendous pressure to resign since a report this summer detailed the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of mishandling several cases of abuse while at the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that skating horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro birds state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from\nBishop cardinal Donald Wuerl world has been under tremendous pressure to resign since a report this summer detail the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses world was accused of mishandling several cases and abuse well at the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that scathing horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro\nBirds state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm going to ask you about your reaction to worlds resignation what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWhat cardinal Wuerl resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse I actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church\nI think what's missing here though is an acknowledgement by the Vatican\nOn the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop worlds role in it now I'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their preference but I I Do not think\nThat the people of Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up\nShould face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the\nPope I think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover of that\nThis cover up should face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop we're all played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for a changing the current statute of limitations you you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living every single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nBut with respect to completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the case becomes to prove witnesses pass away memories fade evidence grown stale does any of that concern you as a lawyer\nOf course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when the number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who were abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two\nTaste becomes to prove witnesses pass away memories fade evidence grown stale does any of that concern you as a lawyer\nOf course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when the number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who are abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two fifty two and yet the law here in Pennsylvania says that\nWe couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty and so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone to come forward\nWe shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nWhat your officers report laid bare is how a large institution in this instance the Catholic Church but there are so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse and to protect abusers\nDoes reviving the statute of limitations get it that we did actually increase the accountability internally at these institutions\nYou hit the nail on the head so much of this is about an institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution in the world constantly and consistently putting its own reputation above the needs of\nThe people they were there to serve in this case children I think there's a reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going to or how much we are willing to hold powerful institutions accountable\nAnd I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on with the me too movement and the Kavanaugh hearings and The Cosby trial is\nIs you're seeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and law enforcement plays a\nOld constantly and consistently putting its own reputation\nAbove the needs of the people they were there to serve in this case children I think there's a reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going to\nOr how much we are willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on with the me too movement the Kavanaugh hearings and The Cosby trial is\nIs you're seeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and law enforcement\nPlays a unique in critical role in that process that's what we're doing here in Pennsylvania\nJoshua Shapiro is Pennsylvania's

governors thank you so much for coming in today thank you for having me here also\nSo how usual is it for a president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nIt's been very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush the president and its minister ration often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy and maybe didn't call the fed crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve and for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known private lead to the chair and other members other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nOkay so up until now fed officials had been defending the fed from the president's attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fad Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes so does Evans have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these rate I\nIt's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing and a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself uh with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's uh\nOK so up until now fed officials happened defending the fed from the president's attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fad Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes still does have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these right I\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing and a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself\nWith the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to the air but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing\nDo you think then at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president and held sway the fed to slow down the rate hikes\nUh no I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident that it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis information\nUsing the institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be sending or\nThink is very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up his attacks and others drawing him and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation\nSo I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think it's important for the Federal Reserve the have the confidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it is a deliberate nonpartisan institution that's acting in their best\nAnd others drawing him and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political
