we're learning more this hour from the FBI about a number of suspicious packages that were address to a democratic political figures this week\nAnd then where do you say five devices were sinking identical bubble line manila envelopes each of them with the return address a former Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nBut those envelopes weren't all of this suspicious packages reported today for more on this we're joined by NPR justice correspondent Ryan Lucas Hey Ryan either\nOkay so take me through this the FBI says there were five potential explosive devices but they're also report more\nThat's right so the FBI says these envelopes were address to George Soros he's a billionaire big contributor to democratic causes a Hillary Clinton Brock Obama Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder and his former CIA director John Brennan\nOf the package that was intended for Britain was sent to CNN's New York office right or not clear why that was but\nYes there were other people who said they received ... suspicious packages today one of them was in New York governor Andrew Cuomo who is a Democrat his office later said however uh that the package didn't contain any sort of suspicious explosives\nAnother was California congresswoman Maxine Waters US Capitol police say that they intercepted a suspicious package that was addressed to her\nThey say it was removed and is being investigated by the FBI right now we don't know whether the FBI didn't mention her because her package\nA doesn't belong with the others or perhaps it would just was received too late in the clear at this point but\nThe FBI did say in a statement on Wednesday that uh it's possible that there are more suspicious packages out there or that it doesn't know about at this point\nI'm not clear at this point but the FBI did say in a statement on Wednesday that uh it's possible that there are more suspicious packages out there or that it doesn't know that at this point\nSo what do we know about the five packages that the FBI discussed in its announcement early\nWell law enforcement official described him as pipe bombs earlier today in the case of the ones at the CNN a package also is said to have contained to white powder now the FBI itself says that all of the explosive devices were mailed in these identical bubble wrap envelopes\nThe address is on the packages were computer printed the return address on all of them was as you mentioned for Wasserman Schultz although her last name was ... was misspelled each package had six U.S Postal service stamps although in the one photo of a package that was provided by the FBI doesn't appear as though they were post marked which could mean that\nIn that case or the individual or individuals ah put

been labeled tragically the suicide belt\nSuicide rates are high across rural America and then you pull on rural life conducted by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health more than half of those surveyed said they knew someone personally affected by suicide\nBut eight rural mountain west states are among the ten us states with the highest suicide rates NPR's Kirk Siegler visited one town Grand Junction Colorado which is trying to do something about it\nAt the confluence of the Gunnison and Colorado rivers Grand Junction sits in a bowl of valley ringed by tall mountains desert bases and red rock cliffs you can see how someone who is struggling could feel a little trapped here this is how Seventeen year old Victoria Mendoza describes it\nAnd we can't really fix it because it's nature but the surrounding mountains I feel like the people in our valley feel like there is only life in Grand junction\nMendoza has battled with depression runs in her family the first funeral she ever went to was a little girl was for an uncle who died by suicide\nThings got really hurt a couple of years ago when there was a rash of teen suicides seven over a school year one was a student Mendoza knew from being in band together at another high school student killed himself in the parking lot in front of a crowd\nHonestly physically kind of felt like there was like this cloud around our whole valley [noise] we were just kind of anticipating the next one and it got to a point where we were just like waiting for the next one\nBefore it became such a public crisis suicide was stigmatized in this valley that's long been a problem across the rural west it's that cowboy stereotype\nCrisis suicide was stigmatized in this valley that's long been a problem across the rural west it's that cowboy stereotype of self reliance that runs deep you know pick up a bear bootstraps mentality Kathy evil has worked in the school district for Thirty years most recently helping at risk kids\nI think that we unfortunately [noise] think of [noise] mental illness instead of mental health\nAnd it's a rural area and there aren't as many resources Grand Junction does have a small mental health hospital but it's the only one between Salt Lake city in Denver I think there's also\nThe issue of access to guns and I'm not ... I mean that's not a political statement one way or another way of guns in our home 'cause my boys hunt but I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes evil says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act the old way wasn't working\nVictoria Mendoza says at first kids were told not to talk about the suicides or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for Mendoza\nAnd it kind of just made a division between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nForward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior as one of dozens of pure mentors and the districts new sources of strength suicide prevention program\nOh she's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be in trouble\nOr these are not junior psychologists but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first and also that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help a lot of this came from the students\nThat first and also that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help a lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the two sides\nAlongside the mentors the school district also hired a suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers to bus drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year what are the warning signs and kids how to respond and talk about mental health\nAnd starting in the sixth grade all students have to have a similar training and lately they're starting even earlier in\nClassrooms with a mental health resiliency curriculum beginning in grade school [noise]\nAt orchard Mesa middle school eighth grader ... and the lunchroom taping note cards to a wall\n... all the kids in the school had to write positive messages about what a good friend [noise]\nOr how a friend who's helped them through tough times lily points up to her and the crowded wall\nSupporting than keeping the positive\nBecause I feel like even if they're down you can like help them be positive and just stuff like that and see what they're going through and they don't feel like giving up\nReally has brown hair and a ponytail she's wearing blue sources of strength cookie with the words hope help strength displayed in bold white letters she too is a peer mentor acting as a role model and talking openly about why it's important to be strong and help others\nShe says that's what her friends did for her\nI actually lost my uncle and my dad suicide\nShe says she started speaking out about her family's trauma at school because suicide shouldn't be taboo\nIt's tough to share but like I've shared it a lot easier and if it helps other people cope\nTrauma at school because suicide shouldn't be taboo\nIt's tough to share that like I've shared it a lot easier and if it helps people hope I don't mind sharing what's going on in Grand junction represents a broader shift in\nThinking in the public health world the ideas that you go way quote upstream and try to tackle the problem like suicide by focusing in its earliest roots in this case the mental health and wellbeing of every kid and for that matter the entire town\nIn the schools people on the front lines sound confident that this was going to work though it could take years one person in the community who's watching all of this is ... she had two daughters and a high school here six years ago she lost her husband as suicide\nThe idea of of having 'em up here or someone who is supporting you who has been through that experience I think it's incredibly valuable because um you're traumatized you don't know which way to turn\n... husband grew up here he was captain of his high school football team valedictorian a pilot in the Gulf War later he was a dad competitive bike racer he was a community leader seems a pillar\nSuicide has no no boundaries I'm even in beautiful places with incredibly successful active healthy people\nSo says her town and others in the Colorado mountains have come a long way and even just talking about suicide since her husband's death\nOh gosh I guess it's a double edged sword I guess it's so common here that there are so many people in the community who are struck by it in one way or another\nSuicide is most common here among older men like schools husband or ... dad an uncle and this mirrors and national trend in Grand junction there are prevention programs aimed at this demographic like a project in gun shops\nBut really the book and focus of a lot of the resources is in the schools Genevieve Moore says the school districts news suicide priest\nShops are really the book and focus of a lot of the resources is in the schools Genevieve Morse is the school districts

listen to what he said\nThe powder in those particular ... did not present a biological for other analysis is only going however it is worth repeating that any device could be considered potentially dangerous and treated as such until proven otherwise\nYou know at this point law enforcement are being very tight lipped about details\nOf what they found out so far you know they're characterizing

things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Audie Cornish Megan Kelly and her NBC morning talk show may soon be off the air Kelly was hired away from Fox News and twenty Seventeen with much fanfare and a big paycheck\nHit her time at the network has seen some controversy including comments she made about black face just this week yesterday and emotional Kelly apologized\nShow I'm Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry now NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting her employment by NBC appears to be over David joins us from our studios in New York City hey there David ... so describe exactly what Kelly said that caused this latest controversy\nWell Tilly a obviously a host of the nine AM our ... she was having a chat a couple of days ago with a civil panelists about Halloween costumes and talks about how she is not PC and then started to talk about what it was to dress up as somebody of a different race here's what she had to say\nYou get in trouble if you are a white person who work on or a black person a facade of white flight\n[laughter] you get in trouble if you are a white person who we are black person and puts on white Halloween but that was okay as long as you address character\nAnd that of course at tapping into a rich vein of pain or in terms of the course of American history depiction of African Americans by whites\nHow did her fellow NBC colleagues react to all this\nPretty sharply or is it notable in two ways one which was the significant coverage that was given to the story a both by a on the NBC nightly news uh obviously it's anchored by a Lester Holt the only African American anchor among the big three broadcast to American networks\nI and also on the today show in the hour proceeding her own show a two for African American colleagues really way to end up first let's hear from our broker a he noted that she'd apologized colleagues but said she needed to do more\nShe does a bigger apology to folks and color around the country because this is a history going back to the Eighteen thirties minstrel shows to do to me and denigrate uh a race wasn't right\nAnd then also a quick Melvin perhaps the newest co hosted today show he waited as well\nThere was some criticism yesterday on line that this was political correctness run among um that's silly and it's missing juniors and it's it's it's just as ignorant and racist as the statement itself\nOr NBC News Germany Andy lack at a a meeting with staffers this week on the subject I refused to defend her as well this isn't the first time making Kelly is his criticism while at NBC um why do people think this was the last straw\nWell I think there are a couple of things going on up first off it kept in as well to her own history in terms of remarks on race or from her days as a Fox News host a much sharper edge parks and he's hosted she insisted that both Santa Claus and Jesus quite Christ were white ... back in a twenty Thirteen she said she regretted that last year when she was\nAnd he's hosted she insisted that both Santa Claus and Jesus quite Christ were white\n... back in twenty Thirteen she said she regretted that last year when she

movement including accusations of sexual harassment\nAgainst some of NBC's biggest stars not only Matt Lauer who was fired but the former ah NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw much blood figure who retain says that ties to the network what have you learned about what's next for her\nI Want to be very clear about this a source would direct knowledge of the matter says ah it's clear she won't be returning it seems impossible to imagine but these things aren't quite concrete yet you know Andrew lack has been a her biggest champion a despite the fact that she had a fairly a\nCool and conflicted reaction and and a welcome from a employees that NBC\nShe displaced a couple of a popular figures in that town hall\nAnd I ... at that nine AM our and her ratings didn't do a heck of a lot for it in a dish and she was paid an extraordinary amount of money or for a uh for the thing and she really took on a lot of fire as a figure who brought on ideological baggage who brought Fox News baggage and it turned out didn't bring a whole lot of success at the box office\nThat's NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik thank you you bet\nBegging Kelly's comments on black face or not the only reason she may be on the way out at NBC but they're definitely a big contributing factor they're also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now the subject seems to come up year after year

I've been an advocate\nThis conversation year after year would um we do every year uncouth which in fact we joke\nThat October is blackface Avon and now the advent Halloween is is Christmas it all companies on this one day of the year when all the races costuming comes out maybe these annual conversations should be less about whether blackface is bad but why so many of us have so much historical literacy about as bad as well\nWalk us through some of the history of this when did we first started saying blackface and America\nWe first start saying black face in the early Eighteen hundreds may become central to minstrel shows on which why people would dress up like black people are talking in this game with polish and with court\nAnd of course these missile shows depicted black people as lazy as animal is to play caricatures played the caricatures of course and that sits next to obviously this broad human disease shouldn't allow slavery to happen at the time um and so these caricatures linger and the American consciousness for a long time in fact by the twenty century algae Olsen\nIs the most popular entertainer in America and he's performing exclusively and black for [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nSo there's a whole history of you know read the paper trail the Native Americans and yellow face portrayals of Asian Americans think of Mickey Rooney ... character in breakfast at Tiffany's um but it's those mocking depictions of people of color that these Halloween controversy ... against\nUs and to be clear was black face always seen as offensive by the people who were being caricatured\nWhere the people who are caffeine caricatured were often not in a position to push back showing some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to see black people and missiles cord not wearing black with because that was so much of the visual language of the minstrel show ...\nTo track us back to this week in her apology Megan Kelly said she didn't know about this history\nTo track us back to this week in her apology Megan Kelly said she didn't know about this history\nWhat do you make of that [noise]\n[noise] I mean she can claim ignorance but employers often say ignorance without a defense\nNone of this history is particularly deeply hidden and Kelly when she was talking about this and this panel is all white and I went to the port in\nShe seemed to be primarily concerned with defending the innocence of people who may dress up in blackface and that happens all the time of these conversations about race in history and power they always become conversations about intent and not about so this broader context they always start in a store a vacuum\nDoes intent matter since you raise it more is this something we should just degree it's like the N word it's offensive and we're just not going to argue about it\nI'm Glad you bring up the N. word because we're a good example of the ways in which the context of things change depending on who it delivering something and who's receiving it so when these controversies tend to happen it's usually when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party\nDressed in blackface usually there's not a black person in attendance and no one at that party made bad an eyelash\nBut then a video from that party or picture from that party slips out into the broader world somebody posted on Facebook exactly and then that video has to contend with a different context with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different relationship to the consequences of that imagery\nAs well maybe these conversations\nWill be better served if we spent less time parsing out what's going on in people's souls and whether they're good people are not when they put on black face\nAnd more time thinking about why so many social circles continue to insulate people including apparently\nProminent talk show host from understanding this history and its consequences\nNPR's Gene Demby of our Code Switch team thank you\nThank you so much Mary Louise the next like silver [laughter]\nI Hope not [noise]\nI Hope not [noise] this is NPR News\nThere\nIs an oil boom in ... Texas it's one of the most competitive congressional districts in the country how politics are playing in the oil field\n... or President Trump has threatened to send the U.S military to close the border he's also threatened to cut us aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador for not stopping their citizens from leaving the U. S. currently since hundreds of millions of dollars every year to Central America\nShouldn't O'Neill is senior fellow for Latin America starts\nStopping their citizens from leaving the u._s. currently since hundreds of millions of dollars every year to Central America\nShouldn't O'Neill is senior fellow for Latin American studies at the council on Foreign Relations and shouldn't do Neal you argue that cutting aid to the region as Trump was threatening to do will result in more care events which of course was precisely the thing he says he wants to stop why what what's your argument\nSo actually the United states over the last couple of years has been sending seven hundred and fifty million dollars to primarily these three northern trying all nations\nThis goes into all sorts of dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs helping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods\nSo if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cuts foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want to leave yes\nSo if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternative is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S I mean I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at their radios right now wants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs in Central America violence prevention programs and Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why\nShould the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here\nKnow each country in the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador as their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or Oregon\nPeople to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day\nThat we need to be active around the world and these are places in our hemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize those places to make them safer and so we\nShould be looking here near to a home for places that do affect us day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking several hundred million dollars not billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is to the U.S has some responsibility for the problems in these countries and plenty of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back to central\nAmerica United States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not just this aid the United states was a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contras were there and we were big supporters of of those groups\nAnd then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now transnational in nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here in our prisons and in our communities and so those linkages are\nNot just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nations\nSo if you could wave a magic wand until the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would you tell them you\nKnow I Would tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to reduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity but I Would also ask him to hold these governments accountable in Central America make those governments\nComic opportunity but I Would also ask him to hold these governments accountable in Central America make those governments actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because it in the end it is the responsibility of the Central American governments to\nProtect their people ... of the

our balance turns out this ancient part of the brain may have been under estimated a new study suggests it also helps us manage everything from emotions to social interactions to planning NPR's Jon Hamilton has more\nCerebellum doesn't get much respect scientists often dismiss it as that part of the brain that lets you pass a roadside sobriety test\nIt helps you do things like walking a straight line or stand on one leg if you're sober but researchers at Washington University in St Louis thought there was more to the cerebellum so they used a special type of MRI to study the brain wiring of ten people and Dr Nico dose in boxes they found some surprising connections\nAbout twenty percent of the cerebellum is dedicated to motion that eighty percent is dedicated to higher order cognitive functions kind\n... about twenty percent of the cerebellum is dedicated to motion that eighty percent is dedicated to higher order cognitive functions\nWhat kind of cognitive functions Scott America post doc and doesn't bucks lab offers some examples\nAbstract thinking forward planning even holding something in memory producing the words that you're saying it's important for all of his day to day functions that you really take for granted and that seems effort less\n... says the cerebellum doesn't carry out these tasks directly just as it doesn't directly control movement instead he says it appears to monitor the brain areas that are doing the work can make them perform better\nSo we think that the cerebellum is acting as the brains ultimate quality control unit\nThat still speculation but doesn't bug says the findings published in the journal neuron adds to the evidence that this ancient part of the brain plays a critical role in modern life\nAlready thought that the cerebellum is cruel than most people thought but these results were re more exciting and clear then I could have ever dreamt\nDoesn't box says most researchers haven't paid much attention to the cerebellum perhaps because it's most obvious function involve something pretty mundane physical movement\nBut really it's much more about editing your thoughts and your internal life it's just much harder noticed that I think that's the way scientists to neurologist had been missing in front of the time\nAnd doesn't says the new study offers a good reason why alcohol affects a lot more than a person's balance when it impairs the cerebellum\nYou have an explanation for all the bad ideas people have when they're drunk they're lacking ... editing of your thoughts\nOne scientist who's not surprised by the new studies results is Jeremy Schmahmann a professor at Harvard Medical school he's been arguing for decades that the cerebellum is involved in both human behavior and disorders like schizophrenia Rahman says the cerebellum has changed dramatically since it appeared and fish and lizards hundreds of millions of years ago\nWhat's happened to all the time is that the cerebellum has expanded enormously and the parts of serve but I'm not talking to the parts of the brain upstairs\nIs that the cerebellum has expanded enormously and the parts of Syria but I'm not talking to the parts of the brain upstairs that on both in cognition means that say about them is involved in those process sees as well\nSchmahmann says the cerebellum is performing more or less the same function it always has but instead of just making a physical movement smoother and more accurate it smoothing out our emotional responses or improving our ability to make good decisions and focus on a task\nWhat we now understand his up what cerebellum does to motor control it does to cognition and emotion as well\nMom and says the cerebellum does all this automatically so we're unaware of its contribution but\nWhen it stops working he says the result may be a brain disorder\nThere is increasing evidence from a variety of fields now that psychiatric diseases from autism spectrum schizophrenia depression obsessive compulsive disorder or have a link to cerebellum\nAnd mom and says he and other researchers are already trying to fix some of these problems using treatments that make the cerebellum itself work better Jon Hamilton NPR
