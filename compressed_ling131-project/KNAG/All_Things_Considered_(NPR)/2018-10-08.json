at all they wouldn't even have the option of leaving the country in order to even try to get married\nThat is one of the one of the things too I mean there's a lot of countries for example we have heard our current president say there's many countries were denying these is from\nThe other thing is if they came they might not be able to work because they're not on a work visa so it creates a

officers do you have any sense of what's going on\nUh from my perspective it's really what we should be looking at it it's not so much the number switch statistically you know you see when when you say twenty percent it's significant that said that ... percent but then when you look at all none of us we're talking about for the something off ... says investors said there's something of says\nSo

have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drives so much of the country music industry now her songs are being played on pop radio and\nShe'd have this broader audience I feel like it may have the trapped her a little bit in the way that because she still has his country than she did still want to appeal to them\nBut I think she probably didn't feel more free overall to

considered\n[noise]\nThis month we're looking at our bodies the way technology sees them here in the U.S we're gradually getting used to facial recognition technology it's in our phones and some airport security systems on social media\nBut how good and and how secure is this technology\nTo answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she's a facial recognition expert at the University of Texas at Dallas welcome thank you now I feel like I'm seeing facial recognition pop up a lot more recently not just on smartphones but an airport\n... the way technology sees them here in the U.S we're gradually getting used to facial recognition technology it's in our phones in some airport security systems on social media\nBut how good and and how secure is this technology\nTo answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she's a facial recognition expert at the University of Texas at Dallas welcome thank you now I feel like I'm seeing facial recognition\nPop up a lot more recently not just on smartphones but in airport security systems for example law enforcement has also experimented with it\nWas there some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed white or use of this software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system whereas older technology would do really quite well with well controlled facial images when elimination is good and the viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that\nYou know a change in age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better at the task\nYou know one recurring issue though we keep seeing is facial recognition technology that miss identifies people of color much more frequently than it missed identifies white people uh there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as guerrillas\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistakes like that happen yeah this is a really excellent point the current algorithm\nBetter at the task you know one recurring issue though we keep seeing\nIs facial recognition technology that miss identifies people of color much more frequently than it missed identifies white people are there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as guerrillas\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistakes like that\nHappen [noise] yeah this is a really excellent point the current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically\nMany many images of a particular person and an accurate label and so you get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different races\nSo you're saying there are just a lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right so how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make the Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color\nYes oh the answer to the question technologically it's quite simple if you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race bias that's a harder question\nSo even when facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could use this technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAs someone who really understands where this science is today how do you think about this\nIs face recognition technology abused um that certainly a pass\nThat's a harder question so even when facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could use this technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAs someone who really understands where this science is today how do you think about this um\nIs face recognition technology abused um that certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse whether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility\nIs something that has to be decided by societies and carefully looking at how it works and making decisions about what the right ways to use the technology are\nAlice O'Toole is head of the face perception research lab at the University of Texas at Dallas thank you very much thank you [noise]\nFor for all tech considered comes from the three I O T providing a software platform that enables organizations to deploy artificial intelligence predictive analytics and

poison squad comes from project which he undertook it really shows his commitment to this ah described the poison squad was\nWell this is an experiment you could never do today because he basically goes out and recruits other people at the department of agriculture\nEspecially young clerks to volunteer to dine very dangerous lay and so the idea of the poison squad\nWas that three free meals a day seven days away super fancy meals that are cooked by a professional chef all the ingredients are amazing and they only catches you have to agree\nThat half of you at any given period in this experiment are going to be adding capsules that contains suspect food additives and the other thing about it when you say is this crazy or what you were testing\nSuspected toxic compounds on human volunteers was that he felt that was the only way he could deal with this you had this rising tide of really dangerous food additives\nThere was no safety regulation how do I make a case that perhaps this is not a good idea I'll just tested on people and so he did\nTo no one surprise if you feed people formaldehyde arsenic or lead they will get sick and when you demonstrate that why does it still remains so\nIs this crazy or what you were testing suspected toxic compounds on human volunteers was that he felt that was the only way he could deal with this you had this rising tide of really dangerous food additives\nThere was no safety regulation how do I make a case that perhaps this is not a good idea I'll just tested on people and so he did\nNo one surprise if you feed people formaldehyde arsenic or lead they will get sick and when you demonstrate that why does it still remains so difficult to outlaw formaldehyde arsenic or lead in food why wasn't just not an obvious thing that everybody got on board with right away\nAnd doesn't that sound like the most logical response so look you've ... you've poison people let's get that out of the food supply to the food industry\nHad been organizing itself to fight regulation probably at the point that widely starts these experiments in Nineteen oh to he had been advocating advocating advocating and working with Congress men to try to get some kind of basic consumer protection ... regulations out there\nAnd if nothing else labeling and\nAs he does these experiments and ads they catch the national attention which they did they were from page news they were songs and you know musical numbers about them every one is suddenly realizing that there was a lot of bad stuff in their food there's just a lot of bad stuff in their food and\nSo there's this in media push back\nRight to in which suddenly congressmen or on the side of food business or getting offered more money and the food industry actually organizes they create a food Manufacturers Association and and and coalesce against making sure this doesn't happen and they were fun um\nYou know musical numbers about them every one is suddenly realizing that there was a lot of bad stuff in their food there's just a lot of bad stuff in their food and so there was this in media push back\nRight to in which suddenly congressmen or on the side

they were phenomenally effective\nAnd yet despite these long fought fight to expand decades today there isn't lead and formaldehyde an arsenic in food the way that there was a hundred years ago progress really was made\n[noise] yes once this\nFirst food safety law that passed in Nineteen oh six two years after a while a finished his\nFamous poison squad experiments wants that law went into a place\nWe started pulling stuff out formaldehyde when outsell a silk acid went out bore acts went out we are cynical it out right you really see government stepping up for some of these outlet extremely dangerous compounds\nIs this book just one big argument in favor of government regulation\nIn part because it certainly should be a reminder of that before government regulation food was a constant unknown and often terrifying risk to American consumers and put our lives at risk\nBut it's also I Hope just a good story it's a story of something that I Love I Love these kinds of stories
