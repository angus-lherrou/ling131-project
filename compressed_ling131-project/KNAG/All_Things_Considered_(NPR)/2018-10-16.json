not a security issue maybe she had to ... I have one\nThat's the word and show dom in two thousand sixteen our data found women at this prison compared to men of other Iowa prisons were three times more likely to get punished for the

women who come to prison\nI mean I saw patients that had been chained for months at a time in the basement sold his property\nVictims is to panic rituals\nBut it goes even beyond that\nBecause then in their homes many of them were beaten to the point of having traumatic brain injuries\nMen in prison that long histories of being victims of violence too but research in gender response of corrections

can take off one piece of clothing at a time and then put it back on show dumb the warden\nWe always say correctional officer and really it's a Human Services worker it's a customer service\nSome presidents that welcome the change in discipline policies others say there are bigger problems here like not having enough corrections officers I talked to one staffer who didn't want to go on tape or fear of getting in trouble she complained about the warns new approach meant that in her words the inmates are running the prison\nThe war has heard that before recently from a newly hired corrections officer\nAnd she brought for which some concerns and what she said as you know ordinary sounds people saying that the inmates are running the prison and I'm like well they do there is one of you to

now faces more scrutiny after ... disappearance NPR White house reporter Ayesha Rascoe is here to tell us more about Cushing has role in shaping U.S foreign policy including toward Saudi Arabia Ayesha hello so what can you tell us about Jared Kushner's relationship with Mohammad been so long\nWe know that they've had at least five meetings in person uh since Trump took office their first meeting at the White House was in March twenty Seventeen and they seem to have hit it off they're both in their thirties\nAnd there I was obviously and both both in very powerful positions it was Christian or who reportedly convinced Trump to go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first\nForeign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to\nAh Canada or Mexico first\nA cushion he doesn't talk much in public

convinced Trump to go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first foreign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to\nAh Canada or Mexico first ah and cushion he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech to celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\nIt it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this but President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide uh this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on Kushner a and that continued as president\nAnd so a big part of criminals portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east and coming up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that\nA U.S ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley was in the oval office recently

reports that former secretary of state former secretary of state Rex Tillerson was not happy with questionnaires are influence on foreign policy and both ... and ... they really approach international relations in a different way they focus on personal chemistry and personality pretty much above all\nTo now with this controversy where the White House was getting daily questions about it and for secretary of state has flown to Saudi Arabia where things stand today with Christian or on the crowd press\nWe don't really know it's not clear at this moment a cushion there was one of the White House official who was reaching out to uh Mohammed bin some on a\nAfter ... show gee went ... went missing the White House said he and other officials are pressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation is open and transparent a but right now the crown prince is denying knowledge of this disappearance uh one of the criticisms of cushion there has been\nFrom an experienced diplomat is that because he lacks experience\nThat it may be easy to manipulate him a and for foreign leaders to manipulate him I talked to Brett brewing who was a director of global engagement for the Obama White house and he said he worries that Christian or could act as a back channel\nOr to Trump for kind of outside leaders and go outside the national security change\nAnd then there's the question of

and the Saudis\nYes and a lot of that is not clear because we don't have a President Trump's tax returns and some of that's not clear and\nSome of these dealings are are not transparent\nBut we do
