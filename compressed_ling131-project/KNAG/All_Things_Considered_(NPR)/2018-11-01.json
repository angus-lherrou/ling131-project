year since allegations of sexual misconduct began pouring out against Hollywood power player Harvey Weinstein which of course led to the toppling of hundreds more prominent men around the country\nWhen the new NPR Ipsos poll out today shows a significant backlash against the me too movement\nAmericans are deeply divided on the subject and largely along partisan lines as NPR's Tovia Smith reports more than forty percent said the movement has gone too far\nAfter a year of intense focus on sexual misconduct Americans remain deeply divided even on what sexual harassment means\nWell I Would say that Charlotte dances especially ... any type of grabbing initiated by the man anything that's uncomfortable word um insinuation that is tough\nOverall half those surveyed say they're

paper that says after follow all use rules one of the rules is you can't look at a member of the opposite sex more than three seconds what so and not offend someone that makes no sense to me\nOverall forty three percent think the me too movement has gone too far encouraging an over sensitivity for example or a rush to judgment that includes one quarter of Democrats versus three quarters of Republicans\nOh yes yes definitely\nRackets Seventy four year old Republican from California is among those who say the benefit of the doubt in cases like this should not go to alleged

know justice is done you can't there is two sides to every story\nThroughout our poll party drives opinions more than gender which doesn't surprise Clara Wilkins a social psychologist at Washington University in St Louis according to our research it sort of the way things work\nWhen there's sort of a conflict between gender and party party wins\nThat's especially true Wilkins says for those with a strong conservative ideology\nThey're more likely to think that gains for women are losses for men so conservative women are more likely to think that maybe men in their life are going to be hurt by the me too movement or change in general\nIndeed our poll shows nearly twice as many Republican women as democratic women worry that a man they care about will be unfairly accused\nAre very very time

false allegations jumping on it\nTo oppose me too he just wants to give voice to another sort of victim\nWe have females that come forward and make false allegations jumping on the bandwagon and its ruined a lot of guys live and they're now just as brave of them to come forward\nOn the question of false allegations are poll shows Seventy seven percent of Republicans believe their common but most Democrats disagree\nThose talking points are being used to discredit women and to weaponize this issue just simply for partisan gang\nAttorney Deborah Katz says she ran straight into it when she represented Kavanaugh's accuser Dr Christie bloody Ford\nWe have the president deliberately muddying the facts to confuse people in that way giving people pass for engaging in the behavior and it's dangerous\nUltimately Katz says the backlash will fade with time the NPR Ipsos poll does show much more consensus among young people\nFewer of those under thirty five believe that me too has gone too far fewer say they would ever consider voting for a political candidate accused of sexual misconduct and more young people said they're clear on what sexual misconduct actually means\nFor the next generation our poll suggests the issue of sexual misconduct more often transcend party lines Tovia Smith NPR News\nNATO is holding its largest exercises since the Cold War the war games in Norway

counter insurgency in Afghanistan but after Russia invaded crime you're in two thousand and fourteen NATO seems to be refocusing more in its roots back here in Europe\nNow the war games that they are staging right now has a NATO forces defend the country that's been attacked by an unnamed invaders and what they're really trying to emphasize here is a pillar of NATO which is if one country has attacked it's seen as as an attack on all NATO members now a most assume this fictitious invader is Russia\nAn earlier this fall Russia had massive war games in the east and and now it seems to be NATO's during\nThese huge military maneuvers by NATO and the Russians makes it sound like we're returning to something like the Cold War is there talk of that they're in Norway where you are\nActually

about the U.S commitment to NATO as some of his predecessors I mean he's publicly berated some NATO member countries for not spending enough on defense is that tension playing out as these exercises unfold\nNo certainly not on the surface and there's a real emphasis on unity here in the United states heavy commitment we have Seventy five hundred Marines here I was talking to you and Stoltenberg he's the NATO secretary general he says there's a difference between the political rhetoric you here and actually the troops on the ground\nWhat we see is stunts or they're not just states is increasing its presence military presence in Europe would more forces more exercises more pre positioned equipment for the first time they're also use Marines hated Norway\nYeah so the message here is
