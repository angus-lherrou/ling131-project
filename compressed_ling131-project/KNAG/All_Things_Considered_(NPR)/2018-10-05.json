to make a decision and I've made that decision\nPolls are showing her down and this might be the thing that she needs to do to kind of remind people she is a Democrat and this is in the state of North Dakota right that's right and I mean from a lot of Democrats that they think Republican enthusiasm may said if a cabinet gets confirmed so we will see\nNPR's Kelsey Snell thanks I'm watching\nYou well as we just heard Kelsey no they're the FBI interviewed nine people for its report not Ford or Kavanaugh or some of the others from the judge has passed to have stepped forward to share thoughts on his nomination ... went to Yale with Kavanaugh he says they used to drink together\nThat would Kevin I'll drink he got belligerent and aggressive\nThat he won ... Kevin I'll throw a drink and a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kevin ... may have lied under oath I\nAsked ... did he offered this information to the FBI\nOr yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them by from the did than told me what exactly to do first and the pill that sending a request for the form to fill out\nAnd then I filled out the form in fact when the former run this had been pre filled by the presumed reviewed misspoke do oh\nSave that he won ... Kevin I'll throw a drink in a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kevin ... may have lied under oath I asked ... did he offered this information to the FBI\nOr yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them by phone they did then tell me what exactly to do first and that entailed sending a request for\nA form to fill out and then I filled out the form in fact when the former arrived it had been pre filled by the uh presumably the Asian I spoke to a with my testimony in it that took up most of the three thousand a character spaces that they allowed\nSo you feel that this form did you ever than sit down with are having a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nUh last I did not I was never called back I read by my phone by my computer ah hoping to get an email that nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why as your account relevant to the FBI why do they need to question yeah\nWell I think it's relevant because first of all I don't think one should lie in front of the Senate Judiciary committee or when it's taken an oath and one is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you're saying you thought he lied and testimony that's in regard to the extent of his drinking\nIt is the basic lie was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black and yeah I think ... may confuse that was passing out but the black man phrase means doing things that you don't know you you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of his intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for\nYou become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you're saying you thought he lied and testimony this was in regard to the extent of his drinking\nYes it is the basic lie was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black now I think ... may confuse that was passing out but the blackmail phrase means doing things that you don't know you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of his intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to that condition how can one no\nThey don't let me ask you this a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nNo I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened in the last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I can speak to what I Know about making eighty three eighty four eighty five at college\nAnd then how that was spoken about in two thousand and Eighteen so I don't think they've done a very thorough job in that sense at all\n... classmate of Brett Kavanaugh says he's now an associate professor at North Carolina State University and you heard him here on all things considered from NPR News [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] Mm\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nListening to all things considered from NPR News the Labor Department comes out\nTwo thousand and Eighteen so I don't think that deliver a thorough job in that sense at all\n... classmate of Brett Kavanaugh says he's now an associate professor at North Carolina State University and you heard him here on all things considered from NPR News\n... [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] Mm ...\n...\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe Labor Department comes out with the latest jobs report tomorrow and economists expect to see more new jobs being created at a healthy pace\nBut there aren't just more jobs Cardiff Garcia of our planet money team says people are also changing jobs more often and he's here to tell us more about this ... hey Ari what shows you that people are changing jobs moving around more\nWell my favorite indicator of dynamism is probably the quit straight that's just the share of people who quit to voluntarily leave their jobs each month it's now its highest point in Seventeen years so it shows you that people are confident letting go of their place of work or in looking for something else\nSo you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a high rate that's actually a good sign economically\nI mean individually usually we associate quitting your job with like being fed up you know you've had it\nUp but actually if you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy it's a great sign when a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nAnd when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there\nA lot more uh in fact there are now more job openings than there are unemployed people this is the first year that that's been the case in the government started tracking these records back in the year two thousand and\nBeing fed up you know you've had it up but actually if you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy it's a great sign when a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nAnd when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there\nActually a lot more uh in fact there are now more job openings than there are unemployed people this is the first year that that's been the case in the government started tracking these records back in the year two thousand\nAnd that doesn't mean that everyone who once worked will just slide into those open jobs the jobs might be in different parts of the country from where the unemployed people are they might not be a perfect match in terms of the skill sets that are required versus the skills that people have but it does tell you that there is a lot of work out there if you're looking for it\nAnd is that across the border in certain sectors are the more job openings and others\nNo no it's it's consistent geographically across the U.S and it's also consistent across the entire US Economy are but there are some sectors that are more impressive than others and if you look at\nThe health care sector food and accommodations restaurants hotels\nAnd then there's this category called professional in business services those are like high end services things like design accounting law advertising in all of those sectors are you really see a lot of job opportunities if employers have to compete so much for talent and why aren't wages going up faster than they are\nYou know this has been puzzling economists for quite some time uh but what could be the case is that\nThere are more people than economists realize who are willing to take work in part because a lot of the people who are taking jobs now\nSaid that they weren't even looking for jobs in the month before they actually took them and so what it suggests is that actually there are more people willing to take work and so companies are having to look for workers yeah but there are also more workers available to be found\nLot of job opportunities if employers have to compete so much for talent and why aren't wages going up faster than they are\nYou know this has been puzzling economist for quite some time uh but what could be the case is that there are more people than economists realize who are willing to take work in part because a lot of the people who are taking jobs now\nSaid that they weren't even looking for jobs in the month before they actually took them and so what it suggests is that actually there were more people willing to take work and so companies are having to look for workers yeah but there are also more workers available to be found\nWhat does all this mean for the economy as a whole\nYou know when the economy's more dynamic it tends to give people more bargaining power so wage growth has been kind of sluggish in the last few years very disappointing it could be about to get better it also makes the economy a bit more efficient more productive because if people are finding jobs that are a good match for their skill set a\nIt makes them better at their jobs

I'd had\nBy the way he acted like ... I think that response would have been well clearly he must be guilty because they truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think a price cap and all the put into a position where he was damned if you did and dance\nExpressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think by Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if he did and damned if you did at the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers and said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as a Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice\nFalling forward sure one\nBrett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not basically ... based on any political or personal bullies and he is not about to sacrifice that welders are reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court\nI wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter Ginsburg had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the all you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut did that specific remarketing or he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated and orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question that he found the tactics\nOf some of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate but when it comes to rolling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker headed Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal and he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation\nFor a moment in his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal and he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he uh he said there's some things I shouldn't have said what thanks get what you do not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break you apologize to center ... uh for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the collar but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's strengths and facilitating gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said that\nYou know he I think there is no question that the Democrats you know when you you'd be some of them engaged and the timing of this for maximum advantage and had a political tinge to it and I like not fault him for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota\nJohn Malcolm thank you good to be with you at the Heritage Foundation John Malcolm an

unemployment rate reached an important milestone in September it dropped to its lowest level in nearly fifty years it's now three point seven percent according to the government's monthly employment report today's news is a big positive for many workers but a challenge for businesses NPR's John Ydstie has the story\nSarah houses senior economist at Wells Fargo says it's hard to overstate the significance of this super low unemployment rate I think it's a huge and houses the lowest unemployment rate in half a century has businesses scrambling\nTop concern or hearing from an players they\nAnd how says the lowest unemployment rate in half a century has businesses scrambling\nThat top concern or hearing from and players if they can't find work earth that\nCould limit their ability to grow their companies and put a drag on the overall economy but how says that's historically low jobless rate is a positive for many workers\nIt off of course has ... implications for wages\nThere are signs that wage growth is finally picking up as employers are being forced to boost paid to attract and keep workers\nEconomist Dean Baker says low wage workers are among those benefiting partly because many cities and states have raised minimum wages the September ... jobs data showed average wages growing at just to point eight percent over the past year but lower income workers experienced much bigger gains\nFor point three percent over last year so some of the minimum wage was but I think some of that is the tightening labor market\nAnd Baker says the super low unemployment rate is helping those at the bottom of the economic ladder finally get a toehold on the first wrong\nWhen you start to get the unemployment rate down the slow the people who benefited disproportionately those bottom so you're seeing people that historically not been able to get jobs or at least recently not been able to get jobs the markets opening up to them\nBlack teenagers are a good example the black teen unemployment rate hit a record low in September that's the good news bad news is that it's still above Nineteen percent\nAnd that's why Baker believes the Federal Reserve should not panic and start raising interest rates more rapidly to keep the economy from overheating\nSo who should get the credit for engineering this low unemployment rate the White House took some credit today touting President Trump's policies on deregulation tax cuts and trade former President Obama\nWhite House took some credit today touting President Trump's policies on deregulation tax cuts and trade former President Obama also get some credit for reducing the unemployment rate by more than half during his administration\nBaker who is senior economist at the center for economic research and policy says both administrations have a case but\nThe fed is really a hero\nBaker says remember that just four years ago the consensus among fed policymakers was that once the unemployment rate fell below five and a half percent inflation pressures were built\nA lot of them wanted to raise interest rates I said you know look what makes getting too low you have a problem with inflation\nBut former fed chair Janet Yellen said let's wait and see what happens and that's what the fed did finally it began raising rates gradually and has continued that pace under the Fed's current leader Jerome Powell\nIf you followed the view of many people on the fed and many other economists they will start to slam on the brakes the unemployment rate got around five percent and they never would have allowed it to get the slow\nAnd Baker says that would have meant millions of people might not have gotten the jobs they now have John Ydstie NPR News Washington [noise]\n[noise] Mm [noise]\nYou're\nListening to all

Supreme Court and move to a final vote despite allegations of sexual assault and has passed\nAnd one year ago today with a New York times broke a bombshell story\nThe times headline on October fifth twenty Seventeen read Harvey Weinstein paid off sexual harassment accusers for decades or one of the two reporters who broke that Weinstein story was Jodi Kantor and she joins me now hey there\nHi how are you I'm well thank you I've started here you just pointed out today a picture of what you were up to a year ago today and it's it's a bunch of you all crowded around to the computer and the New York Times' newsroom about to hit send on the Weinstein story and you write none of us knew what was going to happen when we send that out into the world\nDidn't my partner Megan to me and I we certainly felt the power of the story as we were reporting it and because of the times was doing bigger investigations of sexual harassment we knew that this was part of the system and it wasn't just about Harvey Weinstein we were reporting on Bill O'Reilly and we were\nBigger investigations of sexual harassment we knew that this was part of the system and it wasn't just about Harvey Weinstein we were reporting on Bill O'Reilly and we were reporting on Fort factory workers\nBut you never know what's gonna happen to an investigation what it's when it's published and you know one of our editors I'm Matt pretty like to say as we were working on it he said ... it's not that famous and that is true aside from New York and LA and maybe D.C he really was not\nA household name 'em and and what we've seen happen is that not only did the me too movement which was founded years ago by trying to bark\nTakeoff globally but it just kept going and going\nAnd going there were so many times in the past year when I saw productions that this was going to burn out or you know the women were all that simmered down or the news was finally going to stop and it never did and what's happening with judge Kaplan I think is representative of that there's a feeling that this reckoning only continues and grows bigger\nMe ask you this it if Kavanaugh is confirmed a with a full Senate vote this weekend [noise] do you see that as a step back to the momentum of me too\nI think if he's confirmed there will be massive debate about what this means for the me too movement and I think there are two contradictory answers both of which\nProbably have some validity I'll give you the pro and con the obvious one is that people will say this as a setback he was confirmed anyway uh these really serious allegations of sexual assault didn't matter um women were ... you know ignored yet again this is a replay of Anita Hill\nThe other argument however is that what especially what Dr Christine Blasey Ford did was really important uh that she spoke up in front of the entire country she put high school on the table right\nDr Christine Blasey Ford did was really important uh that she spoke up in front of the entire country\nShe put high school on the table right she made a case that these things that that happened in our collective you do have a bearing on the presence and we also some moments like with um the two protesters and the alligator with Jeff Flake where they were able to literally stop the national conversation for a second and say listen to these stories\nOne footnote to this conversation before I let you go Judy we just heard there from our reporter psoriasis or hurting also that today also marks the award of the Nobel Peace prize prize is often seen of sending a political message\nUm and the word went to people working to stop sexual violence as a weapon of war I Wonder if that's one more book and if you like to the global scope of this me to\nMoment the EU hopes and motion a year ago\nI look up to the same news and had the same side I think it's a reminder scale I think it's a reminder of the global reach that ... and also maybe a reminder perspective at a moment when we are all so immersed in the ... news media this as a reminder that this topic is it's even bigger than that in a way\n[noise] Jodi Kantor she broke the Harvey Weinstein story for
