from Michigan Radio in Ann Arbor the national unemployment rate is lower than it's been in half a century three point seven percent\nThat's a huge turned around here in Michigan the rate was close to a Fifteen Percent during the crash a decade ago the auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy\nWe wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their paths through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plant under one roof it was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM shut it down in two thousand ten\nIt's odd standing here it's emotional yeah I'm sure it is it's crazy what is the phrase willow run mean to you at this point when you hear it today a sick I get sick sickening just the word or to see it on a freeway on the way here and\nYeah it was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed down Skidmore was president of the local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIt was a December twenty third it was Christmas but uh yeah it was a\nDark and scary and\nYou know crying all the way which are\nLike losing somebody\nLike losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and steps on the has the each of them have taken since then reflect\nLike losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and steps on the ... that each of them have taken since then reflect larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready

private golf course at a fancy club in the suburbs\nBeautiful here yeah very elevated\nHe writes a lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often about the auto industry\nAnd the days are over them good old days are over\nBetween the golf course and his GM pension he makes less money than he did at the auto plant but he says it's enough\nAre not happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing people you know it's great and then General Motors just bam you know they shut the door and now we all go our separate ways\nBack then Don Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck workplace\nPolicies that eighty see you again\nToday Don green is a nurse an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed scribes little\nBit of everything a little bit of everything from stitches X rays step is a big thing this time of year than\nThe after she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflect the bigger shift in this economy\nAs auto industry jobs went away the health care field grew and was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and\nYes very much so I notice when I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really can it be because they were people who just\nMuch though I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really going to be because there were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to ... when the plant closed ...\nDid the thing about marriage have anything to do with all the people that was going on in your professional life\nYeah I Would say because um I at that\nPoint was used to being independent used to being able to to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and once that wasn't there anymore I felt like\nI had to depend on him\nI think I was searching for that independence again and just couldn't handle it so\nWhen you think about her work family that you had a willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position urine today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled in on their feet\n[noise] I'm not going to say that percentage of them\nIn and it gives me kind of emotional to be honest I guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoyed your life after that but I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and\nStuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like Don green son Peyton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was hitting and many of them have never found their foot Peyton started working as a clean or on the midnight shift at willow run when he was a tea do you have that job for about three years\nIt was like AT T's really you know for like a kind of like tease me it's like oh hey here's a good job you know you're going to be set you don't have to worry about\nThree years it was like a tease really you know I felt like kinda like tease me it's like oh hey here's a good job you know you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting thousands of dollars in debt for student loans and doing all this you can just work hard here and you know twenty five thirty years retired and just living normal life but\nThat was not the case\nAs you say when it went down the drain little bit\nPeyton has struggled since he left willow run he's been in and out of school and service industry jobs he moved to Florida and came back he just got offered a job with a rental car company at the airport until he starts there he's doing seasonal Halloween were\nAre running [laughter]\nThose are fireworks going off overhead Wired's nights

members has a job they're all making less money than they did it willow run\nAnd what about the plant itself it seems like a fantasy world or something in there you know the current owners invited us into take a tour along with Don Skidmore who was one of the last people to leave when it closed down this is his first time inside the gate since that\nDay draws a him six hurting\nEnter our tour guide is Jeff Rupp he's chief technical officer at the American Center for mobility\nThe site formerly known as willow run is now a place where people test autonomous vehicles driverless cars Don

Honduran Caribbean is reportedly dropped by half from some seven thousand thirty five hundred now and expected the fall even more the further north of gifts but that hasn't stopped all the overheated talk coming out of Washington\nI mean just to give you a flavor or listen to this exchange between Fox News anchor Martha ... column and homeland security secretary cures to Nielsen that was on TV last night\nIs there any scenario under which if people forced their way across the border they can be shot at\nWe do not have any intention right now to people and they will be apprehended however uh but I also take my officer and ... at their own personal safety extraordinarily serious and they can't have any ability of course to defend themselves\nJohn how is this intense rhetoric playing out at the U.S Mexico border\nSo today I spoke with the mayor of Columbus New Mexico is ... cities right on the border across from Columbus Mexico he said an armed militia from Florida is already camped out west of town patrolling private ranch land you got a call from another militia leader from South Carolina earlier in the week\nHe said quote if you need help with the illegals coming across you let me know when will be there\nThe militia leader reportedly said if were fired on will shoot back so I was told him I'm thanks but no thanks we're fine with the border patrol\n... we've heard about growing numbers of migrant families trying to cross the border and this caravan that we've been talking about is not even arrived jet a tell us about why the numbers are growing right now\nWell there has been a record number of families with children turning themselves into federal agents either at the ports of entry or shortly after crossing the border illegally the Trump Administration released numbers earlier this week and they really are startling in July agents arrested about Ninety two hundred family members\nThe border illegally the Trump Administration released numbers earlier this week and they really are startling in July agents arrested about Ninety two hundred family members traveling together in September that number resort to more than sixteen thousand apprehensions that's an eighty percent increase\nThat's a huge growth how our border agents handling that\nSo border patrol agent in South Texas told me every day they're arresting four to five hundred immigrants just in his station mostly adults with small kids asking for asylum\nImmigration says their detention facilities are not big enough to handle these crowds so they have to release them with a notice to appear in the already back logged immigration court\nThis week immigration and Customs Enforcement put a new policy into effect ice will no longer help immigrants with travel arrangements to a destination in the interior\nAnd that leads thousands of families stranded in these border towns and the nonprofits that helped them are overwhelmed immigrant aid groups up and down the border overflowing some are paying thousands of dollars a night on motel rooms for immigrants with nowhere else to go\nCritics claim the government is just dumping immigrants in the streets making the crisis look worse\n[noise] President Trump says he has plans to deploy the military to the border to stop the caravan whenever it might arrived can you give us any more details about that right the Pentagon said today defense secretary Jim Mattis plans to sign deployment orders this weekend for up to eight hundred active duty troops to be in place on the border by early next week\nThe White House has floated the idea of an executive order that would shut down the border to the Central American immigrants and denied them the ability to seek asylum that would be an extraordinary moved us recognizes the right of asylum in federal and international law\nBut we saw that this president attempted what he attempted with the travel ban and he'll give his government emergency powers when he's worried about immigrants coming to our borders NPR's John Burnett speaking with us from Texas Thanks John\nHis government emergency powers when he's worried about immigrants coming to our borders NPR's John Burnett speaking with us from Texas Thanks John you\n[laughter] you're\nListening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe U.S economy continues to grow at a strong pace thanks to healthy spending by consumers and the government the Commerce Department said today that the growth rate was three point five percent during the quarter but NPR's Jim Zarroli reports there were signs of potential trouble including weak business spending\nAs he often does President Trump painted today's numbers as historic and unprecedented\nThey just announced an estimate of three point five and these are numbers that we're not even thought about\nIn fact the growth rate was only a bit better than most economists expected and it was a drop from the four point two percent growth rate in the second quarter still the numbers were impressive former White House economist Jared Bernstein says the strong showing reflects the fact that so many people are in the job market\nLots of people are working in drawing paychecks even if those paychecks are growing as fast might like that's going to fuel economic road and in this report in fact the strongest sector was consumer spending\nAmericans spent that and especially fast rate during the quarter they took more trips and ate out in restaurants more Eli Maloof is America CEO of I G the hotel group that owns Holiday Inn and camped in among other brands which has been opening up new hotels at a rapid pace\nShut records around our Labor Day an immoral Davis your fourth of July in terms of travel and so they're spending offer\nOr set records are around Labor Day an immoral Davis here in the fourth of July in terms of travel and so they're spending more for for trip spending more with us\nBut it wasn't just consumers who are spending more government spending was also up Congress passed a bipartisan spending bill in February a bill that Trump signed even as it was cutting taxes on businesses and individuals defense spending in particular with high Bernstein says that has an impact on the economy\nAll that deficit spending shows up in GDP and that's helping to juice the growth rate\nFor all the good news and today's report there were some disquieting signs business investment spending grew at an annual rate of just eight tenths of a percentage point a meager number\nDespite the big cut in business taxes there is little evidence in today's report that it has led to more investment spending by companies Gregory ... who is chief us economist at Oxford economics\nWhen you take a look outside of the consumer rail you're starting to see some headwinds appearing before the U.S economy in particular when it comes to business activity\nThose headwinds include a Federal Reserve that has steadily raising interest rates higher rates tend to dampen spending by people in businesses over time and they're already signs of weakness in the housing and car markets\nDeco also site say gradual slowing and the global economy in Europe and Asia meanwhile the stimulus from the tax cuts should begin to wane by next year deco says that should bring the growth rate under three percent next year\nWe should expect to see somewhat slower momentum but overall the economy is still doing quite well\nAnother question mark hanging over the economy is trade there is what deco calls they growing spirit of protectionism right now the U.S has already imposed tariffs on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports and China\nCause they growing spirit of protectionism right now the U.S has already imposed tariffs on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports and China has retaliated there's no telling what impact it will have but for now Americans are working and spending and that is keeping the growth rate strong\nJim Zarroli NPR News
