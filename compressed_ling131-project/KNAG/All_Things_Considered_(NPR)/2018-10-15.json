high at first what are the arguments being made in the case\nStudents for fair admissions the group that filed this lawsuit will be trying to prove essentially for things in this case first they say that Harvard illegally uses a quota system or racial balancing it admissions\nThey say the admissions rates for each demographic river or two similar from year to year a second the group is arguing that Harvard admissions is considering race too much or that it's a deciding factor and not just a factor of a factor like affirmative action policy actually allows\nThe group also thinks that Harvard hasn't adequately explored admissions methods that don't use race they say that you really can still get a diverse class by considering things like geography and socioeconomic status\nBut as you mentioned the biggest delegation here is that Harvard is intentionally discriminating against Asian Americans in this application process\nAnd there'll be trying to prove this with a lot of

standardized test scores things like that that they consistently earn lower personal scores from the admissions department and a a personal score is a number that Harvard assigns applicants to to

illustrates the problem is\nWhat is Harvard have to say\nWell Harvard is standing behind their admissions policies and they say they don't have a quota pointing to the fact that in the last five years they have admitted about twenty nine percent more Asian applicants\nHarvard's legal team will also be presenting data that refused the plaintiffs analysis over those lower personal scores\nAnd W.

Louise Kelly and I'm Audie Cornish we're spending a few days looking at a striking disparity in prisons across the United states women are disciplined more frequently and often more harshly than men that's the finding of an investigation by NPR and the ... school of journalism at Northwestern university\nNPR's Joseph Shapiro and reporter Jessica papa that found that women are punished disproportionately for minor infractions those violations can have major repercussions like the loss of good conduct credits or solitary confinement here's Joe\nWe collected data on prison discipline from Fifteen states in all but two women get this one of the higher rates than men what's most striking is that women get punished far more for minor violations of prison rules at rates we estimated often two to three times higher\nFor what prisons classify a smaller fraction\nPetty stuff you can get written up for a not closing your doors you get written up for jumping on the phone without permission or if you just want to just picture room up nice in just takes and too late and die you appeal the case you get written up for that\nThat's Victoria Williams and it made up the central

written up for our numbers showed that in California women compared to men get twice the disciplinary tickets for disobeying and order\nAnd more than twice as many for what's called disrespect in Vermont we found women are more than three times as likely to get in trouble for making what's called derogatory comments in Rhode Island they get more than three times the tickets were disobedience\nThose tickets have consequences women who's good conduct credits that kind of time at it to their stay in prison or lose bone in visitation privileges or go to solitary confinement in Rhode Island women were more than three times as likely as men to end up in solitary confinement for disobedience [noise]\nPrisons were built for men and the rules for discipline were set up to

often as men for all offenses big and small but almost five times more likely to get in trouble for a lesser offense called minor influence\nAnd they also really if they seen injustice with another woman in a prison or something that happened they want to fix it like they want to be the mom that's going to come in and mediate between people and fix the problem\n... told us she likes it that women prisoners are this way but she said many corrections officers and often even in a women's prison most of them are men say\nThey hate it the first thing that they'll tell you is these women are so difficult gosh they're a pain I Would rather work anywhere but here they always want to talk to you they won't take no for an answer\nCorrections officers are trained to keep control they expect women to be compliant if the women push back that's where those disciplinary tickets for influence come in\nTo women and we met in Illinois told us they'd been written up some years ago for an
