most with\nAll of these characters have some element of me in them whether I'd like to admit that or not there's a pimp there a couple of ... types in here there are you know there's a a man who's object to find women who is a former cop\nWho admits to using you know prosecuted women or as he says never on the clock though you know never well I'm actually on the clock but yeah\nAnd you know to realize of course I'm looking at him he's objectify women I object to find myself and other women obviously it's on a continuum and it's a different conversation but every time I look at myself and think oh my body's not okay or my worst than value are determined by my\nParents and my marketability I'm kind of engaging in one form of this same narrative so ... writing this work has been really cathartic and humbling\nFor me what is forced you to start looking at yourself in relationship to this why are you beginning to do this now\nOf the things I'm discovering in performing this piece in different places and in connecting with people one commonality is engaging after the show whether it's in queuing day or with social media and I found myself being really you know open about my own me two experiences\nI'm kind of engaging in one form of this same narrative so writing this work has been really cathartic and humbling\nFor me what is forced you to start looking at yourself in relationship to this why are you beginning to do this now\nOne of the things I'm discovering in performing this piece in different places and in connecting with people one commonality is engaging after the show whether it's in Kew NA or with social media and I found myself\nBeing really you know open about my own me two experiences that predate the hashtags you know when I was in college I thought about\nStripping as kind of a you know it was sort of cool it was like oh this is my pre beyond say feminism like yes I have bell hooks on this side but I have biggest malls on this side and you know what does healthy sexuality look like as a woman at Bryn Mawr college where you have to you know kind of ... to serve earn more\nBut who also you know I Would go home from school from Philly to New York and party with rappers and you know what did it look like to trade on my appearance and being a woman in a context that was obviously just as sex us as the rest of the culture but in hip hop\nThere was definitely this space that I was trying to occupy as a feminist as well and so looking at all of that I'm On a continuum of women who are negotiating their relationship to sex and power in a male dominated culture\nMhm yeah I was wondering if people come up to you after the show\nTo talk about these characters that you and body whether they say to you oh my gosh it's totally saw myself and that person or whether they say to you maybe you didn't get that quiet writer I'm not sure if I felt comfortable with you using this accent which is my accent which was my real accent\nCan you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show that maybe\nMen who are negotiating their relationship to sex and power in a male dominated culture\nMhm yeah I was wondering if people come up to you after the show\nTo talk about these characters that you and body whether they say to you oh my gosh it's totally saw myself and that person or whether they say to you maybe you didn't get that quiet writer I'm not sure if I felt comfortable with you using this accent which is my accent which was my real accent\nCan you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show that may be comfortable and supportive and maybe not as comfortable\nYeah I Would say for whatever reason the gods goddesses and trends gods of the theater\nAnd of accents and you know kind of persona I really don't think of my of these characters as just having an accent you know there's a woman in the show\nShe's from Dominican Republic she's Puerto Rican Dominican all proud and it's very important to me that people to understand that I have a direct connection to them and the republic myself through my family but also that I Want you to hear her accent and if you have a problem with an accent I Want you to hold up a mirror to yourself\nBecause actually there's no indignity so having accented English actually does means I speak two languages or what you know so I Love\nKind of doing a deep dive into people's experience and then presenting it to those people first I always take every character you know\nCan remember hide that my name is probably more so individual and us how to do is when do United Nation schools you also comes from a mixed cultural background so she was growing up with different people from different places from for so long\nBut then when she came to India she was kind of working on some of this material on during the different places are that are lots of conversations about sex work or prostitution or commercial sexual exploitation that we can have all over the world so\nShe came to India and we said very good cracking good job or she's a very nice woman a bit dog but\nI can remember hide that my name is probably more so individual and us how to do is when do United Nation schools you also comes from a mixed cultural background so she was growing up with different people from different places from for so long but then when she came to India she was kind of working out some of this material\nOn during the different places are that are lots of conversations about sex walk or prostitution or commercial sexual exploitation that we can have all over the world so she came to India and we said\nVery good cracking good job she's a very nice woman a bit dog but other than that chief it in ...\nSo you know I really try to vet my material with people from those communities first and then try to engage directly in the conversation if someone says I feel like this isn't dignified why are you doing this I'll say well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified\n... what is it about how you were raised and how you were brought up that drew you to different people with the with different experiences and drew you to wanting to bring their stories to life\nWell I think like so many of us in today's culture I come from a mixed\nUpbringing experience my family was black and white him on my mom's side my grandmother was Irish American and German American and we have both Christians and Jews on that side of the family as a character Lorraine would say it's a long story

really knew and I\nHad to learn to Code Switch as we call it now just to like get dinner [laughter] you know growing up it was very normal for me to identify with\nThe kind of the pluribus unum within
