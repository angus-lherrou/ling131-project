all things considered from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro and I know the chain when Brett Kavanaugh sat down before the Senate Judiciary committee to respond to charges that he had sexually assaulted

two thousand sixteen election\nRevenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars and money from outside left wing opposition groups\nSo what could the consequences of statements like this be

requires most water utilities to test for a list of ... passes and in twenty sixteen agency lowered a non binding health advisory limit for some ... chemicals it's now Seventy parts per trillion I'm told that it's about Seventy grains of sand and an Olympic size swimming pool\nAnd some environmental advocates argue level should be even lower than that\nBut all this uncertainty it creates confusion especially for water companies like aqua America it's based in suburban Philadelphia Christopher crack at is the chief environmental officer there and he says companies like his need clearer

they responding differently today is\nAn issue like this it really fits in with the way the Trump Administration has tried to narrow the focus of the EPA away from things like climate change and

Yale Law school classmate of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh thank you very much thank you and professor also now teaches law at the University of St Thomas and St Paul Minnesota\nThe federal government was so unprepared to carry out the Trump administration's policy of separating migrant families earlier this year that it wasn't even ready to has the children and where did it even have a plan to reunite them with their parents\nThat is from a scathing report from the homeland security department internal watchdog this week\nThe administration has abandoned its policy of separating families to deter illegal immigration but only after widespread outrage and after more than twenty six hundred children were already separated from their parents\nTo talk more about the ... inspector general's findings were joined by NPR's Joel Rose ... hey also so you know we've been hearing all year about the problems with this policy of separating families but what is new in this report that contradicts what we've been hearing from the administration\nWell it contradicts some early assurances that we got from federal officials as this policy was being rolled out here's da just secretary just Nielsen\nIt is important to note that these miners are very well taken care of don't believe the press they are very well taken care of it\nBut this report paints and much less rosy picture the inspector general found that da Jess held hundreds of migrant children and border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child\nWho was held for twenty five days and many of these children were held in middle\nFrom federal officials as this policy was being rolled out here's da chest secretary cures to Nielsen\nIt is important in it that these miners are very well taken care I don't believe that perhaps they are very well taken care\nBut this report paints and much less rosy picture the inspector general found that da Jess held hundreds of migrant children in border patrol facilities well beyond the legal limit of Seventy two hours in fact federal officials held more than eight hundred migrant children for longer than that including one child who was held for twenty five days\nAnd many of these children were held in metal cages and border patrol facilities near the border until the government was able to find space in shelters that are equipped to has children\nAnd as we mentioned many parents and children had trouble finding each other and assist in after they were separated\nWell again at the time officials denied that that was a problem remember here's Alex aides are the secretary of health and Human Services speaking it back in June before Congress\nThere's no reason why any parent would not know where their child is located I could with with just basic keystrokes within seconds could find any child in our care for any parent\nH H s by the way cared for children after they were separated while da chess had custody of their parents and at the time da just said there was a central database of the locations of parents and their children\nAs central database did the inspector general find that central database\nThe inspector general found no evidence that there was such a central database the two agencies actually had computer systems that could not communicate with each other and the inspector general found that when distraught parents tried to track down their children the government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some cases parents couldn't communicate with their kids at all\nAnd then what happened to those families\nThe government was ordered to reunify them by a federal judge and it has reconnected more than two thousand children with their parents but the inspector general's report says that this lack of communication made that\nThe inspector general found no evidence that there was such a central database the two agencies actually had computer systems that could not communicate with each other and the inspector general found that when distraught parents tried to track down their children the government sometimes gave them inconsistent or just wrong information in some cases parents couldn't communicate with their kids at all\nSince then what happened to those families\nThe government was ordered to reunify them by a federal judge and it has reconnected more than two thousand children with their parents but the inspector general's report says that this lack of communication made that reunification process slower\nAnd the process was especially hard for children who are so young that they couldn't speak immigration authorities according to this report made no effort to identify those young children it anyway no wristbands and no photographs of them were taken so it was only through communication with the parents that that authorities were able to find these children and reunite them\nStill have federal officials responded to the inspector general's report in any way\nWell as the administration often does is blaming quote immigration laws that are broken and poorly written unquote\nDa chest does say that it deserves some credit for working quote exhaustively to reunite these families although again they were ordered to do so by a judge but the H. S. also acknowledge that the government's computer system still do not communicate across these agencies\nAre there any children still haven't been reunited with their parents\n[noise] oh yeah more

... about it earlier today\nI like a lot of journalists probably today had been getting a lot of survivors wanting to share their stories of sexual assault and what was notable to me is how many of them had a common thread of the one person I've never told as my dad I don't think he could handle this\nAnd what did they tell you about the reasons they never told their father\nSome women said I'm afraid to tell my father because I I Know he would kill the men who attacked me and I'm worried he would go to jail\nSome women said I've never seen my father cry and I know that if I told him this

about what it means to be a good dad\nI've gotten a lot of emails from men who say\nI always told my daughter if anyone tries to hurt you own murder them and now I'm rethinking was that the right message to send\nBecause what if that kept her silence because she didn't want me to go to jail for for murdering someone um so I think that these are conversations that have just been happening in secret for really long time\nAnd good men are trying to figure out how to be a part of those conversations and how to be a comfort in them\nAs part of your argument also but it's important for
