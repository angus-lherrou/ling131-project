much of the country music industry now her songs are being played on pop radio and\nShe'd have this broader audience I feel like it may have trapped her a little bit in the way that because she still has this country than she did still want you to appeal to them\nBut I think she probably didn't feel more free overalls to share opinions\nYou know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated
