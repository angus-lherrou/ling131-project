from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin broadcasting today from member station W H y y in Philadelphia\nWe're here because we wanted to spend some time talking about the mid term elections which are just a few days away\nBut we're going to begin our program with news of another horrific mass shooting this time at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania eleven people died and it left at least six were injured\nIncluding for police officers of public safety official in the city describe the synagogue as and horrific crime scene\nThe alleged gunman a man named Robert Bowers was taken into custody reporter Kathleen Davis of member station W E essay is covering this tragedy and she is with us now Kathleen thank you so much for talking to us what do we know about the identity of the victims so far we do know the police officers were among the wounded\nSure so as victims of the ones who have unfortunately died I have not been identified so far there is a press conference tomorrow morning at nine at eastern time where a an official from the coroner's office is expected to speak so we're expecting that there will be a\nLittle bit more information about um the the victims here at but as you said or six people\nAnd have a or were injured in in the shooting four of them police officers and ah they were all taken to hospitals and two of them are are said to be in critical condition but the other for a seem to be doing OK\nAnd can you tell us any more about the alleged gunman Robert Bauer as I understand he was taken into custody alive\nYeah so I'm not a whole lot is being said about power as a officials did say today that\nAlive yes so I'm not a whole lot is being said about Bauer as a officials did say today that they are investigating this crime or as a hate crime and so it falls under the jurisdiction of the FBI and that besides that we don't know a whole lot about him\nCan you tell us any more about what type of weapon or weapons were used and how long it took to subdue him\nSure so at the scene there were three handguns in one assault rifle recovered or officials said they they weren't sure if all of those were used in the shooting but they they were recovered the scene and the whole uh the whole situation seems to have lasted about twenty minutes\nOr hours entered the synagogue and uh that is where are\nThe the shooting happened and then a officials say he walked out of the synagogue and was engaged by a police officer and uh there was a bit of a a ... a shooting exchange there and then ... went back into the synagogue and uh they eventually recovered him\nAnd and before we conclusion here can you tell us whether there were any security guards posted on the reason I mentioned that is that President Trump rejected the notion that this had anything to do with gun laws he said that if the synagogue had an armed guard inside the gunman could have been stopped sooner and I just wanted to ask you about that\nIn Afghanistan

Philadelphia we are of course following the shooting at the synagogue and Pittsburgh today\nWe will have more later in the program but first let me tell you why we're in Philadelphia you may have hurt other colleagues from NPR on the road this week like them we spent the week traveling\nAnd talking with people about the mid term elections just ten days away now visiting pivotal states and counties we decided to come here because Pennsylvania the Keystone State went for President Trump and two thousand sixteen breaking a winning streak for Democrats that stretch back to Nineteen eighty eight\nAnd Pennsylvania was supposed to be part of the blue wall from Pennsylvania to Michigan to Wisconsin the Democrats thought would secure the White House for them and uh all of those states went for Trump on election night\nNow though Democrats are banking on a comeback here in Pennsylvania in their quest to retake the house so we've been talking with candidates business owners students working folk people we found because they are really into politics and people who are really not\nAnd we've been asking all of them what's and they're on what's on their minds this election year and help us understand what we've been hearing we asked WHYY is Dave Davies to join us he's covered politics in this region for more than Thirty years and he's with us now and thank you so much for hosting us and\nThanks to all the people who offered us pumpkin bread and cookies insider which we were not expecting so thank you for that is great to have you all so nationally they've Democrats need to take back twenty four seats to win the house and Allen Say they could pick up a quarter of those seats give or take in Pennsylvania and a lot of that has to do\nWith a new congressional map here in the state can you just tell us how that came about and what that has meant to this election\nThis is a seismic shift in the Baltics over the state I mean for the last six years pencil then you'd have had ...\nAbout and what that has meant to this election\nYeah this is a seismic shift in the politics of this state I mean for the last six years Pennsylvania ... have had congressional maps that were pretty bizarrely shape and generally acknowledge to be a gerrymandered if even favor Republicans we have eight hundred thousand more registered Democrats than Republicans in Pennsylvania Democrats have only one five of Eighteen seats\nThis was challenged last year in a lawsuit that was aimed not at federal court where some of these gerrymandering suits have stalled but at a state court\nIn Pennsylvania the state Supreme Court five of them elected Democrats not only ruled the map a a an unconstitutional gerrymandered and ordered new districts but said it had to happen immediately for this election and it created some confusion and controversy but it really opened up opportunities for Democrats\nAre they're big themes playing out in congressional races across the state and I asked because we've been watching the ads all week and I get the sense that both major parties are trying to push specific themes in these racist so do you see that\nSure sure I mean for the Democrats they're telling people that Republicans are tools of corporations and and the wealthy who will strip away protections for people with preexisting medical conditions are up the Democrats or Republicans are catching the Democrats as friends of Nancy Pelosi they can't say that name off\nWho will spending recklessly raise your taxes and a lot of it is you know Michelle just character assassination if you have ever missed the tax bill if you have done or said anything controversial it will be exaggerated an amplified on television and hopes to to undermine you\nWell one of the races that we've been focusing on this week is the first district in Pennsylvania it has attracted an enormous amount of national attention it's drawn huge amounts of money\nIt's been one of the most expensive campaigns in the country and a lot of that has to do with the fact that it's one of the twenty three districts that went for Hillary Clinton it two thousand sixteen but was also carried by a Republican congressman in this case Brian Fitzpatrick he is\nThe fact that it's one of the twenty three districts that went for Hillary Clinton it two thousand sixteen but what's also carried by a Republican congressman in this case Brian Fitzpatrick he's being challenged by a millionaire philanthropists named Scott Wallace was never run for office before and he's poured millions of dollars up his own money into his campaign and I asked him why\nBecause it's an extraordinary you're not just the policies that are being twisted around and and turned toward the one percent on the corporations\nAnd away from the Ninety nine percent but just the moral tone of our country I've got three kids are going to raise a kid and the atmosphere of this influence coming from the White House it's destructive of the fabric of our moral core in America\nAnd destructive of democracy the assault on the media the assaults on the courts and the rule of law on the FBI on our intelligence agencies on the very notion of truth itself\nIs under assault and I've never encountered at a time like this and I just couldn't sit on the sidelines anymore\nWhen do you think the campaign here hinges upon it you know I was watching a lot of the ads last night and\nAll very negative [laughter] so what do you think is the lynchpin of it\nThe ... on a specific level the big issues here our health care and clean air and clean water we have local issues with water pollution from a military base and air pollution but the overarching issue\nThat ties all of us together is money in politics\nMy opponent has taken a million dollars in corporate pac money I refuse to take a dime\nHe's got seven and a half million dollars in superPAC contributions a huge amount of corporate money in this\nAnd I think people are fed up with that because that's what is blocking the people's business from getting done and you think people are noticing that when I explain this is why you're not getting clean air and clean water\nFrom getting done and you think people are noticing that when I explain this is why you're not getting clean air and clean water when you want reform of Wall Street predatory lending when you want gun control the ... amount of money that flows in from the big corporate special interests\nStops every single thing that the people want you know frankly the situation with money in politics is outrageous\nThe amount of money it takes to run in the district like this in a suburban district done are expensive media market like Philadelphia is ridiculous nobody can raise Fifteen million dollars without going to the corporations and begging them and of course their money comes with expectations comes with strings attached\nAnd so that tells the candidate boats\nSo yes I Am blessed to be able to do some self funding here I don't know how anybody could unless they take corporate money so we have to fix that system you know the largest voting bloc in America that understands this problem is the people who don't vote at all\nThey are not crazy when they think that their vote their voices going to be drowned out by the voice of the big special interests how big a factor as President Trump in your campaign\nIs he's huge I mean I I don't bring him up when I go door to door but people blurt out that they want change they cannot stand the tone coming from Washington even Republicans not that they want to throw him overboard but they just\nHate the tone still he's not on the ballot but is he on the ballot in a\nWay I mean do you see your campaign in a way or this election as in uh in part a referendum\nOn Donald Trump it is becoming that and largely through his own urging he goes around the country is saying a vote for blank is a vote for me he is saying this is essentially a presidential election and of course in ...\nHe goes around the country singer vote for a blank vote for me he is saying this is essentially a presidential election and of course interest is much higher in the presidential election and the reality is this is the first chance to voters in this district in everywhere in the country have to express their feelings about what they're seeing\nAnd the last thing I think anybody wants to see is ... doing a victory lap around the rose garden on November seventh\nSo let me see babies let me ask you about both of the things have got lost just brought up first of all the money going into the race tell me more about that well Scott\nWallace has put at least eight million dollars of his own family fortune into the race probably more when the final tallies come in about eleven million dollars has gone into the race from outside superPACs most of that Republican superPACs to help it's Patrick does he doesn't have the family money and all of it for most of it\nAnd what about the Trump factor we talked about that is is is that the president a factor in this race across the state\nIt's fascinating yeah I mean when I talk to voters and ask them what are they thinking about they might mention jobs or taxes but pretty soon you get down to some version of I think the other side in this country has gone nuts and they have to be stopped and that really is about Trump\nOr the feeling that the Trump has to be stopped or that those who oppose him have to stop I think it really is what's it's the most motivating thing I see\nSo as we said Democrat Scott Wallace is challenging the incumbent Republican Brian Fitzpatrick fitzpatrick is the former FBI agent the only form of FBI agent currently serving in the house but he's also been a vocal critic of President Trump on certain issues such as the way the president has handled the investigation into Russian interference in the two thousand

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania the FBI is on the ground there hoping to investigate the tragedy authorities are treating it as a hate crime NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here with us now to tell us\nThe FBI is on the ground there helping to investigate the tragedy authorities are treating it as a hate crime NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here with us now to tell us more hello Brian Hi there first of all what can you tell us about the gunman at this point\nUh well we don't know a whole lot about 'em at this point he's been identified a as Robert Bowers of Pittsburgh resident in terms of how this investigation is going to look the special agent in charge of the FBI field office in Pittsburgh a man by the name of Bob Jones laid out a bit of that today a here's what he had to say about how this is going to move forward\nAnd over the next several days and weeks we will look at everything in his suspects life is home his vehicle is social media and his movements over the last several days\nUh Jones says officers recovered an assault rifle and three hand guns at the scene a when a agents are going to search is home they say that they'll take precautions in case there might be any sort of explosive devices there\nHe says the FBI does not believe at this point that the suspect had any accomplices or he was not known to law enforcement for today says uh and he also says that the suspects full motive at this point is unknown but then of course is something that the FBI is going to work to find out\nWhat the president has called this an anti Semitic act and authorities say that they are looking at this as a hate crime investigation what does that mean and what does that tell us\nWell first off yes attorney general Jeff Sessions has said in a statement that the Justice Department will file a hate crime or hate crimes and other criminal charges or in this case he says that there is no place for hatred and violence on the base of basis of religion\nOr the U.S attorney for the western district to Pennsylvania Scott Brady he says that prosecutors could file those charges as early as this evening but we're gonna have to wait and see what all those sort of charges are going to entail\nAnd can you tell us a bit more about what hate crime charges would mean\nRight in in some cases a federal hate crime charges would bring a stiffer sentence or to take into account\nCould you tell us a bit more about what hate crime charges would mean\nRight and in some cases a federal hate crime charges would bring a stiffer sentence or to take into account that particular nature of of the crime in a case like this a a former federal prosecutor tells me that it's likely wouldn't change that much\nBecause this sort of crime with eleven people killed uh the the sentence is likely to be significant anyways but federal hate crimes could bring into play a possibly the death penalty Pennsylvania does have a state death penalty although it hasn't been used in in quite some time\nBut treating this shooting and prosecuting it as a federal hate crime does send a message of the seriousness of the crime and that the federal government treats it is such a you'll recall of course the case of Dylann Roof\nOf who was convicted in the killing of nine black parishioners at a church in Charleston South Carolina the federal government in that case brought hate crime charges against him even though he was already facing state charges and ultimately a federal jury convicted him a and he uh he was sentenced to death\nAnd just as recently as you can to the degree that you know what happens next\nWell the FBI is just getting to work on this there's a large crime scene that will have to go through a half to collect evidence there\nAre there's lab work to be done and then of course there's digging into the or the alleged shooter's social media history there already accounts reportedly linked to him that appear to show a fair amount of anti Semitic sentiments a and the alleged shooter in this case is of course alive in custody so possibly uh looking to question him\nThat is NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas Ryan thank you so much for talking to us thank you\nAnd once again we are broadcasting today from W H y y in Philadelphia that is where we were when we got the terrible news of the shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh this morning\nAnd this week when two people were killed in Kentucky apparently because of their race and pipe bombs were sent to a prominent figures apparently because of their political views but even before those awful events\nHe apparently because of their race and pipe bombs were sent to a prominent figures apparently because of their political views but even before those awful events we were hearing people across Pennsylvania tell us they are frustrated with the tone of this country's public discourse the lack of civility they told us they hope for more unity\nAnd that is a message that might have special residents in Gettysburg the site of an epic civil war battle in Eighteen sixty three one of the country's bloody is we're more than fifty thousand Americans were injured or killed over the course of three days but now in two thousand Eighteen a group of residents there had been meeting up in a historic church to practice what others preach\nBringing people of different political views together it's called politics fats and stability Democrat car Thompson a former college professor founded the group and twenty Seventeen Darcy Meyer also a Democrat joined a group through her friendship with Tom sent and Republican Chad collie is also a member and he told me why he got involved\nIn twenty sixteen in previous years before that was very politically involved was vice chairman of the Republican Party here locally\nDuring the twenty sixth in campaign a saw a lot of instability a lot of anger a lot of resentment and saw that coming to boiling point in many ways\nAnd uh it encouraged me to stop and think about what was going on in the nation and so I resigned from that and made a vow to myself to get more involved in the community and talking to people who were on the other side of the aisle\nIt sounds to me like this was something that was in you like I Need that you had I it's interesting that there are a number of\nNational political figures who've been calling for something like this layer John Case in Ohio or maybe Joe Biden you could do the same argument ... former governor of Pennsylvania for sixty of homeland security but you it sounds like that was something that was kind of in you and it was\nTom Ridge venue former governor of Pennsylvania from suggest homeland security but you it sounds like that was something that was kind of in you and it was and thankfully current came up with a structure for that ... what about you is this something that was kind of a hunger within you and now no one really\nI um I have always been pretty staunch Democrat I that's where I live pretty much come down on on the left on most things call myself a progressive I never really thought about how important it was to bridge the divide until I got involved I think that\nRealizing that that there is valid points to be made on both sides and that there is a balance that we can find is has just been a real eye opening experience for me\nWhat did you envision when you started this group like what were you hoping to accomplish\nI was hoping that we could come to understand each other more\nAnd I I'm very convinced as Darcy just said\nThat there are valid points on all sides like Darcy I I'm a very blue blue odor but I think that the red voters have valid points that it will enrich all of us if we can listen to to each other it's sort of like the\nStory of the blind men and the the elephant\nWhich um I don't know if you're familiar with Philip ... book expert political judgment in which he actually test the theory that the more you investigate various points of view\nThe more likely you are to be correct in predicting what will happen in the future for example\nSo Darcy not that you were saying I don't want to talk to those people\nIn predicting what will happen in the future for example so Darcy not that you were saying I don't want to talk to those people meeting ... but um [laughter] what you were not as I'm hungry for this experience as others were what made you finally decided to come well it were really", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "city": "Grand Canyon", "day": "28"}
