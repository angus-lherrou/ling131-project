Peter Kenyon joins me now from Istanbul Hi Peter I'm Mary Louise what details do we have from the Saudi announcement\nVery few details of the Saudi press agency is saying Eighteen people have been

consulate here in Istanbul on October ... seconds\nAnd according to the Saudi press agency after he entered the consulate there was a fight to dispute that broke out and that led to his death we we don't know any more details on that right now\n[noise] study TV is reporting you mentioned Eighteen Saudi nationals arrested and among them they also mentioned a general and a royal court advisor who have been sacked from their positions do we know who these people are are any details about them\nWell a major general Ahmed Asiri was first mentioned uh to my knowledge in a New York times report

this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly in Washington and I melted Chang in Phoenix, Arizona President Trump is campaigning here tonight Arizona is a state where the G O P dominates politics right now both US Senators the governor most state lawmakers they're all Republican\nBut that could change because waves of Latinos will become eligible to vote in the coming years and they tend to vote democratic which means Arizona could flip from red to blue\nUnless the Republican Party can win over the growing number of Latino voters in this state\nAnd to get a sense of that challenge I traveled to a town just west of Phoenix called policy it's about eighty percent Latino [noise]\n\nI'm In a restaurant serving port those out got as and tacos and I bumped into a guy who could give the Republican somehow\nThe way we handle our home especially in Hispanic community is the way Trump wants to run the U.S [noise]\nRamon bearing owns a small business repairing floors he's a registered Republican and he says he appreciates the values Trump stand for\nSecurity order you know you need certain order and in your home you know the issues that came with the wall\nYou know building a wall it is a good idea because I just installed not even two weeks or boys security door on my door I already have a door but I Would have better door if you're a ... year old son he's fourteen years old and it's funny that he told me somehow the door and makes me feel safer\nIt made me think you know that you know it does make sense more more metal their keeps\nThe worst people out\nYou know that you know it doesn't make sense more more metal their keeps\nThe wars people out you know\nStep outside and within seconds you'll run into people who beat him mainly just agree with their and like evil Hernandez a truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker the reason most Latinos will never vote Republican\nYou heard of the news they're coming up with all these laws that make it more difficult for people for any country in the world to a ... status you've seen the kid's been separated from the families of the water I think all that reflects pretty bad on the Republican Party you ask me I mean who's ordering all that you know Trump and his agenda\nThere is reason Hernandez has view may not be worrying Republicans right now\nRepublicans are banking on two things\nJuices Garcia hits the Latino public policy center at Arizona State university\nAre banking on that there's enough white voters to win the election today and their banking that there's going to be short memory for Latino voters tomorrow\nBut Garcia says data don't lie Latinos will turn Arizona majority minority by twenty thirty and a whole lot of them are going to be us citizens\nTwenty Eighteen could be the last election that Republicans can win without also winning the Latino vote\nSo the question for Republicans is how will they persuade those Latino voters to join Thirteen\nI'm not a baseball diamond in a small park in northern speed and the district state representative Tony Rivera has any of your friends or or any other members of the Latino community giving you a hard time for becoming a Republican\nI'm people have given me a hard time like what what do they say well they'll say um how could you be a Republican and when the Republicans don't support\nPeople have given me a hard time like what what did they say well they'll say um how could you be a Republican and when the Republicans don't support\nHispanics they don't support immigration reform\nAnd it's just wants to them is take a look at all of the other values of the Republican Party he mesh perfectly with Latinos face the traditional family small business entrepreneurship\nIt's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district as the knock on doors [noise]\nI'm only going to take two minutes of the time I was telling you there on the Republican running for realize I'm I'm here to answer any questions they may have topics including our budget education immigration is a hot topic\nOf the show that people focus too much on the people coming from Mexicali\nSeparating families isn't the way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nWhen they know I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised in Florida and the parents are from Mexico\nAnd um this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country of an opportunity and I know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans of smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask ... if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security\nOne that legalize as the people who are here who want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThis sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration pushing I'm\nA I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is\nBut ... I'm\nA I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is what I just mentioned\nThat independence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate like you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI asked to see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the ... election Doug do see on the ballot and its Doug ... agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters\nA guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry it was the as you approach do see for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor has done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support certain language doesn't support certain policies that the national Republican mood and may may call for he is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them we need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that no I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juice\nIf Republicans want to appeal hardy why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party and the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez\nTrump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way he does\nThey see what's going on they see how they treat us and\nSo my kids you got to vote you got to vote you got ... votes and they said that we were ready to go over there over\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be field for generations to come\nAs a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republicans to separate themselves from the broader party\nGovernor juicy will be appearing on stage at a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight with President Trump [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nNew is shouting ties we take a closer look there's the kingdom faces scrutiny over the alleged murder of ... was President Trump pitch the campaign trail and us mercenaries\nBut all indications from the administration or that they really do not want to break with the Saudis they're not ready to take on a the crown prince Mohammed bin so I'm On a because they seem to see him as an ally and Trump is suggested that he is a personal ow\nOw so it is not down only to the president Congress has a role in this as President Trump has pointed out with Senator Lindsey Graham has weighed in Republican Senator Graham has weighed in tonight saying he's very skeptical of the Saudi version of events Brea is you know there's been a drumbeat for sanctions there's been a drumbeat from Congress about taking a tougher line\nAre you watching for that drew me to get louder\n[noise] yeah I mean that honest thing remains to be seen I think ultimately though that this incident doesn't necessarily mean that we should reorient our entire Middle East strategy\nI mean at the end of the day we have to remember that ... is not just a columnist for the Washington Post but he was also a personal friend of us I'm a bin Laden and was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\nTo remember that ... is not just a columnist for the Washington Post but he was also a personal friend of some uh bin Laden and was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood does as an individual you know we have to take all of that into account and I also think that when you are dealing with who was ...\nAs a journalist for the Washington Post and who was a U.S resident into it now appears was murdered ...\nI and of course we do have an interest in making sure that us permanent residents are protected as well that's something that we're interested in doing\nUm when you are talking about the middle east we are talking about a lot of bad actors here I mean if we don't if we're not willing to work with Saudi Arabia\nThe other options are not so great either right we have turkey which tells the highest number of journalists anywhere in the world we have\nIran we have a number of uh other countries that committed human rights atrocity is just on the regular so I think that we just really need to get all of our ducks in a row and we need to you know maybe not necessarily change in one fell swoop our entire Middle East strategy over this\nQuota wind it really disturbing to go back to his youth this person who has been a as close and the broader sense of the word liberal in terms of\nDemanding greater freedom in the middle east to go back to his youth and tore him as\nA young member of the Muslim Brotherhood I think this is this is a form of propaganda ... that can be is being used to justify a softer line here people should read his final piece for the Washington Post\nWhich was really powerful call for freedom in the Arab world that was really a red white and blue short of column and that's who he has been and that is the man who was killed\nLet me ask you both to set aside for the moment questions about the weather has passed is relevant has passed before he became a journalist and came to the U. S. and focus on this question of does this represent a diplomatic crisis\nWeather has passed is relevant has passed before he became a journalist and came to the U. S. and focus on this question of does this represent a diplomatic crisis for the United states with Saudi Arabia which has been a strong ally for generations\nFree I think that Saudi Arabia is aware that they really matched up here um you know they've arrested I think it was Fifteen people in the last hour they announce that they've recidivism dismissed five others so\nI have to change it said a statement from Saturday state TV\nYeah so I think it's clear that they're taking it seriously and they should be taking this seriously um I think that they definitely need to you know rethink what they're doing and the way that they are going to treat American permanent residents that are living in their country [noise]\nEJ I'm lost tortillas thoughts on the where this leaves the U.S Saudi relationship going forward\nI think the relationship is in crisis I think the comments from some of the Republicans in Congress\nOr suggest that as well as a Democrat and I think it's fundamentally put to bed this notion that mom had been some some on NBS as he is known the crown prince is in an hour or ... or former ah I think this has really brought home the sides of his regime\nOr that or repressive his image will never be the same as it was a when he started out and was getting a lot of remarkably good press and that this is a big problem for him going forward\n[noise] lots of

the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to\nTodd really looked at reading and sharing stories as a doorway to forming relationships

reading\nTell me about some of the places where these libraries now our tuition to the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has been either
