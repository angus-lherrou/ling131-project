Chang and I'm Ari Shapiro with one week's ago before the midterm elections President Trump is floating a new tactic in his immigration crackdown\nThe president says he wants to end the automatic right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S birthright citizenship is protected by the fourteenth amendment to the constitution in an interview with X. CEOs Trump insisted he can change that\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nThe full interview airs this weekend on Axios on HBO joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose has all hey our first just fact check for us can the president do this most constitutional\nScholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually the Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because right now here's what the fourteenth amendment says quote\nAll persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states\nIs that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been reading the fourteenth amendment wrong for over a century\nAnd the children were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship they argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\n[noise] I Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community tell us what people are saying well Republican\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot and birthright citizenship within ...\nWell Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order\nMost legal scholars say the Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nI think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on for a long time I mean I've been aiding looks like it's more than a decade and now they got a president in office who apparently as fixated on this as\nWell if President Trump does follow through on this proposal there would certainly be legal challenges and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House's critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections or is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final days\nWhile the president has definitely been talking a lot about immigration at his campaign rallies or just yesterday the department of defense announced that its sending about five thousand troops to the southwest border to support immigration authorities that is in response to the migrant caravan of people fleeing from violence in Central America that is slowly making its

Democrats Doug Jones is now senator Doug Jones because of black women they turned out and helped eke out a win for the Democrats during the Alabama special election late last year\nSo if black women don't vote if they decided to just stay home next Tuesday that's a real problem for the Democratic party our co host Audie Cornish has more on the effort to get and keep black women energized\nWe recently visited a voter meeting organized by higher heights that's a political action group focused on black women voters and candidates\nAnd more than a hundred of these living room meetings were happening that night across the country do you go around and he hit the women around the circle here in Washington DC included schoolteachers political organizers and healthcare analysts are sipping wine munching on tacos ... rating about politics\nThey actually did not know each other very well once they got settled then they found they had a lot in common first they shared a sense of exhaustion marches and fuzzy hats that followed the presidential election I think that the threat was\nBy the women's march hat [laughter]\nThis is Michelle ... she works and communications white women were divided in twenty sixteen although they did in favor of Donald Trump\nSo white women activism post twenty sixteen too little too late in ... opinion now in twenty eight team it's time for the midterms ... believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that were prop up democratic candidates I think our votes\nTerms ... believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that were prop up democratic candidates\nI think our vote has been taken for granted\nUm and I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past\nEspecially with um everything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama was was black women who delivered that W that gay and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's broke us on people of color in twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote\nAnd what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty to Michelle nearly it's underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters\nWhat is it ... it can be a turning away from family we show what is\nWhat is it\nWhy why do\nWe know\nAnd that list of issues important for black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including Libya Berkes brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice\nEvery election cycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to I\nThink their chances of being real and black woman had a choice we have a stronger voice this would actually be an urgent issue and that's what it's actually missing urgency there's nothing I'm Jewish I\nWilliams added racial profiling by law enforcement as well like I get up religious in the middle of it because I was in the ... and the other police officers say something life\nWe're getting a religious in the middle of this because I was in the ... and the other police officers say something life he fits the profile\nMy dad he sticks to my brother's ...\nAll star game\nWe use slid bills every man in the ...\nBut these women also talked about education and like many other voters the cost of health care more than anything ... resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and then and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all the your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman properly right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this boat or block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in um Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort\nAnd this moment we saw major wins in um Alabama and in Virginia African American women lead the effort to um you know make sure that we won both of those races and so black women have decided that\nYou know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party while we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite and so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat\nI'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at ...\nOne can you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle with a on a Presley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus is on packed\nWith the CBC the island is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire walls there are several organizations that are not a CBC or directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions on who to back and not to back\nBut I on a is a very smart brilliant black woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all around the country\nThis is a new day there's the old way doesn't work anymore and we're going to see more and more of that [noise]\nCalifornia congresswoman Barbara Lee thank you for speaking with us thank you\nPressley herself no major opposition and her Massachusetts district actually set to become

the debates that's been playing out over ... over the last year has been some white supremacists believe that they should present a clean cut image and other white supremacy were saying the only way to get the job done is to do violent acts in public as a way to get media attention\nCan you describe how gab became a home in the first place for white supremacist views\nYes in the lead up to the election of twenty sixteen ... the CEO of gab was looking for users for his platform and he saw that in the burgeoning maggot coalition\nThat there was a question of free speech on line and who's content was going to be able to stay on line and so he actively started recruiting people that were part of alternative media networks\nAfter the election and in the wake of the unite the Right rally tour but again when on a media spree asking for users and explicitly tied this then to\nThe white supremacists organizing and the no plot forming of white supremacists in the aftermath of the violence of the unite the Right rally this third moment where ...\nWas actively recruiting users had to do with Twitter purging white supremacists and removing the blue check Mart from white supremacists on their platform and in each of these instances tour bus was recruiting white people by saying that there's anti white racism that persists on other social platforms\nAnd that you wouldn't suffer\nThe same kind of moderation on his platform if you were to post pro white statements\nI Want to play a piece of tape for you or NPR reporter Jasmine guards interviewed God's CEO Andrew tour but about ...

answered the bad or a beach or he wanted to find that is more speech and always will be\nWhat do you make of his response that gap should just be this free for all yeah I disagree because ultimately the counterpoint that he would hope would be present on gab isn't there and so what users tend to do when platforms get filled\nWith troll cereal harasser as\nPeople generally opt out not many people go on line to\nDefend against these kinds of post that gets served through gab and there is no counterpoint that says this is heinous\nGab is down as we said for now Web hosting companies payment

Shapiro President Trump says he wants to force China to stop abusive trade practices by\nSlapping tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese imports one problem is that the value of China's currency has been dropping this year which is undercutting the tariffs impact NPR's Jim Zarroli explains\nPresident Trump of course likes to boast about the strong US Economy and all the good things it means for the United states\nWe are the economic envy of the entire world when I meet the leaders of countries the first thing they say invariably is this the president so nice to meet you congratulations on your economy\nBut this is only economy also means something else the U.S dollar just keeps getting stronger it's up against the euro the end the peso just about every major currency here is David dollar yes that is his name who was economic emissary to China and the Obama Treasury Department\nThis is actually a worldwide phenomenon the dollar is up about seven or eight percent on average against all our trading partners\nAnd the dollar is really gaining ground against China's you on a dollar would have gotten you six point to you on in late march today it gets you nearly seven it's the lowest it's been in a decade\nA dollar would have gotten use six point to you on in late march today it gets you nearly seven it's the lowest it's been in a decade Linda Lim an economist at the University of Michigan says the dropping the yuan raises questions\nWhen the un fall if it's because people are selling it and buying dollar right and so the question is why they selling it and buying dollars\nAnd Lim says there are several answers for one thing the fed is raising interest rates which makes us investments like treasury debt more lucrative so people want to buy more us assets and to do that they need dollars dollars are in demand meanwhile China's economy is slowing and so its currency is weaker\nThe strong dollar means that Americans can buy more from overseas especially from China and they are says David dollar\nSo you actually see the U.S trade deficit rising very rapidly this year trade deficits up about ten percent year on year\nThe strong dollar also has an impact on President Trump's trade agenda the president placed tariffs on Chinese goods to make the more expensive so Americans wouldn't buy as many it was a way of putting pressure on the Chinese economy but the stronger dollar then makes them cheaper says Linda Lim\nThe terrorists I'll watch will increase the costs of Chinese goods in the U.S that we couldn't ... well partly counteracted\nTrump is so far imposed tariffs of ten percent on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports but the yuan has fallen that much since the spring which blunt their impact Lim says the following you on may also have another impact\nForeign companies that have been thinking about investing in China will now find a cheaper to do so\nIs now a cheaper for U.S companies to invest in China you know for Tesla to buy land and bill apply\nNow a cheaper for U.S companies to invest in China you know for Tesla to buy land and little pond\nTrump has promised to raise tariffs even more after the new year they're set to rise to twenty five percent and if he does that China is more likely to feel an impact but for now China's falling currency is helping it absorb the blows from Trump's trade policy Jim Zarroli NPR News New York\nChina's government is piloting something known as the social credit system like the credit scoring system we have in the U.S China scores use financial information\nBut China system also considers information like when you buy and how you treat your neighbors if you fail to pay your debt you might find yourself on a sort of blacklist\nStacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia from the indicator podcast bring us this story about life on China's list of ... trustworthy people\nLoved one is forty two he lives in ... province in China in one day he went on line to book a high speed train ticket to Beijing you put down his name and payment but right away this page popped up saying he could not complete the purchase\nOf it on on on these days than this person is on the uh untrustworthy list from the court\nLoud one was confused why couldn't he book this dream ticket he started looking into the situation and he quickly realized why this was happening loved one had landed himself on something known as the blacklist\nDo one thing that comes along with the black lists the unpleasant words they live on that uh you're fired from high end consumption which means that you can't take a speed train you can fly China started the black with about five years ago\nWhich means that you can't take a speed train you can fly\nChina started to block with about five years ago as a way to infuse more trust in banking and financial system and part of this has involved cracking down on debtors creating consequences for people who did not pay back their loans\nLoud one ended up on the blacklist because he was working in the coal industry that was his business he would take out loans by huge amounts of coal and store them but then one day the Chinese government changed its energy policy and the market for coal just collapsed\nSuddenly all the coal loud one had wasn't worth anywhere near when it had been and he had all these loans he couldn't pay back\nAnd the Chinese court ruled loud one would go on the blacklist\nAnd soon after when loud one went to his bank he found out that all of his account and credit cards had been frozen and one morning when loud one was driving through the center of town you discovered another aspect of being on the on trustworthy list on one of the electronic billboards by the side of the road was his face like up on a big building\nAnother more than ... electric ... by the side of the plaza there are like huge grants and they're very eye catching you can't really say them from afar and I saw my my pictures on that screen it's like a picture of on my ID card and my ID card number and my name\nThe billboard said this man is on trustworthy loud one says these billboards are all over town she says whenever he went\nOut whenever he to the billboard she would just stop and kind of watch it for awhile scrolling through the untrustworthy waiting to see his face would come up but one day when he was doing that you saw the face of someone he knew\nOr on a ... oh my God this or anything we should be working in a semi industry as I did all know about their\nOne started to notice a bunch of his former colleagues from the ...\nIn a semi industry as I did all know up their\nLoved ones started to notice a bunch of his former colleagues from the coal industry were also on the blacklist you started calling them saying hey I'm On the list to she started getting people together meeting up for dinner he says these are the only people that he can really be relaxed around\nAbout what was actually a friday the widespread attitude toward the U.S is very resistant people will think why are you you're being happy why do you still have time to be happy or why do you not to go out and make money to pay back\nYour loan so far loud blonde says you've paid back about three hundred thousand of the one and a half million dollars that he originally owed\nSo still about one point two million to go but you didn't win loud one does manage to pay off his debts getting off the blacklist could be hard we talked to ... and trying to deal with this by all accounts getting off the blacklist even if you've paid your debt\nWell it's technically possible but it just never seems to happen we reached out to China's Supreme Court about this issue but they didn't respond to requests for comment loud one says she will keep paying off is that she has to believe there's a way off this list Cardiff Garcia Stacey Vanek Smith NPR News\nSupport for Planet Money comes from transfer wives a service that helps
