P. five hundred\nA rising interest rates make stocks less valuable and there's concern in the market about just how high rates will go\nThe Federal Reserve has said it will continue to raise rates

learn more about tourism in Egypt for example it was again sort of a broad based initiative but she and that was her undertaking this awkward\nBecause her husband is known for his America First agenda for wanting to slash foreign aid in their shoes on a trip highlighting all the good the American foreign aid that awkward\nIt's that strange sort of juxtaposition between the first lady and what she

they can come home anytime they want but if they dock and\nCome home than they are basically abandoning ship the space station would be empty and it's a big enough and complicated enough ship that after a little wild things start to go wrong and there'd be nobody there to fix them so it really causes a lot of risk for the space station to leave it on man\nSo people will be looking really hard

fetus cells that detect blue light up here first\nI saw a chance to try something much more ambitious\nWe discuss this crazy idea of could we use the human Redmond, Oregon annoyed to study how we get the different colors sensing cells in our eyes\nJohnston says using human cells was key because you can't study human color vision and a fly or even a mouse\nMice don't fence read they don't have these red detecting cells and so\nWe really have to study this in developing human tissue to get any insight into how it works\nJohnston ... knew that in a human fetus cells that detect blue light up here first income cells that respond to red and green light and research on animals suggested that fly ride hormone was involved in the development of these ... so called home so he had Eldridge do an experiment\nI added thyroid harm onto that dish during their development and we got more red green ... developing and organize and so we got really excited\nIt would take years and many more experiments to confirm that thigh right hormone was actually triggering the emergence of color vision and the teams still hasn't figured out what causes some cones to go on to become even more specialized by detecting only read or only green but Johnson says his lab is ready to take on two new goal\nWanted to restore color vision to people that are color blind but perhaps just as important there is a disorder called macular degeneration that is the leading cause of vision loss\nMacular degeneration affects the macular an area of the retina that provides high resolution vision\nThat condition it's been hard to steady though because mice don't have a macular so Johnson hopes to learn more by having his lab create macular Oregon writes Steven backer of the national eye Institute says studies like the one at Johns Hopkins are helping to resolve doubts about whether retinas grown in a dish can truly mimics\nBut perhaps just as important there is a disorder called macular

Institute is trying to encourage the creation of more retinal org annoyed by sponsoring a scientific competition with a million dollars in prize money\nIt's important that we understand how nature controls the development of the retina so that we can understand better why things go wrong and\nDisease and how to develop better treatments the new research appears in the journal science Jon
