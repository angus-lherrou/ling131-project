that Internet providers should not be able to slow down an app\nThat you're visiting other elements sometimes include things like zero rating which is a deal wherever I might give you streaming of Hulu that doesn't count toward your or a data restrictions but then count Netflix stored database restrictions and these are all rules that California put into place they they banned all these things\nBefore the Trump Administration repeal neutrality rules there was a really vocal campaign by activists trying to get the FCC not to take this step now that California has gone through what has the reaction been\nWell California was indeed sort of reacting to the massive liberal wave of activism and online activism that prompted\nUm the writing of these rules um you know the battle lines have been drawn for a while on the net neutrality debate and then there's still the same on the one hand you've got Internet companies especially the smaller ones like at sea or video streaming video saying that these rules are critical for them to be able to compete against the bigger companies\nOn the other side you've got the telecom providers you're Eighteen to your rise in your Comcast that

S. M. C. A. NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nPresident Trump has long railed against NAFTA calling at one of the worst trade deals ever negotiate it but in the White House Rose Garden this morning Trump's celebrated what was billed as a new and improved trade deal Trump called it a positive step for both the country and the world\nOnce approved by Congress this new deal will be the most modern up to date and balance trade agreement and the history of our country with the most advanced protections for workers ever developed\nIn signing on to the deal candidate agreed to open up bits long protected dairy market at least a little bit Trump says that means new opportunity for American dairy producers to sell their products north of the border including milk butter cheese yogurt and ice cream to name a few I Want to be very specific\nBut Canada is still expected to buy more than Ninety percent of its dairy products from Canadian suppliers former U.S agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack who now heads the dairy export council says the new deal is an improvement for American dairy farmers but not by much\nWe're looking at an incremental increase in excess were not certainly looking at a an opening why do the market but we are seeing\nSo that means new opportunity for American dairy producers to sell their products north of the border including milk butter cheese yogurt and ice cream to name a few I Want to be very specific\nBut Canada is still expected to buy more than Ninety percent of its dairy products from Canadian suppliers former U.S agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack who now heads the dairy export council says the new deal is an improvement for American dairy farmers but not by much\nWe're looking at an incremental increase in excess went out certainly looking at a an opening why do the market but we are seeing an increase\nMore importantly perhaps the agreement is designed to prevent Canadian dairy farmers from dumping surplus skim milk powder on the world market at what the us views as artificially low prices\nIn exchange for these concessions the U. S. agreed not to scrap NAFTA Arab process for resolving trade disputes even though Trump wanted to preserving that arbitration process was a top priority for Canadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau\nWhen you're trading partner is ten times your size you need rules you need a level playing field\nThe U.S and Mexico had reached a tentative trade deal more than a month ago but Canada didn't

the food chain and parts of the government that don't get as much attention like the department of commerce and the department of energy\nThe book is called the fifth risk Michael Lewis welcome back to all things considered thanks for having me in each part of the government that you look at you tell the story of what happened during the transition between election day and the inauguration\nAnd in each case the story is pretty much the same what happened\nWell what happened was before the election the Obama administration has spent the better part of a year and a thousand people's time\nCreating a especially the best course ever created on how the federal government works and what the problems are and you should these departments with the idea that the day after the election hundreds of people from the new administration would roll in and get the briefings and learn ... what the problems were and how they dealt with them\nAnd the Trump Administration just didn't show I mean across the government\nAnd in each case the story is pretty much the same what happened\nWell what happened was before the election the Obama administration has spent the better part of a year and a thousand people's time\nCreating a especially the best course ever created on how the federal government works and what the problems are and he said these departments with the idea that the day after the election hundreds of people from the new administration would roll in\nAnd get the briefings and learn ... what the problems were and how they dealt with them\nAnd the Trump Administration just didn't show I mean across the government a parking spaces were empty and\nNice little finger sandwiches that have been laid out went on eating and briefing books when an open to the point where when I roll in a few months later I'm the first person who's heard the briefing that the Trump Administration was supposed to get\nAnd when the Trump Administration ultimately did send some people or one person there was a pattern in the kinds of people who showed up well the real pattern\nWas everybody who showed up was a Trump loyalist and very few of them had any kind of qualifications for the jobs they were being sent into and the spirit with which they approach was a kind of vague hostility to the enterprise\nGive us an example of what happened when people eventually showed up at a place like the department of energy but you write about so\nDepartment of energy could just as easily be called the department of nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean they stockpile is overseen in the department of energy\nSo they're shocked there when the day after election noon shows up and they're shocked when the guy who's in charge of the nuclear weapons packs up his boxes and goes home and nobody says anything and there's nobody to replace him\nEventually kind of a month after the election that Trump people send in one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kind of lobbyists\nThe department of energy could just as easily be called the department of nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean they stockpile is overseen in the department energy\nSo they're shocked there when the day after election no one shows up and they're shocked when the guy who's in charge of the nuclear weapons packs up his boxes and goes home and nobody says anything and there's nobody to replace him\nEventually kind of a month after the election\nThat Trump people send in one guy who was a fossil fuels industry kind of a lobbyist who was they're mainly to root out any interest in the department of energy and climate change in developing alternative energies but he comes for an hour listens politely and leave\nAnd and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about ... how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then a little while later\nAn odd assortment of young people who are kind of personally connected to the trumps are friends of the Trump's sons for example start to turn up inside of the department but they the people the outgoing people generally had the impression that\nHey ... from their especially didn't any idea what they did and be weren't terribly curious to know\nWhy should it matter to most Americans if an agency that they rarely think about is run by people who either have a benign disinterest in the agency or or an active opposition to what the agency was supposed to be doing\nI mean let's take an example uh inside the department commerce there's the national weather service the national weather service has over the past few decades got extraordinarily good at predicting the weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better\nAnd it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane in tornado forecasts\nWhy should it matter to most Americans if an agency that they really think about is run by people who either have a benign disinterest in the agency or or an active opposition to what the agency is supposed to be doing\nI mean let's take an example or inside the department commerce there's the national weather service the national weather service has over the past few decades got extraordinarily good at predicting the weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better\nAnd it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane in tornado forecasts\nThe person that the Trump Administration has appointed to run this operation is the CEO of accuweather whose\nCampaign for the last couple of decades to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the American public so that accuweather can make more money doing it this is a catastrophe for anybody who is in the path\nOf dangerous weather so it matters it matters a lot who's in these places and it's a problem when the person knows nothing it's an even bigger problem and the person has an incentive to screw it up\nAt one point in his book you right there is an upside to ignorance and a downside to knowledge what is that upside to ignorance\nSo if you want to do things like eliminate investment in alternative energy to generate short term benefits for the fossil fuel industry if you want to eliminate the national weather service ability to communicate with the people to make profits rocky whether\nIt really helps not to think too much or know too much about the long term costs of what you're doing because you can just focus on the short term gains and I think\nThat's like a big theme in this administration and the way it's running the government that it's looking for lots of short term wins at the expense of the long term and assuming we all will\nIn alternative energy to generate short term benefits for the fossil fuel industry if you want to eliminate the national weather service ability to communicate with the people to make profits rocky whether\nIt really helps not to think too much or know too much about the long term costs of what you're doing because you can just focus on the short term gains and I think\nThat's like a big theme in his administration and the way it's running the government\nThat it's looking for lots of short term wins at the expense of the long term and assuming we all will just not pay very much attention to the long term and I think the deal they do with their conscious is easier to do because they just don't understand about the long term\n[noise] or these problems that a new administration would be able to easily fix after four or eight years by putting experienced professionals in these jobs\nYou know we have an interesting problem right now because in the first year the Trump Administration twenty percent of the senior civil service quit or\nSo and those are people who have made a career out of ... people who really know really know the jobs\nAnd the importance of the jobs and on top of that Trump still hasn't filled half of the top seven hundred jobs in his own government\nSo there's been a draining of expertise out of the federal government and the question is how hard would it be to put back together I don't really know the answer a harder every day\nYou ended this book in ... City Oklahoma with a woman named miss Finley and she says for the last ten years I prayed for a tornado to come and take that bar and I didn't think it would take the house to explain why you ended on that no well\nLet's explain why mistakenly wanted airborne going ah her husband killed himself in Oregon and she imagined this ...\nThe federal government and the question is how hard would it be to put back together I don't really know the answer a harder every day\nYou ended his book in ...

the destruction it wants Trump to inflict on the things that doesn't like about the government it doesn't imagine all the collateral damage he doesn't imagine the damage it will actually do and I

president held a sun dabbled press conference to talk about his new trade deals but inevitably he faced Kavanaugh questions\nAmong them given how partisan Kavanaugh's performance was last week could the president a sure the American people that Kavanaugh would deliver impartial decisions if he's confirmed to the court\nThe president never really answered the question\nWell you'll have to ask him that question but I can tell you he's been treated horribly\nMeanwhile behind the scenes at the capital of the Republican leadership was trying to limit the FBI investigation that was forced upon them

what that investigation entails remains an open question with a Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell stressing the limited nature of the investigation and President Trump saying he wants a comprehensive but short investigation\nWell all these machinations were taking place the Supreme Court opened a new term and began hearing arguments once again as in twenty sixteen the court has only eight justices back then Senate Republican leader McConnell blocked any hearing for President Obama's nominee to the court for almost a year\nBut back then Justice Anthony Kennedy a conservative
