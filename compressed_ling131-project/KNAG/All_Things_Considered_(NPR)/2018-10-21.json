California when police stopped him\nAccording to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy and then he was taser several times this Kobe later died at a hospital\nAnd it might have ended there without much public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella Kobe is Facebook's public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story and she's with us now from London Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss thank you so much for having me\nNow I have to ask do you think that race was a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this it absolutely\nWas I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds\nAnd it fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think that it has been shown that police officers are able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed I mean I think of the classic example is\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered and he went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers\nClassic example is um Dylann Roof who who murdered 'em who went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to to arrest him without harming him it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests\nFor black men in particular versus arrest for white men that there's a clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he had been described as six foot three and three hundred pounds that sort of those ... those are factual details though aren't they I mean if you were describing someone wouldn't you describe those things\nYou might not so for example do you know how tall Dylann Roof is you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as other so as deeply as Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\nIt's been reported that your brother's struggled with some mental health issues is that is that accurate\nYes that's absolutely accurate\nDo you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often just proportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police to to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that has mental health issues or a factor in this as well\nAnd I think here you see the impact of intersection out so he is at the intersection of being a person of color a black man at the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think statistics and I think I Know statistics show and kind of the police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person as a black man so I definitely think mental health has something to do with and I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who is clearly the mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who's just come in\nAbout what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who's clearly no mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who is just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the tech community has responded to this\nWhenever you have areas where ... privilege in power intersect in the United states they do tend to be bubbles and they do tend to be bubbles that aren't as connected to issues of poverty that aren't as connected issued a mental health in certain areas and connected it she says race\nIn terms of how people reacted I have been overwhelmed with ... with support and even the fact that I have the opportunity to talk about our story and tell her story is a direct result of colleagues at Facebook who thought this is an important story and who shouted by the root causes and story they needed to be told\nThat I've been to a cookie sheets the sister of naidoo oh Kobe who died earlier this month after being chased by the San Mateo county a sheriff's deputy um she's the public policy director of Africa at Facebook and we reached her in London thank you so much for talking with us and our sympathies to your family once again\nThank you so much for having me\nWe said earlier police conduct toward civilians particularly when someone dies has become a flashpoint in American Life this happened in Texas last month when an off duty police officer shot and killed an unarmed man in his own home claiming she must took it for her home and of course amplifying this is that the officer is white and the deceased man was black\nBut according to research by the Washington Post that had been at least sixty eight police killings in Texas this year alone a Texas state center is trying to address this with education he drafted a law that just gone into effect requiring that high school students in the state watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police traffic stops\nThat's just gone into effect requiring that high school students in the state watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police traffic stops\nMe\nWhy are you at all [noise]\nRice West is a state senator from Dallas who sponsored the legislation requiring the video and he is with us now senator west thank you so much for talking with us my pleasure how did you come up with this idea\nFrankly we have an over epicenters of African Americans and Latinos that end up in volatile confrontations with law enforcement don't traffic stops and I guess for land do cats do is kind of the\nTip of iceberg for me it's still end up going to steal he's an African American man who was shot by police officer in Minnesota\nYes and I wanted to see whether I could do something about it in order to\nAt least to find a baby or expectations of citizens and police officers in what's lost here\nIs that people thinking the legislation just focus on citizens will it doesn't it doesn't just focus on video a video camera sets the stage for additional course content for both the citizen and also pollution police academies\nWhat will be expected of the police officers at the academy\nWhat we've done is to find the objectives of a what we want police officers to get while they're in the academy and the fact that the length of course is a minimum of two hours the video was just a part of it's sort of a primer\nThe video that we saw that at least the video aimed at the students to text to what appeared to be two white teenage girls and they're pulled over by two African American\nSo that we saw that at least the video aimed at the students the text to what appeared to be two white teenage girls and they're pulled over by two African American police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally about Seventy nine percent of police officers are white\nUh let me just say this the purpose\nOf the video is as a primer you'll have we need to go back and makes it makes it up that's fine we can do that but the purpose is to make certain we define behavior expectations police officers and citizens and the citizens know what their rights are\nWhen you have a traffic stop if someone wants to get down and picket who was cast in the ... I can\nGive me why is that irrelevant when this very issue that used to spark your concern here is an African American man and I can encounter with a person who doesn't look like him if that's the source of the tents and why would you live with that we're\nLiving as this question it you can pick out and that's fine at because anything that I Do should be able to withstand scrutiny and if I Need to improve on that I Will but the objective was to find a mechanism by which we could establish behavior content\nFor everyone and I thought getting a driver's license was a perfect place to put the behavior expectations of citizens and make certain citizens know what their rights or I thought put it in schools and making it mandatory was a great place to put it also also driver's license courses\nDuring the Saturday for a live broadcast from a Fitzgerald Theater in Saint Paul Minnesota with the game for saw the Warren treaty Mr Gabriel ...\nLive from hip begins in twenty minutes on cayenne a you at\nSix o'clock right after we can do things that funding comes from Oak Creek small animal clinics\nThat he won the west highway eighty nine eight in Sedona adopted Janine ... staff welcoming dumped to Jennifer crest bringing knowledge and navy in ... species to the practice of great small animal clinics dot com [noise]\n\nI'm Janine hurts with these headlines President Trump today says he isn't satisfied with Saudi Arabia is response\n[noise]\nI'm Janine hurts with these headlines President Trump today says he isn't satisfied with Saudi Arabia is response to the death of journalists Jamal ...

candidate Donald Trump promised to do it as president it's been one of his most touted successes\nAnd why you've probably heard about the federalist society Israel and doing that that's the conservative legal group who's lists of potential judicial nominees has produced two Supreme Court justices another group has also played a key role and the project\nAnd that groups tactics are now raising ethical questions which I knew about the Heritage Foundation that is a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC\nThis week the New York times wrote about a secret training program being launched by the group\nTargeting recent law school graduates who had secured clerk ships for federal judges\nIn exchange for participation and they all expense paid program these clerks which you keep the training secret and sign something of a loyalty of\nNew York times reporter Adam ... wrote about this program earlier this week which the Heritage Foundation says it has now suspended after his piece was published Adam's with us now Adam thanks so much for joining us and it's good to be here so what was the stated purpose of this program how is it advertised\nTo the program was a three day kind of seminar they called it a training academy in which they would teach these potential law clerks about legal concepts seemingly tilted in a conservative direction\nBut you spoke with some legal scholars who said that this race ethical concerns what were the concerns\nWell they said there may be nothing wrong with a seminar there may even be nothing wrong with it all expenses paid seminar\nBut there was something problematic about requiring the people who attended to keep what they learn secret probably even from the judges that they were going to serve and something deeply problematic about having to make a promise\nThat whatever they learn will be used for and they're going to quote now from their materials for any purpose contrary to the mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation\nAnd just dig into that a bit like the the ethical concern here is\nThis country to the mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation\nAnd just dig into that a bit like the the ethical concern here is what do you get to the ethical specific ethical question here\nSo it it looks like in the words of some legal experts kind of indoctrination a law clerk is an employee of the federal government and the judicial system the law clerks loyalties on to run to the judicial system into their judges\nAnd not to a private organization that describes itself as a bastion of the American conservative legal movement\nSo ... it's a concern here that they were indoctrinated people into sort of placing an ideology above their commitment to do justice\nYeah that that's exactly right so it's it's probably an affirmative good things for law clerks and others to learn as much as they can about all different kinds of legal concepts including ones that come from a particular ideological direction\nBut not a good thing to promise to keep it secret and not a good thing to promise not to act in a direction different from what the Heritage Foundation wants them to act and\nSo there are all kinds of groups that exist to create fellowship among the like minded as well as to create pipelines for half of the purpose of think tanks in Washington DC is to create pipelines fraternities and sororities they all kind of create\nPipelines um Heritage Foundation has been particularly successful at this they've been particularly intentional at this\nUm creating a shadow government if you will and frightened people on the other side of the I'll do the same thing it does this represent kind of a new strategy for heritage\nI think it's a it's a next step in a program that's been very successful as you say in cultivating in identifying young conservative lawyers who condemned be placed on the bench and heritage will say\nIt's been very successful as you say in cultivating in identifying young conservative lawyers who condemned be placed on the bench\nAnd heritage will say and there'll be right about this that they're counteracting the American legal academy where the fancy law schools the professors and students are overwhelmingly liberal\nSo they're trying to counteract that but legal experts say they may have taken a step too far in trying to get into the world of law clerks who have obligations to the justice system and to judges and to not only expose them to ideas which is probably find\nBut also to make that make these pledges of secrecy and loyalty which legal experts say is\nNot fine and when his heritage say about this I Do know that when you're a piece published on online Thursday that heritage put out a statement said that they were actually suspending this program what else did they say\nThey have been very close mouthed about it a try them repeatedly before and after the article was published they said it was a private program they didn't want to see who was paying for it\nYou know their material said a generous donors were making a significant financial investment in each and every attendee they wouldn't say who their donors were they said sitting federal appeals court judges were among the faculty they wouldn't say who those judges where and when they decided to suspend the program which was supposed to happen in February\nThey just issued a brief blends statements saying they were reevaluating it\n... which suggests that perhaps they might try to reconstituted in a different form\nIt's entirely possible years
