your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent

don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans he's asked for advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is\nIt's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. T. Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day and the overall establishment of both parties\nAre certainly in both parties folks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again we're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there\nUm were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially a trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we have all the overall national landscape for future algae B. T. Q. candidates as well do you know\nYeah I mean I can tell you a you won't believe it I Know but there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what Amelia discussed which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nOf one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just want to\nDiscuss which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship

email and say I just want to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having on young people is more significant and deeper\nThan we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure gene and Amelia do as well to those young people that are falling behind us [noise] I Want to thank all three\nOf you for joining us today Dan in is is running for reelection to the state Senate

Sorry but what's your company do when it makes a mistake a recent study looked at the economics of apologies Stacey Vanek Smith host of the podcast the indicator from Planet Money spoke with Benjamin whoa he's an economics professor at Vassar about why saying sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nYou did this like really really interesting study as a way to study apologies\nThe study was partnered with over so we look we focus on the Ninety five percent of lightness all the most extreme ... mostly rides there's about five percent chance that you never come back to her again and the question is how can we repair this relationship\nAnd that's all the most extreme ... mostly rides there's about a five percent chance that you never come back to where again\nAnd the question is how can we repair this relationship how can repair said the trust between ... and its rider we tested different kinds of apologies\nAnd we found that the right kind of apology could basically increase revenues by one to two percent of the wrong kind of apology could decrease the revenues that went to two percent which we tested apologies and involved with the commitments to do better or or not what we saw was that a commitment to Ben in the future it's it doesn't seem to matter much right away but we track these writers for three months after the apology\nAnd we found that basically two or three months later these commitments have you been in the future\nActually backfired against the company\nI'm In part because you might commit to do about the future and then the ... and do better cars than maybe it's maybe for some of them they had another bad experience and that as a result the those people punished you but more than than the control group that got no apology at all\nDid they ever have a good effect I'm\nNot in our data um [noise] so [laughter] I think they they they temporarily had a good effect right but I think there's this idea that once you've apologized we're going to hold you to hire a higher standard and sort of by the end of the three months three months of observation it seemed like they either had no effect or or or a negative effect\nIt is interesting that we expect remorse from a company like it's like minimizing human interaction yet it seems like we still want the same level of trust and accountability\nI think part of it is that our brains sort of works on script singer is six and so you know enter in a relationship with a company we sort of like the same sort of scripts and risks triggering her brain and so because we expect remorse in real life we sort of expect it from a company\nSo what what ... what were the apologies that really worked for ... like what was that magic the\nMagic was money [laughter]\nYeah um show me the money basically yeah yeah yeah um\nThat we tested apologies with or without a coupon and we we which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones who sort of increased revenues was\nYeah um that we tested apologies with or without a coupon and we we which and we found basically the most effective apology the ones who sort of increased revenues was uh just with a five dollar coupon\nWithin just money or with their certain language that people responded well to\nSo we were we were hoping to figure out the the best language but we found that there was no statistical difference between the different languages his money it seemed to be just money and in fact the message that actually might may not find a bit was a message to sort of committed to be more in the future\nDo you think this like carries over into personal relationships things I Am so sorry that I like whatever was late meeting for ten bucks [laughter]\nYou know she was a box of chocolates right or here's your matters and flowers flowers and candy and so it takes\nOn a whole new significance um does it hasn't changed the way like you apologize\nWhen people thought always wanted to ask you this question of course they do I was curious I think the main ways change with\nThat because all my friends and my family and know that I study apologies than they would always are might be skeptical whenever I Apologize so

News this is all things considered I'm Ari Shapiro and I'm Mary Louise Kelly and as of today marijuana is legal throughout Canada\nWhich raises the question what happens when Canadians want to enter the U.S given that marijuana is illegal in the U.S under federal law yesterday customs and border patrol official Todd oh and held a conference call with reporters\nWho had a whole lot of questions such as this one\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint had smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use our our ground be found in the midst of all empty the United states so yes that's possible\nReporters posed many scenarios and Owens answers were largely the same\nThat border agents have wide discretion and decisions will be made on a case by case basis we reached out to win Saunders he's an immigration attorney in Washington state and he has clients who've been denied entry into the U.S because of past cannabis use when founders welcome to the program thank you for having me on\nWho you listen to that whole conference call yesterday what struck you\nWell what struck me was even though it was the day before legalization of cannabis in Canada CBP still has not given a straight answer on whether they will admit to the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today too\nTo the United states Canadians who admit to purchasing and using cannabis legally in Canada as of today\nTo be crystal clear on what the situation is and maybe that's part of the challenges it's not crystal clear at the situation is here but there's going to be a huge discretion given to individual border agents to decide how they want to proceed\nBottom line if somebody has smoked pot legally in Canada that's going to be an issue for them when they're if they're asked about trying to come into the U.S\nAbsolutely because even though it's legal in Canada and legal in Washington state where my offices the officer has the discretion to determine that the individual could be a drug user or an abuser and denied the mentored based upon that\nSo just to parse the SAT there would be an issue about whether they have used marijuana even if they were using it in a place that was legal there would be questions potentially being asked if they have ever used marijuana and that can be grants from orange somebody from coming into the U.S\nAbsolutely and a great example is prime minister Trudeau he has admitted very publicly or in the past that he has used cannabis prior to legalization so he could be denied entry into the United states when he's no longer prime minister because right now he has a diplomatic passport\nAnd be deemed in admissible even though it's legal as of today in Canada\nAnd again just to try to drill down on this we're talking about a situation where it's legal in Canada it's legal under where you are in Washington state under state law but because federal us federal law prevails at the border that's where we have the sticking point\nExactly and it's kind of a hypocritical situation by the federal government where they've taken a hands off approach to states legalizing marijuana like Washington state but they use the full force of the U.S government and immigration laws to keep out undesirable\nYou know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea be peace\nLaws to keep out undesirable you know people who have used cannabis whether it's legal or not in Canada\nI suppose from the sea BP's point of view they don't make federal law they're tasked with enforcing federal law the border and marijuana is illegal under federal law taking that ... what do you think that they should be saying what role should be put in place that would make the situation less chaotic going forward\nWhile I think the federal government has to have some commonsense so they need to have a consistent approach with the enforcement of federal laws either outlawed in every state and be consistent with what you're doing at the border or\nDo what you're doing at the border with what you've done in many states which has taken a hands off approach unless it comes to your attention and you have let's say you know a huge amount of contraband on your vehicle around you who cares if a Canadian admit that they use marijuana legally in Canada who cares\n... he's an immigration attorney in between Washington talking about the legalization of marijuana today in Canada and what problems that might cause at the U.S Canada border Mr ... thanks for your time thank you very much\nThe state of Florida has some of the nation's toughest building codes at least most of the state\nThe rules are less stringent in the panhandle that's where Mexico beach is and that's where hurricane Michael made landfall with one hundred fifty five mile an hour wins a week ago entire blocks were flattened NPR's Greg Allen reports many are now calling for revised stricter building codes on Florida's panhandle\nIn Mexico beach Lance Irwin is one of the lucky ones his house is still standing he rode out the storm in his home several blocks from the beach\nThe garage doors shaking as somebody is trying to get in and the inside door was shaking I knew there were if I had gone at that point because everything was shaking I thought\nJust hang in there and I save everything was going to be okay for when last doors\nBecause everything was shaking I thought\nJust hang in there and I said everything was going to be OK\nIrwin

just said that Trump folks that fish the area's\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to Florida took a hard look at his building codes in South Florida Miami Dade in Broward County is adopted

miles per hour winds speed standard throughout the state\nUnfortunately because it is based on probability of storms in the past and all of that is sort of a village down as you go further north in Florida\nThere have been fewer intense hurricanes in the panhandle but elsewhere in the state and some north Florida communities new construction you'd only withstand wind speeds one hundred and

it\nGoodwyn NPR News\nHarvard is defending its admissions policy in uh Boston courtroom this week the question is whether the school discriminates against Asian American applicants the case could go to the Supreme Court with broad implications for affirmative action and schools\nYesterday we spoke with an Asian American student who believes Harvard should consider factors including race ... has the opposite view she is also the daughter of Asian immigrants and she's a junior at Harvard welcome to all things considered great thanks for having me why people leave Harvard's admissions policy needs to change\nI think race nearly treats and illusion of diversity and I'd love to see admissions policies change not to have race in it\nNow Harvard says that when they do consider race it's one of many factors and that they consider it's complicated role in student's life experiences would you like to see race just totally omitted from the list of factors that Harvard is considering when it assesses the students qualifications\nYeah I think so because when it comes down to it raises sort of something that is becoming not just merely factor but oftentimes the factory that decision is based on\nI think Harvard as saying that they don't do that but what ... mission has been showing in court the past few days and has really brought to light is that oftentimes it is the single race factor that comes down to someone's rejection\nStudents learn missions as a group that brought this lawsuit we should say\nYes yep and I think it's scary to see this repeating in history because back in the Nineteen twenties Harvard sort of did this with Jewish applicants as well and sort of use the personal rating to artificially keep their numbers lower although they were going higher and everything else similar to what's happening with Asian Americans right now\nSome supporters of Harvard in this case of alleged that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost as a front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups and\nAllege that the group that brought this suit is using Asian Americans almost as a front trying to drive a wedge among minority groups\nAnd that at the end of the day this lawsuit if it goes to the Supreme Court and a successful is really likely to help white people more than any other racial group what do you think about argument\nI don't think that that should all clearly affirmative action has failed in at school right now it's instead discriminated against Asian Americans under the guise of diversity and I think this is a critical time to reevaluate how formative action policies are impacting different communities\n[noise] I'd like you to respond to something that Harvard senior Sally Chen said to us on the program yesterday she plans to testify for Harvard at the trial here was part of our conversation\nMerit means nothing without context the kinds of barriers that people face and the kinds of\nThe ways that they overcome and work despite these barriers I think is really important to how we are thinking about the ways in which people can succeed and can lead merit means nothing without context what do you think of that idea so I think\nThat a lot of admissions process there should be based on just married\nBut I come from an inner city public high school background and I do recognize that marriage does need to be put in context sometimes what resources and opportunities people have available to them is really important\nBut I think that when we look at it we shouldn't just be looking at met in the context of race but again like I said married in the context as economic status or something that\nSpeaks more to someone's opportunities and resources is really important and\nIt sounds like you both agree that there are things about a person's application that cannot be quantified and grades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nI Would agree with that I Would say that all of us sort of have the same\nGrades and test scores you just disagree about whether that list of things including race or not\nYeah I Would agree with that I Would say that\nAll of us sort of have the same goal of diversity on a college campus whatever the sort of benefits that are but we just don't believe that we have to resort to racial ... admissions 'em and instead focus on something like poverty\nBecause when we focus on something like race I think it creates a sort of division in sort of diversity for the sake of diversity and I think chief justice John Roberts said it best when he said the only way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race\nWon't tell me about ... thank you so much for talking
