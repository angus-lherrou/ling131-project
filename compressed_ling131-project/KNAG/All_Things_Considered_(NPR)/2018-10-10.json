dirt that is what astrophysicist Adam Frank says and I'm going to let him explain\nAnd by dirt I mean soil is always around to remind us that the world is one giant interconnected Claude of a wonder\nSee if you can just open your science eyes when you look at a handful of soil suddenly you're going to see not just dirt but as seamless and central network binding together matter energy and life\nWhat do I mean well like a cake batter soils are a mix of ingredients they're made of crushed up rocks sticky clays and a whole lot of organic stuff decaying leaves bacteria worm poop all mixed together\nLet's start with the organic stuff pick up a handful of dirt from a field or a forest floor and you'll be holding more microbes in your hand than there are stars and the galaxy\nBut those zillions of microbes don't just live in the soil they make the soil alive if you could zoom in on your hand full of dirt you'd see was built from countless tiny clumps of rock and play and like a box full of different sizes balls there are a lot of gaps in pathways between those clumps\nThat's where the microbes live and they use those gaps to full advantage turning the soil into both a hyper complicated network of subway tunnels and the churning chemical reactor\nIt's this chemistry party in a sponge architecture that makes soil the foundation for all the rest of life around you\nSee

oaks and wheat seeds turned to the bread for lunch\nIt's not the microbes alone network these miracles and it's not the minerals enclaves by themselves that let acorns become oaks soils are a dynamic pulsing tightly woven fabric with Adams constantly being shuffled from non living forms over to the living and back to the non living again\nThrough soils we can see how our bodies and our lives are also a tightly woven tapestry of living and non living world it's not just us over here in the world over there\nEach of us as part of the cosmic fabric of matter energy and change who strands can never be separated each of us is an ongoing expression of this earth we were born to each of us has an expression\nOf its dirt and that is a glorious thing [noise]\nAdam Frank teaches astrophysics at

storage a former prosecutor can discuss them only in general terms\nStill he's playing a visible role at an agency that often seems invisible with its spying missions and classified budgets\nThe NSA

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly a team of Fifteen Saudis flew into ... last week drove to the Saudi consulate and then deported that same day on private planes headed for Cairo and to buy\nThis is according to the Washington Post which has been tracking the disappearance of Saudi journalist ...\n... has not been heard from or seen since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second it's not known whether he's alive or dead Shane Harris is one of the reporters working this story for the post and I asked him\nFifteen Saudis sounds like a lot to do we know what their alleged operation was\nThink we'd fully know the intent and I think you're right that feed is Fifteen people is a lot to to kill and individual in a a former U.S official I spoke to about this said it actually bears a lot of the hallmarks of rendition or a kidnapping operation but we still don't know but what we are understanding is that the U.S government\nThe Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second it's not known whether he's alive or dead Shane Harris is one of the reporters working this story for the post and I asked him Fifteen Saudi sounds like a lot to do we know what their alleged operation was I don't think we'd\nFully know the intent and I think you're right that fate is Fifteen people is a lot to to to kill an individual and a a former U.S official I spoke to about this said\nIt actually bears a lot of the hallmarks of rendition or a kidnapping operation but we still don't know but will we are understanding is that the U.S government was picking up intelligence that the Saudis wanted for some time to capture could show not clear whether they wanted to capture\nAnd prosecute him or whether they want to interrogate him or kill him but that there was some high level interest on the part of the government of getting him in some way\nOkay let's let's unravel that a little bit ... U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications of love what Saudi officials discussing ...\nCorrect this is us intelligent picking up the conversations of Saudis discussing a plan to to lay hands on a show to capture him at the initial plan as we understand that was to try to find a way to lure him back to Saudi Arabia and capture him there I\nThink probably could show you felt that that was not a safe option to go home to Saudi Arabia\nAnd it's possible that this what you're seeing here happening is stumble could be sort of plan B or for that to send these teams to go out there there was one group laying and wait for him we believe at the consulate and then another group that came in after he may have been captured or met with his faith or at the consulate\nBut it shows that Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that\nDo we know what U.S intelligence did it with these intercepts I eat did they warn ...\nWhat my sources of told me is that this information was circulated in intelligence reports\nHere happening stumble could be sort of plan B or for that to send these teams to go out there there was one group laying and wait for him we believe at the consulate and then another group that came in after he may have been captured or met with his faith or at the consulate\nBut it shows that Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that\nDo we know what U.S intelligence gained it with these intercepts I eat did they warn ... what my sources\nOf told me is that this information was circulated in intelligence reports what's not clear at this point is whether anyone from the U.S government Warren ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn\nIf the U.S government believes that someone is about to meet with harm or whether that person as a U.S citizen or not there can be an obligation to reach out until that person we don't know if that happened and we don't know whether the U.S government or the White House called the Saudis and effectively said we know what you're up to\nBack off ... why do you think Shane Harris your source want you to know about this in my experience U.S intelligence officials tend to have a reason when they talk to reporters like you were I I\nThink there's a real concern on two fronts one that this was a journalist and a prominent critic of the regime in Saudi Arabia who now has gone missing possibly some harm has come to him and there's a real concern about that but more to the point I think there is a concern within the U.S intelligence community that this administration in particular\nHas become very close to the ruling groups in Saudi Arabia particularly the crown prince Mohammed bin so I'm On a hoot to be Frank is not really viewed as a trusted figure within many parts of the U.S intelligence community there is an affection for the old guard that he replaced the he sort of ousted\nAnd I think people have a lot of concerns about the the closeness between people in the White House in the current leadership and Saudi Arabia\nWhen you talk about closeness between the U.S\nCernan about that but more to the point I think there is a concern within the U.S intelligence community that this administration in particular\nHas become very close to the ruling groups in Saudi Arabia particularly the crown prince Mohammed bin so I'm On a who to be Frank is not really viewed as a trusted figure within many parts of the U.S intelligence community there is an affection for the old guard that he replaced that he sort of ousted\nAnd I think people have a lot of concerns about the the closeness between people in the White House and the current leadership in Saudi Arabia\nWhen you talk about closeness between the U.S in Saudi Arabia you're talking in part about the relationship between Trump's son in law Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman\nAbsolutely jerk ... MPs says he sometimes known in the intelligence community have developed a very close personal relationship and that I think is very much at the heart of us Saudi relations right now they've met with each other and a number of occasions and there is a personal bond there that is translating into policy\n[noise] that's the Washington Post Shane Harris updating us on a couple of the many moving threads of the investigation into what happened to Saudi journalist Jamal ... chain thank you my pleasure thanks\nBrett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court has given abortion rights opponents an opportunity that they have long hoped for to weaken or overturn roe the wait at the Nineteen Seventy three decision that legalized abortion nationwide\nMeanwhile Planned Parenthood is announcing a new strategy to protect abortion rights NPR's Sarah McCammon reports that Supreme\nCourt can't just get up one morning and overturn roe v Wade\nThe justices would first have to take out the case that would give them a chance to reconsider that landmark decision but abortion rights opponents hope that will happen soon ...
