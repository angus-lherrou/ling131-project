just have to see where it goes from here\nAnd I know it's late where you are as well but any reaction from turkey from Turkish officials to this Saudi announcement Turkish officials that of course been working with the Saudis this was kind of a joint investigation that they'd been pursuing\nNo reaction yet yes some eyebrows had been raised a when they decided to investigate this jointly with the Saudis they've been in on every search a but we'll have to wait and see what the reaction is\nAll right that is Peter Kenyon getting us up to speed from Istanbul thank you very much Peter thanks very Lewis and we're going to hear now from someone who says this Saudi investigation is compromised with Saudi Arabia has in effect been investigating itself\nHis name is David ... he is the United nations special repertoire on freedom of opinion an expression which means he's tasked with protecting those very rights around the world\nK. has been arguing that the UN should launch an independent international investigation and he's on the line now David Cay welcome\nThanks for having me\nNow that Saudi Arabia has come out and confirmed or the death of ... G and given a little tiny bit of detail on what happened do you still believe un investigation would be worthwhile would be necessary\nAbsolutely I mean I think we're in a position right now where we have all of these competing narratives right we have a the drip drip drip of leaks from the Turkish a law enforcement authorities that have given some really brutal detail of\nA of a of ... killing and those same really quite at odds with what ah what the Saudis are announcing today the idea of a of a fist fight to Adam themes\nSeem really quite at odds with what are what the Saudis are announcing today the idea of a of a fistfight to em seems really um counter to what to do what the Turks have suggested so I think the only way right now to get to the bottom of this\nI have a credible investigation and that means something that would be authorized by by the un or the secretary general or some other international body\nWhat would that investigation look like how big are we talking how long would it take\nI think we're talking about something small you know we're talking about as in past cases like this maybe five individuals could be led by a high profile former prosecutor investigators who have experience with international crimes and criminal investigation\nAnd um you know at the very minimum it can involve\nAnalyzing what the what the Turkish authorities have been giving to the news media over the last a week or two or it could involve on site visits a interviews of of officials and so forth but but I think it's something that could be done fairly quickly four to six weeks well once it's authorized\nUm who has to call for this I mean what what would it take to put this in motion Mm\n[noise] yeah I mean there's really a bunch of different models that would be available for something like this the Security Council has authorized investigations\nFor for heinous crimes and comprehensive systematic crimes like crimes against humanity and genocide\nUh they did it in the context of dark for in Sudan several years ago and they've done it and many other places the human rights council could do it the human rights council benefit is that it's not subject to ah to the veto of any of the five\nPermanent members gonna okay so if the U.S decided they didn't think this investigation was necessary that could block of Security Council investigation but not the human rights council\nAbsolutely ... and there's there's uh\nIf the U.S decided they didn't think this investigation was necessary they could block of Security Council investigation but not the human rights council\nAbsolutely ... and there's there's a third option to which uh several human rights organizations have been calling for and that's for the secretary general on his own to authorize a authorizes an investigation and set one up\n[noise] um what would happen once this investigation is complete it would it be binding in any way could the Saudis just decide we have our version of events we don't buy it\n[noise] yeah no this is a this would be something where it would be an investigation because of its credibility because it would be international lies it would be something that from you know from that point states could take a look at it and make a decision as to how to proceed and there\nWould be any number of options available to them whether its diplomatic penalties penalties and international organizations or or other kinds of outcomes but but there's nothing binding I'm not talking about how beautiful but we're talking about a credible international investigation that David Cay thank you\nThank you he's the un special representative and this is NPR News\n\nIt and they will come in this case a little wooden box on a post the man credited with building the first little library died yesterday Todd bowl was sixty two men had pancreatic cancer\nNine years ago he used wood from his old garage door to build the first little

out next year called little libraries big heroes she joins me now from her home in Green Bay welcome thank you gave Todd Bowles this idea to build a little library in the first place well ...\nShe joins me now from her home in Green Bay welcome thank you gave Todd Bowles this idea to build a little library in the first place\nWell Todd's mother passed away\nAnd his mother had been a schoolteacher and when he was growing up as a student who very much struggled his mother had always been encouraging so he built the first little free library as a one room schoolhouse to honor her and was it a hit right from the start\nActually know very little passed by\nThat he talked with his friend Rick Brooks and so they built a whole bunch of them sort of planting unlike seeds from Minneapolis to Madison to Chicago and it was only after that that it started to catch on\nWe had him on this program six years ago and he was talking about the effects of the little libraries once people did start catching on and start using them\nOne of the things that always is amazes me is how many people hugged them when we actually put them in we constantly get emails that I've met more people have in Twenty years people are always happy my favorite thing to do is sit on my porch and read a book and watch people from the library\nWhat do you think it was about the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to\nTodd really looked at reading and sharing stories as a doorway to forming relationships usually when I spoke with Todd in person or on the phone he expressed how energized he was about projects especially those that had to do with the news for people who didn't normally read getting reading\nTell me about some of the places where these libraries in our tuition the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has been either violence or disaster these little free libraries have come up as sort of a little spring of hope along the U.S Mexico border there is a hundred and fifty\nOr disaster these little free libraries have come up this sort of a little spring of hope along the U.S Mexico border there is a hundred and fifty of them on in prisons in Wisconsin and other states and they can while the refugee settlement in western Uganda\nA hospital in Ireland near a schoolyard and South Sudan these little free libraries have popped up and brought communities together\nPeople of course take books for the little libraries but you also get to leave them I have to see that's what I Love about it I Love if I've got a book and I really loved it\nSometimes going and sticking it in there and then I'll you know when I'm Out jogging ... seeing if somebody's taken it and if they have I feel this little sense of pleasure that somebody else is going to get to read this book that I just love\nI Love that idea to I'm constantly having a few bucks in my car\nSo that when I'm going somewhere if I see a little free library and I want to put a book in there you can share that love of reading with another community whether it's your own or somewhere else\nYou were in touch with Todd bowl when he was in hospice does he feel like he'd done what he set out to do\nWell I went in there so much more to what he's doing and being a champion from books or for reading he was being a champion for communities new friendships new ideas new projects springing to life as a result of his idea that's what he wanted\n... thank you for talking to us thank you

America for refuge in the United states have been mast and whereas today they broke through an immigration barrier and try to enter Mexico from Guatemala\nMexican security forces appealed for order and then fired tear gas to drive the migrants back\nPresident Trump has already weighed in he's think to Mexico for its efforts to stop these so called caravan he has also said he will close the U.S border to these\nMigrants well let's bring in reporter James Frederick who is there in Guatemala Hi James\nAn early so just yesterday you were describing to me a relatively calls scene at the border a lot of security but migrants who were masked a few minutes away from the border what what's happened today [noise]\nThis group of migrants Mel grown to thousands we don't know exactly how many uh but thousands of migrants now decided they were going to march to bridge that connects Guatemala and Mexico and they said they were going to try to enter Mexico today\nIt was a very chaotic scene but you know for him just try to summarize quickly as possible [noise]\nGoing to try to enter Mexico today it was a very chaotic scene but uh you know for him just try to summarize it as quickly as possible [noise]\nAh they were at the fence walking them from leaving Guatemala they got through that fence thousands of people started a walking across this bridge into Mexico Mexico hits close to a big metal gate to them it had dozens of federal police officers in riot gear rating for this caravan\nThen I wasn't close enough to see what happened but then the Mexican gate open briefly we heard shots that turned out mostly to be here or gas or that they were using against the migrants and then the gate shut\nAgain um it was a really chaotic scene and let's hear from this father who was near the front of the caravan with his two young kids\nDon't see them up for it [noise]\nSo what he said was that she went to the front with his children because they thought they were going to let families and children cross first then there's chaos broke out he had to pour water in his children's eyes they got here ... it was just really chaotic or there were several children who have lost their families it was it was a really rough seen\nSpeaking of the really chaotic scene I can hear a lot of noise behind you James where exactly are you\nSo I'm back on the Guatemalan side of the border but still right here or near the bridge\nAnd several of the migrants a couple of hundred so far have drifted back into Guatemala I'm sitting right next to a couple of cops are from the Guatemalan Red Cross they're treating people mostly people who are really just\nHydrated I mean there's a young boy laying on the cutting now he's probably four years old has a has a cold rag on his head so Guatemalan authorities are trying to treat people who said suffered a lot of heat stroke a and dehydration as well as some people who actually suffered broken bones in the class with Mexican and\n... says suffered a lot of heat stroke and dehydration as well as some people who actually suffered a broken bone in the classroom\nAnd as you talk to these people what did they say their next move is are they going to try again I mean it does not sound as though Mexico is inclined to let them cross the border and crossed this bridge\nA lot of people I talked to said we aren't going to leave this bridge what they are requesting is from Mexico to let them in as asylum seekers and so they are many of them say we are not going to leave this bridge we're going to block the bridge into Mexico\nLactose and given the clashes today Mexico has totally closed the border uh you know I tried to get back into Mexico and was not able\nTo disclose to everyone a show it's it's really up in the air what they're going to do but everyone I talked to said no we're not turning around we are not going home\nIn the seconds we have left teams I mentioned that President Trump is threatening to close the U.S border if this caravan does manage to make it across Mexico and advance getting to the U.S is if the goal of these people are they aware of the president's position [noise]\nThey they are aware of that a Trump does not want to let them into their country for what they say over and over again as we know that same stance but we're asking we are pleading for help because you know whatever Trump puts in front of us what is back at home is worse than whatever Trump and put in front of us [noise]\nAll right thank you James [noise]\nThank you that is James Frederick reporting from Guatemala Mexico
