is all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin we're going to return to a difficult and for some people and traumatic subject that's been much in the news we're talking here about sexual abuse we're finally starting to hear from women and some men who've experienced this far more rare though are stories from people who have witnessed sexual abuse and stayed silent about it\nDon ... was in high school when he attended a party\nAnd he says he saw a young woman being raped through a window that was in Nineteen sixty nine and over the Next Fifty years ... says he didn't do anything about it but the guilt stayed with him and after talking to his wife and sons about it he decided to write about it for the Washington Post\nAnd dump ... is with us now from his home in the Pittsburgh area Mr primary thanks so much for talking with us thank you you wrote this piece after Christine Blasey Ford testify about what she says that now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh did to her when they were both in high school is that what made you want to write this piece after all these years\nYes that's what motivated me I watched her testimony and I thought it was genuine you know I felt she was really telling the truth plus uh the things that she forgot wore the same things I forgot you know so I said well I'm going to just write something that my experience which was very similar\nI did something that I sit in the article I committed a crime and I did\n[noise] you know what you wrote is hard to read and you know for some people it's going to be hard to hear about this so this is where again I'm going to say that for some people if this is too much to listen to them you know take a minute and step away from it but I'm going to ask you to recount for me what it is that you said that you saw and you were at a party right\nLet me start by saying this was an unusual event for me because I never went to parties never\nAnd so I I don't even know why I went\nUsual event for me because I never went to parties never and so I I don't even know why I went\nI I didn't know anybody that all of a sudden a kids came upstairs and said hey go outside and look through the basement window to about ten of us went out there and I happen to be right in front of the window and I'm watching\nAnd as soon as I look through the window I see a a girl just lying on a sofa she looked like she was passed out\nAnd so the kid went down\nAnd he looks up to us any waves to us and he starts smiling and then he starts to take her genes off and then he he he took her panties off\nAnd then he he pulled on his pants\nAnd he went on top of her and as soon as he did that he was starting to have sex with her she kind of came to and started hitting him on the shoulders he jumps up right away\nAnd all of us at that that window was outside we all just started to run\n... you also write that you and other boys at the party started touching another young woman who was also passed out on the on a bad but then you you left\nYet this was later maybe twenty minutes to thirty minutes later\nA she was laying on the bed and uh what one kid was doing was\nWhen the lights were out everybody wants touching her he would turn the lights on and everybody would pretend like they weren't touching her and they probably did this four or five times I touched her leg at one point and and that was all I did but uh it was enough\nYou know you wrote about why you think the girls would never have said anything about this they would have been blamed and shame they would have been told the chips fall [noise] but you never said anything either why do you think that is\nA [noise] you know I I think I wanted to forget about it and plus later on it was just\nThe thing either why do you think that is ah [noise]\nYou know I I think I wanted to forget about it and plus later on it was just just plain guilt you when you're guilty about something and I was guilty and I admitted in in any article ah you you don't want to tell anyone\nOne of the things about your piece that I think struck a lot of us is that you said I wanted to tell this story because I Believe it's time for men to tell the truth about the ways they've abused women and what role has been in creating a culture that tolerates this we've all seen things we've all heard other men talk and you wrote about a couple of examples where you just heard\nPeople say these crazy things and you know nobody did anything and why do you have a sense like why do you think that is why do you think this has been tolerated so long\nI I don't know I I don't know why we've kept quiet I had a quote from somebody some man who said that it would be easier to admit that you committed a murder instead of admitting you committed a sexual assault\nAnd ah I I Can't answer that I don't know I I really don't know why men have been silent\nOn this issue but I think men should be part of the me too movement I think we should come forward and uh talk about what we've seen what we've done I think that should be part of it\n[noise] how did your family take it when you told them\n[noise] well let let me tell you when I originally told my wife I told her just the rate part that I witnessed I did not tell her my\nParticipation she didn't know that to this article came out ... let me just say it's a\nWas tough for her to say let me tell you but everything's okay now everything's good\nAnd how did you explain that to your boys\nIt was tough for her to take let me tell you but everything's okay now everything's good\nAnd how did you explain that to your boys well\nJust I was truthful with him and uh\nThey were very receptive\nOn their dad you know dad's can you know we we kinda can't do too much from in the in the eyes of our\nKids are they both told me that my two older boys they don't think it would happen now they said everybody at that window would have had their phones al videotaping it that's what they told but that\nDoesn't mean it wouldn't have had what are they saying they yeah I mean but in that sense that kid wouldn't have done it because you wouldn't have wanted to be on film\nYou say well we film everything you know what they would kind of looting too\nWell how do you feel now that you got it off your chest\nYou know [laughter] and I have mixed feelings I'll be honest there are there are days when I regret it and then there are days that\nI'm Glad I did you know my kids showed me some comments on Twitter from people some women have said it's about time someone it it's almost as if I was the first guy to admit this a lot of women ah said ah\nThey were glad I did it and they felt better about themselves a few women who have been actually a assaulted who wrote notes to me said that they made them feel better and so that made me feel kind of good you know\nYour piece was very moving and I one of the things I think I was like every paragraph of it I could call it but the fact that you think about these women I mean now and you wonder\nWhat happened to them like how this affected their lives I mean if if you could say anything to them if by some miracle they were listening [laughter] what would you what would you say\nThe only thing I can say is I'm Sorry I didn't help\nTo them if by some miracle they were listening [laughter] what would you what would you say the only thing I can say is I'm Sorry I didn't help\nUh you know few women had called me a hero but no I wasn't I Would have been a hero if other help these women then but I didn't do it Don ... thank you so

popularized a controversial fixture of pop music today auto tune here Steven\nThere is a long history of artist you using a different vocal modifications but is it always been a disguise you used it in ways that you would hope the audience wouldn't notice just to make of a vocal a little cleaner and clearer and more on pitch\nThis song brings the auto tune front and center here those modifications\nEasily have just been a gimmick instead auto tune became a very prominent tool in a lot of pop R. and B and hip hop production [noise]\nTo me auto tune sounds sort of like digital stretching are flexing your sharing a a singer kind of slide up and down the register\nIn a in a way that doesn't sound natural but auto tune can amplify an expression of passion in or emotion in a singer\nTo me I think of a song like hide and seek by the singer image and heat or who became really really well known for for using this effect and uh and you hear heightened seats\nHe uh who became really really well known for for using this fact uh and you hear hide and seek and the way they are using auto tune to manipulate her voice\nYou really feel the emotions that that song is expressing

Would describe their sound as like the music robots make when they're trying to sell products to other robots gotta\nGet get gotta get get gotta get there\nSo it's sort of amazing that all of this

but a computer creating a portrait that's being auction by such a prestigious art house now that is new art appraiser Aaron Murray Wallace has been following the bugs around the upcoming sale\nAnd she joins us now to talk about how the art world is taking all this in welcome thank you a pleasure to be here also how controversial is this in the art world for a painting to be painted by a non human and then auction off like fine art well\nI think every couple of generations you have something that happens that begins to redefine what we consider art you can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the euro and oh by Marcel Just shop where he literally took a men's journal and hang it on a wall right\nAnd this completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what are actually is for the twenty first century so I don't think that it is I'm a once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen\nAgain and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context\nThat is so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you\nPrice a painting that is not the product of the human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand it things like technique and the uniqueness of a piece of work those are the factors that drive the price in art so how do you price art where those things don't really apply well they still apply\nBut let's add to that let's add to that the market below\nArt so how do you price art where those things don't really apply\nWell they still apply but let's add to that let's add to that the market ability of a painting let's add to it the hype that's created around a painting or any work of art really\nI tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they want him to price it in comparison with where they wanted to sell it via Christi is\nAll are within the same wheel house in terms of number\nAnd does that orchestrate nation deplete the integrity of the artistic process\nThe rollout my opinion is no because I don't think it is up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at what people are willing to pay for it\nSo who is the artist in this case is it the ... who wrote the algorithm is it the algorithm or is it the machine\nOh the artist has to be a little bit of all of those original artist ownership I Do believe is split between the programming the ... the collective and maybe even a little bit of a nod to Christie's for helping to create the frenzy around it and\nGiven that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around this if this painting were created by human ... think it would have the same attractiveness would it garnered the same price\nNo I don't think so I really don't think so I think in terms of are the things that matter than most are the first and this is the first time and a I generated artwork hasn't gone to a major auction house to be auctioned off and so this is the first is the absolute first time this has ever happened\nBecause this is a canvas print\nIt is absolutely possible that the collective could decide to release it in a smaller limited in numbered edition after the sale I don't believe that those\nIt's possible that the collective could decide to release it in a smaller limited in numbered edition after the sale
