manufacture parts and components for maintenance and repair\nAnd how much was on the line for you in this trade agreement where you're holding your breath to see what the details would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well injured after we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states but it counts and all three countries being part of the agreement\nSo we are very pleased relieved that all three parties were able to come to an agreement this weekend we're cautiously optimistic that the terms of the agreement will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required\nFor parts to travel through the three countries can add to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement but traveled through North America

will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required\nFor parts to travel through the three countries going to have to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement but traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs there's going to be a requirement for more North American steel and aluminum us so all of that will impact our members\nAnd in addition there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have though are there some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states address that before they finalized disagreement and the end of November\nSo on the one hand there won't be terrorists for material crossing Canada U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry have not gone away\nNo they haven't I think one of the things we have to keep in mind as they have been a particular burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members have seen the cost of their steel purchases rise almost fifty percent\nSo this is a significant increase it's typically of concern between Canada and the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up their sleeves uses same energy they used to conclude this this new NAFTA and be able to come to some kind of agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs\nI Know that there's a lot of relief from the auto industry now the uncertainty is gone but how does this compare to the old rules under NAFTA isn't an improvement is is it worse\nI think from the United states perspective one of the things in the United states\nCosts but they're still purchases rise almost fifty percent\nSo this is a significant increase it's typically is concerned between Canada the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up their sleeves uses same energy they use to conclude this this new NAFTA and be able to come to some kind of agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs\nI Know that there's a lot of relief from the auto industry now that the uncertainty is gone but how does this compare to the old rules under NAFTA isn't an improvement just isn't worse well\nI think from the United states perspective one of the things in the United states said little pool through was an increase in the U.S content and for some of our suppliers and some component manufacturers this is going to be a challenge there is no doubt about that\nI Do think that we're going to see more steel moral lumina that's from North America in our vehicles\nThe biggest concern our members are going to have the the administrative costs and we're going to have to work really hard with all three parties to minimize those costs because consumers are going to get any value out of it and that's going to be our next a real challenge for as we move forward that Greenland\nAnd Wilson is senior vice president of the

heard about this NPR Marist Poll signed a Republican enthusiasm had jumped over the last month perhaps because of Calvin all do you expect that this confirmation vote could have a real impact on congressional elections\nHonestly it depends on how you're looking at it for House Democrats it's great they're fighting a battle ground in the suburbs and their eagerly courting women there and this has energized them the Senate battleground on the other hand is in states that Trump won and twenty sixteen\nAnd that's a much harder situation for Democrats up for re election in those states so far

belligerent and aggressive\nThat he won ... Kevin I'll throw a drink in a man's face prompting a bar fight and that he believes Kavanaugh may have lied under oath I asked ... did he offered this information to the FBI\nOr yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them by phone from the did than tell me what exactly to do first and the entailed sending a request for\nA form to fill out and then I filled out the form in fact when the former run it had been pre filled by the uh presumably views and I spoke to a with my testimony unit that took up most of the three thousand the characters bases of bailout\nSo you feel that this form did you ever than sit down with or have a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nAllows cited not I was never called book I read by my food by my computer ah hoping to get an email ... nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI\nUh with my testimony in it that took up most of the three thousand a character spaces that they allowed\nSo you feel that this form did you ever than sit down with are having a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nUh last I did not I was never called back I we're by my phone by my computer ah hoping to get an email that nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI why do they need to question yeah\nWell I think it's relevant because first of all I don't think once you live in front of the Senate Judiciary committee or when it's taken an oath and one is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you were saying you thought he lied and testimony that's in regard to the extent of his drinking\nYes it is the basic law was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of where the phrase is black and yeah I think ... may confuse that was passing out but the black man phrase means doing things that you don't know you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of his intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to that condition how can one no\nLet me let me ask you this is a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nI don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened in the last week that's where I think\nThat he knows for certain that he never got to the condition how can one new\nLet me ask you this a central question today in Washington now that the FBI has delivered this additional supplemental report is does that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nNo I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened in the last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I can speak to what I Know about like nudey three maybe four to eighty five at college\nAnd then how that was spoken about in two thousand and Eighteen so I don't think they've done a very thorough job in that sense at all\n... classmate of Brett Kavanaugh says he's now an associate professor at North Carolina State University and you heard him here on all things considered from NPR News\n...

also changing jobs more often and he's here to tell us more about this like artist hey Ari what shows you that people are changing jobs moving around more\nMy favorite indicator of dynamism is probably the quit straight that's just the share of people who quit who voluntarily leave their jobs each month it's now its highest point in Seventeen years so\nThe Labor Department comes out with the latest jobs report tomorrow and economists expect to see more new jobs being created at a healthy pace\nBut there aren't just more jobs Cardiff Garcia of our planet money team says people are also changing jobs more often and he's here to tell us more about this hike artist hey are what shows you that people are changing jobs moving around more\nWell my favorite indicator dynamism is probably the quit straight that's just the share of people who quit who voluntarily leave their jobs each month it's now its highest point in Seventeen years so it shows you that people are confident letting go of their place of work a and looking for something else\nSo you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a higher rate that's actually a good sign economically\nI mean individually usually we associate quitting your job with like being fed up you know you've had it\nUp but actually if you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy it's a great sign when a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nAnd when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there\nActually a lot more uh in fact there are now more job openings than there are unemployed people this is the first year that that's been the case in the government started tracking these records back in the year two thousand\nAnd that doesn't mean that everyone who once worked will just slide into those open jobs the jobs might be in different parts of the country from where the unemployed people are they might not be a perfect match in terms of the skill sets that are required versus the skills that people have but it does tell you that there is a lot of work out there if you're looking for it\nAnd is that across the border in certain sectors are the more job openings and others\nYou know it's it's consistent geographically across the U.S and it's also consistent across the entire US Economy are but there are some sectors that are more impressive than others and if you look at the health\nTwo thousand and that doesn't mean that everyone who once worked will just slide into those open jobs the jobs might be in different parts of the country from where the unemployed people are they might not be a perfect match in terms of the skill sets that are required versus the skills that people have but it does tell you that there is a lot of work out there if you're looking for it\nAnd is that across the border in certain sectors are the more job openings and others\nNo no it's it's consistent geographically across the U.S and it's also consistent across the entire US Economy are but there are some sectors that are more impressive than others and if you look at\nThe health care sector food and accommodations restaurants hotels and then there's this category called professional in business services there were like high end services things like design accounting law advertising in all of those sectors are you really see a lot of job opportunities\nIf employers have to compete so much for talent and why aren't wages going up faster than they are\nYou know this has been puzzling economists for quite some time uh but what could be the case is that there are more people than economists realize who are willing to take work in part because a lot of the people who are taking jobs now\nSaid that they weren't even looking for jobs in the month before they actually took them and so what it suggests is that actually there are more people willing to take work and so companies are having to look for workers yeah but there are also more workers available to be found\nWhat does all this mean for the economy as a whole\nYou know when the economy is more dynamic it tends to give people more bargaining power so wage growth has been kind of sluggish in the last few years very disappointing it could be about to get better it also makes the economy a bit more efficient more productive because if people are finding jobs that are a good match for their skill set\nIt makes them better at their jobs and it also means that companies will be more likely to invest in the kinds of tools and equipment that will make them more efficient so it's good all the way around both for the workers and for the economy\nBecause of elbow to be found what does all this mean for the economy as a whole\nYou know when the economy's more dynamic it tends to give people

Louise the Justice Department says it's exposing those activities and that this indictment tells the real story\nI was asking you earlier about the timing of these charges carry and I have another question along those lines the U.S announced these charges just hours after Britain and the other one's announced their own accusations against Russian is that coincidence\nOr coordinated very much coordinated the Justice Department actually think it's international law enforcement partners for their help\nAt the press conference here in D.C today they highlighted how the Dutch were actually able to disrupt the hacking plot in April where for Russian men carrying diplomatic passport traveled to the Hague and rented a car and then fill it with electronic equipment they parked that car next to the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons\nThe goal was to penetrate the wife fi networks there but\nThe Dutch we're on to them so the men abandoned the car and left the country and this was at the same time this organization the O P cw was examining a substance use to poison a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter in the u._k. this year ... exactly I mean\nHere's my big question which is what to these charges tell us if\nThe Hague and rented a car and then fill it with electronic equipment they parked that car next to the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons the goal was to penetrate the wife fi networks there but\nThe Dutch we're on to them so the men abandoned the car and left the country and this was at the same time this organization the O P cw was examining a substance use to poison a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter in the u._k. this year\nSays the Sergei Skripal ... exactly\nI mean here's here's my big question which is what to these charges tell us if anything about the ongoing effort to protect us elections I mean this is all you know something we're talking about still because of twenty sixteen and attacks against democratic servers and institutions\nAre we any closer to knowing about efforts to protect the upcoming midterms from further Russian interference\nVideotape wouldn't touch that question may but there is something worth pointing out here the new indictment does include three of the same people accused earlier this year of hacking the twenty sixteen presidential election which begs the question or they added again if so the U.S government is just single them out all over again\nAnd one unusual things stood out this morning the DOT actually a warning for news media both here and around the world be careful they said about using material that comes from these hacks it can be false are misleading or the hackers can have a

to think about what happens when planets collide she uses to actual cannons to simulate those massive impacts here's one firing in her lab at UC Davis\nHer work earned her a spot in this year's class of MacArthur fellows many of us call it the genius grant for years experts have thought the earth's moon formed after a large collision knocked off a bunch of rock Stewart told me her research suggests a different story\nDuring planet formation when two bodies collide there's so much energy released that most of these bodies are vaporized\nThat means that a rocky planet earth is mostly rock vapor what does rocket vapor and and what does it have to do with our moon rock paper is taking the rocks that we stand on end heating it up to the point where it becomes the gas\nAnd when that occurs the earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object\nHer research suggests a different story\nDuring planet formation when two bodies collide there's so much energy released that most of these bodies are vaporized that means that a rocky planet like earth is mostly rock vapor\nWhat does rocket vapor and and what does it have to do with our moon\nRock paper is taking the rocks that we stand on end heating it up to the point where it becomes the gas\nAnd when that occurs the earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the earth today and we proposed that our moon grows within the rock vapor of the earth after a giant impact\nSo the moon actually came from the earth\nThe moon grows within the rock vapor of the earth and that gives the moon the same chemistry as the earth\nHow much of a revelation was that I mean how different was that from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from\nIt was hard to imagine that things could be so different and it was a mental roadblock to realize that giant impacts transformed the planet into an entirely new type of object and that could explain one of the biggest mysteries in the solar system\nDid you have to overcome some mental road blocks of your own given what you would have been taught coming through academia\nAbsolutely and this is when we had a bona fide eureka moment to my graduate student and I are sitting in front of a computer looking at the calculations that we had done and realizing that owns the assumptions are actually violated by what we're looking at I think\nIn any field there's a degree to which people have to be taught to trust to themselves and maybe women even more than men are taught not to trust themselves was it difficult for you to have confidence that yeah well I've demonstrated here actually\nIs real scientists are terrified of being\nThrough academia absolutely and this is when we had a bona fide eureka moment to my graduate student and I are sitting in front of a computer looking at the calculations that we had done and realizing that all the assumptions are actually violated by what we were looking at\nI think in any field there's a degree to which people have to be taught to trust themselves and maybe women even more than men are taught not to trust themselves was it difficult for you to have confidence that yeah I've demonstrated here actually is real\nScientists are terrified of being wrong [laughter] so of course I didn't want to put something out there that was really a crazy idea and so we did have to convince ourselves first\nHow long did that take you to convince yourself\nWell [laughter] from the eureka moment to the publisher paper was four years so I think we had a lot of internal debates\nAre amongst the co authors and a lot of debates at conferences on the origin of the moon\nSo do you expect if ten years from now I pick up a high school textbook it's going to have the results of your research there in the chapter on our moon was formed\nI certainly hope so I Am very excited about this idea and I hope that it leads to test where we can prove whether or not the moon actually formed in the earth vapor\nWhy are these kinds of questions relevant to ordinary people who are not scientists why does it matter where the moon came from for example\nThe creation of the men was the last major event and the creation of the earth and it was such a violent act it left the earth and the state very different from today\nUnderstanding how earth became in the habitable planet that it is is directly linked to this final event and its creation\nYou're saying it's part of our story absolutely\nHow did you get interested in\nIn the earth vapor why are these kinds of questions relevant to ordinary people who are not scientists why does it matter where the moon came from for
