final vote and he's with us now from Capitol Hill Scott welcome thanks so much for joining us show so first of all set the scene for us for people who are not able to watch it\nYou know these votes are one of the most formal moments that ever happened in the Senate Senator sit at their desk and vote one by one while the vice president presides so as that was happening person after person in the

mansion that she was an assault or survivor that he's putting his personal politics ahead of her experience that happened over and over again another man yelled at Jeff Flake that he was a coward and all Thirteen people were removed from the gallery during the vote\nAnd I think that sums up this whole story in one scene in the Senate struggling with its formal responsibilities made hyper partisanship an emotional set of circumstances and both parties retreating to their tribal basis this has all been so\nPartisan and divisive um but even accounting for the theatrics ... that people sometimes bring to politics too you have a sense of this anger will linger in the Senate\nI think so uh senators from both parties are incredibly angry for very different reasons and just less\n... do you have a sense that this anger will linger in the Senate\nI think so or senators from both parties are incredibly angry for very different reasons and just listen to some of today's concluding

these unjustified attacks on the judge and his family and disappointed than their lack of any empathy or more for what they have put them through\nWell let let's talk about that for a minute let's talk about the Republican view for him and his got because because many senators have said all along that they've found Christine Blasey Ford sincere incredible and yet they effectively discounted their testimony that they talk about that\nThey did Republican after Republican was making that same argument often in in strikingly similar wording almost the exact same phrasing that Ford was sincere that's a word that kept coming up\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo has met with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe's in Tokyo says he wants to ensure that you allies are on the same page before

Martin as you've probably heard by now the Senate has voted to confirm DC circuit court judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court\nAs you would likely also know this has been a trying period for all involved earlier this hour we heard from someone who knows and supports judge Kavanaugh\nNow we're going to hear from Lisa Banks she is one of the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford the woman who told a Senate Judiciary committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her years ago when I spoke with Lisa Banks yesterday I asked whether Ford a psychology professor was aware of all of the women\nWho say they have been inspired to share their own stories of sexual assault as a result of her testimony\nI think the impact that she has had on this country has tremendous I'm not certain she has a a sense of that yet the the full impact a and I'm not sure we've seen the full impact but\nBut certainly what she has done a has unleashed something that is going to move this country in a better direction and women across the country across the world for that matter\nA have found their voice to come forward to have the courage to come forward and say I'm a survivor to or to tell their story\n... what does professor Ford want to happen now um respects you told my colleague Rachel Martin when you spoke with her ... shortly after her name became public that her goal has been and ... and is now that the information be provided to the people making the decisions so that those making this decision could make an informed decision with all the facts\nThat's happened so what what does she want to happen now\nWell I think she didn't want the senators casting a vote to be fully informed and what would I Would say is that they're not fully informed because what we did not get was an FBI investigation as FBI invest\nTo be fully informed and what would I Would say is that they're not fully informed because what we\nDid not get was an FBI investigation\nAs FBI investigations are typically conducted they did not interview many many many witnesses who are identified both by Dr Ford by ms Ramirez and by others who would have had important critical information and even corroborating information and so the\nSenators frankly are not fully informed and casting their vote\nThere there is some evidence that this is having a galvanizing effect on both parties I made it there is some evidence that\nRepublicans are now much more interested in the midterms than they had been previously Democrats are showing similar things that there's there's some evidence that it is kind of energizing both sides if that's the case what do you or what his doctor for think about that\n[noise] I think what she has done is in credibly important in that she has given a voice to hundreds of thousands of women across the country and throughout the world and so I think that that can't be underestimated and\nThis is going to be an important moment we're going to look back on it and we may be looking back on it in November it may have an impact on November and it it may not I don't know I think it will because it has raised a lot of passions and concerns among the American people\nAnd it's a debate we're going to continue to have beyond this weekend and beyond November\nThat was Lisa Banks one of the attorneys for Christine Blasey Ford I spoke with her yesterday before the final confirmation vote\nMm Mm\nWeek Amazon announced a minimum wage increase for upwards of three hundred and fifty thousand workers starting on November first the pay will start at Fifteen dollars an hour it's a bold move\nThe minimum wage increase for upwards of three hundred and fifty thousand workers starting in November first the pay will start at Fifteen dollars an hour it's a bold move with the nation's second largest private employer but as the new cells in some Amazon employees have started to consider the other side of the equation the loss of monthly bonuses and some stock benefits\nWe decided to check in with some Amazon workers from across the country to find out their thoughts\nMy name is Emily buyers I'm forty three years old I work at Jefferson ville Indiana at at Amazon so on a day to day basis I Will work on a computer and just to make sure that our bends match up physically and virtually so I've been at this film at center since it opened\nUp about six years ago\nAnd I am making fourteen forty but after the pay raise goes into effect I'll be making her out roughly sixteen\nAnd I have a son who does travel ball and for me this means more sports equipment more opportunities to go to tournaments that kind of thing so for myself and my family I Would rather have the money on my paycheck now than the way the two years for my stocks to vest\nI don't want to get my name but I'm a Packer at a facility that center on the west coast and I've been doing it for about a year iron Thirteen Seventy five\nAn hour and I will be earning Fifteen or five\nAn hour oh what's concerning us mainly is were given a monthly bonus and when our holiday season comes around that bonus essentially doubles and we're worried about not getting or pay out and making less\n... ... for the last three weeks I worked in the ... I started working in a store is a process and the government do you received a merchandise [noise]\n... in Miami I started working off the store is a process and the company that you received a merchandise and Maine to bring the inventory a star making them ... hours and now with the increase we're going to be making Fifteen dollars an hour after November first\nHow you feel very excited about it very happy because of their provider I now I can give to my farm and better quality and also I spend more time with my family because I don't have to be looking for short going full time job is going to change my life\nSo we wanted to hear more about this we called NPR's Alina Selyukh for more information about Elena welcome thank you so much for joining us thinking who tell us a little bit more about how this Fifteen dollar an hour wage will actually work out which Amazon employees are affected\nAmazon says that about two hundred and fifty thousand of their existing fulltime part-time temporary and seasonal workers who are hourly will get this race to Fifteen dollars an hour\nIn addition they are expecting to hire another hundred thousand employees for the holiday season and those folks will also start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nMost of the employees that we are talking about our warehouse workers\nWho do want to raise some of the points that were raised by the workers that we spoke with ... you could hear that some were very excited about it but others were concerned about their bonuses so particularly during the holiday season that you've been speaking with Amazon executives what does the company say about how the wage increase is a better deal\nSo there have been a few reports and a number of anonymous employees who have stepped up and said we're really upset about the law specifically about the monthly bonuses and the stock options are a little bit more complicated essentially used to be that some employees would get vested into the company and they would get\nThis big massive bumped from stocks two years later two years is a long time for somebody who works in a warehouse so the company\nBusted into the company and they would get this big massive bumped from stocks two years later two years is a long time for somebody who works in a warehouse so the company on that front of the company says\nPretty much majority of the of our workers told us they would rather get the money now than wait for two years for these stock options on the monthly bonuses it's a little bit more complicated\nThe company's response was pretty adamant they're saying it should not be the case that you are making less money with this Fifteen dollar minimum wage than you were before\nSo I took part of the confusion might arise from the fact that this wage increase in the other changes to compensation were announced very suddenly a lot of the employees didn't know that it was coming\nIdea why why why did they announce it so suddenly and why no\nOne is kind of known for making really big announcements kind of out of the blue they keep a lot of really big things close to the vest up at the top of the company um Amazon executives that I've spoken with did tell me that the conversation at the top level was happening for quite some time and they just decided it wasn't worth waiting for anything they might as well just roll with it\nBut one really big thing to keep in mind is that Amazon has been under pressure for quite some time to show that they do treat their workers well there have been a state of stories a highlighting some of the more um questionable activities at some specific warehouses around the country and overseas\nThere was that big a criticism that Amazon got when the company released their median income number the median income was released as twenty eight thousand four hundred and forty six dollars this is just above poverty level for family of four\nRadio players will be there with our new music director Mike

Dyke testified that he felt threatened by McDonald\nA podcast called sixteen shots from member station WBFO easy in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune has been following the trial it's included riveting conversations with people from all walks of life were connected to the story including with officer Van Dyke and there was tape from the courtroom when the jury returned to\nVerdict we measure

might welcome thank you so much for talking with us once again thank you so let's start with the current state of things and then we'll talk more broadly how would you describe the reaction when the verdict came in and what's the mood of the city now\nThe reaction was one I think of overwhelming relief um there was some disappointment among people who have been following the trials especially activists who believed Jason Van Dyke should have been found guilty of first degree murder\nBut there's also the sense that this is just one case you know in in the seven years leading up to Van Dyke shooting ... McDonald fatally CBD shut nearly four hundred people and all of those shootings were found to be justified and so there's this sense\nThat this is one officer one case but this is not indicative of reform\nWhat are the police saying about this and are there people who continue to support officer Van Dyke\nWe heard from the head of the F O P the fraternal order of police who said that really this was a problem of of\nOfficer Van Dyke we heard from the head of the F O P the fraternal order of police who said that really this was a problem of of a lack of officers on the street that officers didn't have access to enough tasers but that Jason Van Dyke was essentially responding to the training he'd been given so that's the overwhelming sentiment\nUm but there has been a stronger response as well from some circles people saying you know officers are going to stop policing act differently if this is how they're going to be judged when they're on the street doing their jobs\nWell we'll just have some of the riveting moments of the trial\nI think the big moment of course when when Jason Van Dyke took the stand and testified to you know how that they started for him waking up and spending time with his wife and children and\nStarting his day not with an expectation that he was going to have to fire his weapon that day but also hearing from the psychologist the defense team put on the stand um who brought actually a piece of evidence that was damaging for Jason Van Dyke um in in his conversations with band I\nAh the officer said that driving into the situation he said to his partner something to the fact that we're gonna have to shoot this guy or why are they not firing on this guy but he's not responding to command\nThe jury took that to heart and and to them it said when Jason Van Dyke arrived on the scene he had the intention of pulling his weapon of firing a shot and and that was a bit of damaging testimony\nNow you've mentioned in ... reported on the fact that this opened up some strong feelings in the city about policing and a number of other issues do you have a sense that this is going to bring closure to some of these refs or does it just to keep them kind of laid open\nIt it certainly doesn't bring closure we're looking at decades' worth of history of abusive holy\nThem kind of laid open it it certainly doesn't bring closure we're looking at decades' worth of history of abusive\nPolicing practices or after the video was released to the shooting\nThe department of justice came in and investigate it CPT thoroughly and and came away saying listen there is a policy in practice when it comes to especially black and brown communities in Chicago where police are over policing where there are abusive practices\nAnd someone talking to activists who are pushing for police perform again they say this is one case that we think some degree of justice was done but when we look at the police department as a whole you know what is reform look like\nYou know what is it going to look like moving forward is this consent decree in the city is in the process of\nEnacting a consent decree to reform the police department but isn't going to be effective because there have been promises in the past that the police department was going to be reformed there have been different panels for them to try to hold police accountable for their actions and none of that has worked so what's going to happen from here\nAt ... she's the host of sixteen shots that's a podcast from WB easy in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune that's been following
