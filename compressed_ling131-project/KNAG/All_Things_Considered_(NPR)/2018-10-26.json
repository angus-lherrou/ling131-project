you\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered I'm Audie Cornish and I'm Mary Louise Kelly the search is on for the person or persons who sent at least ten suspicious packages to prominent Trump critics this week\nHere in Washington attorney general has condemned the bomber and said he is determined to ensure justice is done in New York police and elected officials are briefing the media here's police commissioner James O'Neill\nOr can say with certainty that we will identify interested person or people responsible for these acts\nOK NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson is here Hi Kerry hey Mary Louise so many moving parts that seems like today catch us up on where the investigation stands\nThe FBI has confirmed it's investigating ten suspicious packages these are bomb like devices contained in manila envelopes and sent to a who's who of well known critics of President Trump\nThey include former president Brock Obama former vice president Joe Biden former attorney general Eric Holder former CIA director John Brennan former secretary of State Hillary Clinton and congresswoman Maxine Waters and this morning we learned that actor and prominent Trump critic Robert De Niro had received one of the package and ... at an address link to him in New York\nCommon denominator is that these are people that President Trump himself has called out and campaign stops in speeches and tweets\nAbout the packages themselves and the fact that none of them actually exploded or hurt anybody which is great news of course but does that tell us anything about the investigation\nAuthorities are tight lipped about whether any of these devices may have exploded a or had the potential to explode them here hills are at the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia for review there\nAre any of these devices may have exploded a air had the potential to explode them here you are at the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia for review they're an FBI official says part of that review was already under way they're going to be looking for things like fingerprints or DNA for insights into how these devices were made\nAnd the FBI's assistant director William Sweeney says the powder and at least some of these on bulbs does not appear to pose a biological threat important clue they're a former official at the ATF the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives who is reviewed some images of these devices say they don't appear to work\nThere is some hazardous material there he says but the images that he's seen seemed to lack a second power source that would produce an actual explosion and there's also a really big underlying question about the motive here if these devices were not meant to exploded the bomber just want to scare people and intimidate them\nAnd did that with that happening for political or personal reasons all of that is a big focus of this investigation or it so if we don't know the motive do we have any clue as to who we are talking about who the who the suspect is at this briefing in New York investigators we're not talking about individual suspects here's what we do know\nIn Flagstaff Seventy nine into donut in Seventy

this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Audie Cornish eight hundred US troops are headed to the U.S Mexico border the Trump Administration is sending them to assist with immigration and Customs Enforcement this as a caravan of about a thousand migrants tries to make its way to that border\nThat caravan and how the u._s. should respond have become a central issue in the quickly approaching midterms\nWere going to dig into this with Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee and we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you well Marilyn how are you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border\nWhich as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nWell it's certainly troubling that uh we have created incentives in our immigration system an insurance partly because we really reward illegal immigration we really need to have is the legal immigration system that works and where there is there are consequences for illegal immigration\nI Want to get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding\nIn Mexico as their so called caravan makes its way north Mexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it is\n[noise] well I I Know they'd call it a national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the multi year flood of individuals coming from\nCentral America is on a company children ... set of eyes by laws were passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again\nCompany children and I was failing units set of eyes by laws we passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country illegally because once they get here our legal system allows him to stay\nIn the interest of sorting fact from fiction at a couple of questions to your knowledge senator are unknown middle Easterners part of this caravan and marching toward the U.S border\nI don't know about this caravan but I Know when I Tour de the northern Arab countries with Ben southern command General Kelly I heard a new term I'd never heard before essays special interest aliens when was there that were ... that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen\nAnd I've never heard the term special interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican and\nCentral American immigrants and we've been tracking that now truthfully it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds as opposed we're dealing with tens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nYou would not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts as they are in twenty times so I I I'm definitely a very fact based individual absolute of course yes or no any evidence of middle Easterners in this and that I've had that I I Do not have any specific evidence in this chair bad\nBut it it wouldn't surprise me if there were some effect check up a second claim with the new President Trump has suggested that Democrats are somehow involved with instigating this caravan might let me tell you what he said\nDemocrats want caravans they liked the care of it is a lot of people say I wonder who started the caravan [noise]\nAs President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support that Democrats somehow started this caravan well they certainly are are not\nHelping us change the law so we can end these and sent\nTo support that Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not helping us change the law so we can end these incentives I mean let's face it some of them their solution is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people in this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely counterproductive\nI Do want to get to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from this ask you the direct question that has on some people's minds that this so called caravan is a manufacturing controversy drummed up to energize Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again what I've read about is this occurred in Honduras or people opposed to a prison Hernandez down there and in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what I've heard read news reports\n[noise] let me ask you about Congress's role in trying to fix this are you optimistic that something will happen in this next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done these last two years\nWell part of my proudest chairman homeland security most of these laws aren't under my major's diction we've got another my Comey's jurisdiction because Senate this year I was able to move forward and and working with my colleagues I got there agree with that I could start handling this so I'm trying to go through this as a business person would\nA problem solver gather information find areas of agreement in our community we you know we all agree what to secure the border that we have to have\nReasonable silence standards that are maintained we want enforce our laws and then we don't separate families so try to go through a problem solving process very transparent very open very detailed and see if we just can't fix one aspect of this and then maybe successful breeds success\nSenator thanks so much for your time everyday Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin many of the
