nominated but I think that his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nTo Americans so these are not he said she said questions that are being raised these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think\nSure well we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to guard who\nKnow him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week will testifying\nWell that that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught\nAgainst him and his reputation and his family that he would have acted like an all time and time I had by the way he acted\nLike in ... I think the response would have been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation\nAt the at the charges that he was facing so I think Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if you did and damned if you did at the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as a Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of it is absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man\nThe way he acted like in ...

conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice\nForeign sure one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not basing relief based on any political or personal beliefs and he is not about the sacrifice that wealth is er reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court\nI wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter Ginsburg had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the all you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either but to that specific\nRemarketing or he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit ... do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question that he found the tactics\nOf some of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate but when it comes to rolling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because he was mad that Cory Booker headed Spartacus moment\nHe was the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to

he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he uh he said there are some things I shouldn't have said what thanks get what you do not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break you apologize to center ... uh for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the

it's now three point seven percent according to the government's monthly employment report today's news is a big positive for many workers but a challenge for businesses NPR's John Ydstie has the story\nSarah houses senior economist at Wells Fargo says it's hard to overstate the significance of this super low unemployment rate\nI think it's a huge\nAnd house says the lowest unemployment rate in half a century has businesses scrambling\nThat top concern or hearing front and players if they can't find more hurry that\nCould limit their ability to grow their companies and put a drag on the overall economy but how says that's historically low jobless rate is a positive for many workers\nIt off of course has ... implications for wages\nThere are signs that wage growth is finally picking up as employers are being forced to boost pay to attract and keep workers\nEconomist Dean Baker says low wage workers are among those benefiting partly because many cities and states have raised minimum wages to September jobs data showed average wages growing at just to point eight percent over the past year but lower income workers experienced much bigger gains\nFor point three percent of last year so some of the minimum wage law but I think some of that is\nAre signs that wage growth is finally picking up as employers are being forced to boost pay to attract and keep

at just to point eight percent over the past year but lower income workers experienced much bigger gains\nFor point three percent over the last year so some of the minimum wage law but I think some of that is the tightening labor market\nAnd Baker says the super low unemployment rate is helping those at the bottom of the economic ladder finally get a toehold in the first wrong\nWhen you start to get the unemployment rate down to slow the people who benefited disproportionately those bottom so you're seeing people that historically not been able to get jobs at least recently not been able to get jobs the markets opening up to them\nBlack teenagers are a good example the black teen unemployment rate hit a record low in September that's the good news bad news is that it's still above Nineteen percent\nAnd that's why Baker believes the Federal Reserve should not panic and start raising interest rates more rapidly to keep the economy from overheating\nSo who should get the credit for engineering this low unemployment rate\nThe White House took some credit today touting President Trump's policies on deregulation tax cuts and trade former President Obama also get some credit for reducing the unemployment rate by more than half during his administration\nBaker who is senior economist at the center for economic research and policy says both administrations have a case but\nThe fed is really a hero\nBaker says remember that just four years ago the consensus among fed policymakers was that once the unemployment rate fell below five\nRight the White House took some credit today touting President Trump's policies on deregulation tax cuts and trade former President Obama also get some credit for reducing the unemployment rate by more than half during his administration\nBaker who's senior economist at the center for economic research and policy says both administrations have a case but\nThe fed is really a hero\nBaker says remember that just four years ago the consensus among fed policymakers was that once the unemployment rate fell below five and a half percent inflation pressures were built\nA lot of them wanted to raise interest rates are said you know look down upon makes getting too low you have a problem with inflation\nBut former fed chair Janet Yellen said let's wait and see what happens and that's what the fed did finally it began raising rates gradually and has continued that pace under the Fed's current leader Jerome Powell\nIf you followed the view of many people on the fed and many other economists\nThey would start to slam on the brakes the unemployment rate got around five percent or they never would've allowed it to get this low\nAnd Baker says that would have meant millions of people might not have gotten the jobs they now have John Ydstie NPR News Washington [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\n[noise]\nThis is Kenny you Arizona Public radio good afternoon
