attack and during the service each name was read out loud and candles were let in their memory a pastor wrestle ... said he that he held a special service to show his congregation support for the Jewish community and their time of need\nOur intent was to express our solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters a member of those who were killed ah to offer prayers um but as I mentioned in my my Sherman to also find our voice you know we often say that we offer our prayers and thoughts\nAnd that is fine but we must do more we must put those prayers into action we must give them all age and with our boys and with our actions we can ensure that this hatred is not the new American way you can not be\nDo you have a sense that there are some people who might have been afraid to come out

is welcome to science writer everyone is welcome and and normally welcome but to be celebrated what was the attendance like today was it more than you expected we had a couple of ah folks from the Jewish community come at the beginning\nAnd to offer their words of Thanksgiving they did not stay to worship but they did come and to say thank you for joining us it makes a difference\nIf I ask you

baby naming ceremony was ... was being held in the presence of children hit very close to home\nWell this church has recently in kind of been coming up with plans what to do in case of the situation like that of course is the nursery attendant that has always been something that's been on my mind to start here because I'm responsible for eight or nine children at a time\nAnd how I Would evacuating and then from the building or hide them in a situation if it were to come down to it\nSo I just running through my head penance plans that I've come up for years\nReally and is that what occurred to you yesterday when you heard about what happened were you thinking okay what would I Do in that situation\nYeah I grew up post Columbine so as a child um even in first grade we had drills even back then of what to do if there was an active shooter in the school and my whole life I grew up in public school constantly hearing about stuff like that Sandy Hook happened when I was in high school or things like that just always\nAnd my whole life I grew up in public school constantly hearing about stuff like that tiny hook happened when I was in high school or things like that just always kind of was in the back of my mind and it's kind of a shadow that I guess a lot of American Kids are growing up with these days\nI don't know whether to be happy or sad\nYou know that you have that somehow it hurts me to think that you have to think about that instead of thinking about what fun games to play\nYeah it's not it's not a plan anyone wants to have but it's become a reality that you to be in that situation not have thought of something or to be in that situation and to have you know you you are the last protection for those children and that's what you have to be thinking

away at the beginning there was a a Baptist choir and African American Baptist choir singing I mean this is an event hosted by the Jewish community but it was a clear symbol of the\nOf the whole Pittsburgh community standing in solidarity and the music was beautiful and really soothing to many in the crowd there were people weeping including reporters\nUm I'd say they're maybe three thousand people inside and as I left to come out and speak with you I had to pass through another three thousand people sitting outside in what's now very chilly rain listening to the same service over over speakers\n... cents lovely now um you also spent some time uh in squirrel hill the neighborhood where this attack occurred what was the mood there [noise]\nYeah I mean people were out and scroll hill trying to kind of have their normal life in a way of farmers markets are people going to Sunday services and you could see the diversity of the community it's notably Jewish but it's really a bit of everything\nThey were trying to be normal but they're also trying to explain this I spoke to a woman coming out of the sixth president Presbyterian Church Brittany story and she's in eighth grade English teacher she just friday took her students to the Holocaust museum in Washington DC here's what she said\nI came in\nShe just friday took her students to the Holocaust museum in Washington DC

them the space I have\nProcess a half and what they thought they were really moved by the family the Holocaust or weak\nAnd people were saying that you know in the little town like this you never think can happen but in today's America they realized it can happen anywhere\nAnd and to that point this is a a a a smallish city and the victims of the shooting were identified this morning and people are probably just finding out that they may known someone who was affected how are people absorbing this\nYeah it's another wave of shocked to hear the names I ran into Dan Franco he's the he's the state represented Pennsylvania state representative from this district he went to Hebrew school at the tree of life when he was eleven years old and he knew a two the two brothers who were killed David in Cecil Rosenthal he was really sad\nAnd they were really specials men who are known for many years and whenever I go\nTo a tree of life for a bar mitzvah or a wedding or some kind of case and

assault rifle and massacre eleven people in twenty minutes while they were praying\nMost of these people were old enough to be grandparents for the community is trying to take action they say they want to do something they say they talk about guns they talk about trying to tone down their rhetoric in this country and many of them talked about upcoming elections in and wanting to be active\nThat is NPR's Quil Lawrence cool thank you\nThank you and as you just heard we've been talking quite a bit today about how people are mourning and how they're trying to make sense of this tragedy but it's not just adults who are trying to make sense of yesterday's shooting and tragedies like this that are unfortunately all too common a lot of people are thinking about their children\nAnd how to talk to them about tragedies like this NPR's Sarah McCammon has been reporting on that story and she's back with us in the studio Sarah thanks so much for coming back and doing this sort of thing and I understand that you actually covered a lot of these shootings and this is something that is really on people's minds\nAnd fortunately I've covered several of these now in my career as a journalist and you know anytime there isn't a senseless act of violence especially especially these mass shootings it's it's hard to explain it to children especially for people in the area and the community affected\nI it's impossible though for kids not to hear about it right in the news and their their friends and neighbors are talking about it even if they're not directly involved in the tragedy I found a lot of people struggle with how to talk to their children how to explain things and not terrified that\nSo you did we mentioned earlier that you went to the synagogue neighborhood outside the synagogue he also in other places tell us about that\nYeah I actually went over to the children's museum here in Pittsburgh it's a pretty famous really really great one actually and uh they have opened it up to the public for free this week Monday through friday or they want a place for families to to go and feel safe and comfortable they say\nAnd today was a pretty normal busy day at the museum and and uh staffers were thinking about ways to to reach out to families today too I met a woman named Jesse live than she was ...\nStay at the museum and and uh staffers were thinking about ways to to reach out to families today too I met a woman named Jesse live and she was hanging out with her family and she said something I've been hearing repeatedly and talking to people in Pittsburgh today\nJust that you hear it happening everywhere but you never really think it's happening here\nShe says she's not sure how to broach the subject with her two kids ages four and six we're from Canada so\nIt was very new to us living here for the last year to start seeing more regularly [noise]\nAcross the room at least the Hoffman was also unsure what to tell her two kids ages six and three about what they're seeing in the news\nIt's hard to [noise]\nPut it into a contract where they understand um\nYou know so we haven't really talked about it yeah I\nWe will Hoffman grew up in the Pittsburgh area and was back here to visit family and like so many here she has ties to\nSend a lot of my\nFriends have five bar mitzvah that tree of life I have\nAttendance Sunday school because my best friend growing up was Jewish and that's where she went so it was just really [noise]\nPricing upsetting you know disappointing that that\nPeople get these thoughts in their head and and do it [noise]\nYou know and I think that they [noise]\nDevon bill runs the make shop a play and cross area for the kids she says the museum staff has been grappling with how to help children and their parents during this scary time [noise]\nSo today it's hard to be at work\nKnow that we are the helpers here and we are the ones offering support for those families and children while we are also struggling with our own feelings\nThe helpers here and we are the ones offering support for the families and children while we are also struggling with their own feeling [noise]\nBut the way that I'm looking at it\nYou know we are part of a community together at all and I'm being\nWith the community right now feels are important and powerful for me to\nAbout\nDid the current sort of political anger and conflict playing uh so I Know that investigators are going to be going through his computer files are going to be going through his home they're going to be talking to folks who know him who might have worked with in family members friends\nI kind of thing but Julie ... of the New York times who's been reporting on the background of Robert Bauer as the accused synagogue shooter thank you very much\nThank you President Trump will travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow at today's White House briefing press secretary Sarah Sanders condemned anti Semitism and set the hatred must stop\nCritics of the president said his campaign rhetoric is raising tensions and widening divisions even as the country is still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd here's our usual Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey there hello so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president and she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent\nIt did was condemned the attack are on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media beers responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media\nUh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on this rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week oh what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent this is who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the solar in chief or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is or when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy\nUh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren using this belittling nickname for her\nJob [noise] I guess she doesn't have it is more than she does and I have no\n... and since that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling him with beef without evidence in many ways\nAs the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling you must be without evidence in many ways like you said this is what his support is likely expect from him but what his critics will argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that\nIs that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences be in the mid term what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\nIt's very hard to tell A People's views the Trump or as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so you really don't know whether this is going to change any votes\nOr the risk of course is that maybe some lukewarm ... supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents could get really fired up but we'll just have to see what happens next week\nThat's NPR White

card there are barriers more razor wire fencing crossing points\nAnd they'll also transport border agencies to more remote locations by cargo aircraft and helicopter there's also a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so\nThese soldiers were also built camps provide housing medical assistance camp kitchens for these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all legal there's a law called ... which prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders and the U.S this is this is all legit\nAt well that that's what the officials say they

edition by asking your smart speaker to play NPR or your station by name\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nIt's for forty four with and I'm sexy clear with Arizona Public radio news from Flagstaff\nA report from the United nations Intergovernmental Panel on climate change says the planet has already warmed by one degree Celsius due to human activity since the industrial revolution\nAnd it's on track to get hotter thousands of experts contributed to the report which warns the world's carbon emissions need to reach net zero by the year twenty fifty to avoid catastrophic environmental changes\nCan they use Melissa ... spoke with northern Arizona university scientist Christina she do about the findings\nWhat kind of changes are we seeing from climate change here in Arizona a match and if you have any more days in Phoenix for example the temperatures go adopt one hundred degree Fahrenheit and that will be even more when it goes about scientists\nIn Phoenix for example where temperatures go above one hundred degrees Fahrenheit and there will be even more when it goes up off one hundred and Fifteen so we have this already now sometimes in the summer and it's not pleasant and if we have even more you have a really skyrocketing air conditioning costs for example\nAnd other aspect is that the water supply and Arizona is going to change drastically and it's going to become very unreliable every place we'll see some form of climate change it will not be the same in every location but there's literally no one who will not be affected by climate\nChange so we're talking about um things that affect our economy um things that affect tourism for example um but also some of these things are potentially life threatening things like heat waves\nYes he drew it can be very life threatening and the problem with that is that you can have your car air condition and you has air conditioned but it will cost you a lot more in the future and not everyone can afford that and I think that's a really important aspect of climate change just as well there is this so called climate injustice\nWhich means rich people can probably cope with it to some extent better than those that have their little money\nRight yeah the report really emphasized but not everybody's going to feel the effects of climate change equally\nThat is very true and I also think it's important to say that here in Flagstaff we may not be affected so much by sea level rise but there are millions of people worldwide that are affected by sea level rise and they often are\nAmongst the poorest yeah the climate injustice topic is very difficult on there is a moral aspect to it I think\nThis issue has kind of a sense of urgency because of that do you think we can make the changes we need to make by twenty fifty\nYes we we can make the changes and we have to make them soon\nImmediately basically and\nMake by twenty fifty yes we we can make the changes and we have to make them soon\nImmediately basically and I think what is important is to you know it's not a geophysical impossibility so we can still do it but it needs a joint effort of governments industry in society and we cannot rely on others to do something they have to do it ourselves\nWhat we're talking about these are really big processes and I think a lot of people when they hear about climate change it feels like it's too big of an issue like there's just nothing they can do how do how do you personally deal with that\nI sometimes feel despair as well and I'm sometimes also overwhelmed by the topic but then I also realize just\nBeing depressed about it is not going to change anything and there are things that every person can do that if we all do it it actually it really makes a big difference and so for example I tried to bike to work and to reduce my electricity consumption at home I eat less meat and things like this\nBut one thing that everyone can do is is a vote for someone who has an agenda that includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions and things like this so I think that that's actually a really important aspect that you can do because\nIt just riding your bike to work is probably not enough Christina shadow and keep so much for talking with me today You're welcome it was a pleasure\nBut was carrying a use ... speaking with Christina should all of northern
