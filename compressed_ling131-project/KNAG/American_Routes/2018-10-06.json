America and blue America look at the exact same about income to radically different conclusions\nAnd to me this one feels the worst I think because the original hearing itself with Dr Ford and judge

we've had this one\nBut can I say for me again for me\nOf all the moments we've had these last few years where red America\nAnd blue America look at the exact same event and come to radically

witnesses were so emotionally wrong\nThat even watching it was a motion was upsetting\nAnd then since that hearing we've had this week of waiting for the FBI report which held us all for a week in

the Senate wait for a new FBI investigation than he was a yes again\nA British is do we choose to spend a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode you did recording him for months and then he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill and she was with them in the days before and after the Kavanaugh hearing watching what is going through and talking to him about how we made his choices there's always\nThe first thing I Want to talk about the elevator okay it's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator\nHere

FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said in that elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country flick and declared that he'll be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination than English confronted by a mob of screaming protesters the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake crumbled\n... was one of the two women and that

more scarce that day\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not the one time he spoke and hearing he sounded just as insurer as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nIs not a good process but it's all we've got and I would just urge my colleagues to recognize that and then we are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best
