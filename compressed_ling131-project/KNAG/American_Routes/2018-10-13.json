[noise]\n\nAll right here we go we go [noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there [noise] so that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything just timing the response\nWasn't great that wasn't attorneys ... first yeah oh yeah it was it was on the doors [noise]\n\nWe said so controversial to put guns into school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to though I I talked to John\nThe principal about this yeah um for a long time he agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he says he's not a gun guy didn't grow up with guns had never used one\nThey came to the school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have its own beliefs\nYeah oh yeah it was it was the doors [noise]\n\nThey said so controversial to put guns into a school like

school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have it some police force so if a shooter got in the building they could be waiting a long time for help\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right thing to do but\nYou know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you worry you worry because you realize that you're on your own and and so\nI wanted to learn [noise]\nSo I went out and started learning how to shoot a gun and how to handle a gun\nAnd which is different you know first time you shoot a gun that's pretty scary scary to me\nAfter that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd would exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target tells close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision\nThis is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around how close to you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target\nYou've got to shoot

example out there that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained her students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation\nJust came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nI don't think they could have been more prepared than anywhere I say I mean they knew what to do I mean you\nEven sell even with that we still had\nCasualties kind of the people that are going\nDid the training they received save lives that day or didn't it was actually an open question whether it produces Robin

clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner she believes in a good hard think and being proactive\nOnce she and the other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills the whole school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying when you're the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the cage and go through all the emergency procedures this is what we do for ...\nEvery period for every dish is what a code black and this is what we do for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kid was you have to do it with each and every class because they wanted to make sure that the kids\nStand in front

anticipating what Melissa and Ashley were a surprise active shooter trail using blanks\n[noise]\nAfter those two boys tour around the corner yelling at the shooter at the shooter actually stood for another second in our doorway still confused then she plans to her left all the way down the hall just set of open doors to face the freshman building\nI see like hundreds of kids running out of the freshmen building flicking terrified you know when you see terrified kids running like that and it's they they're not there there is no rhyme or reason it was chaos and then you hear that you can hear the gunshots and it's just it's that is not\nWhat the drill was she knew it was real [noise]\n[noise]\nFor like the next Ninety seconds as kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running to stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of kids that are running\nThey're they're not there there is no rhyme or reason it was chaos and then you hear that you can hear the gunshots and it's just it's that is not\nWhat the drill was she knew it was real\n\nFor like the next Ninety

group a smaller group\nKids that are running towards the freshman building um and I was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nWow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total body is in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people and\nYes it was [laughter]\nYes it was laughing\nThere were terrified people running and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that I\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said

of her emergency folder she kinda Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway the group is small enough to fitness applied cause it must have told them to leave their\nBackpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and moved there in the closet it was hot and dark except students face as led by their cell phones and Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third floor the freshman building she ... she's on the tax cuts that says there's a shooter there's a shooter in my floor\nUm and so my my friend Sara says\nDrill or actual and she says actual my window is blown out and then she told us she had been graced by a bullet she was raised in her arm by a bullet\nAnd I didn't hear from her for a while\nIn our one by\nHeard noises in the hallway um we got really quiet um I had had a flashlight part of my phone on so that we could kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was open with the key\nUm and so then I could hear movement and around and then somebody not comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police officers that this is a police anyone in here and then there was like\nAn hour walk by\nWe heard noises in the hallway um we got really quiet um has it has a flashlight part of my phone on so that we could kind of like

comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police officers that this is a police anyone in here and then there was like\nKind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police as anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is a police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is a police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time they set it on my couch or what I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly at the handle and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they have their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were cops\nAnd so I just very slowly ... than you pulled on the handle pushed it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWas uh told me that actually it was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEven did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy held her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yells to you know Scott below the closest door and grabs the handle with two hands and pulls it closed\n'em so her door was open up to the to

for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare [noise] but now Melissa and actually has been in a rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both\nTold me that having a playbook for what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class and now I Move us all to a closet [noise]\nBut they also both had ideas coming out of this about ways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has saved lives and mass shootings\nI really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help\nDid more kids survive because of it\nWhat might have worked better show Johnson research is what's effective in these drills at Xavier University and it's a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U.
