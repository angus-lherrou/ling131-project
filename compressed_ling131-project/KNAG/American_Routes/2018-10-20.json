the other half days of the story that is so small it almost feels wrong to tell it in a room this ground it's actually about a real opera singer not\nSuper famous upper singer or anything like that person go free makes about half of our living singing the other half she makes a recording audio books\nAbout a year ago she was staying at a hotel and she had a deadline when the children's book that she was supposed to be recording and hotel room was kind of noise is using a lot of noise from the street as you'll drive for quiet places you went into the closet put pillows all around to dead and the sound\nSound before we microphone and then the court and the microphone\nBy places you went into the closet put pillows all around to dead and the sound sound on the floor with a microphone and then the court and the microphone went under the door of the closet out to her laptop because her laptop had a fair that make noise closes the door so it's pitch dark\nExcept for the light from her eye pad which had the text of the book that she was supposed to read and she began\nBe exciting exploits an ... else written by Tricia sugar wreck and married it by kind give free\nChapter one way or is Anna the and chanted\nForest was deep and green and splashed with places like would it be incredible if I just now play do the entire audio book [noise]\nHe paid like eighty five bucks for that seat [noise]\nActually I can put you to hold audio book because car and gets exactly like two and half sentences into this book and she stumbled in words as I said oh wait I just I'll just start again at the start from the beginning so she gets up to go to the closet and started the tape again started recording again and ah she tried to get out of the closet [noise]\n\nAnd she's ... she's locked them [noise]\n[laughter]\nOh my God [noise]\nThe guy told me at first she thought like this isn't going to be that hard right after all she has the eye pad his wife I should call the front desk on Skype right and there was a problem\nThis life I was like half of one bar and it kept just cutting out but I found the hotel number this course is on the recording into six six one nine six series yeah\nBut I found the hotel number this courses on the recording\nInto six six one nine six series yeah down there [noise]\n\nThank you for calling the road outside of town and carefully to the following option\nFor additional information about the hotel we look at our website\nAnd then of course I like the longest hotel phone menu ever\nAnd catering service ... for counting platform\nFor the human resources officer staff\nAnd like trying to pressure zero to get to the operator and I'm thinking the wife I was going to cut out at any moment so I'm listening to like this giant long menu and finally I hear\nIs that anytime you wish you the to an operator from eight [noise] eight [noise]\nBrittany ... Hi I'm actually in room eleven certain effects can you hear me can you hear me [noise] [noise]\nAfter that the seven minutes of silence on the recording just like total silence nothing happens except every now and then turn just laughed to herself [noise]\nOne minute and forty seconds after the phone call then it's quiet there's no other sounds for forty four seconds and then when the recording you're here [laughter] [noise]\nNow and then she tries to door handles again thinking she told me later you know just can't really be true I just can't there's got to be with us going to work\nWhile it because it has the hallway on the other side and Eighteen minutes after car washes up in she hears people\nGot to be with us going to work one wall of the closet has the hallway on the other side and Eighteen minutes after car locked up in she hears people she hears some German tourists walking towards her down the hall and fortunately she actually has the skills\nFor this very situation [noise]\nGermans come to the door of the room the whisper to each other for a little bit\nAnd then they do nothing [noise]\n[laughter]\n[noise]\nHer husband is I don't know dish and he's also a singer

stage and horses and of vengeance and big grand feeling it was really it would really be hard to get further from that\nTo what happened to her in that closet right all the action takes place in space not much bigger than your body it isn't as simple as pot imaginable there's literally no movement in this plot if someone were to stage this as an opera how would that go [laughter]\nUm it might be minimalist music actually a right\nLike just repeating theme over and over and over again\nWith me yelling help\nPeople say those kinds of things in interviews and then I'll put that quote at the end of the story and makes sending put a little funky music under it and maybe you've heard our show [noise]\nBut when we did this interview like three or four weeks ago I wrote\nA witness and every once
