Q and a nine point the past\nScreaming at K. innate you job or\nCanyon ... kids and he ... the past\nScreaming at ... you got on [noise]\nIt's eleven o'clock [noise]\nOh\n[noise] someone in Manhattan so late last covert action in the New Yorker WNYC studio ...\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick\nWhen we first began learning of Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election which seemed absolutely mind boggling at the time something that just couldn't happen he was often said that Russia had hacked the election we quickly learn to more specific\nMore accurate way of putting it Russia had influence the election by manipulating political messages on Facebook and so on but they hadn't exactly gone into election computer systems an altered the results not exactly now if foreign agents could actually change the outcome of an election that would be and you can say this lightly\nAn existential threat to American democracy but what we've learned since twenty sixteen is if somebody really did want to ... election it wouldn't be impossible not at all to help and has been writing for the New Yorker about election security and what she's found should scare us all\nLogan lamb is a security researcher in Georgia I'm generally a curious guy I enjoy the poking around part I like to do that in my free time in August twenty sixteen at the height of the presidential election you started poking around Kennesaw State University's Center for election systems\nWhich ran all the elections in Georgia\nOr in the course of doing that I did a very very simple Google Search 'em I said for the ... election suction assault dot edu or Google\nVery very simple Google Search 'em I said for the ... elections dot Kennesaw dot edu a Google please give me all of the PDF documents on this website and generally that turns up reports or public presentations and this\nThis particular search didn't turn that up instead I found it very curious links and I was presented with a very long list of what appear to be a vote or names in some sort of a dinner fire next to their name and I immediately thought wow that that seems a little strange\nAnd then he crafted a simple program to download what was publicly accessible from the George election website and when he found in all of that data astonished him\nThese documents contain supervisor passwords to be used on election\nDay there were also windows programs that are placed on electronic pull books\nYou don't need to be a cybersecurity expert to know that supervisor passwords should absolutely not be sitting around on line unprotected immediately\nI thought to myself while this this doesn't look like sort of data they would purposefully put on this Web server\nIn total lamb downloaded Fifteen gigabytes worth of data from the center for election systems this by itself will be a huge story but on top of that land also found security hole through which you could download the entire database of the state six point seven million registered voters\nI had access to their full name their address birthday last four digits of their Social Security number and their driver's license number and then there were also gyms databases and the gyms databases are used by the um\nLicense number and there were also gyms database and Jews databases are used by the um gym server which is the central tabulate er which does the final vote count\nIf Logan lamb had been a bad guy this would have been a bone answer [noise]\nThe scariest scenario I can think of would be an attacker implanting malware on the programs that are placed on the electronic pull books were altering the registration databases disenfranchised voters\nAn attacker could have compromise the Web server and used it as a beach head to get deeper into the center for election systems networks [noise]\nThis is right around the same time that the Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp rejected an offer from the department of homeland security to help the state harden the election system to protect it from hackers because Kemp said that the system was secure the way it was and that the state didn't want any help from the federal government\n\nIt wasn't until march of twenty Seventeen so seven months after lamb's initial finding that the system was finally patched then more information started to trickle out\nThe intercept published the NSA report that had been hacked about Russian cyber attacks election systems and the lead up to twenty Seventeen and later the more indictments found that the Russian hackers had looked for vulnerabilities to election servers in a number of states including Georgia [noise]\n[noise]\nWe have no idea if the Russians made alterations to Georgia's election systems in twenty sixteen and if they did we probably wouldn't know but this is a critical moment we know that foreign actors are interested in our election system just as we head into the midterms\nBut this is a critical moment we know that foreign actors are interested in our election system just as we head into the midterms a few months ago the director of national intelligence that the warning lights are blinking red some states took this seriously but others seem to have left themselves wide open\nWe're in a new world now we need we understand the states need to run elections that their authority but they're not cybersecurity experts Susan green hall is the policy director of the national election defense coalition\nSo you know you and I met at DEF CON where people were\nHacking lots of election machines left and right um so I Wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the problems in Georgia I'm with their machinery and perhaps even elsewhere since the same machines are used a cross country\nSure that the machines used in Georgia are computerized touch screen voting machines Georgia is one of five states that entirely had machine that don't have a paper ballot\nThen there's also other machines which ... paper about those are also computers and those machines can be hacked and have digital records changed within them and that's why\nHaving the paper ballot it's so crucial because it it's that linked to what the voter got to see and say that's how I voted and to be sure that that's what's counted currently\nElection security folks are on the ground and people who are the vendors that these machines insists that they're not really ... because they're not connected to the Internet\nAnd I wonder if you just explain why it is that there's this discrepancy in in um the explanation for the safety of these machines\nWhile many of the machines that you and I might interact with\nSee in in um the explanation for the safety of these machines\nWhile many of the machines that you and I might interact with on election day at our polling location\nWhether it's a touch screen voting machine or an optical scanner on may not be connected to the Internet it has to get programming information from\nAnother machine which is essentially desktop or regular laptop computer that program here are the candidates here the races here is how the ballot should lay out that information has to go from that computer to the\nVoting machine that's in the polling location by some sort of removable media and it's well known that if the device that is doing programming gets infected with malicious software it it can be transferred to the individual voting machines\nBut furthermore there's another factor that debunked that assertion which is that in many of these machines that are in the polling location\nAre equipped with wireless modems to transmit their election results back to the county headquarters on election night and those wireless modems go over a cellular networks and those cellular networks are part of the Internet [noise]\n[noise] we spent a lot of time talking about hacking voting machines or hacking vote tallies\nBut there's this new way of hacking an election and it has to do with the new restrictive voter ID laws in states like Ohio and North Carolina and Georgia\nThat purge voters from the voting rolls who haven't voted in previous elections whose names don't precisely match the name on the voter registration data\nBase [noise] personally this has been a concern for me because\nDon't precisely match the name on the voter registration data base [noise]\nPersonally this has been a concern for me because uh on election day in twenty sixteen people were showing up to vote in Durham county North Carolina and um their names weren't on the voter rolls are they in Durham Kennedy use electronic pull books\nAnd people were showing up and they were being told you're at the wrong polling location or you've already voted during early voting or you already voted absentee or your name is in here or your address has been changed the vendor\nA loan and see\nI'm going to miss the snow\nSee I'm\nGoing to miss the snow\nOn the B I miss the things that go on\nAnd on the tree\n[noise] gonna miss the ... [laughter] [noise]\nUm there's the animals and I miss you ever\nWant another\nAnother way\nI Need to know the play\nWell that he\nAnd he never\nThis one scene in nearly ... ... I'm\nThem they're singing all the ... I'm\nMeans the when\nIt's been kissing me so long\n[noise] another way\nAnother way\nAnother way\n[laughter]\n\nThat's the beauty of beauty isn't it do you ever ... you say we checked in with a new one\n\nWho's the beauty of beauty isn't it you do you ever seen were checked in with a known about the songs that they do how much do you tease out what the song is about\nOh I really try I didn't need to I mean for me it for me it's mostly about climate change you know\nBut you've you've been through a certain number of political moments [laughter]\nSixties and in many moments in between ... and just how does this seem\nSimilar a different [noise] um issues I couldn't have dreamed us up all the stuff I've been through and all the countries no dictatorships and ah [noise] I don't know\nUm and we're all that if somebody has had said can you stories about how bad can it get I couldn't have written it nor could anybody I Know\nThat it's just you know what we are facing in the administration is evil and it's it's cruel it's there's no empathy narrow embassy so um\nIt leaves you release me thinking how am I gonna conduct my life it's ... you know it's the year the bully and\nUm to bully people now seems to be okay the lying ... no problem no perjury and not a problem um notes that that is a new normal and how has it\nChanged the texture of your life day to day waking up in the morning as yeah proceed through the day well I think\nMean I've heard other people say the steward law oftentimes hits in the night in the form of this terrible anxiety and you realize that it's real I mean it's not some neurotic anxiety [laughter]\nAnxious about the state of the world which is terrible and so one thing is to one of my things I suggest spend a lot\nThe state of the world which is terrible and so one thing is to one of my things I suggest spend a lot of time in denial that's great advice yeah and um don't expect much I mean keep the bar really low yeah keep laughing\nYou know I I was just watching a documentary you forget which one it was because the ... the scene appears in so many documentaries of you singing at the march on Washington\nAnd I I I just wonder how you visualize in your mind moments like that in your life would you know distant and they're like comic in the minds of other people but you were you're there you're holding the guitar your microphone and it's kind of lousy sound system and seen [laughter] it was a half million people or whatever it was [noise]\nDo you think about these moments in your past and\nYou know I think as I get older sometimes I Do or somebody to show me a photograph\nI think oh my God I was there and those people were there and Dr King said what he said um and sometimes going into a quote historic moment you know it and other times you don't know it um in that case I think by midway through the morning you know we\nKnew it yeah yeah\nYou you mean there's some there's some times that you were in the middle of an event that turns out to be iconic and you have no idea I think festival a political moment\nYeah I'm just thinking about Woodstock and it was a little bit of both because I took the last helicopter in and looking down and seeing these ... literally aunt you know it just ... people\nAnd so I had a hand them over to this is going to be something very big but it was after the fact that you realize oh my goodness that's made a dent in people's lives forever and in your mind\nYou this next song that you're going to do I went to um Charleston\n[noise] ... you know this next song that you're going to do I\nWent to um Charleston not just days after the shooting to write about these families and these these ... relatives of people who lost people in the church there in his in his slaughter\nIt it was extraordinary and then the funeral that followed um that President Obama a win too it seems like a million years ago it does the idea of\nA president I'm capable of showing empathy to such a degree that not only is the crowd with him and he feels they feel like allies\nBut he's able to sing the song and begin the song yeah that lift people up as opposed to issue a tweet that depresses hello [laughter] um yeah how do you remember that that terrible incident and why did you decide to I'm covered the so\nWell covering their son was a no brainer I mean it was whatever feelings I had them in our future that song just dropped out of the sky shouldn't by the way most offered I did not know and most people didn't know and\nI Need to tune into every time I mean if I was quicker and tune out in that guitar and you're killing I'm not going to hear hearing loudly\nAnd they just go ahead yeah okay and then\nThen when\nA young man came to our house of man\nThey didn't\n\nYoung men came to our house of prayer and\nThey did not\nBrought him and he was not\nFriend he was not keen but they open the door\nAnd they let him me\nAnd for an hour the strangers the did he sat with them many seem to print any but then not young ...\nIn the world and only a\n...\nIn Charlotte and in the month of June Mm mourners gathered and ... the president came to speak some whatever\nAnd the cameras roll and the nation and her\nCould say what must be said for all\nRoom and so on that day\nI'm raising ... cheese the president said\n...\nWhen you\n...\nWe argue lay the blame a lot\nHanging around nation shame some sickness but the minute or so\nMight be made\nBut the minute or so\nMight be made whoa\nCould say what must be said and all the living and so on that day\nHe's the president sang\nAmazing grace my president\nA man thing or a ...\nMe\n[noise] wow [noise] yeah [noise] the last line is my president which is this just switch yeah for that President and vice president he says is the only president you felt of this and that way but um\nOkay I'm sixty five sixty\nEach night after a long track your call Eli give them his medical condition and his coordinates if he was ever in trouble he could call for what he referred to as the most expensive taxi ride in the world will be a rescue plane to pull him out\nHey they charge you are on drugs\nHe also called a friend in London so he could record an audio diary of its day ah which could then be posted on his website and it's updated listeners about what he was going through what he was eating what he was feeling\nGood evening everybody showing wave after wave of close calls\nIn a shorter life like race horses this\nSo [noise]\nHe wasn't credited naked licking\nHenry met his wife Joanne at a party in London in Nineteen eighty nine [noise]\nMost of my friends friends they are wild and we're also that someone in the special forces was very very glamorous and\nCould ...\nYou think it's great talking to people who are adventure as he had recently ...\nI could ventures paper\nI think it's great talking to people who are adventure as\nHe had recently completed his selection course for the special ear service or SAS a legendary a leak commando unit\nIn many ways he enjoying a were opposites uh she hates the cold or she could think of any more dreadful place in the world than Antarctica\nYet for all their differences they shared a similar sensibility\nReally was a tree ... tray\nHe loved to tell me he did tapestry\nHe stitched the most wonderful\nCaseloads ... getting across the snow\nHe loves the history of all these old explorers and\nHe glamorize satellites that his head\nLeader faith or ... you know\n[noise]\nHenry worshiped Ernest Shackleton who in many ways that was a failure as and explore on his first expedition that he commanded some self\nHe set out to reach the south pole with three other men\nThey got within Ninety seven miles nautical miles to the poll but he feared that if he kept going his men who were already fading would not make it back\nThose for the men for my favorite\nFood or\nAnd so I made a decision that always astonished to Henry worse Lee\nHe decided to turn\nThe food that that really\nAnd his other uh most famous expedition a Shackleton had wanted to walk across Antarctica he thought it was the last great price to be achieved but before even reached in\nBut ... a Shackleton had wanted to walk across Antarctica he thought it was the last great\nPrize to be achieved but before even reached Antarctica his ship or the difference that frozen in the eyes and Shackleton found him in all his men were ruined on an ice flow more than a hundred miles from the closest I've been with any contact with civilization\nWhat made it so amazing was he was able to guide all the men in his immediate party\nAnd get them back all home alive\nOr I can only face you know that they have loyal to the very far ... I Believe I'm four\nYears I was very interested as Charles golf Soviet injure story synergy ... started reading a car is a a car is a very writes expeditions\nHe began to burn with this very peculiar ambition would very few share which was the kind of suffer these misery and become a polar explorer and the model that he lived by was a Shackleton family motto which was by endurance we conquer\nI should have had ... pounds when he came back from a trip to says ... just ... and was incredibly excited because he had managed to really beside Shackleton grave\nLook some can tell\nWhen he was about ... that he does it rarely talking about ... photo and Shackleton footsteps\nSo by the time or Henry was talking about doing his first expedition he had two children max and Alicia initially when he decided he wanted to do something that you know how many people say suddenly wasting\nTwo children max and Alicia initially when he decided he wanted to do something that you know how many people say suddenly wait a second I Want to go walk to the south pole or you know his kids were a little bit will hurt but a joy and it was very supportive\nBoth of us were huge believe as in trying to fulfill dreams and most of the time my rich still she's from fulfilling you're an individual dreams\nBecause you've failed you have to get permission from the other person and\nI felt that through my twenties I had fulfilled a lot of my dreams that had a little bit from and he went in the army when he was Eighteen and I felt that it was his town rarely\nSo for his third trip he wanted to walk across it took her to fulfill the goal that his hero shocked him was not able to achieve we wanted to do with a low\n[noise] excess of ... you know\nFor the time off at seven thirty in the trial or not I am\nEach day with similar I mean Henry would get up with the early in the morning hike up his lead this usually took about an hour the hardest will be connected to the slide and you begin to haul the Donald like a mule\nFluffy skiing for Ninety minutes taking a five minute break\nAnd he would walk with his skis burning as much as eight thousand calories in a day\nOr every ... to ... still very striking ships small chips like trying to protect X Y story\nHe would do this particularly in a task and challenge day after day there was something almost time\nPutting humans do this ... a task and challenge day after day there was something almost primal about a Cold War he's\nKissing your the purpose became to just make his mileage he had to achieve so many miles a day if he was ultimately accomplished his goal\nNine ... coal fields ... guy giving everybody dies in some are caused by the nine going the other ... are hard won by colleges that long ago today just ... miles of the funny thing everybody guy Twenty one\nI'm going ... miles was a disappointment but\nIt's also you know what's come all there's all I can do the engine of twelve hour day\nHe would track for fourteen Fifteen sometimes sixteen hours across an alien landscape is covered with a sheet of ice it's hospital crosses\nThe wife actually jumping off his ability to see the ... region ...\nIt was a very tough day but many pauses or take a breath waiting for my ski\nSteaks at stroke seven PM ... during the day and it was a letter from little seven but I Am I checked again was twelve festival nine\nLong enough to to him I don't know\nWhere he sat down on a satellite than\nHarder than other expeditions and at least if you're with other people and you can take time to be at the front\nWhereas if you're the lead scare press has miles [noise]\nHave time to play my hard [noise]\nWhereas if you delete scare criticized miles [noise]\nHave time to quit playing my God [noise]\n\nHe felt the constant strain of making his mileage so that he could reach the end plenty of the expedition before the end of the month of January because in February begins the winter season and talked to cope with the temperature drops even further it can reach a minus a hundred degrees Fahrenheit\nEven Eli shuts down then and at that point that would be no exit\nPolls show off of those\nSurgical lofty goal and\nThose sort of old old enough to accept the oil which says to the old old\nMan if you were goals recognized as Lawrence joke if they go to the feudal ... will says ... ... years old\nI listen to his ... every day and they were pretty good they were ... feet but uh I was just very concerned that was a ... miles on his and\nHe was a little time he was fifty five when he says ... instead of [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "New Yorker Radio Hour", "city": "Grand Canyon", "day": "13"}
