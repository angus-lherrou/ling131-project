[noise]\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick [noise]\nWhen Janelle Monet came on the scene in pop music about ten years ago you might not have picked her out right away as a future star her music was rooted in Seoul and R. and B.\nAnd also punted new wave and Monet wrote these kind of sigh fi concept album set in the future starring herself as an Android it was just kind of out there kind of weird sometimes and it could have been ridiculous except it wasn't it was great\nAnd Janelle when they actually got the acclaim and recognition that you deserve [noise]\n\n\nMore recently she started acting seriously in film\nAs one of the stars of hidden figures and in moonlight and this year she released an album called dirty computer despite the title it's not science fiction at all she's dealing frankly with the issues that she's facing and that our country is facing\nRight this very moment she joined me in the studio and I wanted to begin at the very beginning\nSo at the New Yorker we have a whole fact checking department [laughter] so I Want to start with the fact checking thing sure I read that as a kid you wrote an entire musical inspired by the Stevie Wonder album Journey Through the secret life of plants\nAll about photosynthesis what was it like what was this musical like well my uncle was a huge stadium when the fan and he played out\nAll about photosynthesis what was it like what was this musical\nLike well my uncle was a ... fan and he played the album and now is like oh we're lying about photosynthesis in our school\nAnd I started to just write about me 'cause I was living with my grandmother at a time we were in between houses and I started to write about me and just this attack on a or not attack attack on him in front of plants\nHowever you shoot I had to ban like elementary school 'cause I like science class and maybe like the fourth or fifth grade who\nThe writers in an even performers are songwriters that were just in inflaming your imagination when you're that young\nWhen I was wondering I was really on phones because I was with my family if you will have been a big family like me I have over fifty first cousins while I have my grandmother had to have children well and I have a huge family and so I was just with them a lot and I come from a musical inclined family\nMy great grandmother's those plate or in Indiana where their churches um the church was it was a huge aspiration for me\nTo sing in church do in a in a way that singers that I'm from an earlier generation to do with it or is it kind of grew up knowing the music of Sunday Morning on Saturday Night\nYou know I did sing in church but it's not\nThe type of song that you would think would be something in church it's not traditional ... no I actually was that five six year old kid\nWho would be sitting in a few in in my past year it would be between yelling and sweating in about to get a hold of those and I would bust out in the Michael Jackson to beat it and then I'd be escorted out to the children's church [laughter] kinda got kicked out yeah I was I\nA rebellious Christian\nNow you're also interested in musicals and musical theater and did you have access to that or was it all through records and radio\nI did it and access to musical theater\nA magical and musical theater and did you have access to that or was it all through records and radio\nI dated access to musical theater and what else did you play as a kid Cinderella I can totally elated it went into production or I went to a predominantly black a high school a tuna a Latino and black high school and\nUm he's got all the lead singer I didn't actually it's funny what did you not get the lead the way as I did not get to lose I wanted to be Dorothy so you're still mad about it [laughter]\nI'm I'm kind of store but I understand it but it crushed me growing up it really crush me now at what point did you think I can have\nA big life like something that's beyond being in the high School Musical something beyond being a maybe the best singer at your high school something larger than that\nI don't think I registered until\nWent to New York post high school I went to the American music on dramatics academy and I started to learn more and I start to grow and when I realized\nThat there was just more potential that I hadn't tapped into there was an access potential that was there and that led me to leave I left school because I realized\nThat I wanted to general fresher stories high or heroes at that a law now Lauren Hill was my biggest inspiration and I love Judy Garland yeah ordering Judy Garland were were my my my heroes which are pretty different performers why those two they were just women that I felt\nReally is their voices you had a first of all unique tone I'm\nIn Maine just came across as strong I didn't know a whole lot about Judy Garland obviously I'm from Kansas and the wizard of Oz you know in her being in that um I felt like she was a dreamer and she was a strong\nStrong I didn't know a whole lot about Judy Garland obviously I'm from Kansas and the wizard of Oz you know in her being in that\nUm I feel like she was a dreamer and she was a strong woman I Know she had a complex life\nBut Lauren Hill in particular resonated with me as a black woman who did an album and made a career full of being herself she did not shy away from her religious belief she didn't shy away from 'em you know being a mom during the town where people say that she could not\nHave a child who will ruin her career um she she was an actress she was an actor she was ashamed or a she was a producer she was a ... and now is how one model my career\n... ... ... what's your song from an early album that's called violet stars happy hunting and this is from an album called metropolis betray sweet [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nYou know a long time now that sounds like something out of a musical is that what you said that's right [noise]\nYes you know what will I wouldn't say a musical where I wanted to do was figure out\nI could sing songs\nHave concepts for them if I wanted to talk about science fiction which was a huge inspiration to me after I watched ... Nineteen twenty seven German expressionist silent film when I rushed that metropolis Oh yes it it it is by all of my work really it was the birth of metropolis the money that but let's start\nWhen I watched that metropolis Oh yes it it it is by all of my work really it was the birth of metropolis the money that\nBy that started how the hunting that we just heard but what I wanted to do is figure out how to you take how can I take all of me on stage like am I Am theatrical I Love singing I Love R B I Love rock and roll 'em I Love you know dressed in black and white tuxedo to pay homage to my family I Love\nTo have a ...

New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick the midterm elections are often said to be a referendum on the presidency and that's never been more true than this year in the era of Donald Trump at the same time no matter where you live there also other issues on your mind\nAnd see and that's never been more true than this year in the era of Donald Trump at the same time no matter where you live there are also other issues on your mind as a voter local stuff that is maybe nothing to do with whether you watch Fox or CNN or even how you feel about Donald Trump\nReporter a lawsuit Griswold has been spending a lot of time following races in the state of Pennsylvania and what she found is that for voters across a wide swath of the state the thing that's foremost on people's minds is a gas pipeline it's already under construction and it goes through a lot of people's backyards\nAnd they're really unhappy about it one of the communities allies have visited was exton Pennsylvania in the suburbs of Philadelphia [noise]\nAfrican is a place where two tectonic plates in American politics meat we saw Pennsylvania go narrowly for Donald Trump and twenty sixteen and the Philadelphia suburbs are one of those places that political consultants like to talk about is kind of a bellwether\nAlthough the larger county went for Hillary Clinton accent is heavily Republican about two thirds of its voters are Republicans and yell ... is running as a Democrat for state assembly and she thinks she has a chance to go rogue\nWere on a leafy suburban street they're colonial houses which are made of brac inside and was final it's in the middle class place how are you guys and Danielle is going door to door she's a suburban mom with two kids under the age of five and she works in marketing\nI have you heard about running for office Daniel ... you do okay well I actually live right on Devon drive and I decided to run because for the last five years aren't even here have been dealing with us\nWe she's pointing to a long stretch of orange plastic fence saying that marks the beginning of a controversial pipeline which is supposed to be buried about forty feet behind all the houses on the street and\nStretch of orange plastic fencing that marks the beginning of the controversial pipeline which is supposed to be buried about forty feet behind all the houses on the street\nAnd fighting the pipeline for the last few years is what motivated Danielle to launch a novice his campaign for the Pennsylvania state house taking on her Republican opponent and the establishment in her own party\nUm there are one two three four five six rows of pipes\nIt's within\nFive fifty feet of my backyard like Seventy feet from my house and\nUm we're standing right now ten feet from playground that\nMy neighbors kids my kids play on\nYour greatest fear is Danielle with the pipeline I mean if what how does it impact how do your fears about an impact your life\nUm [noise]\nIt's horrible to think about a couple of weeks ago I'm a python exploded in ... county in Pennsylvania and it was a smoker pipeline that was only a week old and so I actually was I'm taking a nap in the afternoon shortly after that happened and I jumped out of my bed because I had this nightmare\nOf like my babies like burning in their bed and I'm I called them and I said John we have to move like you have to move we can't [noise] um\nAnd like thankfully in beaver county there were only thirty homes within a mile of that explosion and the closest family with five hundred feet away and the scapegoat their life but they're homeless destroyed um those things seem like national news to most people but to people like me that's like reality\nSo [laughter] you know we're here trying to connect the dots between what's going on politically nationally\nAs well as on a state level I'm with and the pipeline how do you see the pipe\nPlayed nationally\nAs well as on a state level I'm with and the pipeline how do you see the pipeline as relating to national politics just an example\nOf the graciousness of what's happening at the on the national level and all of these regulatory role backs\nAnd how it really affects our daily life and how it can affect anyone anyone\nLet's put it this way I'm never in my life never in my life I Would run for office never never ever occur to\nMe I just wasn't something I ever\nLike maybe I thought\nIt would run for school board or something like something small local when my kids were older and I had a little more time on my hands but after all of the things we've experienced over the last few years and just the lack of humanity from are\nThe people who represent us [noise] it's it's ... it it makes you feel powerless but I refuse to be powerless\nDaniels opponent and district one fifty five is Becky Corman a Republican has been in office is two thousand twelve I reach representative Corbin for an interview and she sent the following statement I have a proven record of standing up to oil and gas companies to ensure the health and safety of our community\nThen she lifted her opposition to a number of bills which she said would have rolled back health protections standards for oil and gas wells and made it easier for public utilities to use eminent domain\n... ... ... but here's the thing about Pennsylvania politics are both the Republican legislature and the Democratic governor Tom\nWolfe had signed off on the pipeline fracking has made Pennsylvania the third largest oil and gas producing state in America and and that's brought in a lot of different players including to know co and its parent company energy transfer partners which owns this pipeline project the Mariner ...\nBut in a lot of different players including the ... and its parent company energy transfer partners which owns this pipeline project the Mariner east\nWhen we build a pipeline safety is our top priority for highly skilled engineers environmental scientist wildlife biology and geology to sign off I Want to follow the safest rounds with the smallest environmental footprint\nATP as a private corporation but they were able to use eminent domain to take people's land against their will in order to lay the pipeline the pipeline move natural gas liquids from the Marcellus gas fields in the west for three hundred and fifty miles to the east to markets hawk outside Philly where it shipped overseas\nWe were following the root of the pipeline through Pennsylvania our second stop with a hundred miles west of action in the small town of blows or fail\nAt plumes gun shop\nWe not Ralph and Doris blue\nNow the fact checkers at the New Yorker I don't want to brag but they have something of a reputation so when Ratcliffe want it to get a taste of what fact checking was really like it made sense for him to come by the office and try his hand at it here's Peter can be runs to fact checking department\nSo Daniel ... showed up at my office shortly after town on a Monday morning along with Michael showman who writes about theater for the New York [noise]\nVery well thank you very much [laughter]\nAnd he didn't look unlike under ... and I wondered whether that had something to do with his intense immersion in the play where he plays a fact checker in a mortal combat where the where the writer\nBecause of because one of one of the policy to sort of the laws and I'm In ... in like ... asking if I see a U.S know that if you can differentiate between ... one of our schools are things that matter in St John\n... sort of gifts for way too everything everything\nMean there's the thing is people who don't are familiar with that second mostly think things are either factor opinion or we check the facts and we leave the finance allowed that to us the\nBigger the biggest thing that we work on is what I refer to as fact based opinion in other words like you have to know the underlying facts in order to crack they constructed argument I'm\nNot really a science more of an art it's kind of a ... you may there are kind of having such judgments that you make and of course that's\nIt's not really a science more kind of an art it's kind of akin to editing you make there are kind of common sense Kuhl judgments that you make and of course that's a sort of squishy ground to make comments that she will judgments but you know we are journalists so\nWhen we shouldn't show you how to do it 'cause I mean for you to work on and I'm like gosh I Believe you have a phone call scheduled at a chef of a Mexican restaurant\nAdolescent
