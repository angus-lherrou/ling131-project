N. Y. [noise] [noise]\nHey I'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today to [noise]\nStart this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times he's a guy we've had on the show before then facing the high [laughter] [laughter] okay I think it's a good thing where we just want to know from you or what are you guys doing how you doing and\nWhat are you thinking I'll start at the beginning Yeh started to begin with what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nIs growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and\nWhen that became a national story [noise] there was a lot of belly again and the press how many people do is they killed in the United states about by the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire near rice and Harris than about John become sort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing\nBecame a national story [noise] there was a lot of belly again in the press how many people do is they killed in the United states about by the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on the shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire near rice and Harris than to budge on over there and will become sort of a national story [noise]\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing that like number one\nIs there a is a trending one way or the other or police shooting more black people and white people just very simply you know the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part\nRoom and said that that that doesn't exist somewhere in the place from itself in the\nPolice department it does on the local level however uh it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency it and I can tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers are the numbers committed for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete\nKnow 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database\nMost of them rely on media reports that the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public consciousness that is right\nTo ban in his editors thought let's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented burst study had Florida it's a third biggest state demographics are pretty

and started emailing every ...\nYou know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database most of them rely on media reports of their own really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public consciousness that is right to ban in his editors thought let's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented\nBrain so burst study had Florida it's a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public records loss legally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places and ... and Ben sat down and started emailing\nEvery single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\n... three hundred and eighty eight emails asking for five\nYears worth of paper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting out for this involves a year of work county police department is getting lawyers\nInvolved is is a massive thing they're both probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nThink Sir Ben put together\nMost comprehensive police shooting database that we know of would show that\nWhile back we send our producer map kills me down to the Tampa Bay times or is this somebody there to check it out yeah how how many documents you think you have someone on the stuff is probably five thousand pages I have a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me ... six feet tall you got 'em broken down by county but you can see uh\nSo a or B county\nBook or a time or even bench a all through the\nAlphabet and he basically just have a all these ah folders with tons of papers in them spread across an entire desk\nIs a combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings represent\nEight hundred and thirty one shootings\nSome pages at a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me ... six feet tall and broken down by county but you can see uh\n[noise] so a or B bay county\nBook or a time or even beach uh all through the off about a basically just have a all these uh manila folders with tons of papers and spread across the entire desk is a combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings represent\nEight hundred and thirty one shootings\nEvery shooting in the state of Florida in the in in six years time two thousand amount of two thousand fourteen\nSo he did was go through all of this material scraped each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team that involve a an armed suspect was or chase\nAll the demographic information for the the firing officer or officers and the people were hit by those bullets than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how\nHow we can compile the data and build a database and um [noise] you know hopefully draw some conclusions some lessons some solutions\nThis all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there are lots of link to it from my website radiolab dot org highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency to keep track of the stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found an initially some of it\nYou know kind of surprised us well the biggest some sort\nOf counterintuitive a line in this the the numbers are flat\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they study about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year which seems odd\n'cause uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral\nHighly recommend hope to the other\nOrganizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency that keeps track of this stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest some sort of counterintuitive a line in this the the numbers are flat\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they study about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd 'cause uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it seem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers show that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down\nInto category and he says you know what you see like on the most basic\nLevel are are that about a third of the\nPolice shooting case it involves someone the other side who is quote mentally unstable and this is the case we're not taking a gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which\nThere's some evidence and report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill maybe off their meds anytime of the shooting in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases they called suicide\nBy cop which is what is somebody who is usually a mentally ill\nApparently trying to get himself shot intentionally person is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door\nAnd raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a weapon so it's called I Want to kill myself\nBut I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot at sort of to incite the shooting that is right this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know they're the news briefs that you see once or twice a week but it was new to us I mean clearly police are\nNow like the de facto front line in dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got\nAnd raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a weapon so it's called I Want to kill\nMyself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting I think that's right this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know did a news briefs that you see once or twice a week but it was news to us I mean clearly\nPolice are now like the de facto front line in dealing with mental illness in this country\nBut when it got to Ben central question what do the numbers say about race I think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black\nAnd that is a that is out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics and you're one of the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you or four times as likely\nTo be shot by police than if you're white southern ... much right now but the breakdown between the ... for the same demographics and this was that they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were\nCarrying a firearm nine percent had a\nBlade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest you know and we talked with in the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent\nYou know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty and numbers themselves don't really get you very far and ... percent six kind of ... he says one percent or more years just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem yeah you ... I mean\n[noise] I mean what gets me is like the I don't know it's back to where we were and why we want to\nNumerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent you know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing\nBut for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty the numbers themselves don't really get you very foreign percent six kind of ... he says one percent or more years just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem yeah I mean [noise] I mean what gets me is like the I don't know it's back to where we\nWere in why we want to start this methane gas is I've still just moved by the single case the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is you know I mean there are written in this uh\nThere's a horrible thing in a very you know ten ten times a hundred times worse for his for his wife children than it is for me\nI think it's a different thing when you're a person has killed by another human being and that human being is returned to the streets with a gun in a badge in a you know in a position of authority\nSomething you do see impacts numbers even though the numbers themselves they they can't really tell you whether or not a shooting with legally justified what is clear is that over a hundred plus shootings even the shootings where the person was unarmed only one police officer has ever been charged\nTimes worse for his first wife children than it is for me I think it's a different thing when you're a person has killed by another human being in that human being is returned to the streets with a gun in a badge in a you know in a position of authority\nIn something you do see impacts numbers even though the numbers themselves\nThey they can't really tell you whether or not a shooting with legally justified what is clear is that over eight hundred plus shootings even the shootings where the person was unarmed only one police officer has ever been charged and so it's it's this weird sort of like double grief\nYeah it's like past and present at the same time like\nYou can't put it away because it's every day is another insults kind of right then it's I'm having\nSomething happened in you know here in Florida\nSo after the event ended up community center has took a bunch of mom they all got in their cars and drove over to this like little gem shop\nLike you guys do this after every every event or no for no just wanted to know was there and has been telling everyone about\nThis de ... says her son Andrew ... routine\nSo no we didn't know anything about this but they must be part of the different types of learning as part of just hoping dream right right we all just simply trying to find our way is it puts all gathered like\nProbably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because you wanted to show these women\nTook a bunch of the mom built on their cars and drove over to this like little gem shop\nJust like you guys do this every every event or you know I just wanted to know this one's parents and has been telling everyone about\nThis dinner justice her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nYou know we didn't know anything about this but thinking this must be part of the different types of learning part of just hoping remind right we all just simply trying to find a way it's official\nGathered like probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because she wanted to show these women like here's how I Hope or here's how I deal with my grief you can either get the um the larger staged a certain point I was talking to these two women and she had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like\nThan I open my windows and I just knew when I go through my house she says his age concert down you know I'm just [noise]\nThey went to the gym shop Christel House [noise]\nMid sized one story house in the land and a lot of women hung out in the living room were drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and a cousin\nWere in the kitchen\n\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together like they bring with them you know their own stories these stories of suffering and yet when in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\n\nAnd the night before they'd all gone out dancing together\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together like they bring with them or their own stories these stories of suffering and yet when in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\n\nAnd the night before they'd all gone out dancing together [laughter]\nNow what we're doing instead of getting motel rooms again this is the touch a Clinton were starting to celebrate each other's houses\nSee each other out too long\nMetric it becomes a huge sleep over in first of course the talking you know getting to know each other you know it's nice over shows results like therapy for\nFigures let me pass but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that really stuck with me\nI Believe we're at ...\nAnd it's when crystal let some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marvin was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people here in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or brother or a child basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grass but we usually the video that's\nMy house probably over like right now\nThe police caught up behind him was probably right here\nAnd then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nWe came and he came right here\n[noise]\nIt's been or brother or a child and they're basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grad so we usually the video that\nSmall house probably over like right now\nThe police caught up behind him was probably right here\nAnd then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nWe came and he came right here [noise]\n\nAnd that's why we recall execution a vegetable garden 'cause\nWing and all that that I Am then 'cause ah when they when you know when they took him away in released and sit down and type of stuff we came back at us all you can smell what's going on and so now like when you play any like it's it's not as it's not as bad now but just the association for when I'm quite onions and you get that smell like it just\nYou get those flat mhm\nHad just brings you right back here mhm\nAnd the twelve is just kind of stood there for a minute\n[noise]\n\n'cause his eyes were sort of ... when it started to cry\n\n\nYou don't want me to uh take some yeah my ...\nCouple of women had him either phone my\n\nAnd it's probably about these women who huddled together and they just\nScience or ... some of the other one that started to cry\n\n\nYou don't want me to uh take some yeah my find the best\nAllowed a little bit of fun to me a couple of women handed me the phone my\n[noise] yeah\nAnd it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera\nWith this sort of straight face at three to one\nThree two one [noise]\nThe real started walking back to the cars [noise]\nFirst of all I just want to thank you for just sharing that with us because I Know [noise]\nIt was up to the various ... we saw that once a week\nAnd I three o'clock in the morning [noise]\nWhat I remember at the end I used to tell you all the time how do you live so far away\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\nMy son's greatest about Fifteen minutes\nI have to go there all the time of horror\nYeah no for how could you not\nYou know what you like you want to go take a chair\nAnd sit there yeah\nAnd it's crazy because like if a listen it's a cemetery like a little bit further out\nAnd it's crazy you know about is like a certain time every day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo like I happen to be there at this really interesting number because just a few months after that trip\n[noise]\nEither be feels with some other Senate blend when she spoke at the Democratic national convention one\nShe was on stage with Michael brands mother Eric Gardner's mother watched\nA few of these women started to call themselves\nSomebody showed up at the women's march in D. C. [laughter]\n\nIt because in the short amount of time\nThis thing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nOf felt like at the time a support group\nAnd suddenly become\nUp and down a cop with a gun and men with a knife\nAnd look at the razor thin life or death moment between them so stay with us\n[noise] what a damn accomplished a gun a man with a knife\nAnd look at the razor thin life or death moment between them and you're going to get so stay with us [noise]\nThis shirtless black guy that's the kind of talking on the ... in the body cam and this black man goes on waste ... walking towards the ... phone crazy [noise]\nLike I get closer and closer closer if the cop when the body can pulls out the ... the other officer out it was out of the frame is behind him with his firewall them out and the\nGuy down is approaching\nApproaching approaching the protein\nAnd now\nHe gets within ten feet of the cops and then\n\n[noise] the guy with buddy team fires the case or the guy holding the knife he falls onto his back on to this like cement driveway still got the knife in his hand\n\nThe cop who's got a gun out he has over ... kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabs him by that\nStare at it was added a frame is behind him with his firewall them out in the\nGuy like put it down is approaching\nApproaching approaching the protein and now you get to them I can see the cops and then [noise] the guy with buddy Kim fires the case or the guy holding the Nike falls onto his back on to this like cement driveway stood up a knife in his hand\n\nAnd the cop who's got a gun out he has over ... kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabs him by the hand turns them over and then\nThe detained central four cups and then there may not if it's not a smart idea to have a nice coming out of the police\nOfficer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me\nYou were lucky you didn't just show on your best shot you're going to die I Want a dog you can guy\nHe tells the officer was in Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know what a blue sports can kill\nA fan of counseling on T.\nV. to pick 'em up walk them over to the squad car the men and the un\nSaid this is the thing that you guys will use this video for what it guys warn of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things you know and and that's the points we hit home or the officers years' time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull wait up\nAnd the guy losing the corn chose that one I mean you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use mobile command first ruined and let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\nAnd it's important 'cause the guys partner who is holding the gun have you heard this hot you might have just\nThis video for what it is one of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things you know and and that's the points we at home or the officers years' time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans in the current judge that one I mean you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal commands first ruin them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that\n... and this is going to get the guys partner was holding a gun how you heard this hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots\nFired his gun so you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest of communication with your fellow officers\nThere was all the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they want to officer in particular no that individual from prior contact read I mean it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek and Derek isn't just a black man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there is no connection there\nIs a lot easier to see somebody has nameless faceless and I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that and establish some kind of poor that made the officer think\nOf how he's going to deal with this thing\n\nActually after he finished watching a video and I was packing up she told me that just a couple of months after that incident on by the ... you might miss a front step ... what I meant that Derrick does\nStupid set up a bit you and how close game to be in bed wouldn't be backwards medication wasn't doing drugs and he was is completely as normal as me and you are right now\n[noise] now again are almost kind of like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona

team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for the use of force and the number one principle rather than being some in law and order law and order is the sanctity of human life\nYou know just a month after ... put out those principles to the biggest policing organizations in the world the icy pie you know National Association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against\nThese guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job and some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly\nDespite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive conversations and police weren't talking about\nAnd the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against these guiding
