just in a very short time they saw girl and he was laying down in the mud not moving\nHe might be dead because he was just laying there but that you know took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\nSo they put 'em in an ambulance and they were rushing to the last\nHospital in Plattsburgh according to a gym a couple of cops go with them they're going in the whole time because they think that you might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing [noise] but you wouldn't talk about the most part but the story\nThat I'm interested in rural get started it's known\nAs the buried bodies case and I think one of the things that's so\nAbout this case this is a law professor Lisa ... is the conflict\nBetween what a good lawyer should do and what a good person should do in the situation okay and we are recording\nI saw the guy at the center\nOf this conflict was a man named Frank our money\nFrankly each arm many\nBrenda the lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or urban that's Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area in some ways they use that money but it is\nOr money couple of months ago producers Simon I learned I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York that's our money now in his eighties he's retired [noise]\nMy name is Frank uh money and I will say drawing for rubber\n... um\nWhere I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like ... how did this whole story start for you well\nJust to get a bit of background must Armani told me that was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he'd always the guy that that will walk away\nBackground must Armani told me that he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that will walk\nAway it was a fighter I like ... flights go flights I'd like standing up for the the guy and\nWhen you're fighting a cage for defended you're fighting this date and tear it and he was doing really\nWell he has well respected had a good reputation\nRobert Guerra yeah black hair strongman to take him oh you might get forty five and uh I just had that feeling this guy is dangerous and level things are going to happen this is a year before the manhunt\nNineteen Seventy two I'm Frank are members he represented in at first on two pretty small things one one\nClosed up mine shaft the mind up mind though about\nHour south of the hospital has been running in the movement were you scared where are you excited like oh you rub pie so high but you're scared you're concerned yes fair your food if you do in fact at one point looking on the\n... they got a little bit we thought we were being followed by the state police\nWent into one bar where one of France's bell jeez I'm lady friends was hanging out there about thirty minutes don't you talk to her then you have to pick up our car and then we went up to the back door\nTo cubs driving that lady friends car to try them moonshine details and so they got back on\nWe drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here this may be as far as we can walk\nUp to the old abandoned life [noise]\nI went out there last February world reporter Loma chemistry and letting tons of supervisor of Mariah Tom's cause a father says just on a road that goes to the line with what is clear to them on [noise] it was then it's sort of hilly area off the side of the road as I said\nTrailed grown or you're just\nA very icy that day the share this used to be an old roadway [noise]\nThis here is used to be an old roadway [noise]\nFairly teeth are lonely and all the trees were\nI'm Sorry skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that are mania and this is the only way they could have came in here\nSo that so here we are in Sunday's suits and regroup trudging ... floors looking for the case [noise]\nBut you know we're just looking around [noise]\n... well you see the air shaft there\nThey find those air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off the care for this is going to be such\nYeah you don't want to fly down in there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the whole So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you know my feet and left me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lower down into the whole\nI could see or sneak shoe Abou\nSneaker [noise]\nI said to myself this bitch does it back up to build you get me out of here who my back up\n\nThey'll gee found the other body Alicia hawks body she was in a cemetery where girl had said he\n\nEventually they'll gee found the other body Alicia ... body she was in a cemetery where go headset he left her\nWasn't there when the algae founder\nSo what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls so let's play that out what what are your options shirt so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor\nThese are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right\nNo you can't you just can't read token you know to get the confidence is over ...\nUnder the current rules which have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality umbrella so you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that that is yes it can be or will be\nOkay right so so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's no future crime it's over it's done and\nIf the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and making money even if they have hired detectives and even if local police are combing\nWords and the taxpayers are paying for that but there's no if if if the people are already dead than you do belong in his shoe\nThat's right\nA really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role\nThat's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role\nIsn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you will do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is is to get to play this part of a system in which you are the one\nWho stands up for the guy that everybody else hates and even if everybody hates you even if maybe you have yourself a little bit you will have to\nDo your job in that job is to be in the role of the person\nThat fights as high as they can for the clients but\nWhere is the age of ... up his client why all the agent of or also a citizen\nOf the ... and part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double murder\nHere and family\nSeeking to find out what happens ...\nWhat happens right if ... building on on the side of tell just tell tale\nOf course yes I Know Mr hulk from blowing [noise] 'cause his double ...\nWere in the same class and I knew him from church and\nWhat not to be in them or not a few\n... the parents of the family and your children have my duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two more morality [noise]\n\nSo now with this [noise] coming up that hard spot gets even harder [noise]\nRiver right back [noise]\n\nIt's even harder [noise] we'll be right back [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nPrefer to eat from Ireland contracts or radioactive reporting in part by the Alfred P funk transition enhancing public understanding of science and technology\nAnd the modern Robbie walk for ... at that but you got

D. enrollment information at five to seven six thousand\nRadiolab continues next here on\nK and AOL\nOkay hey I'm ... I'm a rod I'm rubber crow which is radiolab and now we should get back to our story from producer Brenna feral and when we left it there were where they were stuck right do they knew this thing but he's a client was very guilty of something they found the bodies of these two girls and a no brainer what is it what what's their next move wild\nSo they decided to put the burden plea bargain they take this information to the prosecutor and say I\nInformation that will help you solve some cases some cases yes and in exchange I Want you to give me a better deal for my clients to get Guerra into a mental hospital instead of a prison Oso right away they're going to use this as leverage\nThat was the idea yeah you're going to give a moon you're going to take a ... well that's kind of gross you know\nYeah he's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from Frank perspective he's got this information\nAs a person he doesn't want to have to keep that secret so if he plea bargains then that's the way for him to get some closure for the family because he can give the information to the prosecution but he's also not selling out his client so report Jim Tracy again they called a meeting with McCabe investigator from the state police\nTo make a movie he was just barely getting by for a little while I think the ... all over the stress and pressure takes his troops will\nIn fact he has a heart attack um while this is all going on\nBut eventually the criminal charges are dropped and the ethical complaint is dismissed and the reason in the opinion of the court and then the state bar is that what ... did\nWhat they did was good exactly according to the law and my\nView is Frank our money is a you know real life hero I always say you know people so it's Meyer Atticus Finch and the difference between Atticus Finch and Frank our money is that our money is a real person\nThey told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility and there were about four hundred people in the room most of them layers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was love feast\n'cause this is what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you\nThe featured speaker Frank our money and it was look\nFeast 'cause this is what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed that uh I don't think I was ... was a road\nThat dangerous job [noise]\nUh I mean I was a good lawyer a\nSurfer so art everybody um and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and bell gee did a good body is case it's taught in law schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what people think what if what if what if\nPeople face so it went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham just stand up um I agree\nUm his duties to his client represents his client's best interest if you've\nBeen in sitting in on these classes and and talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely as because professors can point to they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n...\nFrom from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the families involved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both\nFamilies and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with\nI made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing her mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan ... mother\nWho's in his the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing well she was camping with her boyfriend and she's who are among the indulge you found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn the story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that you knew a lot of schools are teaching and and if you had any feelings or thoughts about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nI 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical class is\nTotally and comprehensible to me\nAnd it was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reach out to yes and it was yes\nYou were the only in talking to you that I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they are trying to defend but what about the victim and I think that that should at least be an equal starting their mind\nThey're trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal starting their mind is not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have seen um the did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as all this was happening\nYes and only oh my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing wave flu immediately and and went to the police station and up\nWhen we were there sitting with the police men they received the policeman at the time that we were received a phone call now and he's my daughter's boyfriend what his body was found and that's that's\nAll we knew and we never really had any updates and nobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was\nOr some authority I Can't even remember who was um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later and in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact\nEven went so far as to contact a psychic that's how how important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did\nWas a total Eli the lawyer maybe he considered to be ethical about what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months of of horror and [laughter] and this is what is being taught and law schools\n[noise]\nSo anyway [laughter]\nAnd this is what is being taught in a lot of schools [laughter]\n\nSo anyway just to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professors law students there um when they approach this as it's with a lot\nOf sensitivity and they are they're struggling with the pain I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it\nAnd so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of um but you know the chance to communicate some of that um experience\nYeah well it's impossible to really communicate and words I made forty years later I'm Still I still struggle to discuss this because you don't ever go away as long as I live so\nI don't I guess\nI'm Wondering what we've been talking a lot of I'm sad stuff I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know\nThat you would want to share I don't know when you don't have to but [noise]\n[noise] [noise] what can I say she was she did receive her degree posthumously ah we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University where it was too difficult for us and um [noise]\nAnd Danny what's her boyfriend had haven't just that summer and he had a full scholarship to harbor and he had graduated just the year before and so to arrive and I'm sure the other two children had\nGreat future's ahead of them too and it's just oh\nAnd I'm sure other children have great future ahead of\nIts that's about it it\n\nIt's it's\nHorrible you know to be in a position\nTo have to live [noise] I mean how do you relate to Utah to know what what excuse who's there for you to protect the person to killer\nNew justification you couldn't justify it in my mind\nI don't expect him to accept it\nThat's the way it is [noise]\n\nUm and then you get just a minute of silence that parents that's okay\n\n[laughter]", "year": "2018", "show_name":
