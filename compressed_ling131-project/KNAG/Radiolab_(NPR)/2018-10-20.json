much for tuning into all things considered this evening on line I just it's six o'clock\nYou [laughter]\n[noise]\nListening to radio last\nRadio there'll be you and why [noise]\nHey I'm ...\nRobert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can say and what we\nCan't [laughter] and uh in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode a contain some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no don't don't say that we have to say that we don't we have to and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping [laughter] so we must lead us is on the radio yeah so she's got kids with the you may want to make one yeah\nThe story comes to us from producers Simon apps are so strict can we start in two thousand they sure about what the song yes please cut\n\nAh December twenty seventh eighth sunny Saturday morning ah this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo Alto and are seeing and sway directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of\nDirectly in front of the glass toward headquarters of\nFacebook [laughter] yes\nIs on a few dozen women\nAnd babies that right there are you the organizer\nIs one of the organizers up the gathering and stuff\nNurse in as in like breastfeeding intent was really just to be disciplined and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken up themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would upload those photos to Facebook\nAnd these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for uploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their\nBacks up those it is [noise] they want Facebook to say that ... is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [laughter]\n[noise]\nStephanie Coontz have learned at the time was that this small peaceful protest will turn out to be\nThis morning a face off on Facebook and one of the opening shot Facebook triggered hordes now in what would become a loud\nBut Facebook rockets\nAnd global battle embattled Facebook CEOs but today playing defense and now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in the election meddling\nOr data breaches\nBut but rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of them free speech\nViolence against Rohingya Muslims what we can say in\nBoth of them free speech\nAny violence against roe kingdom muscle what we can say in what we can't say that again by this iconic photograph what we can see in what we can see it led Mueller right kids in front of me on\n\nMr that come back I got to\nDo you subjectively prioritize or sensors speech\nCongresswoman we don't think about what we're doing of censoring speech but there are types\nOf what what what really grabbed me was was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual book\nA text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook where you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of us can say on Facebook to digital document it's about fifty pages if you've printed off\nIn diet in bullet points and it's been statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the growth which made me wonder like what are these roles\nHow were they can have one rule book right exactly so I I dove into this world book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test so ah let's start back a on that morning two thousand in the morning that you could argue started at all\n'cause in the building right behind those protesting mothers there was the Google Facebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do I'm cool so if I so I'm just going to switch and just read so I was able to get in touch\nConference room trying to figure out what to do I'm cool so if I so I'm just going to switch are just\nSo I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees when I'm One of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nIn now neither of these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought into read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different form of Facebook employees\n[noise] All right ready so\nAt the time when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again keep in mind this isn't nearly two thousand seismic change in this week and the Internet hierarchy this was like the deep dark path I space time\nIs now the most visited website in the U.S Facebook had somewhere in the neighborhood of ... we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids\nAnd so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of confidence like room with a big long table\nEach of them in front of their own computer and things that come up to their ... to Facebook\nAnd on like meaning like I use or saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like a recording a piece of content that you think violates the community standards this is Kate clinics she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing\nAnd and she says in his early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of content and then [noise]\nThat content along with an alert would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on the screen most of what you were saying was either naked people blown off heads or things that there was no clear reason\nWhy someone had reported because it was like a photo of a golden retriever and people are just annoying and Everytime something popped up onto the screen\nNo clear reason why someone had reported because it was like a\nPhoto of a golden retriever and people are just annoying and Everytime something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at that computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take it down\nAnd at the time if you didn't know what to do you would turn your party leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and ask what do I do with this\nAnd they would either have seen it before and explain it to you or you both wouldn't known you Google some things it really was just kind of an ad hoc approach was there\nAny sort of written standard or any common standard uh what kind of they had a set of ... the standards that day at the end of the day they were just kind of that as one page long and it was not very specific site that that the guideline for really one page long throw one huge long and basically all this page said was nudity is bad\nSo as Hitler and um if it makes me feel bad take it down and so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breast\nFeeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down until\nAnyway now a dozen or so people in front of their officers on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but according to Stephanie me are those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who had organized ironically enough\nThrough Facebook so to coincide with the live protest they just picked up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse in two for one\nTo an image of\nThen change the status to the title if I could have Facebook breast feeding us\nThen change the status to the title if I could have Facebook breastfeeding it's not and pick Cohn huh the social\nNetworking website is under fire for it and tell them the unfolding of women brand new meeting their children\nMembers participated and the media requests started pouring and they have them by hitting is not I didn't hundreds of interviews for print Chicago Tribune Miami Herald time magazine in New York Times Washington polls\nSupposed to be a source of content moderators itself\nAround twenty ten they decided to start outsourcing some of this work to places like manila where you just heard reporter Aurora home and draw as well as\nTwenty tend they decided to start outsourcing some of this work to places like manila where you just heard reporter Aurora home and draw as well as\nI mean I Would guess for the ...\nWhere we sent reporters get stuck\nWhere they get their dishes Facebook treats cooked everybody ... percent\nThe motor tried to talk to some of these people to for a living they did a computer and collectible quick through around ... million flag bits of content to pop up and that they screen every day wow\nI'm just curious like what's what's that like\n[noise] well I thought\nFound out pretty quickly ... none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nAnd so there's a lot of reading femi happening\nA lot about the good work if I had a ... foot fence and now I don't have money you\nWouldn't even admit they work for the company like what's a is there something wrong about being in like in India that they find well yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing are willing to talk to me do you want to be named or do you know\nWhere do you not want to be named and that that's the only find you know I've got a little bit strata of\nKicks plain that he and all the other moderators liking was forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to a myth that they work for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nLike to talk about a lot ... watch\nMine several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worst so that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it it create a sort of separation between these workers and the company\nSecret what these rules worth about they couldn't be gained a at the same time would create a sort of separation between these workers and the company which if your Facebook you might want right I I I find that to my editor ethic I let us just to give him a major of the job\nThat you know like a really low impact\nAt ... could have I I tell you got ... so\nThis guy I talked to he he got his first contract doing this work several move back in for the duration of it about a year he jumped to his desk in the morning put on his headphones ignored ...\nJust that's just that's just what is high us as also says other day I was just a much of a social ... a size\nFive thousand a day you just said it was ... he he said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every three or four seconds [noise] wow all day long all day eight hours a day [noise]\nWell if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nThat's just what whether it's true I told us to extradite\nClicking through he came across unspeakable things\nFederal ... you know with other squashed by attacking for a surge of it was all about\n[noise] virtually I have no facts about why it's just what it was all over\nWhen did you did this like keep you up and that if you do that is\nAbsolutely absolutely I look at a cover up a lot of uh\nKept him thinking about these photos when he was trying to relax you had to start voting things\nLike that is the second I like to watch as well\nAbout these videos and photos when he was trying to relax he had to start voting things\nThat I noticed that they like to watch is why ... why I left us the whole thing that has the expert and I have a lot\nI just I have to I was chosen as to where [noise] I I saw that a classic access to\nA different moderator I spoke to describe it as seeing the west side of humanity\nYou see all of the stuff that you and I\nDon't have to see because they're going around playing cleanup yeah what a job well ... and ... and it's worth noting that are more and more this work is being done in an automated fashion particularly with content like a Gore or terrorist propaganda or that they're getting better\nThat they had the uh through computer vision they're able to detect hallmarks of of of the terrorists video or of a gory image and uh with terrorist propaganda that they now take down Ninety nine percent of it before anyone flags it on Facebook\nBut a moving on to our second story here that there is a type of content that they are that they are having an incredibly hard time or not just automating but even getting their real straight on and that surrounding hate speech oh good\nWill be laughter hopefully they will be comedians there will be jokes to me is hey All right okay oh there was so we take

story about Facebook and free speech and we just want her mind you guys are are those who you're just tuning in\nThis episode does contain some graphic content some strong language which must in order for us to make a point but but we don't warn you that you you if you don't want to hear this kind of thing because we were kids in the room might want to sit it out yeah okay back to Simon Adler so as we just heard before the break a Facebook is try to do two competing things at once\nThey're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe in ways that are fair and consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April fifteenth twenty Thirteen strike\nA girl at Rhonda Marilyn thanks very sorry for them to get up\nThe act was put to the test April fifteenth twenty Thirteen strike\nAnd Carlin Rhonda Marilyn thank but sorry my aunt had him up thank you I mean how can break we asked and

blown off\nAnd the second one is blown off below the knee other than the femur bone sticking out and then sort of skin and muscle and tendons it's it's ... ...\nMeanwhile the new CBS ... on the other side of the country ... ...\nI remember snippets of the day\nFacebook employees are clustering around several desks staring at the computer screens watching the news right now this has occurred just in the last half hour or so I have memories of uh watching some of the coverage chilling new images just release of the Boston bombing I remember seeing the photo published online and it wasn't long after that\nWatching some of the coverage chilling images just release of the Boston bombing I remember seeing the photo published online and it wasn't long after that\n[noise] someone had posted on Facebook from folks I spoke to the order of events here are a little fuzzy but\n[noise] pretty quickly voters going viral\nAnd we realized we're going to have to deal with it this image is spreading like wildfire across their platforms it appears to be way outside the rules they'd written by its him is totally new context\nSo they got Thirteen together sat down in a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like\nShould we allow it or should they take it down according to the rules are in this photo you could see you could definitely see bone and so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yep however have to wear says\nWell the other people are saying this is news worthy essentially the photos being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which immediately with these\nPush back well I was saying that what we prided ourselves on with not making those calls and there are no exceptions there is either either mistakes were improvements we made the guidelines for moments like this ... directs the other side shoots\nBack oh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe's publishing this all over the place and we're taking it down like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense here like humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nHow do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of the stuff\nThat other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact\nHow do you answer your any of the questions about any of the rest of the stuff\nThat in other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally clear they decide to take the photo down but before they can pull the lever\nWords that's making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources executive ... sent down in order we're essentially told make the exception\n\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason those the photo stance you're not taking this doubt\nYes oh yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook has just become a publisher ... but they don't think maybe they have put the meat in news judgment and just really really they've become a news organization yeah ... and this brings up a legal\nQuestion that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech\nLike is Facebook is sort of collective scrapbook for assault or is it a public school\nYou should be able to say whatever you want or yeah it is it now in news organization trends\nParents here let me let me get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question to kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook\nIs this question has been popping up a lot recently in fact did even came up this past April when sucker Berg was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so\nWhich are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher\nCenter this is a I view us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology and I said you responsible for your content which makes that kind of a publisher right well I agree that\nWe do is build technology and I said you responsible for your content which makes that kind of a publisher right well I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and built products\nBasically ... is that the company or arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the well Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where uh they can't be held liable for much of anything they're subjected to fewer regulations\nHowever where were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization\nThat could change but setting that aside what what what really strikes me about all of this is if you have a company that really\nUh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective is possible\nAnd can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound than what people find interesting were important what what people find newsworthy ...\nHe'll give and I'll give you an I'll give you a great example of this or that happened just six months after the Boston Marathon bombing when this video starts being circulated out of northern Mexico", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)",
