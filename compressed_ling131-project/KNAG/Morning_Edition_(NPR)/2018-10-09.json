increasingly being sent to re education camps\nOther members of Interpol vetoed that particular red notice after China could not provide any evidence of criminal wrongdoing but it was an example of how China was using the organization for its own political means in this case with lung is a good example of how China's messy politics is spilling over into international organizations\nReally

there's little research on video court what's out there shows it may increase bail amounts and in many cases makes private communication between attorneys and clients more public\nOn the prosecution

government which under leader Xi Jinping was eager to use Interpol to locate an extra day Chinese officials at it deemed corrupt to it escaped China\nBut as it turns out among himself is now under investigation by Chinese authorities for corruption\nWhat exactly are they investigating him for\nWhich I think government hasn't released any details besides that he's under investigation for bribery and other unspecified crimes and the little we know about how is the tension unfolded has come from his wife grace among on September twenty fifth\nThe day her husband arrive to China for a visit she

under amongst presidency was starting to raise some red flags earlier this year China attempted issue or red notice that it's an international alert for wanted person\nFor an exile weaker activists readers are mostly Muslim ethnic minority who live in northwestern China who China's government blames for unrest and who are increasingly being sent to re education camps\nOther members of Interpol vetoed that particular red notice after China could not provide any evidence of criminal wrongdoing but it was an example of how China was using the organization for its own politic\nHow China was using the organization for its own political means in this case with lung is a good example of how China's messy politics is spilling over into international organizations\nReally interesting stuff

just blew 'em up because it was and everybody get up and go in front of the screen it's an issue yes or no or you know you couldn't Sunni to\nDavidson says when you're in the same room as the judge it's easier to have a conversation with them and he's noticed there's a greater chance to listen to what you have to say he says the first time he appeared in video court he didn't think he got a fair

their fate\nEven before the proceedings begin\nYou already feel like you're treated as though you're guilty you are feeling excluded from the process you are treated as the least important part of the process because there is nothing that can replace human interaction and as a defense attorney I Am never going to be as\nEffective in the courtroom for my client\nUnless my clients stand shoulder to shoulder to me\nWell there's little research on video court what's out there shows it may increase bail amounts and in many cases makes private communication between attorneys and clients more

also what help them heal can you know using was his seventies spoke with women about her recently published findings\nWas the question you really want to answer what did you want to find out where the survey I really want to find out is grief predominant reaction initially or you know in combination with a depressive reactions are anxious reactions so no study that I've come across has made that distinction\nBoth are painful but grief tends to bring people together which is what my research has shown and a depression tends to isolate people so it really could have very different implication\nBut grief tends to bring people together which is what my research has shown and a depression tends to isolate people so it really could have very different implications for how people cope and what types of help is best um after that experience\nSo we you designed study really quickly after the shooting that happened on any use campus you had to write those survey questions I think it was within a couple of days\nWe had the surveys really ready to go because I Do this kind of work and uh we were given permission\nWe had a sample of over four hundred a undergraduate students and that was collected very\nQuickly within I think five to ten days most of them within five days and grief was the predominant response not depression not there were some anxiety share people's uncertainty what does this mean in my safe I hear it and he you or I\nLooked at the open ended responses and the number one response was shock um how can this happen here how can this happen to what we thought was the safe community so shatters our assumption about what a safe unpredictable world is\nYou know let's talk a little more about that so so based on your survey um what were some of the factors that were associated with a student having a much more acute reaction more distress ... response\nSo people can very I mean there are studies that show over and over again really you know that the biggest predictor of sort of depressive reactions are pass mental health issues or other things that maybe don't have to do with the loss per se but it's a law says one of those situation that brings forth\nUm these kinds of reactions whereas the uh predictors of grief tend to be um factors\nThat say that a person identifies with the last person like there's empathy there and I think that's a we bid measure empathy and my studying in grief is related to empathy and depression is not\nDo you feel comfortable at the at this\nAnd I think that's uh we did measure empathy and my studying and grief is related to empathy and depression is not\nDo you feel comfortable at the at this point I'm maybe making some suggestions for how people can respond after a collective trauma\nYeah I think I think though a suggestion is not to stay isolated but to share one's feelings or with close others\nBut I think grief is an important piece and I think it's ... I think people need to know that that's normal\nAnd it is tied to these things that are so positive they're they're tied because we actually do emphasize with the individuals are we do identify with the individuals and that's a compassion right\nFeeling that there's no distinction or not much of a distinction between us and the people for whom tragedy hits right at home\nOh that's a compassionate reaction so I think that's what people really need to remember if they can't\nPublic viewing nine to five Saturday intended for Sunday Sedona arts festival dot com sitting through Arizona Public radio with NPR and local news headlines coming up at about Ninety second stay with us\n\nFrom northern Arizona university with NPR News in classical music on can you know you eight point seven Flagstaff KP you be Ninety One point seven Flagstaff Kenyan a Ninety point seven show low key and ate the Ninety One point seven page can you in a gene Ninety point three Grand Canyon and can you in a Q eighty nine point\nThree Prescott as always streaming online that can you know you dot O.
