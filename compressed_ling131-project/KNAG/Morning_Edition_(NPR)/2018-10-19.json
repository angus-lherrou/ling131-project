deal of confusion and in some cases controversy here's Noel King with commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions about how politics and the government work\nAhead of this year's election some states have already closed voter registration while other states allow people to register at their polling places on election day what is the deal with this patchwork system what is the deal is going to jail All right here's our first listener question\nThis is claiming a heart from San Francisco California I'd like to ask Cokie whether voter registration laws were controversial before the voting rights act in Nineteen sixty five how last changed since the Supreme Court granted black citizens the right to vote and wait for the ... barriers to voter registration\nThe basic answer is yes voter registration laws were controversial at first people staffing the polls were just expected to know everybody didn't in their neighborhood but then an Eighteen hundred Massachusetts instituted the first voter registration\nAnd as a century moved on it became more widespread partly in a move to make sure that non citizen immigrants didn't vote by the late Nineteen the early ... centuries a rural dominated state legislatures impose registration on city voters again it was named immigrants and at fraud by big city political machines\nWhat about the rest of her question there what about the effects\nCity voters again it was named immigrants and at fraud by big city political machines\nWhat about the rest of her question there what about the effects on black citizens versus white citizens' well of course black\nMen were given the right to vote and the fifteenth amendment in Eighteen Seventy but at the Jim Crow laws and the south effectively\nStripped African Americans of their voting rights in terms of rights of course white women and black women couldn't vote nationally until the nineteenth amendment and Nineteen twenty but you know before the sixty five ... a lot of whites in the south couldn't vote either just because the registrars had frozen the roles they didn't want anybody new voting\nAll right we have a couple of questions about current controversies\nMy name is Rachel ... from Shaker Heights Ohio why as a candidate for governor allowed to purge voter rolls shouldn't he recused himself a secretary of state while he's a candidate\nBut I assume this is in reference to Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp who is the current secretary of state and this and thinking about refusing himself he's provoked a lawsuit by buddy more than fifty thousand new voter applications on hold for minor inconsistencies\nThe lawsuit charges discrimination saying eighty percent of those applicants are members of racial minority groups\nThough they can't vote early or by mail they can still vote if they show up the right polling place with the proper ID\nOkay that that idea of proper ID that gets right to our next question Hi my name is Amy paying their chart and I live in Omaha Nebraska when I heard about the Supreme Court ruling the ideas for voting would need to have a street address it didn't faze me\nThen I heard that a lot of Native Americans on reservations only have a post office address how is that going to affect their ability to vote\nThey're complaining about it this has to do with the recent Supreme Court decision upholding in North Dakota voter id law does require a current residential street address Native American groups say that off and on reservations they don't have those and pointing icy irony that the nation's origin\nAnd like residential street address Native American groups say that often on reservations they don't have those and planning IT irony that the nation's original residents are being

the house of representatives and we have been spending time\nListening to what is on their minds so this is Orange County it's home to the largest Vietnamese population in the United states' part of this district is actually known as little Saigon and the anthem trend lives here she works in community affairs for a utility company she is raising two kids\nOr parents also live in this community but she says their lives and her's are so different\nParents are pretty much their lives are in little Saigon my dad works at a pharmacy and so they live there and the Vietnamese community right and for me I go out in the world I experience racism I Know what it feels like to be discriminated against I I think my parents have it because really they their lives are here\nExperience racist that I Know what it feels like to be discriminate against I I think my parents have that because really they their lives or hear their communities here they go to the ... they go to their customers are meeting these are our ... our diverse now I realize my experience as an American very different from my dad\nAnd these generational differences extend into politics older Vietnamese Americans have tended to vote Republican many of them fled communism and they see Republican presidents from Reagan on as being tougher on communist leaders some younger people like ten term trend has been leaning more democratic and that is one reason\nThe party believe they can unseat the Republican incumbent here\nSo when we went to visit the ... we had heard there were some political differences in her family though I'm not sure she herself new quite how stark they were\nHigh high she invited us into her parents' home her kids were playing around they were eating snacks and they were orbiting around the grandfather [noise] how Tran is the ... father he\nPrimarily speak Vietnamese and his everyday life including when he talks politics with his daughter [noise]\nHe's been backing Republicans since

much\nAnd and then what now I guess we're today we have Trump what do you think of Trump so far sofa\nIn this country who do good uh what do you like what do you have\nYou're unemployed rate the low uh-huh and um stock market in a row seat in Greece and so the economy's important do you yeah\nAnd that this is this is um I\nMark this in the roof in Greece and so the economy is important to you know\nNone of this is this is um I open\nIt [laughter]\nI didn't realize how he he thought of Trump but we haven't talked about that so is this the first time yeah and I had a surprise because then I'll have a conversation about the other stuff that he does against the media\nAgainst like just civil society we grow up knowing how undemocratic Vietnam is the crackdowns on freedom of the press on basic human rights women don't have the same rights there and to see some of that happening now in America you know in some factions of government is scary because that was something that I never would imagine\nWe would be in a situation where we have a president basically calling to press the enemy of the people like we hear that from communist Vietnam but we don't hear a you know I Would never have imagined that would be reality here today\nCould you say that you're done and yeah I'm just I just wonder why when Trump calls the media enemy of the people what your reaction to the\nMenu ally like all the whole goal and yelled out you know neither\nOf whom ... the press talk about what the ...\nBut they don't care about the truth and\nYou're just has CNN or didn't drum riff off for both him\nSo they're not there by us yeah Fox News clearly is by it and I don't know if he does is the al\n... they spend a lot I think it allows apple I'm Trump boxes like ... you know make a phone [laughter]\nYou think you think the media\nIs too negative about Trump food is not fair\nTo say that Russia interfered in through the election in this country mhm\nBut when they know that\nRussia and diffuse into the election in this country mhm\nBut when they know that\nWas it on Russian before the election [noise] the way until from both elected and the money issue\nSo if if they find out that Trump worked with yeah the Russians where that would that bother you yeah\nYou don't you don't believe that you\n... Gruber that don't need to believe them\nYou know ... the ... FBI ... know jazz job no no no he believes\nThat the Mueller investigation should continue so that they have we have the facts I agree with that\nYeah to some degree on yeah\nThere are a lot of families who've been divided over\nTheir views of Trump what is your dinner conversations that yeah go really badly in I mean people get it from the table yeah it I mean this is it doesn't seem to be happening in this\nNo because I don't think our country should be torn apart because of one person\nI clearly am strongly against you know what the president stands for\nBut I also believe it's important to you I mean I respect my parents I Know what their experience has been and and we came here so that we can have the freedom to have different views to have this kind of conversations because they don't happen in Vietnam and so the fact that my dad has a different view from me on this particular issue that doesn't bother him because we have that freedom that's why my parents' lead Vietnam to be here in the first place\nEverybody got to go to vote yes you both for tours and for future either we tuned in\nTo think everybody should vote yeah\nAnd my father I didn't mention any he

News I'm David Greene and I'm Steve Inskeep in Nineteen sixty five when President Lyndon Johnson went to Congress to propose the voting rights act he outlined some of the bill's provisions\nFinally this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting\nBut even though when it comes to voter registration laws there is a good deal of confusion and in some cases controversy here's Noel King with commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions about how politics and the government work\nAhead of this year's election some states have already closed voter registration while other states allow people to register at their polling places on election day what is the deal with this patchwork system what is the deal\nWhile other states allow people to register at their polling places on election day what is the deal with this patchwork system what is the deal is going to jail All right here's our first listener question\nThis is ... heart from San Francisco California I'd like to ask Cokie whether voter registration laws were controversial before the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five however loss changed since the Supreme Court granted black citizens the right to vote have white citizens' ... barriers to voter registration\nThe basic answer is yes voter registration laws were controversial at first people staffing the polls were just expected to know everybody didn't in their neighborhood but then in Eighteen hundred Massachusetts instituted the first voter registration\nAnd as the century moved on it became more widespread partly in a move to make sure that non citizen immigrants didn't vote a by the late nineties early twentieth century is a rural dominated state legislatures impose registration on city voters again it was named immigrants and at fraud by big city political machines\nWhat about the rest of her question there what about the effects on black citizens versus white citizens' well of\nCourse black men were given the right to vote in the fifties amendment and Eighteen Seventy but the Jim Crow laws and the south effectively\nStripped African Americans of their voting rights in terms of rights of course white women and black women couldn't vote nationally until the nineteenth amendment in Nineteen twenty but you know before the sixty five bill a lot of whites in the south couldn't vote either just because the registrars had frozen the roles they didn't want anybody new voting\nAll right we have a couple of questions about current controversies my name is Rachel ... men from Shaker Heights Ohio why is the candidate for governor allowed to purge the voter rolls shouldn't he recused himself a secretary of state while he's a candidate\nI assume this is in reference to Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp who is the current secretary of state and this and thinking about using himself he's for votes\nWell I assume this is in reference to Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp who is the current secretary of state and this and thinking about ... himself he's provoked a lawsuit by buddy more than fifty thousand new voter applications on hold for minor inconsistencies\nThe lawsuit charges discrimination saying eighty percent of those applicants are members of racial minority groups\nThough they can't vote early or by mail they can still vote if they show up the right polling place with the proper ID\nOkay that that idea of proper ID that gets right to our next question Hi my name is Amy payment chart and I live in Omaha Nebraska\nWhen I heard about the Supreme Court ruling the ideas for voting would need to have a street address it didn't faze me and I heard that a lot of Native Americans on reservations only have a post office address how is that going to affect their ability to vote\nWhile they're complaining about it this has to do with the recent Supreme Court decision upholding in North Dakota voter id law which does require current residential street address Native American groups say that off and on reservations they don't have those and pointing icy irony that the nation's original residents are

their lives and her's are so different\nMy parents are pretty much their lives are lost sight on my dad works at a pharmacy\nAnd so they live there and the Vietnamese community right and for me I go out in the world I experience racist that I Know what it feels like to be discriminated against I I think my parents haven't because really they their lives or hear their communities here they go to the ... they go to their customers are ... or ... or diverse\nNow I realize my experience as an American very different from my dad\nAnd these generational differences extend into politics older Vietnamese Americans have tended to vote Republican many of them fled communism and they see Republican presidents from Reagan on as being tougher on communist leaders some younger people like ten term trend has been leaning more democratic and that is one reason\nThe party believe they can unseat the Republican incumbent here\nSo when we went to visit the ... we had heard\nWere some political differences in her family though I'm not sure she herself new quite how stark they were\nHigh high she invited us into her parents' home her kids were playing around they were eating snacks and they were orbiting around the grandfather how trend\nThe grandfather [noise] hell\nTran is the ... father he primarily speak Vietnamese in his everyday life including when he talks politics with his daughter he's been backing Republicans since he first started voting in Nineteen Ninety two and he told me he was certainly no fan of president Barack Obama who he said just wasn't tough enough on the

he thought of Trump because we haven't talked about that is the first time yeah and I had a surprise 'cause then I'll have a conversation about the other stuff that he does against the media\nAgainst like just civil society we grow up knowing how undemocratic Vietnam is to crack down on freedom of the press on basic human rights women don't have the same rights there and to see some of that happening now in America you know in some factions of government is scary because that was something that I never would imagine\nWe will be in a situation where we have a president said basically calling to press the enemy of the people like we hear that from communist Vietnam but we don't hear a you know I Would never have imagined that would be reality here today\nCould you say that you're dead and yeah I'm just I just wonder why when Trump calls the media enemy of the people what your reaction is to that\nMan you know I like all the whole goal and yelled out GM neither did\nWhat your reaction is to that\nMenu alive like oh you're going to add that to you from taking\nYou to some time to press talk about what these changes\nBut they don't care about the food thing\nYou did his say

be torn apart because of one person I clearly have strongly against you know what the president stands for\nBut I also believe it's important to you I mean I respect my parents I Know what their experience has been and and we came here so that we can have the freedom to have different views to have these kind of conversation because they don't happen in Vietnam and so the fact that my dad has a different view from me on this particular issue that doesn't bother him because we have that freedom that's why my parents let Vietnam to be here in the first place\nOver the ...\nGot to go to vote
