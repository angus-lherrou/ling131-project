Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and embolden there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be older because if the Democrats taken by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts that opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere will be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could lead congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump being base of the party former\nHouse Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently at forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause he's at eighty eight or Ninety Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nFirst thing they'll say the morning at the election\nHave no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say that morning at the election is we're dedicated electric re election of Donald Trump and that becomes the

Goldwater responsible for one of them Ronald Reagan Gingrich himself and now President Trump does he see each of these waves that's connected to to the previous\nWell he does but what's interesting is that when you press them on that you know why why how are all of these connected because you could make a case that philosophically they're all quite different\nUm what he said to me was you know basically they're all anti liberal which I think actually illustrates a broader point about the politics that Gingrich helped create which is it's tribal in nature partisan and nature and\nDriven especially by negative partisanship it's about a desire to beat the other team more than it is accomplished some unified goal\nIt is a zero sum it's totally versus them President Trump was on sixty minutes last night talking about what a nasty place Washington DC is\nBackstabbing duplicitous and almost in the same breath he said I feel very comfortable uh was was thinker jazz comfortable

Gingrich like most about Trump when\nYou try to get him to talk about Trump is andme or or the brand of conservatism that the president stands for what he talks about most is the personality and the larger than life style and how how cutthroat he can be that's what Gingrich likes about Trump and I think that says a lot about his worldview\nWhat end though I mean where Democrats a poor the idea of what Trump has right in terms of our political discourse the erosion of norms undermining of institutions does\nIt's world view to what end no I mean where Democrats support the idea of what Trump has right in terms of our political discourse erosion of norms undermining of institutions says Gingrich see all this as a long awaited political breaks through\nYou know totally I think that in in the big scheme of things she actually likes that our politics has gotten more tribal and more vicious and has kind of shed a lot of these civilized and traits he thinks that it should be two teams you know duking it out and ... and that's how he or she sees the world and he's happy that it's gotten to where it is\nFunding for K. and hey you comes from Humphrey some it's the winter adventure gear in

Inskeep\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin it would be understandable if executives and Kentucky bourbon industry said they need to drink bourbon whiskey as the target of tariffs in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states the same reasons\nWhy we have the world's resources at the same reason where the world's greatest bourbon\nKentucky system lumps don't show\nThough I'm show filters out for water takes it all the impurities and uh\nKentucky sits on the limestone shelf\nThat lumps of shell filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world's best whiskey how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six centuries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nOh it it it's getting to the point where it's it's more than ... percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past seniors you're probably global sales have been out pacing your domestic sales while\nAnd just to just to be clear on that fact that you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over\n... but yes they I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements well a nap to on the agreement\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat all\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem or but at the same time we you know ... are starting to look at what happens if it starts to escalate mhm and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away\nAnd well ah we don't like the options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase tests are taxes no doubt about it\nSo you're either going to pass along those costs a consumer and hopefully you know have people that you've converting from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back a which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so the lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any other\nState of the obvious as a state that\nBack home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any of them\nStayed in the obvious this is a state that voted for president today has voted for Republicans a lot to ask 'em\nWhen you have conversations with people do you run into people who were having conflicted feelings\nOr [noise] I think we all understand that there are no winners or trade war and you know we're we didn't ask for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why we know we're kind of\nCollateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much uh uh come up as an issue yet\nYou made an issue like an election yeah it has come up I mean congressman Barr has been very helpful to us in the past few months he\nSaid the meeting with a vice president Pence when he came to Kentucky in the spring how does the vice president response he you know being from Indiana he knows what pardon means you can decades or he well known for the non geographically minded right across right across the river yes uh and and he told us he understood exactly that this with the sushi could mean for us\nBourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else\nYou can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thanks to Nineteen sixty federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon being indigenous spirits United States\nUnlike you know highly David sandwich announce it can move some production overseas we can't do that with bourbon you've got to make it here\nIn America and if you want to sell you better make Kentucky\nBeginning next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this hasn't been a a I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they started looking and and from a price standpoint if\nThe bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before you know we might lose people bar industry and if we lose them now than we might lose him for generations\nRight maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before you know we might lose the bar industry and if we lose them now than we might lose him for generations beret Gregory of Kentucky distillers association\nNext we turn to the effort to total that damage from hurricane Michael which had Florida's panhandle last week NPR's Camila Domonoske reports since hurricane Michael hit impassable roads and non functional phones and made life difficult for residents and rescue teams and for insurance adjuster\nStreet just ... miles across\n... works in the fraud division of tower hill a Florida homeowner's insurance company over the weekend he caught a cell phone signal near Panama City there were still places it wasn't safe for his team to travel\nFor a situation like that we're relying on aerial that aside at it\nAnd it wasn't just buildings that were devastated by the storm\nA lot of areas of last a generation of timber poultry farms are hit pretty hard and Scott industry is devastated\nChris Chandler isn't adjuster with alpha insurance and Alabama he's been working in Houston county\nCaught was ready to be picked last week and a sixty Seventy a hundred miles per hour winds just blows it a lot\nLess people source of income so lovely\nEarly estimate suggests this hurricane caused billions of dollars of damage Fitch Ratings says that insurance companies will have substantial cost but Fitch also says the industry has quote well positioned to absorb the losses\nAnd yeah that's what insurance companies are supposed to do but in Florida in particular every big storm raises worries that the industry will just fail\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to many companies went bankrupt or backed away from covering coastal areas so\nIs that the industry will just fail after Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to many companies went bankrupt or backed away from covering coastal areas so we had some good news the analysts say that's not likely to happen now the communities are still facing a long difficult recovery Chandler in Alabama says the damage is upsetting\nYou wish that you could just snap your finger and like everything back to normal obviously that's not going to happen or you know when you're you're talking to people that houses have destroyed\nAll their belongings showed her pictures low amount of money is going to get an image back of your of your patients that are passed away so your child first birthday\nWhile some things are lost forever he says communities are already working together to start to rebuild can you hold on I'm asking NPR News\nThis is NPR News new\nAcross the country prison discipline comes down harder on winning you can get written up for not closing doors you get written up for jumping on the phone without permission and those low level infractions can have severe consequences like more time\nJust the way the Democrats in Congress President Obama's legislative agenda die the minute canter and his fellow Republicans took over when they won the house in twenty ten\nLook it's no fun to be in perpetual minority I can tell you that and especially in the house where a simple majority gives you almost absolute power to again sets the agenda and get bills across the floor\nThat will greatly affect the willingness for some who have been at it for a long time and make the decision whether maybe they should retire or not\nCantor things more Republicans will head for the exits if they lose but Karl Rove former top advisor to President George W. Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and emboldened there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be emboldened because what if the Democrats taken by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts in opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere will be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines Trump has never hesitated to\nHe talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines Trump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks and Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump being base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently at forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause he's at eighty eight or Ninety or Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning at the election as we're dedicated to luxury election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding dull\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern that means funding the wall replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security\nAccomplishments that looted them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrow majority making at all even harder Mara Liasson NPR News Washington [noise]\nThe European Union but there's a lot of unfinished business like how will read it affects recent collaboration\nWith the government has indicated that mobility for sort of people that are working in recession Bush made possible\nBy the you know he's a big disruptive Russian ethnic here now\nThey're down today will soon from eleven to noon on you and you news ... screaming at can you know you've done in\n\nThe morning I'm Steve Inskeep pet friendly bars now I have a gym for pets a drink\nMake it in the long run of orange juice in Houston Chronicle reports\nThey're making dog friendly beer alcohol free\nThey started making it for their own rock wider thinking it would help with digestion they say they're now selling it\nTo more than twenty bars and restaurants the varieties of dark beer include one called mailman malt liquor and IP a lot in the yard It's MORNING edition\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from zoom zoom offers cloud video conferencing online meetings and a video conference room solution and one platform featuring digital video and audio screen sharing account registration and more at zoom dot U.

Goldwater responsible for one of 'em Ronald Reagan Gingrich himself and now President Trump does he see each of these waves that's connected to to the previous\nWell he does but what's interesting is that when you press them on that you know why why how are all these connected because you can make a case that philosophically they're all quite different um\nWhat he said to me was you know basically they're all anti liberal\nBecause you can make a case that philosophically they're all quite different um\nWhat he said to me was you know basically they're all anti liberal which I think actually illustrates a broader point about the politics that Gingrich helped create which is it's tribal in nature partisan in nature and\nDriven especially by negative partisanship it's about a desire to beat the other team more than it is accomplished some unified goal\nIt is a zero sum it's totally versus them President Trump was on sixty minutes last night talking about what a nasty place Washington D. C. is the backstabbing complicity and almost in the same breath he said I feel very comfortable uh was was Gingrich as comfortable swimming in this one he\nWas I mean in a lot of ways he created the swamp that the Trump now says he's trying to drain right\nI'm ... and you know I think that this is actually one of the things that Gingrich like most about Trump when\nYou try to get him to talk about Trump is him or or the brand of conservatism that the president stands for what he talks about most is the personality and the larger than life style and how how cutthroat he can be that's what Gingrich likes about Trump and I think that says a lot about his world view\nTo what end though I mean where Democrats support the idea of what Trump has right in terms of our political discourse erosion of norms undermining of institutions does Gingrich see all this as a long awaited political break through\nYou know totally I think that in in the big scheme of things she actually likes that our politics has gotten more tribal in more vicious and has kind of shed a lot of these civilized and traits he thinks that it should be two teams you know duking it out and I and that's how he uh he
