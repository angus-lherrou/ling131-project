college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage more than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which badger says is a good option instead\nOf remaining

that they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want a backstop they may want something and they made by these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA policies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some and\nWant something

them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out

Kurdish city of ... gene I understand there are no official results yet but any indication as to what a new Kurdish parliament could look like\nWell for the most part Rachel it's gonna be the status quo you know there are two main parties here that have existed for decades and they will continue their control but the interesting thing is their opposition parties including one that didn't even exist in the last elections five years ago it's aimed at young people\nAnd it looks like that party at least will do well here's an election observer named ... from the opposition ... party and older party explaining why he thought voters were rejecting those traditional parties\nThe most is is not just on the way you have to be implemented in reality but fortunately in foster used in the office

people you have to be implemented in reality but fortunately for using the walkers and making things ...\nInside of the most almost lost\nHuh and by then he means that he and a lot of voters I talked to frankly are frustrated over the lack of opportunity the fact that the party's control of the jobs lack of freedom for people not connected with those big parties\nSo what does that mean to ... was turn out good as a result of this frustration you were at polling stations right yeah that was a really\nInteresting thing because we went early in the morning and we stayed and we did not see a lot of people but the results that they're citing are\nActually pretty high I'm One of the big fears has always been fears of fraud there were allegations of widespread fraud in federal elections here in may in fact one of the party headquarters was attacked after\nSo one of the biggest parties the u._k. immediately said it was rejecting all the results but then they rescinded that\nSo here's one of the problems media were only allowed in a very few polling stations we got in one one of the approved polling stations and we were able\nTo watch them start to count some of the ballots so there is an election official taking out each paper ballots [noise] because they decided not to do the automated valid counting because they think that leads to fraud\nAnd he's reading out the names of each

question\nRight so I mean we've heard for generations how the Kurds have been wanting their own state right so there's an ... an innate tension between the Kurdish regional government\nAnd the central government in Baghdad so what how how could the new government in essentially Kurdistan affects the the relationship with Baghdad\nAbsolutely you've hit the nail on the head because they had a
