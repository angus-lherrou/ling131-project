this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen\nElection anger building and it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning on women's march it was also anger at some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the interim ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march\nAnd it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history\nAnd it obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious\nAnd it was really dismissed and a lot of quarters as being about the cats the Pussy hats you know a bunch of women getting together and there's a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's march series\nYou know a bunch of women getting together and there's a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's

care repeal teachers' strikes women running for office in historic numbers and then meet you\n[noise] you lean into history in this book and it's full of examples of men's anger\nBeing laudable creating admirable political change the Boston Tea party is a great example what historically was so threatening about women's anchor well in part that anger of the founding our founders who were the white men chafing against their lack of representation\nAnd who were angry and protested in ways that we understand correctly to this is our revolutionary moment but when they made their new nation\nThey codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government so they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women\n[noise] you referenced the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out are condemned to in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outsized penalty for women of color who do so\nDo you think those voices are being heard loudly enough in this moment I think it's almost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of

so many of\nSo an hurt and so marginalized for so long and in fact it's women of color who have been the leaders and the leading thinkers of so many of our social movements in ways that have remain invisible to us so when we think about me to one of the things that gets lost\nIs that the definition of sexual harassment stems from cases that were brought in the seventies by women of color\nWho were actually borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases of having in many cases have been brutally sexually harassed and their workplaces\nIn Nineteen Ninety One it was a need a hill his testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea that sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter]\nIt's Toronto Burke who in two thousand six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement Iraq's\nI think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience or the reality of the harm they sustained but in fact\nAll of that is for grounded by women of color who stories so often get lost or kind of erased\nAs the author of a book called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [noise]\nThat's true but that could have been true of so many other weeks of the past two years we have to say there are plenty of women who support Kavanaugh women who are indeed angry because they believe that this is a character assassination by the left so as women's anger only a productive force if it's done in the service\nTo a progressive partisan agenda not at all it is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still I\nA partisan agenda not at all it is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still\nI think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this is part of

be clear the AFL CIA oh Teamsters and others say they remain undecided about whether to support the deal mainly Drake says because it's not clear how the U.S would be able to enforce the new labor

big three us automakers would benefit because many of their cars would be compliant with the new rules that balance as it makes us a less appealing place to make cars for foreign automakers\nThese rules don't apply if you're building a car in Asia or if you're building a car in Europe and those are going to be relatively cheaper to build automobiles to export anywhere around the world\nAnd that

Brett Kavanaugh this week and with the Supreme Court nominees still in the news it's hard for a lot of us to get last week's hearing out of our minds author Rebecca Traister keeps thinking about how different the tone was of the two witnesses\nDr Blass before it was so deferential so polite so constrained\nI understand and appreciate the importance of you're hearing from me directly about what happened to me and the impact that it had on my life and I my family\nAnd then in came Brett Kavanaugh his instinct was very public fury on his own behalf\nOf his number one in the class I don't know I thought oh no no no no no I'm going out there so I'm going to go on no I mean I'm sure I'm going to talk about my ... year mocked me was\nThat was an exchange between Brett Kavanaugh and democratic Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy during those hearings Rebecca Traister says men in general are allowed to use a full range of expression and still come off as credible\nHe had in his arsenal the ability to use anger fury tears\nIn a way that he felt confident would resonate with the American people I don't think that Dr Christine Blasey Ford I Can't imagine a scenario in which she would have gone into that hearing room\nArmed with that same weapon that same tool that she could yell and be furious in ...\nHearing room armed with that same weapon that same tool that she could yell and be furious in her retelling of what happened to her\n... has been exploring the idea of women and anger and her new book out today it's called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nThe moment that it occurred to me that I wanted to write this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen election anger building and it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning on women's march it was also anger\nAt some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the interim ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march\nAnd it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history and\nIt obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious\nAnd it was really dismissed and a lot of quarters as being about the cats the Pussy hats you know a bunch of women getting together and there's a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's march seriously what are these women gonna do not just running for school board down the road but this week\nAnd of course then that gets us to a year that has women protesters opposing the health care repeal teachers' strikes women running for office in historic numbers and then meet you\n[noise] you lean into history in this book and it's full of examples of men's anger\nBeing laudable creating admirable political change the Boston Tea party is a great example what historically was so threatening about women's anchor well in part\nThat anger of the founding our founders who were the white men chafing\nHistorically was so threatening about women's anchor well in part that anger of the founding our founders who were the white men chafing against their lack of representation and who were angry and protest it in ways that we understand correctly to ... this is our revolutionary moment\nBut when they made their new nation\nThey codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government so\nThey built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women\n[noise] you referenced the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out are condemned to in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outsized penalty for women of color who do so\nDo you think those voices are being heard loudly enough in this moment\nI think it's almost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and\nSo marginalized for so long and in fact it's women of color who have been the leaders and the leading thinkers of so many of our social movements in ways that have remain invisible to us so when we think about me to one of the things that gets lost\nIs that the definition of sexual harassment\nStems from cases that were brought in the seventies by women of color\nWho were actually borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases of having in many cases have been brutally sexually harassed and their workplaces\nIn Nineteen Ninety One it was a need a hill his testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea that sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter]\nIt's Toronto Burke who in two thousand six pioneers and\nDEA that sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter] it's Toronto Burke who in two thousand six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement Iraq\nI think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience with the reality of the harm they sustained but in fact\nAll of that is for grounded by women of color who stories so often get lost or kind of erased\nAs the author of a book called good and mad the revolutionary power of women's anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [noise]\nThat's true but that could have been true of so many other weeks of the past ... years\nAlthough we have to say there are plenty of women who support Kavanaugh women who are indeed angry because they believe that this was a character assassination by the left so as women think are only a productive force if it's done in the service to a progressive partisan agenda\nNot at all it is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still\nI think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this is part of a long process social movements take a long time and the kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around Kavanaugh\nIs going to be part of a far longer story that's going to extend deep into our future\nRebecca Traister is the author of the book good

ACLU and more than a dozen other legal groups have raised similar concerns the bill also mandates the use of pre trial assessment tools essentially it's computer program that aims to measure risk after putting in arrest and conviction history and other data\nThat algorithm gives the bill of near of objective science attorney racing says but in fact becomes a kind of feedback loop merely reflecting social biases\nIs a pretty well documented fact the police stop search detain arrest black people more than white people poor people more than wealthy people and that the courts treat people of color and treat poor people worse or the various factors that the risk assessment tools are looking at\nPeople and that the courts treat people of color and treat poor people worse or there's various factors that these risk assessment tools are looking at to judge who's higher risk\nAnd it's not yet clear just what data would actually go into the algorithm the bill doesn't

to detain or release pre trial has always reside in with judges\nThis new law she thinks will simply help judges get it right more consistently\nAll that and of course make better than it should also right people being identified as a threat to public safety and it shouldn't melt in your people needlessly incarcerated ending trial\nMeantime the bail industry which would be put out of business
