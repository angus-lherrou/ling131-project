baseless in a background briefing for reporters a senior FEMA official conceded while there is no opting out of the alert\nSystem is very well governed and you would not have a situation where the

and trying to design right the enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties\nShe started trying to improve the performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme up putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzyme and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display it uses a virus to infect bacteria\nAnd it can be used to evolve new proteins and including antibodies that is what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and apply to the antibodies and you know by doing that you can create anti bodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI

who'd been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy led the attack\nIn Robert Bork some Erica there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court for Robert Bork\nThe Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination and eventually Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat that it's being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about our politics and government work hike okay I see here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process has ended how does it affect their legacy or not\nWell out of a hundred and sixty three nominations residents are sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five and been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\n... means that it's not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen have been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington was when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice aid for deceptive chief also found in the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first appeared before the Judiciary Committee\nWell the other part of our question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like those different ones have just\nWell when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice Abe Fortas up to chief also failed and the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWell the other part of her question was interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then demand President Reagan named after work a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because either legally smoke marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until he took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee because that caused them to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely or the way you remove the Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate that was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for\nThomas Jefferson wanted them off the court because he disagreed with them politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric John Randall off in the house of representatives that hit wiped the floor with chase a so this nastiness is hardly knew\nUm but then the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing adjusted for political reasons\nThat leads to another question Hi this is Kelly my her from birth still Connecticut I was wondering do other comparable countries have lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now if so what was the result of what is it worth these lifetime appointments well lots\n... off in the house representatives said hit wiped the floor with chase a so's this nastiness is hardly

variety of scenarios where it would be good for the president to be able to speak directly to the public\nBut this is where Dr redlin or has some qualms especially he says when it comes to this president\nWe shudder to think that the president might be using such a shift them for political purposes or to create a diversion if he felt the presidency without a threat\nFor whatever reason so I think there are real insurance I it'd be so lived about it but these are not ours that many Americans would want to give to Donald Trump\nRed letter is not alone last week three people filed suit in New York to block the testing the system known as wireless emergency alerts or W E a the suit states the plaintiffs are Americans who do not wish to receive text messages of any kind on any topic or

Winter at the ... the laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution\nAnd so basically the idea is they took the principles of Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test to basically you know developing new types of chemicals in enzymes by inserting an element of randomness ... of the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by you know using logic and trying to design right the enzyme to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the

trying to improve the performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme\nUp putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzyme and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith developed a technique called phage display uses the virus to infect bacteria\nAnd it can be used to evolve new proteins and including antibodies that is what Gregory Winter did he took phage display and apply to to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create anti bodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world well you know\nBy using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process\nI mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you could you know develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you

... dot org and from the any each case the foundation\nThis is MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep let's recall a Supreme Court battle before the one we're living through no judge Brett Kavanaugh's contentious Senate hearing last week recalled some earlier ones including a Nineteen eighty seven showdown\nBetween Democratic senators and them federal appeals court judge Robert Bork who'd been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy lead the attack\nIn Robert Bork some Erica there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court\nFor Robert Bork the Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination at eventually Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat\nThat it's being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about our politics or the government work hike okay Hi fi here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process has ended how does it affect their legacy or not well out of a hundred\nAnd sixty three nominations that presidents have sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five and been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on so we don't have the means that it's not controversial and that at all in favor say aye and they just go right only about a dozen had been rejected\nSo the government work hike okay I see here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process offended how does it affect their legacy or not well out of a hundred and\nSixty three nominations that presidents have sent to the Senate a hundred and twenty five and been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSo what do you mean that is not controversial and not at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen had been rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington while when the Senate refused to remove Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice a forge us up to chief also failed and the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWell the other part of our question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resign from his judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then the man President Reagan named after work a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because it illegally smoked marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until they took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found but he lived in front of the Senate Judiciary committee cars that caused them to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely the way you remove the Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate that was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for Thomas Jefferson wanted them off the court because he disagreed with them politically\nOf course withdraw because he had to legally smoke marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until they took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee because that caused them to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely the way you remove the Supreme Court justices through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate\nThat was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for Thomas Jefferson wanted them off the court because he disagreed with them politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric John Randall off in the house of representatives had hit wiped the floor with chase a so this nastiness is hardly knew\nUm but then the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing the justice for political reasons\nAnd that leads to another question Hi this is Kelly my her from birth still Connecticut I was wondering do other comparable countries have lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now if so what was the result of what is it with these lifetime appointments swell lots", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "Grand Canyon", "day": "03"}
