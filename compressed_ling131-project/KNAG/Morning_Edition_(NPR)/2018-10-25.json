King good morning\nThe u._s. stock market looks ready to recover some of yesterday's dramatic losses when Wall Street opens this morning most Asian markets were down overnight the Nikkei hang saying but the Shanghai stock exchange was stable which was unexpected because\nChina stock market has fallen thirty percent since January and its currency is falling to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly two years\nNPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai good morning Rob you more into our what thirty percent drop for China stock\nIn nearly two years NPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai good morning Rob good morning to isolate thirty percent top pertain to stock market sounds pretty darn bad what's going on\n[noise] well China's economy has been lagging for the last few years the government's dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debt spiraling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble\nAnd through all of this Beijing's making painful changes in how China's economy runs moving from an economy based on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn in China stock market this year reflects that\nBut it's important to remember here that when China stock market dropped by thirty percent like this year it isn't going to have\nAs big an impact on the economy like if the ... the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is edited weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is tiny manipulating its currency\n[noise] well it's interesting hearing well is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing [noise]\nYears ago China used to weaken its currency to make exports cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that the u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\nChina is doing a China doesn't want its currency to depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now\nSo if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and China are these terrorists\nWe can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and China\nAre these terrorists that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a kind of I'm speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chains to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war and that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U. S. China's economy was already vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost\nNPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks out ...\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change Silicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes\nBlocks chain that technology behind crypto currency like bitcoin is the latest solution coming from big tech\nMember station KCUR December net has more\nUntil about a year ago hardly anyone in climate science is talking about watching but at the recent global climate action some in San Francisco it was all over the place there were panels papers people were talking about how he can help mitigate climate change in all sorts of\nLand use agriculture harvests oils frustration power\nSome dumb and coaches the climate change coalition he came to the conference to spread awareness about ...

that isn't held by a central authority like a bank but instead on the computers of everyone on the block chain\nTransparency is its main advantage tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency block chain to solve all sorts of problems everything from curing cancer to ending human trafficking and now even climate change\nIts it's our intention to build the infrastructure to make it possible to reverse climate change\nBall gamble used to be a software product manager he's working on climate change now but he's still makes the grand tech world pitches he's the CEO of a new Silicon Valley company called ...\n... is a black chain based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credit systems the total number of carbon possible to admit is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting end to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nAnd then the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch you want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy\nBecause a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution that things that fix climate change are going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars\nThe things that sticks climate change are going to be really hard\nLike getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars the pollute because I said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data were the hot new things and these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nIs watching could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees a company's planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mock a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt's essentially Ken kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place the solutions that are actually more important to make the entirety of the problem something not solvable\nWith a clock ticking on climate change ... there's no time to waste

after a rough day yesterday the Dow was trading up about point eight percent this hour\nBut I don't think the market volatility we've been seeing in the past couple of weeks is not over NPR's Yuki Noguchi joins us now to discuss some of these markets swings ... good morning I'm All right so it has been a choppy October yesterday markets closed down and the Dow innocent pie basically erased all their gains for the year what has\nBeen going on it's because investors are conflicted and one of their biggest underlying concerns is the global economy you know how the trade war will play out and how higher terrorists might effects might affect U.S companies\nAre you're starting to see some of that already a caterpillar which makes farm equipment and three am which is a huge conglomerate that makes everything from sponges to car parts\nAh this we talked about how that's starting to affect their bottom line now on the plus side the economy and labor market are and have been chugging along so there are no clear indications that that's going to hit a wall or some companies are beating expectations\nAnd although interest rates are heading up there still historically low All right\nSo some good factors some bad factors one of those sectors that's been hardest hit in recent days is the tech sector\nUp there still historically low All right so some good factors some bad factors one of those sectors that's been hardest hit in recent days is the tech sector yesterday the NASDAQ which is made up of a lot of tech stocks I had one of the worst days in seven years now this morning we should say it is trading up but what is going on in the technology sector\nIt well the technology sector has been on an even steadier and stronger Bull Run in recent years I'm apple this summer you might recall became the first company to reach a trillion dollars and market value so basically textbooks have already risen very high end of a lot\nFurther to fall a and when you have a ... few companies talking as you saw this week about week sales or miss profits\nOn that makes investors nervous that perhaps those stocks are overvalued and tech is a great example actually of how the volatility kind of spreads around the world yesterday you had some us tech firms including Texas Instruments and\nAT and T. reporting some weaker earnings which then prompted you Asian tech stocks including Sony and Samsung to fall overnight\nBut then by the morning you had stronger results out of European tech firms in some U.S companies including Microsoft and Twitter this morning and that's helping shore up some of those losses\nSo it kind of good contagion they're eating nerve wracking though to see the markets lose like six hundred points in a day and analysts say this could continue for a while really quickly why is that\nIt's largely because we don't have clarity on some of the questions that I outlined at the outset where's the global economy headed how much of a trade war is going to affect companies\nAnd until investors feel they have a clearer picture on that you are likely to see strong reactions to any kind of news that could be interpreted as a significant development and we'll get another chance a later today with Amazon\nActions to any kind of news that could be interpreted as a significant development and we'll get another chance a later today with

technology behind crypto currency is like bitcoin is the latest solution coming from big tech\nMember station KCUR December net has more\nUntil about a year ago hardly anyone in climate science is

record of transactions that isn't held by a central authority like a bank\nBut it said on the computers of everyone on the block chain transparency is its main advantage ... tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency block Jane to solve all sorts of problems everything from curing cancer to ending human trafficking now even climate change\nIts it's our

of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credits systems the total number of carbon possible to admit is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more\nEconomists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use block chain to verify the accounting end to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nNow the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch\nYou want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy because as a researcher at UC Santa Barbara\nYou said the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution the things that fix climate change are going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people\nTo stop driving cars the pollute\nBecause it before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data were the hot new things\nAnd these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nSays blushing could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees the company's planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mock and a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nEssentially Ken kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place the solutions that\nBut she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt's

just a moment but first let's recap what's been a a wet and kind of a wild\nStart to fall this far it certainly has really you know this October has been one for the record books across much of Arizona will just start with Phoenix because it's there are the most impressive that out of October it five point three five inches in Phoenix that's nearly their yearly\nPrecipitation total but it is the third wettest month ever recorded not only October third met wettest month of all time ever recorded in Phoenix in over a hundred years and here in Flagstaff where just over four inches which I\nBelieve puts us at uh the seventh or six wettest\nOctober of all time so it has been a cool and wet mud for sure it seems like we went right for monsoon into the ...\nWettest October of all time so it has been a cool and wet month for sure it seems like we went right for monsoon into the beginning of this month when we had some hurricane moisture all through that we had a fall storm and even some mountains snow across the region it's been a mixed bag\nAround here this October but that things are changing here going into the final days of the month not to mention we had a tornado as well touchdown so we had was NATO edged out outside of winds low last weekend just over a\nRural areas yeah very a week kind of wrote tornado but you know not totally unusual October's the month that we usually see tornadoes people maybe recall I think it was back in two thousand twelve the big tornado outbreak out towards Belmont or it might have been two thousand nine\nIt's escaping me right now but there was like eight confirmed touchdowns\nSo now we shift into more fall like whether this weekend finally it only took us like you know for weeks to go first to feel like ... or mild fall whether we should say I mean it was some wet fall weather and a little on the cool side and we'd have certainly been accustomed\nTo some mild October's around here in recent years this October was a special kind of treat but uh we're moving into some very mild weather here as something we haven't talked about recently high pressure\nActually building into the region and an extended period here of some actually above normal temperatures and ah all sunshine OK Now let's move ahead a little bit here because\nWe just got the confirmation from climatologist that\nUh El Nino appears to be forming in the Pacific right or no it just released an El Nino watch warmer than average editorial Pacific waters are forming and there's a Seventy Seventy five percent chance we move into an El Nino winter here it is forecasts\nWaters are forming and there was a Seventy to Seventy five percent chance we move into an El Nino winter here it is for has to be a week\nEl Nino which is typically not a huge deal across the south west but still tilts our odds\nTowards a a wetter than average winter just slightly tilted\nTowards a a wet winter versus you know when no what comes out the climate Prediction Center comes out with our ah winter outlooks and they just did for the three month outlook period\nOf November December and January and they have Arizona in a thirty three to forty percent chance\nOf wetter than average it doesn't mean it's gonna be super what things were slightly tilted towards wetter than average let's say we were a forty percent chance of wetter than average that still leaves a sixty
