Halloween costumes\nIt was a controversy on the outskirts of New York with ... as she dresses Diana Ross and I felt like who doesn't want Diana she wants to look like Diane around her one day I I don't know how like that got races on hollow why\nNow NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting that the network has dropped Kelly\nI I don't know how like that got raises Holloway now NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting that the network has dropped Kelly from the today show lineup and that she appears likely to leave the network because of the fallout from those comments the money David\n... okay so this is not the first time that Megan Kelly has made controversial comments about race here she's in twenty Thirteen when she was an anchor on Fox News for all your kids watch at home than it and just as white she says it was a white man to tell us about her history of making racialized comments\nWell these aren't uh the only examples of that there are number I remember back in twenty and the Santa Jesus comments back from twenty Thirteen she later said she'd been joking and last year claim that she she regretted those remarks but\nI remember back in twenty ten um she spent a fair amount of time on a tiny tiny he'd group black hate group called the new Black Panthers a one I Believe them ultimately a face criminal charges related to voter intimidation she spent over three and a half hours in a three week period focusing on to this though was a threat to the Republican\nIndeed as one of her former colleagues were counted basically yelled at a white liberal a strategist for about ten minutes who she felt was failing to take it a sufficiently seriously uh one more example among several uh she keeps kept inviting the a former LA up a homicide detective mark ... on the air to talk about a ... a\nCriminal justice issues and to talk about ah the question of a African American relations with police officers he of course had to admit on the stand he had said racist things over the years during the OJ trial um many people saw that as a as discredited thing she welcomed him on the show\nDo you think that history played a role in NBC's decision to let her go\nI think it's played a strong role in uh the reaction of NBC's colleagues particularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American journalists are outraged who her remarks about uh\nThe reaction of NBC's colleagues particularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American journalists are outraged to her remarks about ah which he felt was the acceptability a blackface\nNBC's nightly news with Lester Holt did a whole segment about this controversy on its OWN Network which seems to suggest something about making Kelly's colleagues an attitude toward her\nWell for you and me it might be an admirable exercise and transparency and I think it was that I think it's worth pointing out also Lester Holt the only African American anchor ah of any of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was saying we're not going to protect the starting with we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces and TV news which\nIs really interesting the fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the way the network has handled these comments see something bigger about the way networks and companies are are tolerate it tolerating racialized or racist comments\nWell it's hard not to look at this in light of a you know the reaction at times very slow of major news organizations to the me too movement which was something that for a significant time making Kelly embraced a sheet accused her former boss at Fox News of sexually harassing\nHer I also think you can't divorce it from the fact that making Kelly I received very tepid a welcome from her colleagues NBC News she had to just play some popular collies\nAnd that her reading some cells were mediocre and that even before all this happened uh she'd been discussing with a network another role there because she needed to get out of that show now the show is gone and she's a negotiating her eggs that as well\nNPR's David Folkenflik Thanks David you bet ...\nIt's friday

MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Noel King good morning earlier this week NBC's Today show anchor Megan Kelly caused outrage with some on air remarks about Halloween costumes\nThere was a controversy on the real housewives of New York with ... as she dresses Diana Ross and I felt like who doesn't want the animal she wants to look like Diane around for one day I I don't know how like that got races on hollow why\nNow NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting that the network has dropped Kelly from the today show line up and that she appears likely to leave the network because of the fallout from those comments the morning David ... okay so this is not the first time that making Kelly has made controversial comments about race here she is in twenty Thirteen when she was an anchor on Fox News\nFor all your kids watch at home than it and just is white Jesus was a white man to tell us about her history of making racialized comments\nWill these aren't uh the only examples of of their number I remember back in twenty\nTell us about her history of making racialized comment\nWell these aren't ah the only examples of their number I remember back in twenty and the sand that Jesus comments back from twenty Thirteen she later said she'd been joking and last year claimed that she she regretted those remarks but\nI remember back in twenty ten um she spent a fair amount of time on a tiny tiny heat group black hate group called the new Black Panthers a one I Believe them ultimately a face criminal charges related to voter intimidation she spent over three and a half hours in a three week period focusing on it as though it was a threat to the Republican\nIndeed as one of her former colleagues were counted basically yelled at a white liberal a strategist for about ten minutes who she felt was failing to take it\nA sufficiently seriously uh one more example among several uh she keeps kept inviting the a former LA up a homicide detective mark ... on the air to talk about a ... a\nCriminal justice issues and to talk about the question of are African American relations with police officers he of course had to admit on the stand he had said racist things over the years during the OJ trial um many people saw that as a as discredited thing she welcomed him on the show\nDo you think that history played a role in NBC's decision to let her go\nI think it's played a strong role in uh the reaction of NBC's colleagues particularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American journalists are outraged who her remarks about uh what she felt was the acceptability a black face yeah\nNBC's nightly news with Lester Holt did a whole thing about this controversy on its OWN Network which seems to suggest something and at making Kelly's collie an attitude toward her\nWell for you and me it might be an admirable exercise and transparency and I think it was that I think it's worth pointing out also Lester Holt the only African American anchor ah of any made of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was saying we're not going to protect the starting with we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces and\nOf any made of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was saying we're not going to protect the starting with we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces and TV news which\nIs really interesting the fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the way the network has handled these comments see something bigger about the way networks and companies are are tolerate it tolerating racialized or racist comments\nWell it's hard not to look at this in light of a you know the reaction at times very slow of major news organizations to the me too movement which was something that for a significant time making Kelly embraced a sheet that use our ... our boss at Fox News of sexually harassing\nHer I also

New Jersey senator Cory Booker the other to former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nNPR's national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson has been following this fast moving story I carry hire new well so what do we know that the person now in custody\nWell not much a law enforcement source tells me it is a man based in Florida we don't yet know his name or his background or importantly whether he acted alone we also have to know whether this person was motivated by politics are personal reasons or some other reason\nThe Justice Department says it's going to hold a news conference at two thirty pm eastern time to provide more details on this unfolding case only this morning investigators found a package addressed a former intelligence chief James Clapper in New York and also disclose that they had found a package in Florida address to New Jersey senator Cory Booker\nWell a lot of attention in this case it focused on Florida overnight a look\nAlso disclose that they had found a package in Florida addressed to New Jersey senator Cory Booker well\nA lot of attention in this case it focused on Florida overnight a local police their search to mail facility what were they looking\nFor last night authorities were searching a package sorting facility and Florida in ... near Miami the operating fury with some of the packages went through that facility in through the u._s. mail\nThey were looking for more devices but also any other clues and local TV in Florida is now beaming images of a strong law enforcement presence in plantation Florida at a site that appears to be connected to the suspect in federal custody a lot of manpower has been deployed nationwide though the postal inspectors\nThe FBI the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives have been on the case as well as local police I'm\nIn the Miami Dade County area and also of course the New York city police department to\nAnd there's also some ongoing activity in Virginia right\nYes in Virginia the bulk of the investigation there is that the FBI lab in Quantico which has been analyzing some of these devices which look like homemade pipe bombs they've been looking for clues for\nHow the bombs were constructed and they've also been looking for DNA or fingerprints the bomber may have left behind no word yet on whether anything they found in that analysis has helped lead them to the suspect in South Florida\nOh that's interesting we'll have to wait and see I suppose so I mean one notable thing this whole time is that none of these bombs that actually exploded and so there's been some speculation that maybe they couldn't explode they didn't have the capacity what investigators said about that theory\nOn the record police sources and the FBI are declining to answer questions about whether the these bombs could it presented a lethal threat to anyone on background overnight in earlier this morning I was hearing a law enforcement was inclined to think they did not present a lethal threat there could be a reason for that\nOvernight in earlier this morning I was hearing a law enforcement was inclined to think they did not present a lethal threat there could be a reason for that some former bomb analysts at the ATF have raised questions about whether these devices included a key component that would have set them off that would have detonated them it it appeared\nFrom the photos that were made public that perhaps these devices lack that key component\nBut nonetheless police had been advising folks outside the FBI to be very careful when they were looking at any manila envelopes or any suspicious packages because uh they needed to be considered a potential threat\nAnd they law enforcement right now even is advising people to call authorities call police called the FBI faith see anything suspicious now we know that the New York police commissioner James O'Neill son last last afternoon\nThat the device they've recovered in New York that was addressed to the actor Robert Deniro did not pose a biological threat to not\nContain anthrax or any material like that but that authorities were still treating all of these parcels as potentially dangerous and the analysis may not be done yet as to what's in all of these uh these bombs potential well so law enforcement officials still have a long way to go here\nAnd PR is justice
