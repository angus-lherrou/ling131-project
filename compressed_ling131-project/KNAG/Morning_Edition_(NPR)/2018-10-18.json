are selling Saudi Arabia um it's a much more arms today than we were ten years ago um and and so what I'm suggesting is that we just returned to a level of\nArms sales to military relationship that

you're listening to MORNING EDITION on Arizona Public radio ... in a you at eight forty five but it's now time for our weekly whether chat with our meteorologist Lee born Haley hey good morning seen some blue sky out there yeah it's a welcome size and those what are those up there whose guys\nYou know I'm not I'm not usually a complainer about moisture and either but it was getting a little much there I mean I was missing son\nIt's a little early for for ... will take it of course especially after you know last year is very dry dry winter uh can you just talk about this crazy October whether I Know we've seen I mean at least in insurance Flagstaff I saw on it was it was Wednesday snowfall I Believe forest lakes recorded six inches\nSo that was a nice little storm there and it has been\nA wet and cool October for sure it all got started right there at the beginning of the month where you had the remnant moisture from it was hurricane Rosa came through and then from then on that was on October ... we've had quite a bit of moisture\nAnd even a little bit of snow snow's not completely unusual in October and\nThat was on October second we've had quite a bit of moisture and even a little bit of snow snow's not completely unusual in October and Flagstaff we do average three inches of snow fall and I think uh\nWe've had two measurable snows flags afterwards when earlier in the mind\nWhich all is amounted to an inch and a half it likes to have claim airport but other portions of town you mentioned for another portion of the northern Arizona have seen some pretty significant snowfall including the San Francisco piece which just looked beautiful uh and they are at six plus inches of snow up there or even\nApproaching a foot of snow at some of the higher elevation so it has been a a\nA lovely start here till October but um you know I think it was getting it was like we're quite ready for it right into winter here that I'll get some October whether that right um I Want to get through the weekend a forecast you're in just a moment but first of all of this what October whether do we think there's any\nCorrelation here with a with what's going to happen in winter well I think it's definitely a good sign that the storm track is active and uh I don't know how correlated they actually are you know I mean\nI'm it would be interesting to look at a hundred years I deserve wet fall lead into a wet winter um but I don't have that data set my feeling is that they probably are correlated somewhat but it does not for sure I mean we are going into a wet winter in fact you know this\nFirst very active half of the month with storms is are gonna fade away we have one more little store system this weekend with uh some showers and thunderstorms it's a mild storm and not going to bring any snow falls the region or anything and temperatures are actually going to be warmer\nThan where they are or the next couple of days under sunshine but we will see some showers and thunderstorms but then going into the second half of October things really\nGoing to be warmer than where they are or the next couple of days under sunshine but we will see some showers and thunderstorms but then going into the second half of October things really quiet down for us here so uh which doesn't mean anything about winter either you know we are going into a week El Nino\nType a pattern here going in a winner which would kilter odds a little bit towards I a wetter than average winter and so we'll hope for that\nBut it's hard to predict that stuff because I mean we've had El Nino is just in in in recent memory where it's been dry during an El Nino\nOh you're so right I mean we had the Godzilla El Nino and I didn't do anything that we had let me know what you're supposed to be dry and it was wetter than the Godzilla El Nino\nAnd so you know it just chill the odds but nothing's guaranteed it's tough to beat weatherman is what you're saying\nYeah you know the long term
