effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political and he said he knew how it was funded millions of dollars in money from outside left wing opposition groups\nIn fact there is money flying every which way and the Kavanaugh confirmation battle it comes from advocacy groups that can keep their donors secret\nThe thing that can be traced his TV spending and the Brennan Center for justice at New York university law school has been tracking the Kavanaugh TV ads\nThe centers Douglas Keith said both sides are focusing their ads on three Democratic senators who are up for re election next month Joe mansion in West Virginia Joe Donnelly in Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota\nAnd a little over four million dollars that's been spent running ads and injustice states\nThere's two million dollars more being spent in Maine home of undecided Republican Senator Susan Collins and about half a million in Alaska home of another uncommitted Republican Lisa Murkowski Keith said these are not high cost media markets\nEspecially when you're looking at states like North Dakota and Alaska um this is really an incredible amount of spending\nThe Brennan Center data show that when it comes to T.

colleague Steve Inskeep\nOn the soccer stadium right in downtown rocker and this is a stadium that ISIS use to jail people for executions as well beheadings and it's interesting that now the stadium is being rebuilt to be used for an actual soccer stadium\nNow how is the city different than it was when you were there early in the year shortly after it was captured from ISIS\nWill Steve a rocket

really interesting is a lot more shops are open it's kind of bustling in a way but what's curious is the shops are open on the first floors of a lot of buildings\nIt's sort of a skeleton of a building and a lot of rubble just above the shops and they say there are more than five hundred homes have been cleared of booby traps and more and more kids are going back to school but there's still an enormous need\nFor health officials say they need hundreds of millions of dollars from the international community or just for the basic sort of water sewer electricity and so forth\nAre people returning home people who had fled the city or fled Syria entirely\nYeah a lot more people are coming home and the interesting thing is it's straining the services now but people are going back into their homes you'll drive the street so look\nCompletely desolate from the damage from the IRS strikes and ISIS blowing buildings up and you'll see a family actually walking into their homes the city was roughly two hundred and twenty thousand before the war and now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nSo there are Syrian forces aligned with the United states to control that part of the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself it can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nThey can sort of govern themselves are setting up local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol this area so it really is sort of a little oasis here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces and where does the United states\nNow it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nSo there are Syrian forces aligned with the United states to

far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syria\nRight and there was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wonder is the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president cut that money\nThey had to basically stop some of the programs here in Raqqa searches bomb removal and also education programs\nAnd that really worried a lot of people and it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates that got these programs rolling again\nJulian always good to

have a hard time I'm typing with what happened [noise]\nBut they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I went over that um they are very very they were very tight group loss of solidarity very determined women some of them I'm wearing caged in you know political campaigning\nUm they certainly didn't take any known since from us there was a ... a a degree of skepticism towards the press because they feel like the press was involved in their lives and then kind of just forgot about them and they are pretty skeptical about ... ... as well which is kind of comment the special needs parents\nSay they were quite a strong set of women I mean obviously very different ... the leader of this group which is called the ... mothers of angels\nOr this is a group in ... states which is a sort of\nIt's just that one of the states which was worst affected by the ... the leader of that group is ... and\nShe is you know really quite a powerful personality uh she doesn't mince words you know she's one of these people that just give you a look and you sort of just stopped talking\nA but also very charming and you know she's made a lot of friends with politicians sympathetic ... people have started to try and campaign for the women what is the house\nThose are this is a group in ... states which is a sort of it's just that one of the states which was was affected by the ... the

talking\nA but also very charming and you know she's made a lot of friends with politicians sympathetic ... people have started to try and campaign for the women\nWhat is the health status of these children who were born with the guy I mean you write that in the beginning these mothers were getting a horrible process that their children may not even survive beyond a year so I'm ... how are they doing\nThat's right and so around ten percent of them have died most of those said it's about three hundred and twenty children most of those children probably died very soon off the bus\nOr a few of them are cut things chest infections through breathing food in when they were learning to wean but on the other hand there are children who are actually doing pretty well I mean this is actually this is one of the things that fascinated me the most is\nThey're they're very mixed group of children so there was some children's you can walk to can stand there was some children who've ... words and can talk\nI'm Still maybe a little bit behind the pay is it you know at the at that age but then there are other children who you know they can't roll over and that the fed through achieve into that tell me that that much much more um you know disabled\nSome of the children who are more physically disabled or actually talking to the left side and some of the children who are more cognitively disabled cannot stand up and and walk around [noise]\nIt's an incredibly mixed thing up so much so\nCan talk I'm Still may be a little bit behind that pays it you know at that age but then there are

really couldn't move very much a tool she seemed very aware of what was going on around her but then she had had twin brother who was turned off him who he was acting just like you would expect it to an offer a boy to act [noise]\nJumping up and down and climbing on his mom and I know I Know this kind of thing um so they don't really understand they didn't know why it affected one twin ... another ... ... ... it's it's quite possible that it was because of genetic differences between them so that they now know that\nSome people seem to have a sort of genetic defense against the cap\nYou write that the fact that families are at a turning point why it's such an important moment in in their story\nIce or is that the families are really thinking about the social aspect so while they're largely going to be like like [noise]\nWhat school are they going to go to ... and how would they be able to access to school um will moms be able to go back in and work again what they can is about child care and and\nSo we were able to join the actress ... so she went around the some of the more deprived parts of northern Brazil and she was kind of giving talks\nRight that the affected families are

of year and this type of situation last night uh I think many of us were ... by some very strong\nBig thunderstorms there was a tornado warned storm around pine and strawberry in the early morning
