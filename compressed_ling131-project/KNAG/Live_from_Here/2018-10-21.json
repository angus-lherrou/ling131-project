New York along Lake Erie were the sky was cloaked in a constant gray missed allowing for just occasional peaks of the colorful leaves\nThe forecasts was calling for the first snow fall of the year but for the good people of buffalo that's not even cause to wear a long sleeved shirt\nWhen you live in Buffalo complaining about the weather is complaining about life itself\nI was picked up at the

years and then he's been there so long he doesn't even smell they're famous buffalo wings any more people come in all the time and they say they smelled them all the way down the street but I don't smell a thing who knows maybe it's me they smell\nEagerly place my order there's something great about eating food that makes a city famous\nIn addition to whatever natural elements are involved the
