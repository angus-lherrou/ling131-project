our fellow Americans\nThis week I was lucky enough to experience the iconic New York autumn as I rolled into New York city there's something magical about ball in Manhattan It's that sweet spot between the summer humidity and the icy winter when you can actually walk around town\nFeel good and things don't smell so bad\nIt was late afternoon when I checked into my hotel and dropped off my bags New York is a great walking city and nothing encourages that more than a hotel room the size of a pine cone\nThe streets were colorful as always and Halloween has hit the city have you ever complimented someone's costume and realized he was just a New Yorker wears a milk carton\nA hat [noise] I have\nComplimented someone's costume and realized he was just a New Yorker wears a milk carton\nAs a hat [noise] I have\nI walked into Washington Square park and sat on a bench near a dog run there is nothing crazier than in New York dog park\nThese are not dogs that are used to the freedom of backyards and rolling hills these are pets that have been locked indoors for hours drinking coffee trying not to be on the New York post\nThey finally get to the dog park they lose their minds\nI sat next to one of the dog owners musician named Dave even though he was in sweat pants has long hair and cool Jean jacket said he was a rocker his dog look cool to he was a mutt named Rocco with a spike the collar and an upper lip and a permanent snarl\nDavis lived in the village with Rocco his whole adult life and makes a living now is a studio musician he was lamenting about how the city's changed\nThere's no scene for the young bands any more so than New York used to be a city of artists weirdos who were too strange to live in their hometowns but now there's nothing left us a weirdos can afford\nHe said the one thing that will never change is the amazing diversity in the city\nThere are people from all around the world he said just look at this dog park ... just a crazy mud and here he is hanging with three pose a purebred German Shepherd and the French poodle who's getting a little too friendly with or knows\nThis is New York\nAfter meeting some friends for dinner I headed back towards the hotel through the west village on a normal night this area's hopping but as Halloween comes near it's truly outrageous the bars were in full force and people were dressed up in costumes roaming the streets\nIn comes near it's truly outrageous the bars were in full force and people were dressed up in costumes roaming the streets to me it's the adults in costume gr the

approached by what can only be described as a large dirty humor is facing smudge is had had a muddy footprint on it he was sweating and confused\nHe grabbed my arm and asked if I knew where his friends where I felt bad for the summer but I had to laugh what kinds of friends was looking for where they ... do did they live in a magical land should I Try and return them to his hollowed out tree\n[laughter] I felt bad for him so he took his big white hand in mine and walking down the street have you ever gotten looks to strangers on the street and you knew without a doubt they thought you in the summer for lovers [noise]\n\nTry to reach racist steps and we saw a lot of people but no ... that's when he got desperate and decided to climb onto a mailbox for a better view\nThe postal department might be slow they may not run their post offices that well but one thing they did right was designing their mailboxes they created a square bottom that makes it seem as if climbing it would be easy\nBut when you get to that rounded top you quickly find out it's impossible to stand on especially if you're drunk desperate and dress like a blue cartoon character [noise]\nHis effort was valiant\nEspecially if you're drunk desperate and dressed like a blue cartoon character [noise]\nHis effort was valiant he wasn't falling off but he wasn't going up either he was clinging to the

it turns out that at midnight on friday before Halloween in the west village there are a lot of people in costume thinking the same thing there was a sexy devil\nA hotdog Michael Jackson to clowns from it and one guy who looked like a sea captain who turned out not to be in costume at all [noise]\nSmiling and not as if I Know what he's talking about but the truth is I don't care [noise]\nNow
