Charlotte Gallagher and London thank you so much\n\nIn little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and truly local concerns\nAnd that saying something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me\nAll right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave or what are you seeing state to state\nIt is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of the state legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out\nHave seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat\nMight have said they're just going to maybe ... just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidates\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats at any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin are two states that were really important in twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads of the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix your car when it bumps into a particularly bad bottle\nAnd if the situation would reverse would Republicans hammering the same issue\nYeah I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo that's a good Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but their slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip in one or both what's his story\nIn Connecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate which is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house but if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how ...\nWhich is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election\nIt's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in the state that's in as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yet but taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases\nHave traced a lot of uh Connecticut residents away that's a common theme that I think we hear a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nThere is something pivotal at stake here though um other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up and twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs and a lot of these states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships there'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two weeks\nAre going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years read\nWilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much thank you\nForty five years ago this Sunday Morning America was waking up to the news of

taking a look at what is often called identity politics and how the groups we come from affect our point of view\nThe way politicians express or suppressed their identities has come up this campaign season just look at Texas and a campaign jingle Texas Senator Ted Cruz went after Hispanic nickname his rival of war has long used\nJust look at Texas in a campaign jingle Texas Senator Ted Cruz went after Hispanic nickname his rival ... as long used\n\nSelf hasn't escaped scrutiny here from Chris Cuomo on CNN\nWhat's your name is Raphael you know you go by Ted that's an angle size version of it he went the other way\nAnd just this week Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren who President Trump has derided for claiming native heritage managed to upset detractors and supporters\nSay the leaders of the Cherokee Nation are speaking out against Senator Elizabeth Warren campaign video touting her Native American ancestry courtesy of a newly revealed DNA test\nThe tribe Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU who's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized visit we reached him earlier this week and asked him to explain\nUse identity sometimes in a in a very good way we use identity for example we use our American identity to motivate us to do things together but\nI think that we can over your identity that we can bring identities and when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them in were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other why people are different from each other\nSo that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best still methods in the world whether in her man or woman or black or white and so on but I think we can take 'em too seriously and many political complex I'm\nThe most important thing isn't that that is to say maybe the most important thing for them as they should be able to get the kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who is best for that\nBe able to get kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who is best for that isn't necessarily the candidate who's best view on on the grounds so you have to balance it out\nIs the role that ... of identity politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talk about it without either alienating or collecting\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should onto your question directly gingerly carefully\n[laughter] I I think you you can easily go wrong here I mean one of the things that the president is currently doing is mobilizing identities in a very divisive way and that leads down a terrible road because once you've created as the racial divisions\nIt takes an awful lot of effort to heal the wounds and um it's a temptation for politicians all around the world and and you know well through the twenty century they're drawing people together a through making them feel ashamed of hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is political identities right now the labels conservative and liberal\nAre associated with sort of tribal feelings of a very intense kind it makes the country increasingly difficult to govern that means that every time\nSomebody of one identity wins everybody or the other identity thinks of themselves as having lost something profound and that means that you lose the sense that in an election we vote and then whoever wins or we sort of gather behind in order that they should run the country\nCan send to you I mean I'm hearing a real concern that identity and and the politics around it has been weaponized and and it's certainly\nI think I think it is worrying I mean look the fact is in our country today is that we're more divided around identities then we are around policies so that if we\nI think it is worrying I mean look the fact is you know countries today is that we're more divided around identities than we are around policies\nSo that if we just stopped using our identity divides we could probably come through reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things or immigration abortion there's a whole bunch of things where there's a sort of sensible middle ground\nBut it's not available to us because of the people who are most in ... I think that every concession is not coming together but losing\nLosing the other side\nAnd in order to get voters politicians have to appeal to certain identities because it's it's about making sure that your bases satisfied making sure that your base will turn out to the polls making sure that they are excited about the issues that are there and and that you feel like you're a part of a common cause\nHere the other question is whether you can do that with our ... you go rattling weaponized identity and I think you can I think you can talk for example more about the actual policies democracy needs the capacity for compromise and turning everything into an identity as he makes it very hard to compromise\nKwame Anthony Appiah is a professor at New York University His latest book is the lies that bind me thinking identity thank you very much thank you very much\nAmerica's Test kitchen is celebrated as a reliable source of advice for home cooks they test tools techniques and recipes before making recommendations on a TV show in magazines and cookbooks now for the first time America's Test kitchen is taking that know how to to use\nIn the complete cookbook for young chefs NPR's Lynn Neary recently visited a young chef and she tried out a recipe with some help from an expert\nYear old Lucy Gray is wide and vibrating with anticipation when her dad Paul opens the door to greet me\nWith some help from an expert eight year old Lucy Gray is wide eyed and vibrating with anticipation when her dad Paul opens the door to greet me and Mali burned bone editor in chief\nOf the nation from any live she so good to meet you were a little excited a very\nLoosely likes to cook and has helped make some meals for her family but this is the first time she will cook something by herself\nThe cookbook has more than one hundred recipes and Lucy has chosen to make one pop pasta with quick tomato sauce we begin assembling everything we need olive oil crushed tomatoes in a as she takes out basal Lucy decides to taste it\nStill got rid of the\nDiesel [laughter] at\nOne point while reading the recipe Lucy stumbles over an abbreviation she doesn't quite understand\nSo this is one table\nToo that's at that says T S P which was the abbreviation for peace and this is one capital T. that's been and let me ask you something by at the beginning of the book you talk about sort of the language of the kitchen yet recall it\nDecoding kitchen speak there's so many words and these recipes that you just don't know until you hooked on it so it is a lot about understanding the foreign language that comes with cooking\nThe cookbook lays out the basics with everything from photographs of tools and equipment to instructions on how to measure men's and chop this recipe calls for a chopped onion the first and has to be peel\n[noise] some [noise] like let's say the cookbook emphasizes safety\nIn the kitchen which Birnbaum demonstrates went shopping the onion\nIt can be hard to make this first Koch so yeah and see how my fingers are like this all ... and that means that my fingers are never going to get accidentally under the night so this is the safe way\nYeah you see how my fingers are like this all ... and that means that my fingers are never going to get accidentally under the night so this is the safe way to hold a knife and cutting anything\nFrom northern Arizona university state this is Arizona Public radio NPR News and pacify music on cayenne a use eighty eight point seven Cy staff\nKP you beat Ninety One point seven sidestep cayenne eight eight Ninety seven show than a deed Ninety One point seven page\nK.

I'm Kate in a you\nKnow\n\nThis weekend edition from NPR News I'm due to the end of our good morning it's been a long road to get to this milestone in Afghanistan they were twenty five hundred candidates trying for nearly two hundred and fifty seats I'm Talking about parliamentary\nIt's been a long road to get to this milestone in Afghanistan there were twenty five hundred candidates trying for nearly two hundred and fifty seats\nI'm Talking about parliamentary elections there first in eight years and the vote has been bloody with many reports of violence at polling stations including a suicide bomber in the capital Kabul\nDozens or dead but the vote went on to talk about the significance for America's longest running war is reporter Jennifer glass she is in Kabul thanks for being with us get to be here live\nSo were people able to turn out to vote in large enough numbers or did the violence keep them away\nYou know despite threats from Islamic state and from the Taliban more than three million Afghans turned out on Saturday and today there are people are lined up waiting to vote\nCertainly some people will not get the opportunity to do that right now we've really only seen numbers from the big cities and it's the rural areas where people are most it threatened maybe might feel most intimidated\nTell me a little bit about the violence what happened\nThe biggest single attack was a suicide bomber here in Kabul or the suicide bomber trying to get into a polling station was stopped by policemen he detonated his explosive vest outside\nOr in the north there was showing and couldn't do we know that they burned down one polling center outside of ... city and there's been some irregularities as well one local strongman on the outskirts of Kabul abroad his armed men in he's a candidate and he tried to prevent\nOther people from getting to the polling stations so not by far the cleanest elections the Afghan governance announced its arrested a ... a few dozen people for fraud and intimidation they're trying to make sure that Afghans will have faith in this election\nOne of the more hopeful signs though this time around is the number of women running right over four hundred what will just mean\nThey are guaranteed sixty eight seats in the parliament for each province\nAround as the number of women running right over four hundred what will just mean\nThey are guaranteed sixty eight seats in the parliament for each province\nOf but I think the the real key has been the number of young people running as you said Lou there hasn't been parliamentary elections in eight years the current parliament\nHas been a frustration to many almost a symbol of corruption and patronage that has held Afghanistan back and it was really interesting to see election observers at the polls there were four hundred thousand of them many of them there to support their own candidates to make sure that their candidates got a fair shake\nIn these elections the fact that so many young people and non politicians were willing to put themselves out there I think shows that there was a new generation of Afghans trying to change things and just\nTreasury secretary Steve Mnuchin does in Israel today as part of a six nation Middle East to or to address terrorist financing he's been meeting with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\nIn major league baseball boss Angeles Dodgers joining the Boston Red Sox in the world series the Dodgers one of the national league pennant last night beating the Milwaukee Brewers five to one of the deciding game seven\nOn trial Snyder NPR News from Washington\n\nSupport\nFor NPR comes from this station and from the library of Congress with the national library service for the blind and physically handicapped a program that offers thousands of books for all ages you know audio and braille formats more at one eight hundred three hundred six thousand\nAnd from Viking\nDedicated to bringing the traveler closer to the destination my river and by the offering a small ship experience with a shore excursion included in every port\nLearn more at Viking Cruises dot com\nThis weekend edition from NPR News I'm ... Navarro Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has been under fire since a Washington Post columnist was killed in the Saudi constantly in as temple ... is an expert on Middle East affairs and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region thanks for being with us\nMy printer or the development of this story playing out in the middle east or is it proving to be a loyalty\nIs this playing out across the region thanks for being with us my pressure or the development of this story playing out in the middle east it is it proving to be a loyalty tested the king demolish any opposition in the region\nPlumbing governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty or many of them issuing statements supporting a both Saudi Arabia and ah and king self and of course uh the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of\nA lot of fear a lot of worried that the people who are activists journalists dissidents\nUm and those who may be speaking their opinion and they in fact to be threatened now are there is a real great too I think in the air amongst those are members of civil society\nYou're trying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist or without their intelligence services leaking information\nIt's also a major player in the middle east an American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very Calcutta the terms of how they're released information really to extract as much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they made it very smart or they are looked like the hero in this story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison and many of them are are journalists as well and activists and others and so there clearly not a the beacon of liberal democracy in the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically\nDefending or you know uh this one ... and of course uh it really struck thing I think an important\nImportant important price or from the Saudis which has yet to be determined I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey a what would what game are they playing I mean\nThe Saudis which has yet to be determined I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question ... what is in it for turkey a what would what game are they playing I mean why expose Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated debt\nOr they need they need hard currency date foreign exchange they need to invest meant that he'd investment opportunities and that's all something that's going to review in much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by\nOther allies or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the INS is very clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with with with liquidity\nI and and just briefly we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult uh I Believe for a U.S government who wants to hold sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looks like a much more better thing actor in the region\nThat was best known among many a political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so much\nThank you\nOn September twenty six twenty four teams students from the teacher training school in rural southern Mexico commandeer some buses their ultimate destination was Mexico City poor demonstration but those buses never arrived and forty three of the students went missing along the way and we're presumed killed in and around the town of why\nAlthough the remains of never been found their deaths were very nicely blamed on corrupt local political and police officials as well as higher ups in the Mexican military and the government and of course the drug gangs the aftermath\nLocal political and police officials as well as higher ups in the Mexican military and the government and of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis summit shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations\nNow Mexican journalist ... hadn't and this has published an exhaustive look into the events of that night her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told us the official version of the events was a fabrication\nIn these official version they're Mexican Government said that the army and the ... they didn't know anything about what was happening\nAnd they just get not these two or three hours after everything and these officials store to eat what I have seen all these years four years\nOf investigation is that all the official version is ally is not true its ally\nSo tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked the students and why they were attacked [noise]\nWhat I discovered was that the army and the for the police not Joss Whedon not these about wild west happening that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the police not just is\nEven more I have reports on the show to report that proves that the army and if it up all these white chasing the students scenes they laughed at school I mean the worse before that\nSo the federal police and the army were chasing the students how the students killed\n[noise] well that students arrive\nNear while they're the army the police they state police\nWell that students arrive\nNear while they're the army the police they state police were waiting for them than their students decide to move that to both is where they were transport dating insight to the city\nTo be able to take the more buses mhm they'll get the west take more buses to go to the protest to Mexico City so they went to both the station\nThey do do that you both us and when their students were trying to escape on board will be ... by buses ... when the army the police\nThen when you see by police and the staple east is that to shoot I gained the buses to stop them mhm they they're all ... of that back way to process\nIt from these two buses disappeared all day for a three students\nSo the federal police opened fire people were wounded injured and and two of the buses um the the people that were on those buses the students who are on this bus has disappeared [noise] why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police and the army get involved in this\nThese wise I think the most difficult part of my investigation um if the students were traveling inside boss is that that a good was just too\nAnd so these two versus what exactly they are two bosses that the army and they for the police it stuck to monitor it seems to have a worse before I mean these two bosses was that the boss is where the students were traveling from this\n... it seems to have a worse before I mean these two bosses would that do versus what the students were traveling from their school to why why so when I was able to have found is that in these two buses\nWhere a inside a nest secret parts of the of the boss secret compartment as harrowing to millions of harrowing two million dollars worth of heroin they didn't know\nThe students ... for the army and if the police they knew it\nSo the students were almost victims of circumstance they had they had taken income and dear to buses that were being used by drug dealers to transport drugs and they didn't know what this was that are really tragic accident they didn't know it\n[noise] how do you know that heroin was hitting on that bus [noise]\nI was able to connect with one drug lord important drug lord I was able to contact with one person that works for him and the west indies a informant and inside the cartels that explain made this ...

Charlotte Gallagher and London thank you so much\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nIn a little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and purely local concerns\nAnd that saying something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me All right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave or what are you seeing state to state\nWell it is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of the state legislative seats and that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket\nIt's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be ... and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat might have\nSaid they're just going to maybe both just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidate\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats at any other level uh let's\nThe party line as opposed to the individual candidate\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats at any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin are two states that were really important in twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads of the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix her car when it bumps into a particularly bad pothole\nAnd if the situation will reverse would Republicans hammering the same issue\nYeah I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate

identity and we can bring identities in when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them in were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know

five hundred candidates trying for nearly two hundred and fifty seats\nI'm Talking about parliamentary elections there first in eight years and I vote has been bloody with many reports of violence at polling stations including a suicide bomber in the capital Kabul\nDozens or dead but the vote went on to talk about the significance for America's longest running war is a reporter Jennifer ... she is

and from the Taliban more than three million Afghans turned out on Saturday and today there are people are lined up waiting to vote\nCertainly some people will not get the opportunity to do that right now we've really only seen numbers from the big cities and it's the rural areas where people are most it threatened maybe might feel most intimidated\nTell me a little bit about the violence what happened\nThe biggest single attack was a suicide bomber here in Kabul or the suicide bomber trying to get into a polling station was stopped by policemen he detonated his explosive vest outside\nOr in the north there was shelling including Jews we know that they burned down one polling center outside the of conducive city and there's been some irregularities as well one local strongman on the

and he tried to prevent other people from getting to the polling stations so not by far the cleanest elections\nThe Afghan governance announced its arrested a ... a few dozen people for fraud and intimidation they're trying to make sure that Afghans will have faith in this election\nOne of the more hopeful signs though this time around as the number of women running right over four hundred what will just mean\nThey are guaranteed sixty eight seats in the parliament for each province\nBut I think the the real key has been the number of young people running as you said Lou there hasn't been parliamentary elections in eight years the current parliament has been a frustration to many almost a symbol of corruption and patronage that has held Afghanistan back\nAnd it was really interesting to see election observers at the polls there were four hundred thousand of them many of them there to support their own candidates to make sure that their candidates got a fair shake\nIn these elections the fact that so many young people and non politicians were willing to put themselves out there I think shows that there's a new generation of Afghans trying to change things\nTreasury

in the region\nAnd governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty or many of them issuing statements supporting a both Saudi Arabia and ah and king self and of course uh the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of\nA lot of fear a lot of worried that the people who are activists journalists dissident\nUm and those who may be speaking their opinion a main fact to be threatened now are there is a real great true I think in the air amongst those are members of civil society\nMay try to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist up without their intelligence services leaking the information it's also a major player in the middle east in American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very Calcutta the terms of how they're released information really to extract this much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they played it very smart or they are looked like the hero in this story a ironically they have you know forty thousand people in prison or many of them are are journalists as well and activists and others so there clearly not a beacon of liberal democracy\nPeople in prison and many of them are are journalists as well and activists than others and so there clearly not a good beacon of liberal democracy in the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically\nDefending or you know uh this one man driven and of course uh it really extracting I think an important\nImportant important price or from the Saudis which has yet to be determined I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey uh what what what game are they playing I mean why expose Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated jet\nA they need they need hard currency date foreign exchange the need investment they need investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by\nOther allies or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the INS is very clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with ... with liquidity\nI and and just briefly we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult uh I Believe for a U.S government who
