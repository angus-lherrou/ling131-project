with us\nNo problem what are the reason or reasons these applications are being held up\nSo these are applications Georgia's system has flagged for airs there's this controversial process here called exact match which compares voter registration applications to other government databases so basically works like this right you have\nThere's just like one letter off on your application maybe it's missing a hyphen or there's like a misspelling maybe a a poll or a an election worker inputs the information wrong if something like that happens\nThen the application is frozen and people are not put

by going to the polling place with your photo ID\nAnd then you can still vote I mean that's about that's the bottom line civil rights groups though are saying well that's not enough you know this is going to create longer lines confusion and it could discourage people from voting yeah\nAnd of course will underscore this at a time when there's when there's concern about not just conventional ...

that this violates the voting rights act and the constitution and actually last year the civil rights groups challenged a similar policy to this under ... office they made similar complaints\nAnd there was a settlement they ended up ending the policy but then earlier this year Republicans in the ... the Republican controlled state legislature passed a law\nThat was basically the policy so now it's not just a policy under camp he's actually following state law in his office says you know this exact match protocol it's really important to help fight voter fraud\nAnd of course he winds up

Washington DC this summer he joined us from Washington DC thanks so much for being with us yeah it's good to be here\nTell us about your face which which made you a Roman Catholic\nWell up until this point in my life it's all I had really known as far as religion goes I I Believe in most of what I was taught growing up um it always resonated with me the messages that they present to the congregation I think that having a faith has made me a better person\nAnd I think it as a matter of fact on a lot of people\nHow did you feel when you found out there's some are about the abuse of children that was going on in Pennsylvania ... not far from places you knew\nIt hurt reading the report because I was reading about these ... that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up you would hear kids joke about oh you know priests molesting kids and what not but I never knew that there was actually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion\nAnd then I didn't learn honestly until recently that the abuse scandal is something that was real and something that the world is known about sense what I think it was early to thousands whenever the Boston Globe or whatever the newspaper is broke the story I I didn't know that that was the thing\nIt wasn't something I'd ever been exposed to so I wasn't really aware of the fact that this is a problem that was going on in my church you know it's it's on ...\nAnd a church or face\n[noise] I think that's a difficult thing to answer I Will say that it has hurt my face in the Catholic Church I don't think it is\nDifficult thing to answer I Will say that it has hurt my face in the Catholic Church I don't think it is actually hurt my personal religious faith I'm just starting to see less of a connection between what I Believe and the teachings of the Catholic Church\nMash did you grow up with anyone do you know anyone who uh who has their own story to do no I did not fortunately nothing like that ever happened to me or anybody I was close with do you think the church cared more about itself as an institution and less about the people who had been harmed\nIt certainly seems like that to me and that's one of the most disheartening things about it I Do not think that the church leadership has done enough to make up for\nThe release of disabuse seeing bishops and people whose names are plastered up on church buildings\nBack in my area hearing that they\nSpent years pushing this stuff away and covering it all up just to save the good name of the church I suppose instead of actually trying to make up for the heartbreaking abuse there was actually occurring to me it it it feels like church leadership was more interested in preserving\nTheir own good name than actually addressing the evils that were occurring under their care do you still believe in God are you a faithful person\nI Am and that's what I've been struggling with\nBecause of the Catholic Church is is all I ever\nWas involved in growing up so recently over the past few months um since moving to a new area since starting a new a new part of my life and since the breaking all of these news stories I've been exploring other options I Do still believe in God I still have a face and I just see much\nThe breaking of these new stories I've been exploring other options I Do still

it\nOh not at all not at all\n[noise] when someone says do you tell me about your mother [laughter] it's not a simple question is it oh not\nAt all not at I look forward to it that my mother is incredible model and like most Americans she just had\nA rough patch and she was not comfortable talking about a lot of those rough patch she had me when she was a sophomore Jackson State university and she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty and Jackson was home\nAnd books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life I think her from a ride on the practice that I still have now\nBut that ride all the practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps and a lot of the terror that I think she probably did not want me to write into [noise]\nAnd we do have to get to that don't we face up to\nThe outside world your mother or progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black women were dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications um she was in an abusive relationship she did not\nMake much money she was dealing with\nWhat I Would call like shards of abuse\nAnd you know and I was around nine or ten she started to 'em with me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looking at me because when I was faced with police why people would be even a harsher and those beatings just I think started to get progressive Lee worse\nAnd I think that the beating my mother was taken from life from our town and her partner also started to get progressive we worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we\nI think that the beating my mother was taken from life from our town and her partner also started to get progressive way worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another and we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state was doing to us\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the beat in June to or from your mother the ... the she endured all of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOne of the things that I was going to say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cause just traumatic thing but I Will say the layers of particular kinds of abused really personal and structural I think led to me\nEating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bully and then a lot of other big kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and then a lot of really big women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding\n'em an eventually I started to start as a way of attempting to hide and attempting to disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of veer between a which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something\nNow the running was terrible I run two hours in the morning two hours a night and I play a lot of basketball in the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days\nAnd there's a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lot of times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body and pushing my body and pushing my body I can disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police us about it kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller like I Would be okay with people when\nPolice or not it kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller like I Would be okay like people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years so my body broke\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how does that enter your life\nOh man I'm by the time and my body broke my body literally wrote from overused and wrote from not sleeping and it broke from not eating the only thing I turn to their brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I've made from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and\nIt was hard to write about that harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I talked about in the book\nBecause you were implicated in this in a way you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWell I'm definitely in a perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame when we show people and tell people that the money that we are able to make\nWe aren't able to keep right\nAnd especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win though I told myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home and that's why we're feeling absolutely\nTrash and I just think that's something that I never really understood\nMy mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually still the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse the addiction the gambling on both sides of my family is something that we still can't really honestly talk about\nI\nThe addiction the gambling most as my family is something that we still can't really honestly talk about\nI I don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now what do you hear what she thinks\nOh I Love my mother to death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be a writer or read a teacher\nAnd my mother not love me enough to instill a practice at an early age\nAnd his books in some way is like her investment coming full circle she really believes that reading and writing can save and I don't know if that's true but I Know I'm a writer Norman American reader and I want it to use my words to try to talk to her and tried to tell her that we can be better\nWe can be better if we give ourselves a chance to walk honestly together and that's that's what

majority of those applications are from African American voters\nGroups are showing Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp who runs voting in that state campus also they Republican nominee for governor reporter Johnny Kauffman with member station WAMC in Atlanta joined just Johnny thanks so much for being with us\nNo problem what are the reason or reasons these applications are being held up\nSo these are applications Georgia's system\nUm what are the reason or reasons these applications are being held up\nSo these are applications Georgia's system has flagged for airs there's this controversial process here called exact match which compares voter registration applications to other government databases so basically works like this right you have [noise]\nThere's just one letter off on your application maybe is missing a hyphen or there's like a misspelling maybe a a poll or a an election worker inputs the information wrong if something like that happens\nThen the application is frozen and people are not put on the voter registration list but I Want to make something really clear and all of this if the application is flagged if it goes on the pending list you can still vote or you can clear up the problem by going to the polling place with your photo ID\nAnd then you can still vote I mean that's about that's the bottom line civil rights groups though are saying well that's not enough you know this is going to create longer lines confusion and it could discourage people from voting yeah and of course will underscore\nThis at a time when there's when there's concern about uh not just conventional ... vote fraud is we've known it in this country but but perhaps foreign powers somehow invading the voters roles and uh we we we've certainly been concerned about that what is it a complaint that show rights groups are making\nWell the group's point out that the vast majority of potential voters on the list or people of color meaning that the process is disproportionately affecting people of color and they say that this violates the voting rights act and the constitution and actually last year the civil rights groups challenged a similar policy to this under ... office they made similar complaints\nAnd there was a settlement ended up ending the policy but then earlier this year Republicans in the ... the Republican controlled state legislature passed a law that was basically the policy so now it's not just a policy undercount he's actually following state law and his office says\nPassed a law that was basically the policy so now it's not just a policy under camp he's actually following state law and his office says you know this exact match protocol it's really important to help fight voter fraud\nAnd of course he winds up being the Republican candidate for governor against a Stacey Adams Abrams the Democrats first African American candidate in Georgia nominated for governor by a major party this has become a huge issue in the race has meant\nYeah she is really going after a camp for this um she says everyone who can vote should vote on behalf of those who cannot boosting turnout for people of color is really key to her campaign strategy I'm On the other side Kemp campaign says this is just a manufactured crisis\nBut for both candidates motivating the base is really key in this race because the polls show it's really close and there are very few undecided voters so that's all about who's going to actually show up Johnny Kauffman of member station WAMC thanks so much thank you [noise]\nDavid Sheff realized his

on a lot of people\nHow did you feel when you found out there's some are about the abuse of children that was going on in Pennsylvania ... not far from places you knew\nYeah it hurt reading the report\nBecause I was reading about these ... that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up you would hear kids joke about oh you know priests molesting kids and what not but I never knew that there was actually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion and then I didn't learn\nAnd kids and what not but I never knew that there was actually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion\nAnd then I didn't learn honestly until recently that the abuse scandal is something that was real and

thing\nIt wasn't something I'd ever been exposed to so I wasn't really aware of the fact that this is a problem that was going on in my church you know it's it's on ...\nAnd a church or face\n[noise] I think that's a difficult\nThing to answer I Will say that it has hurt my face in the Catholic Church I don't think it is actually hurt my personal religious faith I'm just starting to see less of a connection between what I Believe and the teachings of the Catholic Church\nMash did you grow up with anyone do you know anyone who uh who has their own story to tell no I did not fortunately nothing like that ever happened to me or anybody I was close with do you think the church cared more about it shelters institution and less about the people who had been harmed\nIt certainly seems like that to me and that's one of the most disheartening things about it I Do not think that the church leadership has done enough to make up for\nThe release of this abuse seeing bishops and people whose names are plastered up on church buildings back in my area hearing that they\nSpent years pushing this stuff away and and covering it all up just to save the good name of the church I suppose [noise]

the chair that I think she probably did not want me to write into [noise]\nWell um [noise] and we do have to get to that don't we go to the outside\nWorld your mother or progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black women were dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications um she was in an abusive relationship\nThat it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications um she was in an abusive relationship she did not make much money she was dealing with\nWhat I Would call like shards of abuse and you know and I was around on a chance she started to 'em with me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looking at me because when I Would face or police or why people would be\nEven a harsher and those beatings just I think started to get progressive Lee worse\nAnd I think that the beating my mother was taken from life from our town and her partner also started to get progressive way worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another and we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state was doing a ...\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the ... from your mother the ... the she endured all of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOne of the things that I was going to say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cause just traumatic thing but I Will say\nThe layers of particular kinds of abused really personal and structural I think led to mean\nEating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bullying and a lot of other big kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and a lot of really big women had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding\n'em an individual you started to start as a way of attempting to hide and symptom and disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of there between of which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia\nAttempting to hide and attempting to disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of veer between of which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something\nRight that the running was terrible I run two hours in a more than two hours at night and I play a lot of basketball and the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days and there's a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lotta times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body and pushing my body and pushing my body I could disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police or not it kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller\nLike I Would be OK lead people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years so my body ...\nYeah [noise] then we got to get the gambling how does that enter your life\nOh man I'm by the time and my body broke my body literally wrote from overused and wrote from not sleeping in a row from not eating the only thing I turn to their brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I made from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and\nIt was hard to write about that harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I've talked about in the book\nBecause you were implicated in this in a way you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWell I'm definitely in a perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame when we show people and tell people that the money that we are able to make\nWe aren't able to keep right and especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win\nAnd especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win the lotto myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home that two hours feeling absolutely\nLike trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood\nMy mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually still the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse the addiction the gambling both as my family is something that we still can't really honestly talk about\nI I don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now why do you care what she thinks\nOh I Love my mother to death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be a writer or read or a teacher at my mother not love me enough to instill a practice\nAt an early age and this book in some way is like her investment coming full circle she really believes that reading and writing can save and I don't know if that is true but I Know I'm a writer a norm in American reader and I want it to use my words to try to talk to her and tried to tell her that we can be better\nWe can be better if we give ourselves a chance to walk honestly together\nAnd that's that's what I tried to do with this boat\nHere say lemon his book heavy and American memoir thanks so much for being with us thank you so much for having me\nA\nGeorgetown of heroism star in Indiana University who is your football team in the Nineteen forties he was an all American ...\n\nGeorge tele
