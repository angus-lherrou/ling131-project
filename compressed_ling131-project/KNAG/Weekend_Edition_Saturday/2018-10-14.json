for these political campaigns\nWhere we can't really say with certainty what it has meant but what it could mean and what is the likely scenario is that this has probably been a a benefit to Governor

to nothing I mean Ninety nine percent of its in the air and everything that was in the air is on the ground now\nAcross the entire region the damage from wind and flooding is extensive says Scott parents and that the Edison electric Institute which represents investor owned utilities\nWe are seeing not just where we're going to do restoration that is pick up the wires resets the polls and to restore power but actually a full rebuild in some cases\nAfter big storms the question always comes up why not put the wires underground where there'll be protected from the elements\nThat seems to be everybody's solution ... and if it was that simple we would have done it a long time ago but the underground being is not a silver bullet\nIt's expensive ... organization asked utility customers back in twenty twelve after Superstorm Sandy how much they pay to put the grid underground most said they'd pay up to ten percent more on their utility bills\nAbout one in ten said they'd accepted twenty percent increase but fewer than that we're willing to pay double which the Institute says it's a more realistic scenario\nIn some cases putting infrastructure underground can make financial sense say in a new housing development where wires are installed during construction but there are other considerations underground wires are at risk when there's a flood and repairing that damage is difficult\nJulie ... an energy analyst at union of Concerned Scientists\nOnce alliance and you're right it can actually be much more ... and take like ... ... ... ... and an overhead why\n... says in

construction no trees just a really powerful storm surge that was kind of a an unstoppable force\nSo let's talk about the political fallout Florida has a a two term governor Republican Rick Scott running for the U.S Senate he's up against Bill Nelson\nAnd a charismatic ... of the state capital Tallahassee Democrat and who Dylan is running for governor against Monsanto is a former congressman who also has a lot of support and pockets of Florida\nYou know what has hurricane Michael meant for these political campaigns\nWhere we can't really say with certainty what it has meant but what it couldn't name and what is the likely scenario is that this has probably been a a benefit to Governor Scott Hurricane Irma which struck in twenty Seventeen here\nAfter Scott led the state he saw his net favorability rating rise by ... percentage points and it put him pretty much and good footing\nTo run for Senate this year and in fact just before the hurricane hit coincidentally risk out was running ads touting his leadership during hurricanes\nSo he has been kind of all over ah both physically and these different pockets of the state in different media markets and he's been in

has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break them down\nHe Jessica Hi Lulu so can Democrats cut into the geo peas edge among governors\nThey have a really good chance they can pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats and this is incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty twenty when there will be\nA census that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of got in the really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional maps to their\nLiking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats and so it's a good sign for Democrats this map is really for them what\nStates are you watching heading into this last month of the campaign I mean where they're really tight races\nSo there's a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan I say some of the really tight races or Florida in Georgia Florida is always\nYou know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American man from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple states\nAnd so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santa it's going to be I think a really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first\nPickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan I say some of the really tight races or Florida in

race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's a state that is changing has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they sort of a handful of surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nNevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss ups but then Democrats have real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that it sort of a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states have been rocked by fights over education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level\nAnd Republican polarizing nominees friends is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally you only narrowly won his primary health care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and tariffs is playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nMeant that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but\nWhat's surprising a notable for Republicans is how many of their incumbent and really blue states are in really strong positions Marilyn's Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont's Phil Scott are all favorites to win\nTerry of state Kris Kobach a
