G. God well visiting the shouted conflict in Turkey on October second\nAfter weeks of denials they say some kind of fight broke out shortly after Mr ... who lived in Virginia and wrote columns for the Washington Post arrived at the embassy that data complete paperwork for his marriage President Trump reacted yesterday and called it a very sad thing he did not criticized the shouting\nThe paperwork for his marriage\nPresident Trump reacted yesterday and called it a very sad thing he did not criticized the Saudis NPR's Don Gonyea was with the president on the campaign swing out west and joins us now Don\nThanks for being with us my pleasure and let's begin with the president's first comments or after Saturday's the Saudis announced a confirmed\nThe obvious to Mr showed jihad died a in their custody he at the at the embassy and placed on both\nThe president was asked about it will turn an air force base\nWhile I think it's a good first step it's a big step to a lot of people a lot of people involved and I think it's a great first step\n[noise] um a lot of people in Trump's referring to the Eighteen arrested related to uh to the fight that the Saudis say resulted in ... what else did you say on the topic\nWell he he took questions from reporters at a roundtable with defense industry officials at that base he called cause showed used at the unacceptable but also right away scot pivoted to the contracts\nThe Saudis have with U.S companies like Boeing and General Dynamics and\nAnd as Trump spoke seated around the table with him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contracts for arms and equipment where the hundred and ten billion dollars he said he'd be working with Congress to see what the US should do in response bought\nBut I Would prefer that we don't use as retribution cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work which means six hundred thousand jobs\nAnd it's got just briefly the president uses those numbers often the dollar amount is exaggerated according to fact checks or as is the number of jobs analysts say the real number would be just a small fraction of that\nDid the president doesn't say anything ah really about the Saudi explanation that Jamal ... died in some kind of fight\nHe was asked if he found that explanation credible he said he'd\nReally about the Saudi explanation that Jamal ... died in some kind of fight\nHe was asked if he found that explanation credible he said he did he called Saudi Arabia a great ally all of this is interesting uh give given up quickly in the past he has leveled very blunt criticism of other us allies are closer allies Canada Germany over trade and the like eh not so with the Saudis now\nAll of this comes up its president is campaigning for Republicans in a number of Senate races that are considered too close to call in Montana Arizona he'll be in Nevada later today what does the president talk about how does he present his argument at his rallies\nHe is really trying to get the base his hardest core supporters to make sure they turn out so he's talking about still the battle to confirm justice Brett Kavanaugh you now calls Democrats who protested cabinet Kavanaugh in unhinged angry mob and I can tell you the rally crowds love that language\nOr any talks about the that that caravan that large group of refugees mostly from Honduras at currently heading north toward the U.S border and lots of TV coverage of it and the president clearly sees it as a political gift just before the election this is from his rally in Arizona last night\nDemocratic victory in November would be a bright flashing invitation every trafficker smuggler drug dealer and the illegal alien on the planet come on and come on and\nSo that's the vibe at these rallies in in Trump's orbit even on a day when the news is about the confirmation of the death of a ... to ...\nAnd here's John ... thanks very much for being with us thank you got the Trump Administration has had a muted response so far to the death ... showed gee we turn now to even adult or he was US ambassador to NATO under President Obama\n... has had a muted response so far to the death in your mouth ... gee\nWe turn now to even do there he was US ambassador to NATO under President Obama and now head of the Chicago Council\nOn global affairs his new book co authored with James Lindsey is the ... the throne America's abdication of global leadership ... thanks so much for being with us glad to be here based on all of your experience to Saudi explanation of how Mr Grisham you died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damaged limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a ... tale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saturday\nA explanation by the president uh how much of this damage limiting exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both Washington and Riyadh were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual\nBut we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in in foreign countries\nHow should the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a writer for the United states to work with its allies\nAre first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council second lead to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well or to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies\nOr to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is\nIt's time high time that the United states work together with our allies\nOr to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is that is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid an foreign society's\nWell yes the export of democracy to foreign countries to\nA point of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it\nBut there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept a Saturday explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections are and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a\nPresident the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it does not the only factor we have other interests and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left or it's not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nReceive an a freedom so thirty seconds we have left or it's not just to expressing outrage there practical steps that can be take\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arms shipments\nA that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're ... trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the Saudis that do not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior we've seen\nCops you weeks is unacceptable even colder thank you thank you\nThe state

learned over the past few years the opioid crisis that the face of addiction can be just about any face an obituary that appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touch many readers this week\nIt included a photo of a smiling face of metal Lynch in there with her toddler son Aden who was grinning from his perch on her back\nThat photo showed a good day for Matty but she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old and try to oxycontin at a high school party a drug took hold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son\n[noise] a drug to a cold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son\nMetal and limbs and Mir died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her sister Kato Neal wrote that obituary and joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Berlin to think so much for being with us thanks for having me\nFirst we're we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing a she wanted to be\nAn actress and star and Broadway musicals and she really had the voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew and loved and then there was the uh Matty who suffer from the disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate based painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Matty this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we\nHope for Maddie this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nDrove more than one program I gathered\nYeah she tried many [noise]\nWhat made you sure all of this in Europe which were\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define\nThe way she lived and to to not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted and now I'm we carry that hope for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or be pronouncing there's evidence that they work but they're very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications that help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for\nSome of the medications that help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver there aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one face of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about is Matty with her son and her back in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\nI understand there's going to be a service for ... there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nWell through song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a a video of Matty singing a bonding rate songs he's just sitting in the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction and recovery and family members and that's been a huge source of support and solidarity for our family right now and I think we'll have more of that kind of

they committed to purchase four hundred and fifty million dollars worth of things and hundred and ten million dollars worth of military [noise] those are the biggest orders in the history of this

you've got a game seven you haven't been to the world series and to maintain it\nTell you that this is what you're supposed to do when you come close and then you have a chance this year you've got a game seven you haven't been to the world series since Nineteen eighty two and of course the Dodgers have a chance to go to the world series back to back so this is what is better than winner take all game seven National League championship series\nUm and we want to know that this week course of the world series is set to open on Tuesday the NBA begins their season\nIn Boston in Boston that's right and if they are they wait exactly yes\nAnd a crusty teller they be it as an assistant coach for the Washington Wizards she's also she'll playing in the NBA for domestic Mickey Hammon of course has already and assistant coach for the San Antonio spurs is the NBA getting closer to hiring a head coach who happens to be a woman\nYeah I think it's coming and I think it's overdue and I and I I Can't wait till it does happen so you can take another\nUnnecessary barrier and and and put it away because I think that the and the NBA has been the progressive lead the NBA has been the one that has been better on on protests the NBA's been better in terms of having female referees the NBA's been better with my colleague doors work on the broadcast\nAnd so the next step is to have a female head coach and it's really not that big a deal for the rest of us because if you actually live in society we've all had female bosses at some point but in that we do here I Want to know yes [laughter]\nI Know and in in that sport it's a big deal and in professional sports in the the male dominated game and also let's not forget that that ESPN actually put the you know we have two women on the broadcast now for football you've got Hannah and Hannah Storm and Andrea Kramer\nBoth doing a broadcast as well and so it's it's important and these things have to happen and I'm Glad that that the NBA seems to be the one when it does happen it's um\nIt's it's going to be good women's tennis\nAnd these things have to happen and I'm Glad that that the NBA seems to be the one when it does happen it's um it's it's

that the way that they do after the U.S open after after the ...\nI don't like it I hate it I think it's terrible I disagree I understand the reason why people do it why they didn't get to a big deal and I I get it I don't like it because I think that it imbalances the game to the land to the giants we know that these players are now seven feet tall is six eleven or whatever we know they can serve a hundred and forty five miles an hour\nAnd that it just becomes a serving contests but you have to play defense and if you can't play defense than the game gets shifted toward the tall guys and so we never had this conversation with with when players were were six feet under so my advice to those guys just break\nServe [laughter] of Howard thank you you're in San Francisco or their commemorated

could significantly change the pool of organ donors in South Africa\nTo be driving the surgery is your first and could significantly changed the pool of organ donors in South Africa we're about twenty percent of the population is infected with HIV largest epidemic in the world\nDr Harriet death riches and medical bioethicist at the Donald Gordon medical center that's where the trench flat happened and\nShe was part of a team of doctors who helped prepare for the surgery she joins us from Johannesburg thanks so much for being with us\nThank you very much for having me on your show how's the baby doing\nAnd the baby's doing very very well we are very yeah after the transplant surgery happen now and to see this child alive and driving under the circumstances with this world famous case is\nObviously enormously gratifying and it really makes us feel good about the decision we made will help\nUs understand that decision because you had to wear a lot of different factors should mere\n[noise] yet so we knew that there was a really high possibility that three doing the surgery we would give this child HIV\nBut the other thing we had to wait is that the child to being on a waiting list for and live a diner\nFor three times the average and the child was getting really sick had been admitted to ICU had needed to be ventilated and we were at the point where the question was literally would you rather die or live with HIV what are the parents children\n[noise] so the parents were saying to us why ... nights where well controlled well HIV positive people we take a medication every day\nWhy wouldn't you consider us so there was this need that wish from the parents and the mom particularly who was the diner that she could be a diner and we had\nSo they were sick need that wish from the parents and the mom particularly who was the Darnah\nThat she could be a Darnah and we had to consider that very carefully 'cause we have to make sure that we promotion and Hans the autonomy of our patients as far as possible so it was interesting that in this case it was very much motivated by a request from this very brave sets of parents who wanted to save the lives of their child\nTo grow through juice in this uh this case the more people know about it we'll contribute something to lifting the stigma that they try to be in so many countries around the world\nI Would like to her so you know HIV stigma is an extremely complicated thing and it's it's a multifaceted says us in South Africa although we have this very well integrated national um aids treatment program HIV is still very stigmatized\nAnd one of the things we would really hope to show through what we've done here is that if you're an HIV positive person and you're on your medication you living in normal life\nThen that should preclude you from being an organ donor it shouldn't stop you from having those options that HIV negative people would have and we hope that by showing that HIV positive people can do this\nThat that would help to reduce the stigma to some extent but this is just one case and it's going to take a lot more than one case to make a serious dent in HIV stigma\nBringing NPR News and classical music to know than Arizona\nAs a can a you eighty eight point seven facts staff KP you be Ninety One point seven Flagstaff cayenne eight Ninety seven show the

gun Jay was with the president on the campaign swing out west and joins us now Don thanks for being with us my pleasure and let's begin with the president's first comments or after Saturday's the Saudis announced a confirmed\nThe obvious that Mr show jihad died or in their custody the president was asked about it will turn an air force base\nWell I think it's a good first step it's a big step to a lot of people a lot of people involved that I think it's a great first step\n[noise] um a lot of people from different at Eighteen arrested related to uh to the fight that the Saudis say resulted in ... what else did you say on the topic\nWell he he took questions from reporters at a roundtable with defense industry officials at that base he called ... that the unacceptable but also right away scot he pivoted to the contracts\nThe Saudis have with U.S companies like bowling and General Dynamics and\nAnd as Trump spoke seated around the table with him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contracts for arms and equipment worth a hundred and ten billion dollars he said he'd be working with Congress to see what the US should do in response but\nBut I Would prefer that we don't use as retribution a cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work\nWhich means six hundred thousand just\nAnd it's got just briefly\nRetribution a cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work\nWhich means six hundred thousand jobs\nAnd it's got just briefly the president uses those numbers often the dollar amount is exaggerated according to

died in some kind of fight\nHe was asked if he found that explanation credible he said he did he called Saudi Arabia a great ally all of this is interesting uh give given up quickly in the past he has leveled\nVery blunt criticism of other us allies are closer allies Canada Germany over trade and the like eh not so with the Saudis now all of this comes up its\nPresident is campaigning for

who protested Kammen Kavanaugh in unhinged angry mob and I can tell you the rally crowds love that language\nOr any talks about the that that caravan that large group of refugees mostly from Honduras at currently heading north toward the U.S border and lots of TV coverage of it and the president clearly sees it as a political gift just before the election this is from his rally in Arizona last night\nDemocratic victory in November would be a bright flashing invitation every trafficker smuggler drug dealer and the illegal alien on the planet come on and\nOn and so that's the virus\nFor Africa smuggler drug dealer and the illegal alien on the planet come on and come on and ah\nSo that's the vibe at these rallies in in Trump's orbit even on a day when the news is about the confirmation of the depth of your mouth ...\nAnd here's John ... thanks very much for being with us Ninety who's got\nThe Trump Administration has had a muted response so far to the death of your mouth to show gee\nWe turn now to even adult or he was US ambassador to NATO under President Obama and now head of the Chicago Council\nOn global affairs his new book co authored with James Lindsey as the empty thrown America's abdication of global leadership that drew bathroom thanks so much for being with us cloud to be here based on all of your experience to the Saudi explanation of how Mr ... died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damaged limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation or that was promised to secretary of state or a ... when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president or how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both Washington and we were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual\nBut we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow should the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancelled that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a right for the United states to work with its allies at first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council secondly to work with our allies protests\nTo work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council second lead to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well or to the to the Saudis to\nSuspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies\nOr to put pressure on the Saudis to end\nThe indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to ... the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is the is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid on foreign society\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries to\nA point of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept the Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections are and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a president the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it does not the only factor we have other interests\nTrees behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests and we want to maintain does interest but at the very least in the\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just to expressing outrage there practical steps that can be take\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arms shipments a that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're ... trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the Saudis that\nDo not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior we've seen cops you weeks is unacceptable ... thank you thank you\nIn the state of depressed 'cause we've got a

Simon\nWe've learned over the past few years with the opioid crisis that the face of addiction can be just about any fish in obituaries it appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touched many readers this week it included a photo of smiling face of metal\nIt appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touch many readers this week it included a photo of smiling face of metal to Lynch in there with her toddler son Aden who was grinning from his perch on her back\nThat photo shoot a good day for money but she suffered from addiction since she was sixteen years old when production gotten out of high school party a drug took hold of her life she was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son\nMetal and limbs and Mir died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her sister Kato Neal wrote that obituary in joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Berlin to think so much for being with us thanks for having me\nFirst we're we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing a she wanted to be\nAn actress and starring Broadway musicals and she really had the voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew in lived and then there was that a Matty who suffer from the disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was ... she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm into farm and\nI don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm In pill form and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Maddie this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nDrove more than one program are gathered yeah she tried many [noise] what made you sure all of this in Europe which were\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share ... addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define\nThe way she lift and certain not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted and now I'm we carried out for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or be pronounced\nFinger what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or buprenorphine there's evidence that they work very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications to help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing I also think that stigma and shame or a huge barrier\nTo recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that ... one face of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about is Matty with her son and her back in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her use and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\nI understand there's going to be a service from ... there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nThrough song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a a video of Matty singing a Bonnie rate songs is just sitting at the kitchen tables will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction and recovery and family members and that's been a huge source of support and solidarity\nShared stories about their own addiction recovery and family members and that kind of huge source of support and solidarity for our family right now and I think we'll have more is that kind of sharing on Sunday\nWhat Bonnie rich on man [noise] I Can't make you left me\nIndeed fun I don't know\nKato Neal who wrote about her sister Maddy mentioned mayor and the Vermont we be seven days thank you so much for being with you thank you so much for having\nMe\nIf you don't know\n\nHow long
