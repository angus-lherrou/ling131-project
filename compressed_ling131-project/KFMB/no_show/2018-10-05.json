election two years ago now in some way\nOr you should feel\nUm I was gonna say just as happy but ah it's not as that means you feel vindicated 'cause probably for most people this is the number one reason why you voted for Donald Trump it's for the Supreme Court picks\nAnd it was a judge Kavanaugh's and do you gonna get on a couple things could happen by tomorrow night including the Republican from Montana his daughter's getting married tomorrow night said Montana so\nHe may or may [laughter]\nJust gotta you gotta walk down the aisle you got to go vote he's going to go a Susan Collins after that dramatic we'll get to this and the second she's probably not going to flip Jeff Flake still could he could still maybe be a no even though even then it's still wouldn't matter mentioned he's a Democrat from West Virginia\nHe flipped he's voting yes for Kavanaugh and he's announced it into the White House so he probably won't go back so I think the only vote right now that could change\nQuite someone who has it been ... come out and issued statements and called the White House and made declarations is Jeff Flake Republican\nOr who may still don't know it seems like you'd probably vote yes but ... but even if you didn't uh it still wouldn't be enough to be fifty fifty and my parents would be the ... the only thing I guess it would be Jeff Flake flipping\nAnd then this senator from Montana and some for some reason not voting even though that wasn't really happen so what they would do is he would if it came down to him they would open up the voting tomorrow\nEveryone would vote\nThey keep the voting open until tomorrow morning when he can fly from Montana DC and then I voted yes and the voting and then the finding was that even that scenario that explained before when I was ... barring any dramatic crazy thing Brett Kavanaugh was indeed going to get a convert so Susan Collins\nWas the big swing and she spoke at twelve o'clock or ... or like I got to take this and I'm thinking ten minutes [laughter] an hour later she finally said\nFive complete transmission service almost vehicles half off what everyone else's pain\nSo telling everyone around\nYou tell your

sometimes even physical annihilation of women\nRight so she remembers when she was a little girl getting beaten because she would talk when she wasn't supposed to talk 'cause she was a girl\nShe's ... she says I don't see movements lead with feminine strength grace and compassion and set I see a stereotype chaotic emotion we smash the patriarchy\nAnd didn't replace it with anything\nBut we have now is a drunk and free for all sets the pendulum thing rice and they didn't put it where it's supposed to be they just went too far now they're the ones doing the\nTyranny\nRevolutions almost always work like that is right very few like the American revolution ever principled enough not to have the chaotic\nPendulum swing\n\nHow many women during the times of the patriarchy where women were less than how many times did a woman get raped and and society only believed all men\nThe solution to that can't be the opposite and equally wrong believe all women that that doesn't it doesn't work it's got to be believed the truth\n... more genuine arguments that ... a genuine person might have made against cabinet like I disagree with this policy this position he took and she's like no this is why I disagree with that and really good job of that\nAnd I was wondering if she was even going to get into the allegations of course she did um and she was thoughtful with that as well and she said listen we pay for three weeks is that there's a prove\nAs you brought up my favorite thing this whole story as much craziness and insanity is has been holding still my favorite part of it is Dr Ford said this is the person who introduced me to Brett Kavanaugh and that person says I've never met by Kevin ... like what is that\nThis whole thing would be so different if one person if one person said even something like yeah I remember that gathering\nIs it not even oh yeah I remember her being a soldier I saw it or not even a witness like that just a witness of even of her best friend said\nYeah I Know ... capital you'd have to be the better there was one shred of maybe potential something that goes back quite then this whole thing would be completely\nDifferent but there was nothing like a comic we look at it from a a thirty thousand story arc perspective like a store or go we'll look back on this moment and be like wow that was odd\nThat there was no proof\nDo I mean are you wouldn't be on this one like nothing nothing nothing not on nothing [laughter] name a single thing that could have been there a single strand of any like now that is all over I think we can\nLook at it a little little more from a broader perspective there\nThat's really interesting that there's no way is right\nUp ... up five house you could have made that took place it could even get that so nothing and if there was one thing it would have been very\nVery different and that's essentially what we did that for three weeks so that's what are called set up there as well and ended with I'll be voting yes for capital so to probably be a fifty one forty nine vote could be a fifty fifty vote if maybe Jeff Flake switches in the next day or so I'm thirty hours and the next thirty hours\nBut that would still be a tie breakers or Mike Pence the vice president who's also the president of the Senate he breaks the tie so that'd be fun um but I don't see two people flipping at this point\nUnless we have more accusations that he's a ...\nAnd the next thirty hours by comes up with new letters I doubt it I think they know their losses [noise]\nUh wick thing I said I Want I got one last sort of thing about Kavanaugh will wrap up this crazy week um I mentioned before the break but I think Trump might might be missing an opportunity here uh I think he should be holding rallies 'cause we were just talking to read to articles about a minority women\nWho moderate lean Democrat\nWho because of this all are now like oh no we're very very strongly in the Republican side here because of this [laughter]\nSo to minority women and we talked about that rats wasn't ball where the the black voters approval rating of Trump's gone from twenty three to thirty five percent in one year\nPretty good it's a big jump so I think Trump is although doing better I still think there's a missed opportunity I think Trump should be holding rallies in ...\nMaxine Waters is districts right and really get out front and talk about how these democratic representatives are not helping anything\nRise of Trump rallies that I Want a fixture schools on a fix euros I Want to lower taxes and bringing more businesses to your town but you gotta go rate\nIn the belly of the beast right get up to be like these are the things I Want to do but your congressman your Maxine Waters who have a right is against me every step of the way I Want to criminal justice reform and here's what I Want to do but your wrapped won't work with me on\nAnything I think there's always a good time to do that maybe they're hanging on to that until we get closer to the presidential race but I don't see why you would wait for that I used to do that straight away we've got some momentum going on right now with messaging I think you should do\nSo we got that on the record one last sort of thing about a cabinet which I think a\nHas this has exposed the worst person on Twitter [laughter] this is quite as quite as that it's the worst person on Twitter throughout this entire cabinet stuff has been the conservative writer\nThe conservative writer like that's our title conservative writer at the Washington Post Jennifer Rubin\nShe's been awful Peru's or Twitter for proof of my charge here uh but it's not only her recent put her comments but her articles over the years from climate change gun control a Middle East policy tax cuts immigration abortion she doesn't hold a conservative position on anything\n[laughter] I mean those are pretty big topic I'm not nitpicking here I'm not like well she doesn't want to lower taxes enough she's not a real conservative so she wants to raise them so I I what are we well you know she's not\nPro life enough no no no no she's pro abortion how she's a conservative writer at the Washington Post so it turns out the other day a group of actual conservative writers wrote a letter to the Washington Post not calling for the Washington Post a\nFire that's not the goal here she can work or whatever just stopped calling her the conservative writer [laughter]\nThat solves some brand new car as someone who represents conservative positions or that that was an interesting a request but at the Washington Post will never stop calling or the conservative\nRight they they want that label on her because\nThey want to be able to use her and and tell readers look even this conservative thinks that Trump has a tyrant\nHere as a conservative calling out her side on climate change here's a conservative who isn't as radical as the pro life for Republicans right I think they need a her that that label as a weapon that or I should say more of a shield at the shield\nAt the Washington Post uses to defend their own insular thought process right like look even conservatives saying that cutting taxes is bad [laughter] so they're never going to get rid of that title but as we talked about all day to day actually pull of his tweets here\n\nOh quoted in full which is not necessarily mean full complete indoors but but I think it's still about right this is Eric Ericson if the progressive leadership progressive leadership had fewer bitter childless feminists\nAnd more moms they would've known that falsely accusing an innocent man of rape would not play play well with moms dads are really anyone else\nRight so the lesson in other words this is Rachel Ruben uh and and many others are living in their bubble I signed signed orchestrated this entire spectacle to hurt Republicans and to further this perception that Republicans are anti women\nAnd it turns out that women were disgusted by the false accusations and smears\nAnd it's going to backfire that's been the theme of the show today that Susan Collins proves\nBut the insular insularity ... folks the Washington Post and find signs office they never could have predicted that they never would have predicted that because they live in the Bible and in their bubble support for capital is on I think of all just like Trump winning the election was on things like never fathom such an sanity [laughter]\nThey can't even entertain the idea\n\nBut uh last year we are I got one I'm no break your out because I Want to opt to\nBreath for a while I'll stop there I think we've made a hundred and sixty K. F. M. B. one out of seven sixty five three six and to what a week but don't worry a as Eric and I were talking about earlier it's all good from here on\nI've I think\nEveryone is ah the they're gonna everyone's gonna come down forever\nEverything saying now I think the Democrats have learned their lesson I think Republicans are everyone's the outrage machine it's gone everyone's gonna be very level headed the calm\nOf agree with the ... of them together that's what it is this is this moment right here in history so it's from this point forward um for as far as I can see every everything's just going to be um what's the word hunky dory rainbows and butter of us so mad if I May of rainbows and the butterflies until\nTomorrow maybe tomorrow it all go back to Bob\nIt'll never get better [laughter] only gonna get worse this will be this will be a quaint acquaint walk in the park these last three weeks compared to the next Trump's Supreme Court nominee when Amy Barrett is nominated to take over Ruth Bader Ginsburg seat\nGood night [noise] wanting under seven sixty chaos and beef we were going to be your earnings for the day is like when Gavin Newsom potentially wins the governor's seat we'll be\nBringing back Jerry Brown but\nThat'll be a weird moment but I was going to have it there is anything here when Amy Barrett is being confirmed for Ruth Bader Ginsburg seen by Donald Trump and the Republicans and the Democrats\nAre gonna flip out right but I only we can go back to the same days of the cabinet hearing\nOf weird moment that will be our solar thank you all of our veterans and active duty service members for I'm trying to win the complete solar system so uh what Adam did is he narrowed it down to three lucky finalist", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "05"}
