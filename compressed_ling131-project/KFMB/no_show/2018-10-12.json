five day they are like that when the dams don't take back the house or the Senate right definitely won't take the Senate but even if they don't win back the house [noise] [noise] yeah oh man\nTo balance it up there will\nBe I'm almost even even if this bet to guide doesn't win because I hear about like his for his four times he's raised in a couple of ladies poll not that we are big pulled

and if I perish perish\nJeremiah how do we get to that point how do we get to that point in our heart in our lives\nWell you don't trust is built like in any relationship\nBy gets built over time and every time you see God in action and you'll be happy and you keep building this trust and sometimes you get to a point where you just don't know what else to do it and you just have to as somebody once said you have to let go and let God and when you do that\nThere is a freedom that comes and most of us who walked with the lord for any given time\nHave been at that point one or two times\nAt our life just give you give up control it's more than the rise a little more than that what what's the what's the what's the root of all you\nJust you just stop trying to manipulate things yourself say lord\nYou know as I said I think I may have mentioned it in one of the services over the weekend you saw in the bottom of the paper and you say lord you fill in the top I'm Molly on whatever it is\nUm another story about CERN because first of all there there's no stories in the world better than the stories in the Bible just as literature for literature saying as soon as the beautiful amazing story um yeah truth God is in control of every you know it's\nSo surprising to me when I told that story I Know that people know that story I mean people at our church of heard it before but there were several times where I was telling it like when Hayman ... who is the bad guy in the story when he gets what he deserves the people in the congregation clapped\nLife is never heard this story before it was really amazing amazing like it's\nA plane they see they are an act of her time in front of them but it's it's as there is of course in college called Bible as literature and I'm never took it and obviously wasn't a Christian you know of course but um I Wonder what they would have thought about that story 'cause there's nothing there's no better story than than that one right there among matters a lot of great\nStories in the by the stories I've ever read the Bible stories\nI notice here I'm In one last question about the last seven or if there's any other time period in history that you would live in which would you choose\n[noise] you know what I've thought about all of that and my wife and I talked about it and I remembered her telling me you know got to put you down where you're supposed to be\nYou're not a renaissance man you're you're here and I remember when I when I was ordained my father preached a message for me for ... Thirteen thirty six years that verse David served his generation by the will of God and of course it was another David but it\nWorked for them and that's what I wanted to do that is what I've tried to do and I don't think I'd want to be at any other time I'm I'm at the right place at the right time because this is where it got plop me\nWe're going to get as a ah what do we have coming up this week there\nWas the last of these five messages and this week uh the the messages about allied you know we have studied ... in depth in recent months this is kind of another one of those this is his whole life\nIn one message and what we're going to learn this week is how over commerce confront their culture and this is what we're going to learn from it ... what he did and how he did it and the principles that a carry over into our lives as well\nAs one of the main themes of our shows how broken our culture is how long can it is a so how do you overcome\nIt ... your culture that right over your culture the fair are important\nI got six things that tell you about that but you got to come to church I like it will be there when I went away after\nFive o'clock on Saturday Night and then a nine o'clock and ten forty five on Sunday\nSo what's the Saturday service the bows give another point for what happens on Saturday Night\n[noise] well it's the same message or a whole lot of different kinds of music more informal I'm\nJust a little more more laid back I guess I could say and a lot of people that work in the services on the Lord's Day church on Saturday Night a lot of for instance we have a huge number of people that drive shuttle buses they all come to church on Saturday and a lot of times\nA whole youth group will come like all middle school kids will show up because they don't have an an event afterwards\nSo it's always just I Love Saturday Night so I mean it it does take a night out of your week 'cause you know there's some things you don't do because\nYou have Saturday Night church but man I tell you this we we just had our thirtieth anniversary of Saturday Night church for ten years ago yeah and\nUh I don't know what we would do without it because we don't have room on Sunday if we had to if we had to handle all those people feel it's it's a good\nThing not very good um so what do you wonder where where where's the look at the times of course that's what got us in the goodness great yeah the website is shadow mountain down Oregon uh let's see everyone there that Sunday certain procedure done\nAll right thank you very much I\nWant to enter salmon sixty can't send me to have enough time to make this point I Do that to me at this point and we'll wrap\nThis up wrap up the way I'm In the history of mid term elections for the party of the president that sounded worthy try it again or\nWhatever party the president belongs to the first election after he takes office so two years after he takes office that party almost always\nDoes very very poorly loses seats in the house and loses seats in the Senate and it makes sense it's a human nature right and so it was oh it's a a a party a wins the presidency wild and party be there at\n... wake up call right and they're like oh my gosh I Can't believe this happened we better go vote and they raise more money because being against someone and something a is a pretty motivating force to get people to turn out to get people to donate right\n[noise] uh\nSo so there are more motivated losing party is more motivated and then the people who just won to the people from party a they are ah they're feeling good [laughter] but\nWe want we want his last one I said we're going to wait on the elections now we rest on our laws we don't have to do anything right\nSo because of those two things coming together a lot of seats flip after a presidential less so it does go back a little bit in time I Would go back to Nixon right the Nineteen Seventy or\nThe first election after Nixon won the presidency so we wouldn't be on what what we're talking about Iraq the Nixon when the president did two years later it's the mid term election so in the mid term election Nixon law his party lost twelve house seats\nFor the first election after last forty eight house seats in five Senate seats Jimmy Carter his party lost Fifteen house seats three Senate seats Reagan his first term last twenty six house seats\nAnd eight Senate seats in his second term first Bush lost eight house seats and one Senate seat Clinton lost fifty two house seats fifty to an eight Senate seats age you about it\nOr you probably couldn't devote not long ago a George W Bush's first term he actually gained he's the only one\nSince Nineteen Seventy George W. Bush gained eight house seats and gained it two Senate seats\nThe Republicans I'm assuming that uh the two thousand two elections some W was elected to thousands of ... to them to election I he was the only president decided to have any as well as far back as I went and I don't even know if you know I'm sure you go further back is\nProbably remains true but first president actually that Republican Party gain seats and I have to imagine that that has to do a lot with nine eleven\nRight up September eleventh the elections have been like a month or two months after so I'm sure it has something to do with that right oh so it's a little bit of an anomaly because\nW Bush's second midterm he lost the Republicans lost thirty house seats lost six Senate seats and then brought about his first term he lost thirty house seats in six Senate seats right you would need to every president suffered W a little bit of an odd way or the\nParty that's in charge of the White House loses a lot of seats in the house in the Senate\nIf that doesn't happen with President Trump in twenty something days\nIf the Democrats do not gain a lot of seats in the house and maybe even take the Senate and\nThe left will lose it they will absolutely freak out\nRather funny article this morning about a from a woman who applied to beyond the bachelor three times\n[laughter] there are times Chuck submitted to the water so some of the final round a shop I was actually pretty funny and insightful peace but this line stood out to me she said I was feeling desperate says when it comes to dating and I was feeling desperate\nAnd when you're feeling desperate you do nonsensical and logical things\n\nWhich is why from the Democrats here the more desperate to get\nThe more desperate to get the more they lose raises the more nonsensical and a logical they're going to get this is what desperation does to you so we'll see what happens in twenty something days but I Would hang on tied for that one out of seven sixty chaos and be anchor funding ... it is expensive to live here you know that\nPrices all prices are up though so you may have equity in your home and you can use that so called ... president raccoon funding has been talking about it for eight years or so now I'm had one of our oil is one of our listeners come by their first mortgage\nAnd over thirty thousand dollars of high inches dead put into one they'll pay me this every four hundred dollars a month just obviously paper relief for them because property values are up they were able to get some cash back for smaller government as well so helpless credit cards just a lot of credit that hurts get some cash out keep more your money instead of all that ...\nGone right out the door so even if the credits lots of perfect don't let", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "San Diego", "day": "12"}
