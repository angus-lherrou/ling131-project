name my son ...\n... so you knew the sermon was going to be a special place for me a love this man so much um how do we\n... and at the same time has conviction and compassion those are two of the key words you use it seems like those two things seem incompatible when we're trying to spread the word but how do we do that\nThere's no way really to do that in my estimation except through the ... of the Holy Spirit that what I what you just describe what I talked about last week that does not natural supernatural\nAnd it takes God's Holy Spirit in us control I guess and I I've had that happened to me on a couple of occasions where\nUm I just realized that what I was doing what I was saying how I was saying it wasn't what I really felt like saying or wanted to say but it's what God\nMade me or helped me say and I think that's really true I mean if you think you have the ability to be the governor on your own life and\nThe emotions and anger and all the rest you will be very surprised that you know\nI'm a super grateful last week certainly to I'd have all the times I've ever heard of ... talked about a I've never heard anyone talk about\nOne of the final scenes right after he does the the you know it shows the king's men who the real got is on top of the mountains and then after that he says he wants to die he's exhausted and he just wants his life to end and I've never heard anyone preach on that part why is that an important part of the story and what lesson do we get from the\nCivil ... it's important because it demonstrates the humanity of Elijah ... if if the Bible didn't include somebody once told me that the Bible paints people works at all\nAnd if that I at the Bible didn't include ... information like that\nThen people like Elijah Wood be out of reach for us we wouldn't be able to apply the truth of their lives with the Bible says the allies who was a man of like nature such as we are so he was susceptible to depression and discourage but\nAnd we all know this that we've done what we do that is that we are most vulnerable after we've had a big moment Mm could have been much bigger moment the large head on mount Carmel with\nWith all the profits of of bail but the next day he felt totally empty and and had to go through that experience\nAnd just out of gas right exhaustion [laughter] that's a big problem down in ah in our culture today too ... about you so you're you're doing a ton of things nonstop all the time how are you not exhausted all the time\nWhile I'm tired some you know you just got back from the ... city tour and um I wasn't tired during the tour but when I got home I realized did it take itself that out of bed I got a chill it for a couple of days\nThe the fact of the matter is for so many of the things we do and maybe this was true ... to he was he was he was burned in some uh\nSome adrenaline yeah and uh you can't help that when you're out there and and and doing some things that are kind of beyond what you thought you'd ever do though\nBut I I Try to learn how to you know what I Know I'm going to hit the wall and just walk away for a while and try to you know read something that isn't connected to what I'm doing and get my mind off things but I don't have that very often I don't have it all 'cause I've just but God has blessed me with a lot of energy at\n[noise] and so uh you know I take that as a great\nYour new great off you're using it all uh what do we have coming up this weekend so\n[noise] well you know we finish this little short series and what's while there's something I Want to preach that doesn't fit any serious this weekend I'm going to preach a on a subject that\nI really never given a full of tree with two and a message and it's it's it's an event is going to happen in the future called the judgment seat of Christ\nAnd it's about what happens when we get to heaven knows relievers and we come before Christ not to be judged for our sins but\nHe will hand out the rewards for our life of service it is a very motivating a lesson and I'm\nI'm sure it will be may be some new material for people we ever studied it before it's it's not founded a lot of passages maybe three or four in the New Testament but if it's filled with a\nJust a great great encourage but to keep on keep it on\nIs it bad or what does it say about about me when when you talk about the judgment seat of Christ in my first thought as a write in and maybe not as super encouraging positive thing even as a Christian believer all the rest right well\nI understand that that's because we misunderstand that the vast vast purpose of that event is not candidate but he adds to reward those who have served the lord and uh you know I've ... I've heard it taught a couple of times in my life where it's been made into a\nYou know you you know let them kill producing a story and certainly going to try to make sure that doesn't happen\nYes it is so the judgment isn't you're going to have and you're going to hell that I don't know it has\nNothing to do with our sins or says are covered\nWill never face our sins who can ... it's more like what happens or in an Olympic race where a man is on the on the beam of seat or on the platform and he is a ... rewarding those who have finished first and of course in the\nGreek and this man games it wasn't just where the Iran and well was rather you ran well and the rules so there's there's several very motivational stuff here I don't think it's going to be negative\nWell All right good stop wondering where do we attend the service near the five o'clock\nOn Saturday and um and then nine o'clock and ten forty five on set\nThe gun and shot a mountain dot org for all the information and if you are a visitor everyone's welcome and and send them out nice enough to have visited a parking rate in front of me I peace not just for you took on channel ... thing you see this weekend All right\nYou send them out and out or going ahead and seven sixty K.
