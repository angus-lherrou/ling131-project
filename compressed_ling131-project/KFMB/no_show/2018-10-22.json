full faced\nYou stick your hand into a dark murky muddy oh and hope that fish ...\nDiscussing muddy river that you that we should never go in and ever yeah ever at all ever at all and it's called Newton new catfish noon you stick your head you're bear arms did you ever do it\nI'm a an industrial climber and they sell a lot of climbing supplies as well they fill all sorts of sporting goods uh as far\nThe outdoors and sent from what you're thinking of if they do have fish in kayaks and things like that they are a wonderful wonderful outfit or of outfitting for clothing and stuff like that for the outdoors\nI got a lot of questions first of all what's an industrial climber\n[noise] um I I Do a lot of different things I technically referred to his rope access and its job that you can only get two by rope or by climbing a big powers bridges skyscrapers cliff\nOr things like that because of that it's a diverse thing I've done everything from putting in a gas gets on the window the Freedom Tower to Niagara Falls cliff stabilization\nI'm into a\nPainting the top of the the Ann tower in Toronto so things like that and I that is what I Do in my off time I primarily worked in the movies\nThe special effects technician and rigor using a lot of my climate ability you\nTalking about what was it the Arab cause them to a radio show ... and says oh I just maybe for sure I Do I Do to call it a race doesn't make stuff up the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard was backed as\nWell as I did it would be to Mike's later shows that I've yeah I've been a huge fan of followed\nYou a first encountered you on the blaze and I've been with you on your Daily Show pretty much ever since and I think the first issue we're dealing with was uh uh the Amazon where house down in Chula Vista\nYeah how about a year ago wow that's all I really appreciate that thank you but I honestly I didn't you probably got to get to work by\nBy climbing some hunters so how do you\nKnow I'm I'm putting I'm building a a a floor for my sons play house who was a close in age to Jack I have always\nAt three and a year and a half and uh and so one of them for his third birthday is getting a little clubhouse and because we get a lot of rain here a lot more than you do in San Diego I have to build a step off the ground to keep\nIt from a large ah can use that first I Want to see a picture of the finished products have you don't mind a secular what ... what was one of the most harrowing a projects that you worked on when it came to climbing\nOh I you know I got to say\nThat the the the Ann tower was kind of the scariest because they're at the time was the tallest building in North America\nAnd uh when we were at the top everything underneath us we're a microwave panels and so they would shut off to panels as you were working but the winds up there so incredible that just consider like this whole by the tea bag and below on it okay and that's what you're like up there\nAnd so sometimes you drift over the microwave panels and get a little fuzzy feeling and that was\nPretty scary up there and live and let them do at the time was a microwave panel\nA microwave panel is a panel maybe even used in this broadcast in which it sends information from one point to another using microwaves\nWhoa okay yeah 'cause on it and had a slightly dangerous if you like what's that that sounds dangerous to be near those\nSure well that's the thing is that's why they shut off two of them so that you don't drift over you know so that you're not working for him but if you should happen to drift over them you will feel it and and that was scary\nWow though it's just yesterday told me to watch the documentary about the uh the free climber guy or you know talking about Alex in old at\nThe end of the French the French\nFrom some ... know rope sure you're out there so so I remember I read a little bit about um a while ago and he literally doesn't have like a part of his brain that deals with the fear\nDoesn't exist today it totally does not work\nYou have that like when you're out there are you scared at all how do you stay focused I guess is a better question\nWell so the fear a I Am slightly scared um and so it does it does help that I Am scared I'm also I Do a diving as well so I work in a fear based environment pretty well um but uh it it is about\nKnowing it appreciating the fear and then using that as your means to stay focused because it's hard to pay attention to anything else\nWhen what they'll when when you I'm Sorry\nWhen you have a proper respect for the situation and and and generally it will give you a fear as long as you have that certain amount of fear that gives you the respect that allows you to focus on exactly what you need to because you know your your your top priority should be to get your job done and get back to a safe situation as soon as possible and safely as possible\nWas it a need to work on the Freedom Tower like than others specials something to do it\n[laughter] no no no it was just a it was a lot of the draw and I was I was obviously I was stoked to get it it was a short thing it was a you know I was happy to to do it though absolutely\nReally cool are you close to the masses Baton Rouge Covington or a New Orleans location\nA New Orleans located in Avondale\nBeautiful well next time you there give a shout out to ah Jerry fullington\nYeah that's how I wanted to catch his name again so yeah I Know I Will go in there I Can't do it tonight but I Will do\nIt tomorrow it's pretty awesome things were called the manor really present\nBanks were making a great show as well I have a great and I have we have a great show I\nThink that was I was in ...\nAnd the guys smoke the boy is so I Do a little research on Jerry fall into the guy so is this list is playing this whole conversation now just this kind of funny sure started talking about Iran and bridge in China\nRight and then some guy and lower the oil and says oh I drive across as really long bridge in New Orleans and then this guy called then he's like a ... a block away from the store the other guy works out to the guy who emailed a second ago\nJerry fullington he used to be he's on the general manager of all those locations he used to be the general manager of adventure sixteen based in San Diego right off the eight I'm off the aid kind of cross from San Diego state it was like on\nThe bill is like an ... guy outdoors you store and they have a weird random like orange dome on the top of it you've sent\nThat they're used to work there now or is New Orleans so since I was on the radio because I was thinking I was like this guy because I thought what are the people who live in New Orleans think about our in depth analysis of San Diego state west and soccer city like that has to be a pretty boring segment you live in New Orleans I guess but then this guy\nUsed to live or work great on the site so still I guess relevant enough\nPeople follow along is so long as it's an interesting enough concept core principle that we're fighting for right there the universal enough right so we talked with about toxicity earlier and like the lives\nIn San Diego state or the the the seat that San Diego state is doing like that's all relevant everywhere there's nothing yeah that's the Sally here but\nI'm the instance of it a pretty cool thanks a New Orleans listeners or let's go to Bob in 'em but Bob where are you calling from probably saying uh\nCalling from uh San Diego\nOkay perfect says this is a pretty pretty mundane part of your program but what's the latest tower that you've climbed Mt aside off I don't like climate [laughter] wow wow this is a really boring won't go tell me about the ... what's your ... years now\nI thought that was interesting you were talking about shares a when I was a child in a small town and the brass uh I live in a Sears home really\nYeah Sears a manufactured are sold manufactured homes and it was in the twenties and thirties I Believe uh they would put a home at a boxcar reflect car ship by railroad to a town\nAnd the town will be lifted was a small a brass go we have to Sears holes that and I lived in one of them and I didn't know what is it time but ironically I was at a restaurant in Claremont\nWalked events room and the wall paper was from a Sears catalog was actually wallpaper they sold the salt that showed Sears products and ... with the whole\nNo way old yeah yeah and my home was up there oh my gosh [laughter]\nWow that is a tricky moment unbelievable law I'm a I'm looking at some pictures of these houses some of these are beautiful homes they respond\nYeah this was a big home two story a big front porch a buildup base but under it\nWhile I'm In this trial would be just one all the two by fours and everything everything you need\nEvery single piece of the instructions I shifted by boxcar it was a railroad car that they put the home into pieces\nAnd it just show up on your land\nWell they showed up at the station siting and then they would off loaded and then build it wherever you wanted the home built\nWho would build it would Sears people do that or\nYou know the you know local carpenters of adverse\nBuild it wherever you want to know\nWho would build it would the years people build it\nOr you know the you know local carpenters of average that ordered it and there were small homes that were really big arms wildly overnight yeah they usually\nRarely a famous church for their side for the stairs that was the finished product wow\nReally interesting wow that's cool well there you go thanks for the story about presented Graham banks or who who's program about who did\n[laughter] no no no no I didn't quite get involved here [laughter]\nNot played a little wine man I don't play a game by you are a lot of it or they get around that offers you a\nLot better [laughter] they're ...\nA play by play in any of your not set to uh it's funny a Sears homes that [noise] um can I make a serious point or do ... years has come and you're right", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "San Diego", "day": "22"}
