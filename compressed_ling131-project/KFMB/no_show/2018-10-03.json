by witnesses to a crime when witnesses are absolutely convinced that they're telling the truth\nWe did a whole thing on this yesterday at one o'clock so if you're interested in how I Witness testimonies are pretty much garbage go to seven sixty ... podcast yesterday at one after all or why after all would they lie a there's the word lie\nThat's the word that gets us off track\nYou see I witnesses who point the finger at innocent defendants are not liars for they genuinely believe in the truth of their testimony the face that they see before them is the face of the attacker\nThe face of innocence has become the face of guilt that's the frightening part but truly horrifying idea that our memories can be changed inextricably altered\nAnd now what we think we know what we believe with all of our hearts\nIs not necessarily the truth\nI bring this up because a lot during the hearing last Thursday you'd have the Democrats try and put cabin on you hear this and other scenarios as well they'll say oh do you think these women are lying or the are you calling them liars\nYes or no you go to the uh uh no I ah the trap\nAlly is deliberate that is Dr Ford saying I'm going to tell I'm going to make up the story I Know I'm making it up I Know it's not true and I'm going to lie about it I don't think anyone thinks she's doing that\n\nThe other two very different but first for these women ... focus on Dr for Dodger Fort can be a hundred percent and this is the where we used earlier in the media and and people keep using or credible she's a credible accuser should not credible the word that we're looking for is\nSincere fear accuser\nNot credible because as Trump said she doesn't have the one where when why what's your name ration right\nUsually the result people and make civilization who want to flip this innocent until proven guilty the attempts are usually there was all the people who don't understand the full or the society used to be people who think that

office they have no incentive to tell you the right advice\nAnd decisions you need to make in your life to get ... more ... about benefits back for the rest of your life the ... why would they do that why would they go out of their way and make the effort to know more about you and your scenario in your situation in order to but I don't care who not only to joke about it why would they if anything\nThe Social Security administration wants you to take as little as possible move the little money as possible and\nBecause accusers sometimes lie [noise]\nDid not go over well so now there's protest all over campus calling for him to resign but most of these comments from the students are this is all on the edge\nAs a female students I feel very uncomfortable that a male professor who my I have never met is trying to interfere check this out with my access to knowledge about my federal rights\nThat's weird [laughter] he's he's trying to interfere with my access to knowledge about my federal rights I don't even know what\nThat means I here's another person professor James Moore has created a hostile environment\nThey always do another protester I Hope that more people become aware of this and start speaking out about what they think should be free speech on campus right so this comment from this professor apparently does not fall under the students definition of free speech [laughter] the guy says hey listen put yourself in a a falsely accused person's shoes\nOff hostile environment dot ... that's not free speech you don't have the freedoms that accuser sometimes lie about their you come on someone else so that that email was truly traumatizing traumatizing\nSo the ... professor respond to this is all going on right now by the way because isn't going back years is happening right or he responded what had really prompted me to respond to call to quote believe the victim\nBut if you believe the victim and then there's really no point in the due process\n\nIs right this is ... ... if we always believe the victim so called victim excuse if we always leave the accuser then why have court but all\n\nGo right to the fact that we're always believe the victim why even have the court ... just whatever the victims says his gospel that's it and if you have any questions that you want to ask the accuser then well you're just as bad as the\nRapist doesn't say what about your babies\nYou're the Yale Law school cancelled some classes last week because of all the cancelled their class Yale Yale Law school\n\nStudents at Harvard where Kavanaugh taught up until now is key cos that's been cancelled move forward but a fifty students signed a petition saying that they're going to file title nine complaint against Kavanaugh because his mere presence on campus\nCreates a hostile environment and has violated our quote right to a feeling of being safe\nPets where do you have a right to the feeling of being safe that's a weird quarter all these things people are making it\nSo a mother in law professor at Harvard said come on this is an abuse of the legitimate title nine process and undermines the is the quote legitimacy and credibility of actual complaints so now there's calls you get those two professors fired [laughter]\n\nSo here's what I bring this up was this thing about this as we saw this coming for years but it's coming for years\nWhat we're seeing these last two weeks with Kavanaugh has been happening on college campuses for at least a decade and it was just a matter of time before this was all going to be seeped out into the real world right\n\nBy the way Keith Ellison Minnesota congressman who's running for attorney general of all things in Minnesota his girlfriend is ex girlfriend says that he beat her\nA ...

I totally ... stand behind what you just said due process I spoke earlier today to a friend of mine who was raped at an earlier stage in her life\nAnd uh she's a she's a moderate she's in the middle she's not a conservative or liberal not a Republican or a Democrat\nAnd I asked her what she thought of this whole thing and she goes you know what I honestly I Believe and due process because without due process like we're basically back where we were uh with the Salem witch trials mhm\nGoes she goes to the things that happened to me when I was younger horrible but Brett Kavanaugh didn't do it\nBill Cosby didn't do it Harvey Weinstein didn't do it you know somebody else so you know where do where do we go from her point is where do we go from ... which is my point is well where do we go from you know why can't we call into question this Dr Ford\nYeah no it's great so of course every sitcom or miles on the phone right now Eric what segment of today's show would you forward a fine print Christ mostly all of them\nOh I'm Sorry I said mostly all the thank you uh the correct answer would be the twelve o'clock segment I Believe we came right out ah and all of last week's podcast usher in every hour [laughter] very specifically to Chris' point though\nWe talked about Dr Ford now we talked about the ... the whole flying why\nLike I I'm scared to fly but on your bio of your website and you say that you like to surf and exotic locations around the world ah that's weird I don't get down or then the lie detector test what you just brought up Chris rightfully so her ex boyfriend says no no no no I don't play that clip actually it's the one I Do try to do so I Would shut 'em\nThe female prosecutor asked very specific questions Dr Ford and I distinctly remember when they took one of the brakes last Thursday I said this is odd because these questions are very very specific\nAnd I said something like ... we're going to find out one day why she asks the specific question because they don't make any sense right now but I don't think she would ask random questions so here's one oddly specific question\nHave you ever had discussions with anyone um besides your attorneys on how to take a polygraph\nAnd I don't just mean counter measures but I mean just any sort of tips or anything like that [noise]\nYeah and it\nScared the heck itself was comfortable on that I can tell the information [noise]\nSlavery or whatever is going to reveal next second to the as long as it's going to be so it's a little bit stressful\nBecause you have you ever given tips or advice to somebody who is looking to take a polygraph test her\nSo she didn't ask she did not ask have you ever received tips on how to take a polygraph the oddly specific question was have you ever given someone else advice on how to ask you to take a polygraph to we are right\nSo now we have not deport ex boyfriend writing a letter under perjury saying oh yeah ...
