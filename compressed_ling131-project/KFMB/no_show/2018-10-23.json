T. editorial board interview a live you guys spend this money so poorly this bond much as five billion dollars that we've already given you\nAnd now here you've got you've only spent two billion other two or three billion of it I think three ... and still no air conditioning in the classrooms and you you're asking for another three and a half to like what's going on here\nSo this is the second part of his answer he said this is Kevin ... one of the school where members there are a variety of other things that I think are important or if you take a look at the check this out I Love it if you take a look at the conservative San Diego county taxpayers association\nAnd whether they're they published an annual report card on bond programs like this and a twenty Eighteen to San Diego county taxpayers association rated San Diego unify the perfect one hundred percent\nOn that report that far off what do you find your cars that ... thing he loves out perfect wow good for them\nThat's an a plus by any measure and what they evaluate value waited were several metrics on bond transparency bond information oversight of the independent oversight committee that one is I can do and what it was like double oversight so so much of the rovers are we we're complying with the letter of the bond\nAnd what we communicated with voters and what voters approved wow\nFreight point Kevin buys her yeah except for everything you just said is it absurd ridiculous alive so the San Diego county taxpayers association they are dead guy but it's funny that he called it the conservative\nSan Diego county taxes association a couple of weeks ago I the reason I say the taxpayer association is dead is because a couple of weeks ago they came out on prop six that's the gas tax they came out\nAs a neutral [laughter]\nMeasure things would lower the gas tax by the twelve cents right and the San Diego county taxpayers association said\n[noise] I don't know\nWho's to say really fear can you know we see both sides on this one got the highest gas taxes in the country I mean what are we to say\nWhether or not we should lower the taxes on gas I\nMean it's not like we're the excuse me sir yes ah aren't you a part of the uh\nTax board dies you mean the taxpayers association said you're sure sure I can see why you would think\nThat means we should recommend lowering but you know and this one is kind of lost on this one I was just ... I got nothing for you or a swing dance or just go for it on this one\nVote your guy [laughter] [laughter] what\nCity or county taxes association is that they've lost all these board members they've totally jumped the shark and it's funny to Kevin ... now lifting them up as a as the conservative San Diego county taxes association hilarious so the conservative San Diego county tax association\nSays gave him a hundred percent\nOn their previous bond measures a hundred percent are you going to be the district was sued because they spent a suit and loss I should say they were sued and lost because they spent millions of dollars on stadium lighting that was not\nDetail in the bond measures they lost the lawsuits so how could you rate those bonds a hundred percent they\nGot sued yeah and the last yeah there which means they lied about spending millions of dollars on stadium lighting ... and the county taxes association says we give you a hundred percent rating on bond transparency and bond oversight and it's a pretty good trick on during present a bond over say\nOne of my all time favorite like Slater says that are in fact\nThe independent citizens oversight committee that buys we talked about a second ago\nOne of the leaders of that independent oversight or oversight committee is the head of the electrical contractors association he's added the electrical electricians' union coup gosh\nBy golly was the guy who signed off on building the new stadium writing [laughter]\n[laughter]\n\nHow to present a hundred percent writing [laughter] wow so the UT was actually tough on buys they're pretty tough on a and then in ... I don't even know that I think I Would have this here uh\nTo to to do here just\nOh your sister the UT there's like two weeks ago\nThey said the current board has had its embarrassments and disappointments and then they went off and that was at a bunch of different things like we talked about for years on the show no leader has a coherent long term strategy for dealing with ballooning pension costs and none has the courage to\nTake on the teachers union are\nSo having in when I Lived in Israel having an independent thoughtful new voice on the board would be of great value nonetheless we endorsed incumbents Kevin ... [laughter] what does\nDoes it got these guys are the worst of the barest thinking disappointing so sad we really need a thoughtful independent new voice on the board\nWill go with this guy again\nThat's that's worth of you do that [laughter] now that you did come out against why why so I Will give him credit on that one at least\nThat's what you do that [laughter] now did you did come out against why why so I Will give him credit\nOn that one at least pretty amazing right so do you take on and they said listen\nI'm not saying this is one of the questions was I'm not saying what you did with these bonds you know paying for either pads for a buck forty forty years for an eye pad that's going to live up to one of the thing is he's legal I'm just saying is it wise that was the question that the UT guy offered to Kevin buys or is it why when you have to pay something off for thirty forty years then you double the cost\nThat that's not good governance if you're doing if you're paying for things that last two years\n\nAnd Kevin said a Kevin by decided we got a very very good return for taxpayers and it was the right thing to do for our children\nBang for the pads and so by the\nUh let's see here's one more oh so the UT ask them about the fraudulent graduation rate numbers parts of the district says that the graduation rate is Ninety One percent\nA time of close to that and they know it", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "23"}
