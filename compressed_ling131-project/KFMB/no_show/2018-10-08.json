[laughter]\nUh so I got the street there certainly but but but I think it's better to where we refresh our memories of the Columbus was a murder and indigenous peoples were noble and virtuous and above reproach mess their hair hashtags is people's day\n[noise]\nMile the founding member of his book clan\nOkay right [laughter] we got a nice ring to it [laughter]\nIt's a funny joke from forty five minutes ago um our it's got to look forward to it as well let's do this happy Columbus everyone Eric\nYes sir every Columbus Day and do you buy an avid Columbus Day to day sir thank you you as well\nI notice that uh there was something going on when there was no traffic this morning on the way I\nHad no idea why it was the person that has it off or is that his government beach is that the fed so thank right\nWow but that's enough to make traffic not a big deal yeah totally I mean I have no I usually deal with a pretty amazing amount of traffic no trial I just eating the indigenous people out on the road either a question or a good point I\nGot in\nChina day well they've all been wiped out and that's why we're there we go we're getting to hear thank you very much for that or this is the day we should celebrate the west discovering America and bringing to this land all of the western traditions that we enjoy and take for granted today that's what Columbus Day is all about for me\nSo let's give 'em a before we get to Columbus let's give today's example of how far we've strayed from having proper perspective\nAnd how far we have straight into the identity politics at all times so Scott Kelly is an astronaut it's been a space for ties\nBetween the other day said one of the greatest leaders of modern time sir Winston Churchill said\nIn victory magnanimity\nAnd being nice to be a nice guy and victory be an expert I guess those days are over ... are now she had to apologize for that tweet Twitter mouth forced him to apologize gentlemen do you know why he had to apologize for that tweet let me read it again one of the greatest leaders of modern times so Winston Churchill said in victory\nMagnet magnanimity bang magnanimity I guess those days are over\nGonna go with that magnanimity magnanimity mortar out oh that works fine still fine PC police no problem with that were magnanimity hair quieted a Scott Kelly have to apologize for that to eat\n\nSomething about Churchill\nOoh here's the follow up did not mean to offend by quoting Churchill my apologies I Will go and educate myself further on his atrocities\nSaying I'm going to be very very quickly\nSo I think like I Know it's okay to evade taxes\nDoesn't mean you need to go out of your way to pay more in taxes\nNot say that I'm great how many are very very Chris yeah so I didn't like I think it's okay to evade taxes legally\nWell let me know it's not okay do they actually that's a that's the law\nDuring those are very disarm starts at a reduced to do whatever you can to reduce our taxes that's what I meant to say sorry that's where my question the question is ... okay I went to a point I mean I've I've been through so what's your point what's the point you want to make you ... if you don't know if you took me down now Mike okay this is your sales\nHey I'm going to get talked about physical college real close\nTo about ... you just come out you just gave you the set up you you did this set up you ask for very specific reason now I I I\nI don't really hear the Patriot if you cheat on your taxes I'm curious\nSo one of the ... what's the proof that Donald Trump cheated on his taxes\nI didn't I didn't say Valentine's Day\nWhen you're talking about the airlines they're done with a New York times article why you're and you're not going to\nTurn around and just talking about hypothetical but sooner calling you brought up several colleagues today and for people who are in tension pseudo Collins always was a yes vote on Kavanaugh and then we're going to this caller let's put an author's by none other than\nGeorge Bush forty one she owes her vote to the Bush family and the Bush family called that podium ... long time ago\nMhm sure nation can then she was sure it on the air [laughter] yeah so it's kind of how ... she's from the Bush era Catholic ... she's friends with the family but I wanted I guess yeah\n\nThat's just okay what are your people wondering about how it would never up yeah up in the air as to whether she was gonna astronaut\nIs this going to do do you find in saying that there's been more criticism of Susan Collins from the left for voting the way she did\nOr even an your your rightfully so it was just probably yes all the time and there's not as much criticism against Democrat Joe mansion for voting yes because he is the actual swing vote not Susan Collins so do you criticize Joe mansion for voting yes [noise]\nI think that when you're looking at a candidate like a judge Kavanaugh for it got to argue\nGiants' Cory Gardner court on a job interview showed him out to be a\nStrong hardest that brought up a ... a theory about the Clinton get actual coming after him [noise] um so the guy is completely on ... on an ... that have a democratic\nYeah we get ... let's see ...

news [noise]\nBuying Microsoft role I got sidetracked hypothesize\nWomen games will Mr Rogers when they did make me realize though that we do need a troll ... and in fact oh you're right it's kind of like the swamp but he but different more like control yeah I'd like we had to we gotta we gotta do far too\nShould have been still part one of a indigenous people's day so why did Christopher Columbus talked about why the left hates by academia hates Chris for Columbus why they needed to do and I said a for now we're talking about why Columbus sailed the ocean blue in what you gentlemen\nFor taking nine Ninety two very good ah he wanted to find gold why because he was greedy\nAnd he wanted to comment quest for the sake of conquests in greed you know he was trying to find gold so that you could fund an army to wage a war against the Muslims and take back Jerusalem\nCloudy in Seventy one up in oceanside well the Houston Astros have advanced the American league championship series they blasted the Indians today eleven to to me while the Dodgers lead the Braves one to nothing in the third inning Mike Slater's coming up am seven sixty talking breaking news\nThey mark Larson here joined me to borrow alive and local tend to noon the day after the cabinet I think it's finally really\nReally official we'll see what happens next day him seven sixty talking breaking news now back to my\nThe native bees [noise] ah [noise] he wasn't\nHe was looking for China and that indeed\nIs why they called the Caribbean the west indies\nBecause they thought he was looking for the Indy ... the regional outside of China that they got it right [laughter] so it was like a ...\nLittle bit different uh do do do do this is Reagan he said Columbus is justly admired as a brilliant navigator a fearless man of action a visionary who opened the eyes of an older world to an entirely new one is Obama a one journey change the trajectory of our world\nAnd this is Trump today Christopher Columbus the spirit of determination adventure has provided inspiration to generations of Americans uh Columbus Day we honor his remarkable accomplishment as a navigator and celebrate his voyage into the unknown expanse of the Atlantic ocean all good\nChristopher Columbus is worth celebrating because uh it's a celebration of the west and all the ideas of the west that we live in today that we Baskin today quality\nFreedom of religion freedom of speech freedom of\nThis was the explore who got here first\n\nColumbus had no desire to come here and kill the natives or to take them as slaves AS number one goal was as we started to get to China and talk to the head of China the con of China\nAnd there was no goal of its leaving the Chinese ride his goal was to convince them to fight against the Muslims who are in Jerusalem I'm right and and to convert the Chinese to Christianity is a very different conversion is very different than genocide\n\nHe also thought that the people he encountered he first encountered would become Spanish subjects and Spain actually had a law that made it illegal to turn native people into slaves\n\nAnd when he got here slavery already existed\nWas already flavor here right so the reason I keep bringing up your kids just because your kids are taught that America invented slavery I your kids have the present I guarantee are your kids have the perception unless you've taken lengths to make the to get rid of perception but your kids have a perception that\nSlavery is a uniquely American thing and if it's not a uniquely American thing is a uniquely white person thing it's white people against black people\nAnd they have zero place in their brain because they never taught there were never taught that slavery existed all over the world for all time and existence here in the new world\nBut for any white folk ever got here\nSlavery was already or not to mention cannibalism and human sacrifice\nDo you know ... ... pretty like a couple of years before a just a few years like two or three years before Christopher Columbus got on\nThat boat in fourteen Ninety to the gas tax sacrificed eighty thousand people over a four day period eighty thousand people human sacrifice\n\nAnd the so Columbus came over here to try to convert to Christianity and and uh get the Chinese to help us out and taking back truce alum said kids are taught that Columbus came over here to commit genocide against brown people give me a break\nHe actually treated the natives with profound respect he admired him he wrote this back to the queen he said you're Hyannis may believe that in all the world there can be no better people\nThey love their neighbors as themselves and their speech is the sweetest gentle is in the world and always with a smile that is what he wrote back about the natives he had no intention no desire to kill the people who are here\n\nNow to talk for three minutes about the natives were going to go easy on him because there's no need to replace a hatred of Columbus with a hatred of the natives that doesn't do any good\nBut in the name of proper perspective I Want to quote Michael Crichton who randomly we talked about last week as well he was giving a speech in two thousand three about global warming um and he talked about heat and I had this idea of a\nAnd the left has this and that man or without man\nNature was perfect right before a man came along major was perfect and we just screw it up and Michael Cryan says there is no eaten there never was\nWhat was that Eaton of the wonderful mythic past is this a time when infant mortality with eighty percent what four children and five died of disease before the age of five when one woman and six died in childbirth when the average life span was forty\n\nLike I was in America hundred years ago or wasn't one plague swept across the planet killing millions at a stroke when it was millions starved to death is that when it was he didn't\nAnd what about the indigenous peoples living in a state of harmony with the eating like environment wasn't ever did on this continent the newly arrived people who crossed the land bridge I saw how the native Scott here\nBut I took it to be fair when I'm going to really go but the natives weren't native here they came here to they just gave me a while before Columbus did but they weren't born here either they came across Labrador\nA across the land bridge almost immediately set about wiping out hundreds of species of large animals and they did the several thousand years before the white man showed up to accelerate the process\nAnd what was the condition of life loving peaceful harmonious hardly the early peoples of the new world lived in a constant state of warfare generations of hatred tribal hatred constant battles the war like tribes of this continent are famous the command ... su Apache mohawk as tax increases\nSome of the practice infanticide of human sacrifice and those tribes that we're not fiercely warlike were exterminated or learn to build their villages high in the\nCliffs to attain some measure of safety science magazine just a couple that I think it's like a month ago discovered finally they discovered a the rack of skills that the gas tax had massive made it a hundred and thirty thousand\nSkull so imagine there's about Fifteen feet tall so it's almost two stories tall fifty yards long so half a football field as he got half a football field long almost two stories tall multiple rows of skulls [laughter] right\n\nSo here's your peace loving harmonious group it was the Aztec Empire how do you become an empire politely knocking on nearby nearby village tours hey would you guys like to join our nice fun empire we got to go to now they go by they kill them\nThere was a ah as I say this is one of the funniest article I read a couple of years old there was an ass take our experiment or art exhibit in London a couple of years back and art critics when there is exhibit were appalled at everything they saw\nThere was a statue of an eagles and there was a hole in its back and that whole is where you would put the heart of the human sacrifice a victim there was a ceremonial drums\nAnd the drum had an image of a of a man lying on his stomach with a noose around his neck and that was the enemy from the uh the Aztec enemy right they had tiny caskets of children that were sacrificed to one of their ... try and put in this little tiny caskets\nThis is one of the art uh art critics it is difficult to imagine a museum display that gives off such an overwhelming sense of human evil as this why [laughter] I just wasn't pitch by the way the art museum to do this wasn't pitch has like a human atrocity look at the aspects those look at this beautiful Aztec art and these are critics when no like holy cow what\nIs this\nIsn't an art critic the ads that culture was bloodthirsty obsessed with death and killing in a way that surpassed any other civilization known to us and its cruelty and disregard for human life\n\nThe essay a lot of the people that they sacrifice not all of them but a lot of them\nOr enemies in battle right PR prisoners prisoners city aspects they would not but there was a battle they would try to not killed the other side they would try to capture him so that they could bring them back and do a whole human sacrifice thing on the altered to the gods right\nSo when they ended up fighting the white man this really hinder their effort because they asked\nThis really hinder their effort because they asked X kept trying to capture\nThe Europeans and\n... buddies urged bite and kill as opposed to capture so they were at a major disadvantage because they wanted to capture them but didn't want to capture them to uh give them a nice life in the ethic or they want to catch them so they could rip their hearts out while they're still alive\n\nWhen I did capture another town they invade out and get another city they were the capture of people were required to send every year a certain number of men women and children to be sacrificed every single year on the Aztec Salter we don't need to keep going you get the idea right for the ads taxing the natives are not perfect to people and\nNeither one of the Europeans but the truth is much closer to the opposite of what kids are taught today\nBut kids are taught today that Columbus was the genocidal awful bloodthirsty maniac and the natives were peace will come by a wonderful neighbors do the opposite of that is not true but the opposite of that is closer to the truth", "year": "2018",
