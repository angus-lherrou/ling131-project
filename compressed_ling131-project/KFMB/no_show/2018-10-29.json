I'll often or we get the point of those two right so let's do this one um\nLatinos won't turn Texas blue anytime soon then backwards but that's the opposite argument what I'm Talking about here in California I'm sure we're going to get callers is that oh Slater come on a Spanish aren't going to turn tech a California\nRed anytime soon are Hispanics aren't going to turn the fifty first district read any time soon but in Texas they're having conversations over the exact opposite like on a Spanish aren't gonna turn this place blue [laughter] like what do you mean how can it be\nSo Hispanics these numbers are four years old but I'm sure it's still true us panics in Texas are ten\nI spent accent in Texas are a much more educated than a Spanish in ... California\nNot interesting California has twelve percent of the U.S population and thirty four percent of the welfare recipients in the country\nSo we have twelve percent of the population thirty four percent of the welfare recipients have heard that before a but let's compare with taxes eight percent of the U.S population somebody goes but only three\nPercent of the welfare population in the country but\n[laughter] that's\nThere's no reason why a Spanish in California or at least Hispanics or in San Diego can't be conservative\nIt just takes truly and this is what maybe frustrating Sasha exciting it depends what did you hear about it uh it's one on one so it's gotta be gotta be straight one on one I was talking about ... ... the guy who called in and got a citizenship you remember called emitted they ever did this to the Alberta um she believe is Albert Albert I don't think there's no honor\nExcuse me if that's right that's right Albert a\nCampaign for oh don't all go and he's the one who told me oh it was later it's easy [laughter] she goes all these events and he talks the Democrats are people who are in the middle of whatever don't even know what they are the abortion so that's a\nThat's the first thing we're talking about abortion talk about these other things are crazy Democrats are ah are fighting for pushing for and and so many Hispanics truly don't like the stuff they're just like wow yeah I'm\nA Democrat is 'cause I you know we've always been we're supposed to be or whatever the guy said is is so this is from Albert so easy to combat so easy to combat intellectually it just takes time and a one on one interaction but it's not an uphill battle\nAnd one at all go probably got fired up so honestly if you're in a district that it's not that competitive or are you looking for a campaign to kind of help out this last week or so\nI Would recommend the dog GO Campaign not because I necessarily think he'll win this go round I Hope he does but I don't necessarily think well I haven't seen any polling anything\nBut just for the future for the for down the road because a lot of these elections take like a decade or so but it's only that groundwork now I think there's a really really good opportunity there and it said the first district especially because one Vargas has won set aside just to know but he's like Susan Davis doesn't do anything\nThey just want a job for life gosh I'd love to fire him want to enter seven sixty K.

good time to think about it too as we're in the holidays and\nAbout why historically people hate Jews and never made sense to me and I got that\nSo Thomas ... rode along chapter and his book a black rednecks why liberals about this and we went over to the surface a little bit of it are the first two segments of the show but in that it is a chapter about he threw a little bit of a side\nThat\nThe ... he says the Holocaust happened not to because anti Semitism reached some peak in the Nineteen thirties\nRight it's not so if you look at the anti Semitism across history it didn't hit its zenith in Nineteen thirties which Hitler then you know took advantage of her something\nHis argument is that it's technology and infrastructure that made it possible that six million Jews and millions of other people but six million Jews could be killed so systematically\n\nAnd he's he doesn't say this but I Believe the argument is\nThe technology and infrastructure was around prior to Nineteen thirties then there would have been genocides prior to Nineteen thirty right there is nothing specifically unique or\nDifferent about the hatred of Jews in the Nineteen thirties and there was in the sixteen hundreds of twelve hundreds of the eight hundred or the right I mean the Ottoman Empire and and what we're one killed one point five million Armenians\nAnd they would have killed more too if they had the infrastructure and the technology to do what the Germans did so I guess I just showed that in the background that this hatred isn't anything new and it's never going away it's really nice\nThe infrastructure and the technology to do what the Germans did so I guess I just said that in the background that this hatred isn't anything new and it's never going away it's really not\nIf you've never study our history which our kids don't by the way I was talking to a a taco to sit down halls talking to Jack Jack Armstrong he said his kid has never learned about George Washington said how old is a jak options get\nSix younger Kim ... say\nEight years old eight years old is third grade and third grade yeah ... yeah there's ... there's an older kid has never learned about George Washington in school\n[laughter] so he's been through that the Arabs one guy that Iraq on\nNo George Washington George Washington ... ... like some of the dollar bill\nIt's got the mall the wooden teeth guy is what I'll never forget\nWhen we were up at the Trump rally in orange county and it was right at the time when they said they were going to switch or that the money to Harriet Tubman has tried to I Want to I'm going to do that and we were doing twenty over there and ah you said what do you think about Harriet Tubman you know being switched on the dollar bill and the guy goes\nWho that is that [laughter] unfair boss\n[laughter] they're carrying Tibet and he's like I Know [laughter] like angry at me like what like what you're making our neighbors [laughter] try to trick me seas so third grade third\nGrade is ice skating never learned about George Washington but there are some gay rights person who jacks never heard of his whole life that his kids' schools spend a ton of time talking about so George Washington never made it appears that history class and\nI'm just going to go on a wild live here and say probably never encountered George Washington in history class because you have you haven't encountered George Washington was off the first president and your first three or four years of school I don't really see why you would then come up\nEventually by so is it is very good likelihood that his kid will never and your kids will never experience or learn anything about George Washington\n[laughter] so our kids don't know history and if you don't have a history of no context on where we live in today and then we also on top of that have this modern day lie that people are good\nSat through\nThe how these two things together store called ignorance and a lot of people are good and then when bad things happened people are shocked\nHow could this be how could this have happened I was I Would have happened hate murder you kidding me I'm shocked every day this stuff doesn't happen more often\n\nAs it always has in history but anyway I digress let's get back to technology apologist sidetracked\nSo the social media is in particular so there's this website called the gab you ever heard of gab dot com never but it's a competitor to Twitter and their claim is that there are all about free speech so you can go and gab dot com and you can say anything\nSo a lot of bad people who've been banned from Twitter it's a lot of white nationalist in particular to this context a lot of white nationalist anti Semite to have been banned for good or I take that back not anti Semite Louis Farrakhan still a tweet he wrote a couple of weeks ago\nSaying that Jews are termites so they posted a video have given a sermon or whatever saying it and then he tweeted in words rode out Jews are termites that's still on Twitter so Farrah Khan anti Semitism totally fine so do\n\nYou guys in the hierarchy the victim hierarchy he's black and Muslim and that's higher than Jews so he gets to do whatever he wants because he's on higher on the victim Eric that's why that works right so so you die Semitism if you're a black Muslim still or whatever that ... you're allowed to\nBe a lot of anti Semitic but anyway uh all these white\nNationalist who got banned from Twitter they went to gab dot com so you're going to hear gab dot com called this a ... it's going to be portrayed as if it didn't exclusively white national most\nWebsite not but it's definitely there Twitter's no saint by the way by\nTwitter there's there's great graphic porn on Twitter there's ISIS accounts on top of their rights so it's all a mess but\nAnyway I keep digressing ah here's my point about technology back in the day if you had hate in your heart towards an entire group of people you were pretty isolated with that\nBut you couldn't communicate that hatred anyone\nReally 'cause your neighbors didn't have that hate but very few people probably felt the way you did\nBut what technology today if you're a white supremacist and there's not one for a hundred miles away where you can still communicate with that guy was a hundred miles away\nSo at the same time social media is made us more connected to people with similar interests which sometimes can be good rioting and you have a similar interest in dogs are sports teams or desire to kill the Jews right to decide what works for are good and bad but it also isolates us\nBecause now all we do is hanging around people on line with similar interests and all those neighborhoods connections are are gone because who needs it back when it was all that there was this that's what you did oh there was\n\nSo we're more connected and more isolated at the same time I I there is a um it's been a net negative it's a bold statement but I really believe it's been a net negative all this technology online stuff I really do\nBecause our brains are not kept pace with the societal change\nAnd the way that you can just just isolate yourself\nOn line\nAnd do you just spiral out of control fast\nAnd here's the thing we do have time to just now talking about the small a there's a New York times article ... months ago I think it called you to the great radicalize there\nAnd I'll give it a shorter the real question is a professor I think she has a UNC she would she was looking up Trump's videos Trump speeches\nAnd YouTube you know the auto play like suggested videos next would suggest more and more extreme like white supremacist Holocaust denial videos so like what is that about so she started a new a new YouTube account\nAnd she started watching Hillary Clinton videos and then you two started recommending a all these like nine eleven truth or videos and and like crazy a communist it's good videos of super far left\nIt was like oh what's it going on so that she started watching videos about vegetarianism\nThey started showing her suggested videos about being an is I'm a little more extreme right she started watching videos about jogging and that led to videos about also\nAll right has them and they started showing her suggested videos\nAbout Venus I'm a little more extreme right she started watching videos about jogging and that led to videos about ultra marathons\nSo ... you to that you do the algorithm keeps\nGoing more extreme it wants it wants to radicalize you in whatever it is it could be a political thing or a diet thing or whatever it doesn't matter just wants to radicalize view because our human\nInstinct ah ease too I'm\nLike I like I Need like what's what's bigger what's better what's more I got up to the states and worked with that appeals to us whether we're going to do it or not it is still appeals there was like what Trump marathon without about I thought it was just it goes deeper and deeper and we just\nUnfortunately go\nFurther and further down the rabbit hole and\nYou two loves the Google that's Google Google loves it because the more time you watch videos\nMan 'cause you're gonna be more appealed to these are these outrageous extreme videos or the more time you're watching the more money they make is all about the money", "show_name": "no_show",
