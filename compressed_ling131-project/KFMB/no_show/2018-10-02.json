who is the pastor skyline church in rancho San Diego of course a bastard or those with us right now Mr ... how are you sir\nI'm doing fine my brother thank you wonderful the doctor a and youth well we were talking earlier about in this era of\nBlurred lines and false accusations and everything's crazy a producer miles you're asks how can to young people date without at all just blowing up and spiraling out of control and the answer we gave is\nIs biblical early and\nI'm sure that only because we need to start looking up for these answers and we need to start looking at a good book for a lot of answers are and I feel like your book\nGives that same advice is that right\nAbsolutely it was it was actually a spawn because the end of twenty sixteen\nAnd a very contentious election as we all know ah I felt like lord of the press on my heart that not merely the Trump Administration but the church of Jesus Christ across America at a really short window of time to address for critical areas racial healing\nImmigration to get the result from a biblical standpoint a renewal a spiritual and change the thinking among millennials and then finally reestablish mode of a proper relationship with Israel\nNow the Trump Administration has done a great you on that last category but the other three categories still hang out there\nVery unresolved in our culture today and we added two more as white as six and not just for and that is we establish the understanding of the Judeo Christian foundation to our country and then finally the last one is left the church started acting like the church\nOkay let's go through some of these um where's a good place to start lifted the Judeo Christian foundation of our country why is that important why does that matter\nWell somebody's belief system is going to be the predominant forcing the culture or it could be paganism and have it could be it could be secularism\nOr it could be Judeo Christian or it could be Islamic are Hindus we all know but unfortunately ideas have consequences and you roll those out in terms of the forms of of of of biblical governance are looked like an actual principles\nAnd from that comes policies and has enormous impact upon communities in the health of communities example example in Nineteen sixty Detroit was probably one of the most desirable cities in the entire world\nFifty years later it looked like a bombed out zone how is that possible and a half century it was just destroyed is very simple principles\nThat from that came policies bad principles and so I Would make the case that God's the one who thought about what people tend to look at the Bible say okay if the Bible covers personal issues it covers family issues covers our church should the government\nKnow God's also part of government he didn't go like oh golly gee I forgot about this government thing in the scriptures lay out specifically\nHow a community and national I should take place and to the extent that will follow biblical governments\nThat that's the same extent will reduce human suffering human pain and poverty and when we violate God's way of governance governing our government in our state governing our our our nation to that same extent human pain is inflicted upon communities and we lose tranquility and these\nAre rude that give us an example do any of the of this government is what the Bible says about that how maybe we stray from the forum where maybe we are doing a bank job and things are going great\nFalling example for example the national debt\nMost people wouldn't think that's gonna they're gonna ... on that but the fact\nIs that the moral biblical theological issue of the national debt actually crossed another number today and and what that means for us is we're as a nation violating a principal now shall not steal thou shall not steal from future generations\nWere guinea ventilate pay a horrific price for that our kids our grandkids certainly will\nAnd lower risk don't

Persians do\nThe same view your family and our country and the faster as some exciting things coming up in a in his life and his ministry that I Want to talk about too but uh one less thing about the book pastor I'm\nCan reach out for a second about millennials are so I Am one and a ... miles is one and Eric is one all of us here are and we we are them and we mock them give us some hope up about millennials [noise]\nWell they are different and the and the book we go through the statistics I won't ... on why they're different what caused him to be different or I should be saying not ban but you know and the millennial be encouraging thing is that there there are some things that they are really\nDoing really well and that one on pro life they're getting on the importance of saving babies in the womb interesting they're the most pro life generation we've had I Wonder why are too they\nThey get it I think because the ... the science the sonogram ... they they were raised on that that is my my my I Would think would be a key point if you get with a millennial and you talk to them through just like you and I just talked just now one on one at let's say capitalism and socialism we talked about a moment ago\nIt's like lights going if you could make it apply to them and say that paycheck you're going to get at the end end of the mock a ... if you wanted to be an end socialism or this person out here didn't work and don't want to work and they want all your money and so I the government will just I'll just take that and give it to them to is it are you okay with that\nOnce they see the personal application ... eyes light up the next ... oh I I'll talk millennials about national debt and the glazed over then I talked about the implications for them to live in a country\nThey can't keep the lights on again next roads that that they can't they can't all the nice thing they enjoy right now that they can't they can't have that anymore oh why I don't want that I was like to hear about the national that's got to be pretty messy or you're in the future if we don't finally addressed that have\nGood news is there a care deeply about the issue of human trafficking and want to help try to stop it more by forty million people\nThat are slaves today more people in slavery today than ever probably in history and and thank God they do care about that issue of the the good news for a guy like neither my shoulder is again he'll focus on relational he wanted it kind of results can be very good you're\nTaking some of the New York or to the United nations to the to Washington DC to Israel to Jerusalem and he gets spent time in boy that there are wonderful time\nSchmidt it's great to get there I'm intrigued by this a sub chapter ah their world the millennials their world is filled with a weak examples what does that mean\nWell one thing they are getting married a whole lot later and that's because so many of their parents are divorced you are so many their friends are on the issue why do you not defend marriage why they're so weak um defending one man one woman marriage because they've seen that so violated\nSo they say well what difference does it make it to women or two men want to get married because after all my mom and dad are marriage didn't last and so they see so many others abuse various institutions we share sacred to us that my generation to some extent or has lost a bit of credibility with them for understandable reasons\nAnd I look at pop culture as well right and then what the message is that the examples of people we left off in pop culture as some sort of model is pretty horrific\nIt is both in Hollywood or sports entertainment et cetera and it's sometimes in the political realm uh the the the models are absolutely one hundred percent in opposition to biblical truth don't bring blessing to their individual lives you know\nA pass or hate that you are or what what's your official I don't want to say leaving skyline church but I hate that you're not going to be here as well as often and you're heading off to the interesting things to tell us what's next for Jim Darla\nThat's correct my time this past year to have a a skyline church in the middle of November and uh a ministry called well versed on going to be following that we we launched four years ago a ministry Washington DC or members of Congress and then it ministry at the United nations so bored\nAnd launching Bible studies in the various departments when we talk about the ...\nThe state department of Energy Department of Interior Department of agriculture H H as a State Department or HUD and so we're launching we have one launched and there were launching a second one we got permission ... we've got launched a permission breath third one\nAnd then one in the Pentagon so we've actually got five different locations in Washington DC currently a Bible studies that are happening and then when you go to the United nations uh this is a place that's known not necessarily known for its view view God it's quite the counter to that\nAnd so we're bringing worded worship in to the secretary it that's the tall buildings and if people know the iconic thirty storey building and to ministry opportunities to people who worked there the bureaucrats who won the United nations\nAnd then we do specialize complications are seminars once called the hammer school society named after the former secretary general of the United nations and it's designed to bring biblical truth or biblical governance for\nThe diplomatic corps or ambassadors as we gather them I'm a congresswoman Michele Bachmann is on our team or their ... and the United nations than we ever pong did this and that is a continuing ... in the in the study of the knock that means all cashed in that\nNot our flag [laughter]\nNot not close so this is the flag so sick of imagined your flag is a rectangle\nHorizontal rectangle right the top third the entire top third of the flag is blue with white stars there's not fifty a nominee or in their mouths maybe cut them up the entire top third the middle third is white and the bottom entire third is read it's kind of like the French flag so yet identical\nWith what was ... mother feels ... so just because it's twenty six dollars\nAnd it doesn't look anything like our flag to Green Bay Packers\nCrowded out and then the MIT [laughter] and we're all supposed to\nBe taught that what is that\nI have no idea the guy that messed up that order [laughter] yeah I I saw that and I thought I thought oh they're trying to go home with the American flag like no no they're very handy [laughter] to the French man Frazier's day is that where they have\nBoth fear that's that's what they're doing there isn't that bizarre\nThat's tricky oh this is on and off on that\n[noise] why would they do that why don't you do the five wow\nThis better not be a thing where you can just like make up your own rebranded flag whenever a vet you what\n[laughter]\nI saw this new thing where Netflix is doing the choose your own adventure thing I saw that new show so partway through the show you can choose your rent oh that's neat loved those books grownup loved him I think it's kinda crazy but it falls in line to it's all about me and what I Want and how I wanted to go right we're\nGoing to err on making a very mice later re giants societal to my yeah wow yeah that silver lining the flag bearer Sarah takes one now nice innovative technology or ... or whatever some interesting says I don't think it has to come and just a\nClick away it was super proved come in and just crushed it on her foot and talk about how all the world's coming to an end out an hour so selfish and we got to get back to Iowa source of those it as ... as well\nJeez Eric brave alright wing or at least for me [laughter] ah this is Shawn Davis back to Kevin Shawn Davis says Cabot all the gang rapist\n[noise] now okay not a gang rape is but a serial rapist so not a serial rapist buttery okay not a rapist blackout drunk oh you're not a blackout drunk put an alcoholic or is that I was a holiday but he drinks beer\nOkay just through ice if somebody wants in the eighties\nThat's where we are now with this ah let's chat about this our local connections to the capital [laughter] saga an anonymous letter\nSaying center Campbell Harris's office saying that Brett Kavanaugh raped me a miles uh when does this accusation added was the top news so this is a big local stories I really I like you know national dog I sit out when a ... so we will the letter was then a couple of weeks ago butter the accuser yeah what uh what's her name by\nThe way a Jane Jane Jane Doe ... is the way you it's\nYeah well we is the way you would spell that but it doesn't really have to name relation to John no relation okay so different to do and just do we know what she does for a living no okay but I guess that doesn't really matter ... or so when she made his accusation couple weeks ago when ... when did this accusation a car when did this act occurs rape ... we don't really we don't know\nWhat you're saying the letter no okay a\nLocation to location where well it's not really about the location Mike because well okay so now we don't know who don't know okay ah\nAny witnesses that she can name anyone any other time or any is there any you know oh yeah that one clear this up the\nRoad no okay do we have a five year now I Want to there's a big story so I think you're missing the point of getting what they call it wants to ... ... what does this make the newspaper oh the front page of quarter page for you to the front page\nThere is a investigation oh my gosh okay well the clearly they're going to a radio yeah and the return address sure go a ...\nThat's the one problem news no return address on a letter oak\nOkay so just to review we have no date it's a classic who what when where your classic you know the five WC you want to get [laughter] I remember\nIn journalism water water who what where when and why journalism today now whenever [laughter] try and find one of them I don't know this is what I've any\nIt doesn't matter who it has to capitalize on what kind of want Josh how you got to do that the what do you live in\nVan\n[laughter] so I ... I maintain that all of this Kavanaugh thing this I'm going to go like Eric deep Web here\nThis is ... I could just went Slater sure I'll play Eric\nYou're on your on your outlive out there's already using [laughter]\nI've got a little bit biased whether I Would say\nThat this is all just a big conspiracy theory by the media to just blow up stories because it just gets advertisers and it gets eyeballs on it so all these things is just the media CNN and MSNBC and Fox News everybody's just in on this\nYeah because here I Am we are were fleeing king we're trying to put them in this prism or in this box of come on guys try to be a journalist or yeah yeah and we're like de bumping what they're doing and again like you know we're not even playing that game yeah and again I can\nSee it from their perspective which is when we don't care what is trying to make money what's your least yeah okay yeah like it's probably not the best thing but All right [laughter] yeah okay with that but I think the problem with that is then they come back\nWith this whole like all wars are for the state or the fourth or it'll be the world anymore so important to the dry dock and start the country and you can't attack us and it's like whoa you guys have never been more hack jobs and you have these last two weeks like a\nPiece of like what is this UT you you you can't what is is\nThere's nothing here now let me let's go back or a real quick let me tell why they're doing this or why the media's pushing that's why the Dems are gonna take it is because now there's a sixth accuser right all the accusers are piling up and no one who who would\nParents that are trumpet that would ever take any consideration to who these accusers or west or even accusing her what their names are where they used to actually took place or any information whatsoever doesn't matter because we're just piling about ... so it all sixth accuser where there's smoke there's fire you know uh and then also they're going to say oh well the FBI didn't investigate this story\nRight at the FBI only investigated the first three women they didn't investigate this person in oceanside we got it I have a longer investigation\nThat's what that is so that's why we have the media pushing this total ... story which could not be less of a story you like ... the only way you can be less is if this person wrote a letter to Capitol Harris saying someone did something to me\nI don't know where when who won or lost or at least this I use that as a lot so there's like\nA shred of something this but it's pretty darn close to literally nothing and I\nGuarantee you here's the thing I guarantee you this UT article will be the most viewed this way\nYeah you're right yeah because it's it's sadly land to the ... yeah you're right yep I'm so here's here's the worst part of this whole thing the dams have taken advantage of of a doctor for\nOne is ... ... men and on and so ... is Dianne Feinstein handled letter the FBI or when she first got it wouldn't have had to hope this entire spectacle I could have all been investigated anonymously\nIt's the third woman Julie sweating ... who's most disturbing she has a mentally ill person a and a nod he's taken advantage of her and the media is taking advantage of her or for their own ... again and then once cabin I'll get in office they are going to kick all these women to the curb like\nDead me that they don't they want they don't care about 'em at all or do we have time to read this letter here\nI don't have time it's four pages I didn't think was four page Wow Let me just gonna with that out of this uh this is the letter sent to the judicial committee and released by the traditionally ah my name is Dennis cat or\nI'm a former weeknight meteorologist protests seven in Washington DC won an Emmy in Nineteen eighty five [noise]\nHe goes on and says I'm not proud of his ... uh I first met Julie sweating in Nineteen Ninety three at a Washington DC bar near Washington Circle I was at a going away party for ... I left the party to go to a bar to buy a soda I haven't drunk alcohol since my Eighteenth birthday I sat alone at the end of my bar at the end of the bar Julie approach me she was alone quite beautiful well dressed no drinking and\nConsequently my initial thought was she might be\nA high end call girl because at the time I wait three hundred fifty pounds what with someone like me like her mom with me\nOr something he goes on how they talk for a long time and but by and then she started talking about a year ago\nWe never had sex despite the fact that she was very sexually aggressive with me\nEr during a conversation about sexual preferences things got more derailed with Julie told me that she liked to have sex and more than one guy that time in fact sometimes with several at one time she want to know if that would be okay in our relationship she responded that she first try sex and multiple gods while at high school and still like to from time to time but the Bob by by goes on and says he didn't do anything 'cause he's married for\nA\nI decided to run for Congress in Maryland eighth district in Nineteen Ninety six as a Democrat I thought Julie could out with my primary campaign because she had a great personality great smile good luck", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "San Diego", "day": "02"}
