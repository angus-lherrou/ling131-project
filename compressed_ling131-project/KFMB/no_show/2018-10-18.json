I still get a new human let's talk about new into a\nTwenty percent of California's point no maybe that's yeah that's it or not ... oh it's okay for not forced to be known that he does yeah yeah yeah which is the progressive the dream a Eric what are you oh Eric doesn't vote\n'em after San Francisco [laughter] uh\nIt's very walk right up to the both my all like a hero like a real hero bucket American patriot\nWe all should a voting by mail she'd be reserved for a very small number of people who physically can't leave the house to vote that's it maybe\nPoint five percent of the population should be voting by mail not Seventy five percent of the population are way off\nAnd then service members\nWho live in other states are countries that that should be voting by mail it should not be the normal thing and our state and our city in particular San Diego's leading the way in moving to only mail in ballots so there will be no more voting in person you only male a vote by mail\n... and it's a very very bad idea here's one reason why it's a very bad idea it's called ballot harvesting so this is David ... this is a um a\nA doorbell in northern California you know these ring the doorbell ... company ring yeah like um the camera yeah so your video and yet as addicts video of it and you probably have your eye pad inside as you get the exact who's at the door and it also records\nSo kind of a good thing I mean if they if you say I think it's a good thing right so a door knock her knocked on this lady's door and uh she recorded the conversation so here's part of it\n[noise]\n[noise]\nBut only tell me about it\n[noise] it was like oh I didn't get a lot of that [laughter]\n[noise] okay [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\n\nThat and doing something but you can't hear you can't hear that was in your father you know you can't hear the woman behind the door but um so this is called ballot harvesting that there is just so much opportunity for corruption here\nSo we just reading off the top of the old don't be zero John that we can just rattle off and brainstorm a couple of ways that this could be the system can be corrupted um let's say in this exchange or the this woman said oh I'm here to collect your ballot\nMy ... what's that still weird [laughter] uh let's say there's voter this woman uh alludes to the fact that she's not voting for the Democratic candidate\nFor him that he was telling me that I don't want to vote for a you know actually I don't really like Devin Nunes [laughter]\nOther woman says okay continue voting and I'll just take about ...\n... throws it in the trash yeah there you go ... ton than ... a\nNoticing this woman who knocked on the door asked for her ballot noticed she said hey is brandy there she is a registered independent\nSo baby swing vote based on the husband is the Democrat\nBut she didn't say hey is is Dan there today is brandy there she asked for the independence\nBallot now because we've talked a lot going back to Ted Cruz's campaign and point sixteen uh and and uh how campaigns can use micro data from your Facebook account and many other different things to determine how you're likely to vote right so\nLet's say this group and you've done this with I'm In DC you went through your house to talk about this right so is this within the realm of possibility under ... candidates\nA nose a brand new house yep a knows that she's registered independent looks at her Facebook posts sees\nThat she's like she likes John Cox for governor sucks John Cox um oh hey brandy [noise] just here just a service just pick it up your ballot\nJust picking up your ballot for you're just gonna mail is ... just make a germ does make a show about getting mailed out that's all\nThose right in the trash yeah I mean why would that not\nA hundred percent yeah yeah I mean it could even go less than John Cox it could be have I saw that you liked the gun post or you get the enter a magazine\nA yeah we can come and get it that's no problem or I I thought the other way when you were describing this is and and this was a lot of people right now because you look at the polls and a lot of people are no decisions or don't know uh and so someone comes and says yeah well I'm not done filling it out oh I'll help you yep oh ... or\nSo that's a little more this is another ... ballot harvesting then there's something called granny farming [laughter] three names granny farming so granting farming is ... it was a while ago you wouldn't ... I don't think people do this right now you\nWalk pulled ... your Blue Note ... [laughter]\nNot like gardening oh there's voter any voter farming ... Grande voter so you go door to door and you offered to help or older folks season to citizens\nOh nice to help with their ah filling out\nTheir voter registration for ... a nice a nice young man came helped me with my voter registration form a yeah the nice lady sign it and then you leave the house and you go and you put on a different address you put your address and you have all\nThe ballots sent to your house has been going on for a while now are so then the older folks go to vote and gosh golly\nWill occurs someone's already voted for a ... looks\nLike you've already voted man [laughter] my dad had\nThat happen to really Chicago yeah like oh ... oh no\nThat sounds count all the the [laughter] so this is all fraud that would not happen if people\nVoted normally in person as it should be a last we are moving further and further to vote by mail and then it wasn't it was it\nDidn't the county or did we ought to do it ... it was it wasn't in the mayor's race wasn't it after Filner wasn't in the only mail in ballot\nYeah could have been saved to save money yeah yeah and it doesn't save money by the way 'cause you got to pay for postage and everything and that which is just going up in up across the same as out more money to do but they don't you think do you think at some point in her life it will be by Internet man that didn't forget about that right the only way I could see\nAt the same if not more money to do when you think do you think at some point in our life it will be by Internet man that didn't forget about that right the only way I could see it not happening is\nA Republican candidate winning in Russia being blamed the day and they're like oh no we can't do anything different different looks old the first time to do an online ballot or Republican crushes [laughter] and then they stopped because of our allow that again right\nSo bottom line here because we can't stop the ... or don't let anyone else be a part of the process so you don't trust\nSo and then\nMail in your ballot don't give it to someone to mail for a few that don't do that ... or drop it off and your precinct on election day or just go and vote in person like who Eric\nBloodshed American Patriot Act you out of seven sixty ... money under seven sixty five thirty six to Jeff grey oh this is funny this morning or my wife said hey we need to make a a\nDentist appointment singer I Would do when it into that [noise] I said ah do you mind calling setting it up\nShe said yeah no problem with the number and I said I forget and I go you go out and she was I'll look it up she goes\nJeff gray with a ... right\nThat's exactly right and then you always I here in my head bbs [laughter] deaf great when the day\nThe last decade or\nSo we just need to get all these Clinton that's all and you know what\nOh you know what I see because we were just ... I mean what we were up there and we are getting innocent pretty intimate details when the president earlier definitely on air but very much\nUh we're getting real you know we're getting real so you know what\nThinking about maybe a teeth whitening getting real getting real you wonder why because I tutored they're just they're just that one I don't think this is all about that too I I didn't know you could have an infected by on that side of the fat it's not so bad I share\nThe yellow while it is Halloween [laughter] so I think I don't know if you can get one to light and I don't know if that's the thing\nI've been doing this why why why in the back [laughter]\nI just smiled virtual consult is something that might be for you so you get to avoid a trip\nTo the office or you just go to the website Jeff gray with an A.

[laughter] like what what a great example tall colleges that your waist imagine you're a professor\nHere professor ... ... oh what do you do for a living on the on the ... yeah I mean ... ... oh wow wow this guy and then you go to work at your you find that agrees the medical field and you find out that the court to teach the students call it rocks for [laughter]\nAnd he doesn't care yeah\nHe doesn't care generally getting paid ... that whatever whatever I years you get a day I don't care so by say this is science hill was geographically\nIsolated but it was also ideologically isolated right so you had the rest of the campus or with the humidity is we're just completely off the reservation but at least you could count on the science hill folks to maintain objective truth there up there doing their own sciency thing and\nNot any more to do this is a a recent National Science foundation grant says the federal government NSF grant\nRugged I can never process where\nMerit to crafts so it was like meritocracy like merit merit to craft\nThe role of overt bias and the merits of chronic ideology\nAnd Trump supporters opposition to social justice efforts the national Science Foundation grant right there for that paper that makes sense ah this is a chemistry course at\nBerkeley chemistry course\nGoal of course is to quote disrupt the radicalized engendered construct of scientific brilliance which the\nOf course is to quote disrupt the radicalized engendered construct of scientific brilliance which defines good science as getting all the right answers\n...\nMiles here are certainly a member of the white male patriarchy sure you probably went around your whole life I was thinking that good science means and getting the right answer yes that's what I was always achieving today\nSaid there's a meritocracy right Myles fair I'm Talking to your half Hispanics idea yeah yeah here's this white guy over here thinking that engineering is all about during the math right in gray they will send you off [laughter] you believe that his essay\nUnbelievable wow it's about time we deconstructed this concept\nHe probably wants to be in the day was do you ... you know\nI Love a static half of Eric [laughter]\nGet you had your love me\nDevoted guides life\nAre voter got good guys [laughter] nice where do you think of that Hispanic half of Eric that get [laughter]\nA saying last saw about ... so for this chemistry course at Berkley it's all about I thought about being good at science it's about believing that you're good at science\nBecause that's what happens when the academic goal is self esteem\nAnd not truth so\nMany ah aren't public arts so we already did our arts and architecture segment\nFor the quarter I Do one quarter oh we gotta wait a little while but uh\nI feel like we still talk about this little mini controversy on public art in San Diego so most of the public are in San Diego it's pretty ugly the new stuff's off all\nThe old stuff's pretty good the sculptures above ballpark obviously are beautiful or in the front of the county building downtown there's this big statue of a woman carrying a juggle water like that's a nice beautiful statue um outside of the Wells Fargo building is a big classic fountain with two people\nLaying there like like laying on the table and waters poring over the side of the compound in right so it's really not so there's some things are great uh\nThat's all the old stuff though those things are all built in my thirties but the new ones are total trash there's one in the Embarcadero called the ... tree ... miles off the phone talking to Google the serpent tree you don't trust my Googling un\nEric Still types and you get a Google yeah he goes to show that Google's ethical and then says hey Google\nCan I see a picture please of the ... tree that Mike is talking about how to say please you censor your marriage still die [laughter]\nOtherwise you know the the search never comes out right is what I find that if you're polite to undergo yeah you've got to ask it nicely ... tree San Diego ... and then are you telling me if this thing is a middle schoolers art project or a million dollar sculpture huh oh\nSerpent tree and San Diego oh that's kind of interesting\nYou're going to sink tree [laughter] I wouldn't call this snake tree [laughter] for okay you're OK with us this is I Would call it abstract ... certainly still [laughter] a million bucks\nI actually like\n\nYeah it's the thing about it is it's really unique box yeah sure\nThat's what I say about jak started projects when he scribbled on the paper the great job jak really unique\nPretty much stopping this thing\nOkay that's just one this one has a million bucks\nSo here's why I bring it up in the city is building a new water treatment plant in North park [noise] and apparently there's a state law that says every public project like this has to have public art on the property and\nTwo percent of the cost of the project has to be spent on public art that truth that under President Trump say long really so the project cause you know ... million dollars two percent of that has to be wow heart\nSo\nOn site who's at for it for this guy at UCLA who makes absolute nonsense modern art\nAnd charges a million bucks paid yeah ... business absolutely it could be here let me see I said oh is that you know I sent you a different one month\nSo wait a second so\nIf I'm a private investor ... and I want to develop the piece of land and I'd be able to say building of some sort of right and\nI have to allocate a certain ... ah public projects like our water it's like when the city built the water treatment plant\nOkay now not private development\nThat was kind of my question I was wondering if it was going to somehow they were going to swindle\nLike the private citizen owner of the land you know so it's city of taxpayer money\nNot private developer money\nJust goes through a few more hands but you're still swindled ... oh yeah oh yeah oh definitely so I don't know how to present yourself and\nSo this new a water treatment plant a million bucks is going to this artist at UCLA\nOr miles you can grew him and his name's Christian Mohler M. O. E. L. L. E. R.\nSo you can see the nonsense that he builds all over the world a\n... he's the guy so I see these ... private buildings are private office buildings and they put a big big buildings and they put in their big lobbies these giant\nRandom colorful steel shapes his things hideous like why why did they just why do they do steel random bend steel that's painted yellow in red and we're supposed to be like oh\nIt's beautiful to look at that are looking at all it's a random basis steel shaped like a ... what is that why do we think that's good I don't get hurt either because I went to do\nThis you don't get this because\nI don't even I don't get this but then I'll go to like Aaron brothers and I'll see something and it looks really cool and it's like twenty bucks I'm like wow that's really cool go to Aaron prices that's right yeah\nThat's really nice this is not good so this guy Christian Miller scams taxpayers' money by making stupid random sculptures he decided to build outside of the water treatment center a giant straw\n... two giant straws actually not plastic\nOne step ahead of me bro there's two straws\nStraight up and then another straw and they're like that's why straws to like red strikes with like a classic straw poll cats one straight up and then another one like wraps around it as it goes up to get through strong suit\nWhite straws to like red strikes with like a classic straw poll cats one straight up and then another one like wraps around it\nAs it goes up to get through straw sticking that right ridiculous ... so I look at it as I say this is the dumbest thing I've ever seen\nWhat an idiot who what what what what how we'd come on\nBut people are outraged not because it's stupid and agreeing dumb they're always because of their kid on it\nEncourages you supply [laughter] upset because it encourages and celebrates steroid use [laughter] trying to cut down on that you know city they're banning you might as well as the giants called job a crack pipe\n[laughter] or John McCain forty seven year what a way that's why people are outraged\nSo I'm thinking what are the ones that are commissioned thinking building up a million dollar plastic straw", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "San Diego", "day": "18"}
