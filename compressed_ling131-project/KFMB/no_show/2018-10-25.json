and then\nThere was a fire at a a St Louis congressman's office he was a democratic congressman he blamed the Tea Party turns out as a super far left progressive who actually worked for that congressman's reelection campaign and was upset for getting fired\n\nSo it wasn't the Tea Party at all quite the opposite so uh Michelle mocking compiled all these uh these are from two thousand nine to two thousand ten [laughter] uh the biggest one of all was congresswoman Gabby Giffords\nRemember was shot at the or the grocery store shovel event at a grocery store and the guy came up in ... ah and immediately the media blamed Sarah Palin\nAnd not only back then but the New York times a couple of months ago blamed pale and again for that attack even though that's been thoroughly debunked the shooter was no way inspired by Sarah Palin at all to kill Gabby Giffords\n\nSo here's this I I don't know do they give you a dozen or so from a short time period of attacks arson murders that were\nAll blamed on conservatives all blamed Republicans all blamed the Tea Party at the time and not only were they not Tea Party related\nCompletely the opposite\nLike you could you can't get more opposite than all Republican burnt down this democratic congressman golf as oh it was a Republican it was someone further to the left then the congressman\nOh you can't you can't get more opposite than these\nNow take all those in because you're still getting the same thing today you get these bombs and none of them have gone off with the weird but\nTake all these sorts\nRather than the New York times on Tuesday I'm not kidding about this they had five novelist do you guys do where I'm going with us got five novelists\nEach write a little short story very short couple paragraphs or have you heard this is on the other guys get a here's the headline in New York Times on Tuesday five novelists imagine Trump's next chapter okay interesting interesting premise focus\nSo one of the authors wrote a short story of a a guy in the secret service who is actually a Russian spy okay\nYou're ready to start getting we're trying to imagine like what's the next chapter of Trump's presidents are going to be sure\nSo there's a guy and and the secret service this person made up a who's a Russian spy deep cover for decades wow this is homeland desk but aren't very right exactly so he he finally he was it was time\n[laughter] he got next to the president and I'm going to quote this is this is president the New York on the Russian waited until the day he and the president or a few steps past before he drew his gun\nHe cited on the center of the president's back and squeeze the trigger guy now\nThe New York times that I had that line and it's all about President Trump's assistant vague about this and it has a picture of President Trump underneath the big headline that cartoon picture of president jobs they're all talking about President Trump's ear\nThat ah the gun miss fired\n[noise] is literally is homeland okay [laughter] I remember the first season the the guys and right next to the president he was in the middle east and the ... season was so unbelievable dumped so so far I'm telling you this is a movie\nThe secret service agent at the president's shoulder heard the click spawn into\nA crouch the register the scene instantly strong his own weapons with a razor edge reflects is\nThe Russian tasted failure he closed his eyes and waited to pay the cost but it did not come he opened his eyes\nAnd the secret service agents did before him presenting his glock here the agent said politely use mine [laughter]\n[noise] the New York times published that on Tuesday\n\nA fantasy story of a Russian spy assassinating President Trump but his gun didn't go off to the American Secret Service agent told the ... gave the Russian guy his gun and said here use mine\nI don't know if if I get coast speaking or I just know he will be there as well\nA year that said I said person or yeah or nothing to do something no I\nThink a little broader I don't want to do one of the hand to be kind of give it away\nDoesn't yeah sort of talk right no higher than ... ... brown so\nI'll give you the ... was a politician former politician\nRoger had Chicago [laughter] of eels mayor\nNow the new ... no not not the one before Sanders no no no it's a Arnold Schwarzenegger okay [laughter]\nOkay\nUh do you remember [laughter]\nGosh Arnold stock has really dropped in our eyes were usually that's Governor Schwarzenegger guy who's heard everything he's gone [laughter] Terminator eight I was going to be on Fox dive and forget it was about Schwarzenegger came up\nAre we going to come up and uh I was going to go ... go out and get Schwarzenegger\nBurlap not the the murder because what's his name friend who is this the top Democrat in the Setting Sun murder to guide vacated as the as you and ... anyway that was the very last thing and all that's right that's right very last thing you did an office my mom like\nStill it was like an echo of court fires that's how you know Arnold Schwarzenegger at\nUm\n[noise] so do you remember when we did Canada Day how can you forget it we [laughter] we had a woman called and she was running for something something weird something small something was it the woman who was running for two no no no this was a call\nYou know she said something about oh well we need to compete against as the genie and miles is all in 'cause ...\nOh yeah for for example ... so [laughter] I didn't know\nThat was the source of the ... it's not actually but I I like throwing that phrase that it goes it's true\nBecause it's true [laughter]\nThat's funny or\n... as soon as she said community choice energy I threw a flag on the field as it hold on that sounds weird what's what is that what's that what's community choice energy mean and then she use all these free marketing the sounding words November\n\nAnd believe that's the as soon as she said that there was a noticeable expediting of the interview\nFrom I ... yeah I Know that you'd be like trying to get her off\nYeah I kind of noticed you or you would have gotten done at ... I I think there was a time ... I remember a time gap or get a [laughter] but I Would actually I just thought you were getting to explain this community choice energy because I think it's the exact opposite of what they're trying to portray it as right\nAnd I think that's what this Kevin partner thing is community choice energy so when I when I heard\nI think what do they want you to think if we're going to have another free market competitor against as the genie but it's not going to be a free market competitor it's going to be a government run competitor\nAnd I'll tell you this if there's anything worse than a government protected energy company\nIt's a government run energy company you want to show you want to get something more apt or whatever then ... then you ... you just have this city run it\n\nSo it's the opposite of what I was originally excited this would mean right it'd be great if you had an option just between as to Jeanie and another private energy company you know and they're going to pitch it that way like now you have a choice community choice\nOn no [laughter] no no no no I got a lot more questions but I don't trust it as far as I can throw a and he lost the Saddam and miles\nAnd I just it's one of these classic like it's the idea's good but obviously it's\nNot going to work [laughter] and they tell me how that affects the other guy\nUm last thing on the bombs uh this is New York times Mrs Clinton Mr Obama Mr Soros CNN have all figured prominently in conservative political attacks\nMany of which have been led by President Trump is often referred to major news organizations that quote the enemy of the people and it's had a particular animus for CNN nice of two things on those two side as I understand using the word attack\nIn normal conversation or in normal times normal circumstances I and using that word is a synonym for criticize much so I read the other day I attacked\nMeasured G and as the as the U.S why didn't attack them\nBut I criticized measure gee I'm against the measure Gees I criticize right but I understand if you're being a little lazy with your words whatever calling in your eye tack to this person I attack that person but you should not use the word attack\nAs the New York times did with a conservative political attacks you should not use that word when you're writing an article about pipe bombs\nBecause this creates a perception that the Clintons and the Obamas and George Soros\nAre frequent recipients of pipe bombs and other physical actual attacks like literal attacks not verbal criticism that makes sense\nBecause the truth is the Clintons and the Obamas have not been the victims of conservative attacks they've been the victim of conservative criticism but when you're writing off pipe\nBombs you got to be a little more careful with your words there but we know what the New York times is trying to do also Trump's minor aside did not call news organizations the enemy of the people he called fake news the enemy of the American people which is absolutely true\nBut what I'm Talking more about that [noise] um\nNo I made I wanted to ... I made no comment on what this is who is behind is actually I'm not saying it's a Democrat staging it to make Republicans look bad I have no idea\nBut it's interesting that was the hero evidence either way but I'll give me that this is talk of the bus pro Trump pundits claim without evidence that mailed explosives\nAre false flag meaning from a Democrat to make Republicans look that right so ... a pro Trump pundits acclaim without evidence that males explosives are false like\nSure but you often to boast\nYou pro left pundits you can't then also claimed without evidence that the mailed explosives aren't attacked by Trump's supporters\n[noise] the point is there's no evidence either way\n\nSo chill out for a minute until we find out what's going on here if we find out whatever's going on here I mean it will it it will be known there's no doubt that the authorities will figure out what's happening but\nI say if we ever know as in the media bury the narrative and just move on to the next thing right uh because again that just well sure many examples in this hour but I ... noon we talked about\nUm there's a pipe bomb sent to the governor of Texas a Republican in twenty sixteen and a woman sent it and the woman was upset\nThat her ex husband wasn't sending her enough spousal support money\n\n... it was like well why did you send a bomb to end the bomb would have gone off but the governor open up the package from the other side of the box the wrong side\nHave you ever done it before by the way you don't put it on the bottom of the box you know like ten seconds then you got the wrong side in the news from Marty in it you're done it with a new car in the old school milk cartons according to its cardboard\n... I got the wrong you know when you got an folded back like wrong side\nBut you're already this far and you gotta gotta commit anyway it's a good thing that Governor went on the opening up the wrong way\nThe ones would have blown up anyway so I bring this up again 'cause ah she also send a bomb to President Obama which anyone interested in sending about a pipe bomb to the president the president's doesn't open his own males\nDo you think that's what these crazy people think didn't really think the president is going to open up random packages that he gets in the mail from random people go through a screening facility at a military before base before it gets anywhere near the president\nWould also imagine\nHe doesn't get any male\nEven like once it gets yeah I Would imagine he's got people that take care of all of it yeah I mean what what do you\nGet I think Obama ... wrote he wrote like once a week or once a day I think maybe once a week\nA couple of letters to people like the random people who would write him a note\nRoad he felt like once a week or once a day I think maybe once a week she wrote a couple of letters to people are getting the random people who would write him a note a nice genuine ... not a pipe bomb\nSewn write them into those two little kids you know and I think a couple a day or a couple of weeks he would write him back a little thing that the ... the notion that you think it's just going to\nSlip saying well I got\nYeah it was\nDon't like give me a break I but I don't know I Wonder if there are other that famous\nSo she sent this pipe bomb to the governor of Texas and the President Obama and they were able to link the two packages together because they each package had a piece of her or a strand of cat hair\nThat\nPackage had a random stray piece of cat hair on it and they were able to link those two together somehow and then looking back to her so I bring that up because the authorities will determine who did this question is will the media\nUm tell us about it and tell us who did it", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "25"}
