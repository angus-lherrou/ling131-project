sidelines of American Life as Andrew yeah real Andrew how are you today sir good how are you did I pronounce your name right at the euro it is perfect oh\nGod you hear so give us the broad scope of the problem right because we're living in a world where\nMajor focus on women and women's rights and lack of female opportunities et cetera et cetera so people don't even don't even have a place in their brain for men less on the sidelines so give us some examples in and the scope of this\nRight up the prompt on really has many components to it uh in my book I've really explore by millions of American man aren't doing well in various overlapping ways and the work world or labor market in terms of health\nRelationships marriage their identity is man which gets to your issues about

I mean we'll\nJust [noise]\nI Can't even imagine how did you keep on you because for ... I've ever seen a picture of it have you did you could imagine\nSure her job and so that's part of the\nThe deal with that so different from cups ed cartons coolers containers blah blah blah everything gets more expensive we talked to a business owner or a couple of weeks ago about paper straws and he said it would cost something like something like twenty maybe even thirty I don't think thirty twenty thousand dollars\nFor more it's more a year for his paper paper straws over the plastic ones\nUp to what to say about fish\nSo that's like an employee right and twenty grand a disguise restaurant um maybe two part timers or whatever\n... someone business owner quoted as your duty article says uh the other containers whatever other material or four times\nAs expensive as the ... who would just go up\nTo the people who throw it in the ocean like who I I don't know how many ... from I've ever used I don't think any of its ever ended up in the ocean why is it out of the ocean why do people Styrofoam at of the ... what are they say it does require that are who go there\nI like I don't understand not throwing things away and the first place that doesn't make any sense to me I don't want to like throw something on the ground who does that\nYeah [laughter] that's the problem but if the ruined it for the rest of us would have to run for the small business owner 'cause you get a couple of slugs who are throwing their trash on the ground\n\nI was driving to the other day and someone's out of the back of their crop pickup truck by came on and expect to cover or whatever came up and there was just [laughter] everyone forever\nAnd all over the highway like trade that's more garbage that is a line that will\nEnd up in the environment this one guy with the victims of of\nWhat a waste I'm quick I mean waste of time is what I mean the city council wasting their time and money on banning ...\nThere were any other people's money not there [laughter] that's a good point thank you very very very important distinction that ah it will never end to always be something else to ban as we move on even the the surf riders quoted a bunch of ... we had one of the guys from the surf right in front of ... years ago when they were banning\nSomething I forget where they're banning\nBags ... and he said oh well it's just the beginning cycle indeed it is so after I told him that plastic bag make up the tiniest he like killing in the ... minute ago if all the garbage in the ocean was a football field this will be a postage stamp\nThey said well it's just the beginning pull right has been bags it's been straws now Styrofoam sooner balloon right my prediction blue and I would always be something as these people can't stop because it's what they do with how they feel important a figure\nI'm so every boy had four characteristics and they need to be deliberately purposely transformed into a man\nThe king the warrior the magician lover each of them has their own characteristics to the king I think is the one that applies most here when it comes to the checked out man but to the king protects provides maintains order if there's\nChaos to king brings peace the king inspires the king cause people to more he blesses the lives of others and the king leaves a legacy to this is what I mean by properly defined vascular like\nThis is how we should raising our boys like these are the things that men do or at least is one aspect of being a man you protect you provide you maintain order you bring peace to inspire you bless the lives of you create a legacy right this is what it means to be a man if all boys not properly mentored\nThen he drew will not become this you will become either the tyrant which would be like the me to write\nFor a weakling right and that sort of we are talking about here with the checked out man\nAnd a major problem with our culture today is we don't actively turned boys and the men and when we don't intentionally turn boys into kings don't be surprised when we have a culture full of tyrants and weak links\nOr ... what was going there then well are you are\nAssigned to stay in the back [laughter] not yeah that's what they were sort of code they keep it typically a so let's give it an error serious as we kicked off the show talking about as the as the west and Beethoven Rourke that guy run it protects a son in Texas against smokers\nAnd how as the U.S has only winning in the polls because of their name their brand recognition that this little enough this measure doesn't than it has nothing you know there's no specific solve anything um it's a zero sum total nothing's out a\nAnd the federal Rourke he's only doing even losing my time but he's only or something or because of his name but though\nA and there's a rather Vanity Fair article talking about how he is low name recognition among Hispanics in taxes we really need to turn out in order for him to possibly went and read this article\nFrom ... months ago about how he almost lost the primary to someone\nNamed sema Hernandez do just because of the name\nRight everyone's all the all the Spanish going on over the span of person and they said over ... campaign advisers wanted to go to our span of districts so yeah a bit to work and they were ... who's O'Rourke ate all Rourke\nO'Rourke\nBut they call the ... they tried to put like in like a thing on the end like it's like hey man\nWhat does that he's a tally in [laughter] the tower and work\nSo they're like oh that ... that do better so we just so now they just say that do that do better to try to appeal to Hispanic\nVoters a as if he's instead of ... names of Robert ... book [noise]\nOkay what's interesting about that though is it Ted Cruz yes [laughter] yeah [laughter] I didn't get to know credit\nMost he needs to start saying it like that [laughter] no credit for being Hispanic but Robert O'Rourke guys\nSay they were tired of this whole this whole identity politics stuff is total garbage and the good news about Elizabeth Warren is I think this is now done because\nShe's Native American then there was no anything sure sure their shoes that American than\nWe're all everything and nothing which is the truth anyway right but now we finally put the stuff that I think wants to ... so a little bit more took a DNA test and\nI Love miles and you're so right because you kind of came you kind of looked at this from a different you came out from under what a\nWhat you saw was people celebrating like her side celebrate like soldier a limited Twitter she's still number one trending a Elizabeth Warren releases DNA tests showing she's Native American soldiers I told them that\n... percent I'm a Native Americans as I was at Harvard and I was the first woman of color\nOn the Harvard staff\nAnd you're like oh that's kind of embarrassing for president so that's what I thought sure but it was on her grandma's a turkey\nRight that would be shut off I was like wow really embarrassed so stick her DNA test says possibly between six and ten generations back there might be some Native American ancestry so that makes her somewhere between one thirty second to Native American and one one thousand twenty fourth\nSaid America which is zero point zero nine were not even out of ten percentage later American as she was like ...\n... total in American air ... got it\nUp [laughter] [noise] so actually does bring it back to back into her greatest amount of DNA is sort of central and South America\nRight which might make a little bit more and more Hispanic then Beto O'Rourke oh\nHow 'bout them apples somebody's got it like some a conservative like like the Republican Party has to get an operative who can just break down all the people's DNA and just totally jumble at like Joe Biden's Mexican and like it was\nA right to make it as a ... just turning the absurdity out of exactly exactly so here's my favorite part is when I was before he came back so people are trying to defend her oh so this is the um\nPulled over and this is a chair of the Cherokee tribe the Cherokee Nation [laughter] released a statement because why not right [laughter]\nA DNA test of the year is useless to determine tribal citizenship current DNA test you not even distinguish whether a person's ancestry weren't digits to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship about DNA test can be used to Germany to German lineage is not evidence for tribal affiliation uh here this is the ... uh using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation\nEven vaguely is inappropriate or wrong it makes a mockery of DNA tests and it's legitimate uses lawsuit does honoring legitimate tribal governments on their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and was heritage has proven\nSenator Warren is undermining tribal interests and our continued claims of tribal heritage that right so now people are saying well all she never claimed to be of a tribe\nRight is their tribe she's just as a native Americas you'd ever since she was part of a tribe [laughter] someone posted photos of this Israel who have clips to her talking about turkey and how her grandma used to say you can't marry this person you're a Cherokee he's a whatever right\nThis is my favorite part Elizabeth Warren submitted multiple ... recipes to an Indian cookbook the cookbooks name was powwow chow\nAnd signed her name Elizabeth Warren dashed Cherokee a [laughter] time she's submitted a recipe for again this Mexican oatmeal\nSoup to an Indian cookbook called powwow child\nWhat are we doing what what is this what kinds of there would be in a in a no sane world right she would be off the president should trail like John forte right outlawed yeah you're you're on the ... the first woman of color to be a Harvard professor and you're one one thousand and twenty fourth\n... what you say you are come on that's insane\nSo if anything this DNA test proof she's not Native American but the left is going to continue to spit lights you know maybe that she's ... she would release\nThis as if it's a great victory now let's bring it to something else to our future president is it a little bit of trouble\n[noise] [noise] oh\n[noise]\n[noise] I don't like to see this will have cars for my prediction comes true we can't be royals and any controversy I'm\nSure they have a no presidential candidate no no no no of course I'm Talking about\n... ... who\n... the rock Johnson sure\nWhat's going on I well he's playing John Henry and a new movie because you know the rock has to fill a quota fifty two movies the year I don't know if you guys know that he's the one movie a week\nSure now sometimes you can't release one movie a week do you end up getting like two or three weeks we kinda catches up\nAnd they all have to essentially be the same oh yeah the world's heading he's the guy who giant monkey ... telling everyone yeah that's so John Henry is a you know the the old folk tales Ryan so he's a black steel driver who asked to build the train tracks\nFaster than the steam powered machine that's coming in and going to get everyone out of a job right so he does like I'll beat the machinery work so hard that he died but he saved the jobs for all the townspeople right All right so it's nice little story\nI don't know how they're going to make a movie out of it but the rock and do anything or\nEven be president so ah the rock during the rock Johnson his dad as black his mom is ... and there's a fake Twitter controversy because he's not\nBlack enough to play\nJohn Henry so just ... if you're falling home Dwayne Johnson half black not black enough Elizabeth Warren one one thousand and twenty fourth Native American\n\nGood enough for me sounds great pay off\nSome walk out to the during one of the rally\nCan you paint with other causes\nA hike in the second one girl hey I'm an advocate it down and then you'll never know\nI was looking at are going to be a white man thinks he owns whatever piece of land he lands on [laughter]\nI think you know you you know what he thinks the earth is just a bad thing that you can claim only half somebody believes that my field or half a me as a process [laughter] yeah that's OK Now let's let you get example of how this is actually pretty serious thing um [noise] well the ... the reason I bring\nThis up again because we got to cut it out with all the skin color nonsense does it uh it's it's got to just stop to stop it right the left always complains about our such a divided NATION What's the greatest dividing thing of them all\nSingle but it's so stupid and not only dividing based on skin color but self segregating everyone based on skin color are they going to rock camp played this this fictional character because you're not black and I was like what what is this sort of give you a series example\nUh there was a Somali refugee you're not going to destroy ... what did you get this ... did you do you get two Thirteen to twenty six did you read my mind to get what you thought you were ... yeah so what are we talking about ... Thirteen seconds long nine Ninety nine Twenty one uh yeah so when the opposite way he told me to you for that gives them a citizen ... this is in England\n...
