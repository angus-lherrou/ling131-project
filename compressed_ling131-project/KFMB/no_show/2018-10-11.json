point I just an ... versus the brand versus the land but that was pretty interesting go back in the beginning here that were\nUm so they're just kind of lesson ... carefully and look for it so good ah so do you know you heard something about um uh the reporter\nSaid you know what is it in Chicago what the problem is it a legislative visit a law enforcement issue what's the problem and Trump said some thing darn it what was the word he said did you catch it\nAnd ... oh I thought it was just kind of like a combination he sent it to say one other thing too said oh you know\nMaybe it's a darn it keeps your father sorry I'm\n... no one wants to say and I think I heard the president alluded to it and forget what exactly what it where it was um\nIt's that family probably no one ever say that that's the thing you know people are getting fed up with Ronald manual\nThe mayor of Chicago and I don't know if they're still doing this for a couple of weeks ago they were having a protest industry against rama manual right because so many people getting shot and killed and so few of these murders are getting solved\nSo this way around the manual finally came out with and said he said this and I don't like Romney ride but but the finally hit on the truth here he said this may not be politically correct\nBut I Know the power of what faith and family can do our kids need that structure\nSo I'm asking that we don't shy away from a full discussion about the importance of family and faith helping to develop and nurture character self respect a value system in a moral compass\nSo they don't spit for dominance self respect so nurture character\nSelf respect of value system\nAnd a moral compass by real crabs are distracted thanks for the word character I mean this book now and it and they mentioned the word character\nSo the word personality comes from the Greek word meaning\nMask like a mask you Erin ... character the Greek root of this is something etched in stone interesting right your personality the mask character is who you really are and\nThat's what's etched in stone so we got we just thought faith and family develop nurture character self respect a value system in a moral compass that allows kids to no good\nFrom bad and right from wrong we have a responsibility to help nurture character plays a role\nI Would argue plays of evil right or our kids need that moral structure in their lives and we cannot be scared to have this conversation and of course progressive how are you white explain or something I don't know what the criticism right\nBut that you can't have that you can't have that conversation that Rob Emanuel find the ultimate they brought up it's gotta be\nOnly in the progressive world media's world like you're the reporter there was it a law a legislative issue or a law enforcement you owe ... a little bit of those right but way way way more faith and family issue\n\nSo I'll give it a little bit of credit to romp are starting to touch on\nThe the true problem here but you obviously won't have the courage to stick with that truth all the way this was the end right oh they'll end up blaming the police department again or
