your assessment of the current state of California elections\nWell let's let's not start with my assessment let's start with a festive and the other end of vigils in groups\nMIT did a comprehensive study of elections in the United states of America and they measured elections office Seventeen different major bowl sadder part of every election and every state and they have determined that the state of California\nHas a number three ranked a elections in the United states but that's not number three from the top\n... number three from the bottom we're the third\nWorst elections and the United states of America not some might say OK somebody has to be the third worse really that you know at least we're part of the United states of America which leaves the world and representative democracy\nWell you'd be mistaken because Harvard recently did a study of twenty eight western democracy in the in in around the world\nAnd they determine when it came to election integrity the United states of America was ranked twenty eight so we're dead laugh in the western democracy\nWhen it comes election integrity in fact you know\nPresident former President Carter who goes around to the

talking breaking news [noise]\n\nCommissioner about these text messages\nReceiving let me let me hold off on that I Want to finish our conversation with\nMark moisture who will make you more\nSure in the integrity of California election when you vote for him for secretary say a farm I can give me some more examples of how the integrity of our election in California are are not of integrity [laughter] are not living up to what we expect\nLet's start with is the oldest person living in the state of California was on July twenty fourth\nWearing hold on hold on a great question guys mark I just put you on hold who's the old how old is the oldest person living in California\nWhich I guess I'm going to go a hundred and four\n... I Want to go one by\nOne of seven are mark how old is the oldest person in California\nThe oldest person in the state of California was born on July twenty four like you know\nWhat I'm Wondering well if you got it [laughter]\nWow that seems pretty old\nThe older person was born on July twenty fourth\nDianne Feinstein was only like Ninety or something I didn't think he got he got out alive at that march you don't have to run for office wasn't even well crafted I Apologize I just keep going through the guy's a hundred and twelve\nAs a gal but okay [laughter]\nThere are twenty three thousand one hundred eight people on our voting will who are older than the oldest person living in the state of California\n[laughter] I thought you were doing Well Mark wow mark a gloomy away\nBut you want to ... when I can taught that I can taught that twenty three thousand one hundred and eight people are on the go to ... all of the oldest person living sixteen thousand seven\nHundred and eighty on boats in the presidential two thousand fixing a great turnout\n[laughter] that older voters her that you're talking about\nWhat are you talking about well\nIf they cannot to maintain the\nVote or not there is no way we're going I'm going to repeat this don't get the oldest person living California's a hundred and twelve at the first I thought that was a joke I thought\nYou were being like well no way this person actually a hundred and twelve 'cause I didn't think people lived to I was crazy oh okay so you're saying is twenty three thousand people older tend to live than the oldest living person in California on the voting rolls twenty\nThree thousand sixteen thousand of those voted\nSixteen thousand seven hundred eighty of them\nAnd they weren't actually\nTabulate it where they like to do is go towards the results of the election or where they get on out yes\nI did know they said\nYeah if you look at the voter registration rolls and something that any statewide candidate can purchase I mean this is not rocket science I purchased from the secretary of state's database a complete list of the vote\nAnd how much it costs ... oh it's a couple of hundred bucks not very still provide I hit\nA very simple core I say how many people are on or off a little older who belong to or July twenty or\nLike you know sex\nAnd the ... less than three thousand one hundred and eight and then I said okay I mean look he voted in November twenty six to eight and it showed a sixteen thousand seven hundred eighty of them voted in\nNovember fixing OK so first off can you tell what party they were registered under\nOh I call it I have all that information I have in front of me right this second but yes I ... that that evening to ascertain I mean we have addresses and everything like that\nCan you tell where they were registered each or they can you tell where or how they were registered\nWe know ah when they were registered yet with that day and sometimes we even know uh what by what means they were registered\nOkay is there any any investigation\nSo what's your hunch on what some of the sixteen thousand people are like that I mean a straight up front there's no what's the most generous story you could make up as to how that happened [noise]\nOkay the most generous story I can make up is that this is absolutely a person living today okay and they were\nAt let's say the farmers' market and there was a stranger who said you want to register to vote and they said sure all registered to vote but they weren't comfortable giving all their ... information on a form that they're giving to this person\nSo they chose not to put their laugh or the Social Security number on and they chose not to put their date of birth they just left those blank\nBut register voters who received the form\nJust made up of date and put it on and registered them to vote now the problem is that there are many things at a secretary or the registered voters is allowed to ignore on a voter registration form and still it is a valid voter registration\nOkay date of birth is not one of ... can you do not have a date of birth it is an N. valid voter registration\nAnd just make one of those up plus if you were going to make one up like Nineteen oh five is a weird day just to pick\nA lot of these or January first Nineteen hundred or my favorite is January first Nineteen fit or Eighteen fifty\n\nBut then on January first days they're not all January first day there are a lot of them that are January first date but what it is is that the register voters basically is violating the law said well we got voter registration rather than actually send them back to the person and say hey\nAh we know you want to register to vote but you did not fill out enough information for us a clean fill it out and return it that's what they're supposed to do it\nWhile it's a combination of the government agency registering people to vote who did not provide enough information okay and why is this important\nWell if somebody passes away we you know if we ever decide to actually comparable to roll with the Social Security death records we would have the laugh or the social\nWe can compare it to date of birth laugh or the social compare it with the voter rolls and go hey this person's passed away when eater removing the model\nBut if we are just registering people\nWithout having enough independent information about them so we can compare them when they knew when they die you know then we're you know we can't maintain Akron voter rolls and then and ensure that there is in ... in ...\nReally what we ought to focus on and get them out to the bowls even though they're doing a pretty darn good job right sixteen thousand in the twenty three\nThousand four registered voter glad who's who's on them so how does the ah\nAlex Wright ... he's the current secretary state a Democrat how does he campaign like what [laughter] what does get very much for me\nI'm In charge of election integrity and we have twenty three thousand people on the voter rolls who are older than the oldest person in the state\nShould be super easy to fix but\nI don't\nLike wouldn't vote for me it takes more time and money to register a business in California than any other state in the country\nHow do you run on that\n\nGosh while\nI uh so my wife this morning for the second time got attacks I don't know but this one this morning was from ... as for yes on\nSex which is the repealing the the most recent gas tax I don't know what the one was before that I forget I think she's had to play a forty hour but I don't like the I don't like the taxing thing\nYour mouth and usually get robo calls were treated the recorded voice or that'd be a volunteer to write and I don't know I don't know why all the tax doesn't seem more invasive I kinda think it's a little less invasive maybe because it may be easier to ignore\nI don't know I've been taught me to talk me office is it okay so here's why I don't like it just 'cause it's new it's like the first time I've ever seen it\nAll from my first things like now but I don't know tell me why it's not a bad thing oh I think it's a horrible thing okay I think but I think ... robocalls okay until\nJust because it takes on a new form doesn't make me like it anymore\nI I I think it's garbage I gave the emails from from\nA one how'd you get my email yeah that is too I think that's what it is\nA um [noise] I don't know [noise]\nCan't articulate why I don't like it I don't mind mail started right away because rate it goes directly from kitchen counter to mailbox doesn't even so that's just a waste but I don't really doesn't bother me\nI've never gotten robo called\n'cause they only do they only do it on land mines the robocall a cell phone that I don't know so maybe that's what it is\nMaybe it's the invasion into the cell phone that I've never had a ... like as a robocall so calling your house\nWhich I don't I don't know how to land mine\nYeah and it used to be people weren't so much upset about that kind of thing because they're in and like your names will send a phone book yeah kinda like public information anyway\nYeah ... what kind of\nInteresting anyway so the said or someone wrote me about the yes on six they recruit volunteers and they send those tax to people who are deemed undecided voters I Wonder why they deemed my wife an undecided voter\nYou tell us might object [laughter] she's very decided on that and I'm I think she's read just dirt Rick Bob so they can well\nA lot of that [laughter] I didn't want to or even if you're an arms visit may have had some employers oh no I Would never having a soldier why they how they decided undecided um\nThey said that they use an app so it appears to come from the yes on six phone number ah okay\nSo it's doesn't come from the person the actual number comes from a one number so all these all these people\nI'm totally just base in the office you know some of that uh everyone download the app and we can all syntax ... volunteers yes I'm six consent attacks through the app and then sends through the F sends a tax to a number to everyone but it all comes from the same number\nWrites yeah even if you have a a Michigan phone number it goes through the app which then turns it into a yes I'm six phone number ... headquarters\nAnd your on a robocall let's not forget that what was that you were a my honorable guests [laughter] I've always the robocall by the way are amazing law are great and you don't robocall guy waits ... being personable you know what is really how do you just rarely\nVery no no no I don't reserve and one is that it not not all of a robocall as\nIt says you matter yeah ... like I'm just saying this to random pee all not at all so this is a very thank you for being you know what it is it Mr Rogers kind of message I Love you just the way you are\nI'm I'm ... I Love I Love alternative now they're a great change of heart off a segment and that's not what you were listening to a and yes there not robo they're not automated\nThey're volunteers on the other side pushing sent I Wonder if there's some law about that you can't have a automated tax sent out to everyone like an Amber Alert\nStyle you have to have an actual person per cent [noise] I Wonder yeah for now\nBut it's all trending in that direction so here Ryan's I made that see some of the exchange that he had with someone hey I'm a teacher this is what someone sent him hey I'm a teacher volunteering for Tony Thurmond for California superintendent who are not endorsing the only candidate endorsed by classroom teachers what are they just send it out [laughter] do you\nShould see the way they do this now they are in political circles they say if you get to teachers\nTo support and you know if I'm running then your support it you can say I'm supported by teachers selling a legal thing or is that just like the ethical ... ethical line human error because teachers and you say yes for miles and miles of supported by teachers [laughter]\nAlso like people named Charlie easy was supported by people named Jim people by name Jim\nThere's bound to be a one teacher that door Fifteen that support you but that doesn't know that it's like I make it seems like there's this coalition of teachers by\nNow you can do I like to have you voted so Ryan wrote back as a teacher do you promote more school funding going directly classrooms yes as a kindergarten teacher just my opinion that we should fund\nSchools from the classroom up isn't that Marshall talks record [laughter]\nSo the so does that open up its here too I got a lot more tax the battles of the corps volunteers which could be fun huge waste of time but also fun\nUh okay let's do real quick here are the fourteenth amendment just so everyone\nIs friendly square it up on this and I heard this before but uh since Trump brought up getting rid of birthright citizenship\nMaybe worth a jogging our memory about it a merry sent me this very says I think he would sign that says an executive order to force it to go to the Supreme Court quickly\nMaybe\nI Wonder if that's the I Wonder if that is why you're doing it like that ... it's an interesting play perhaps anyway um [noise]\nSo here's the fortunate I was fortunate in the past Eighteen sixty eight has right after the civil war it was meant solely to apply to the children of slaves who are now newly freed because of the civil war so think about that you're you're a you're a slave you give birth to your\nSon a data and slavery so what's your son he was he was property a minute ago and now he's free ... is he a citizen\nHow do we solve this year we got fourteenth amendment fall off all\nKids the slaves slaves children former slave joins are now a citizen sets up a specifically exempt ... Native Americans and uh he legal immigrants\nTemporary travelers and uh people who let's say you're like an ambassador from France in your living here and you give birth to a child then that kid is not\nI'm a citizen either right to their specific exemptions and illegal immigrants that wasn't a word back then but they put it under the umbrella of subject to the jurisdiction there of if you're from Honduras and you're coming here in a caravan you come across the border you're not subject to the jurisdiction they're out of the United states of America so if your kid is born here you're not\nThat kids not a citizen should it be a citizen of the United states and that's what Trump is trying to get rid of which I think is a really smart did it strikes the root of a lot of issues when it comes to either go immigration and I think in the end it would lead to a decrease in the immigration and an increase in people trying to come in properly the right way legal way\nBecause if you come here illegally and you become a citizen legally well then yeah of course you are now subject to the jurisdiction thereof which isn't the fourteenth amendment the first time you are now subject to the jurisdiction thereof and then you have kids here and then there'll be citizen\nPerfect that's how it's supposed to be so I think this really strikes the root of a lot of the illegal immigration problems in America and I think it's wise and good are we talked earlier I don't like the executive order aspect of it because the next president can come in and an executive order it I Want it to be more lasting and binding such you go through Congress but I see what kind of embarrassed\nDr earlier I don't like the executive order aspect of it because the next president can come in and an executive order it I Want it to be more lasting a binding such go through Congress but I see what kind of Mary saying as maybe it was fast track to the Supreme Court\nBecause it's interesting 'cause it doesn't\nThe fourteenth amendment already speaks for itself it's already there so Trump isn't rewriting anything about it he's just reiterating\nHis the defining it back to what it was so they're really when it needed to be a new law you could out of the Supreme Court\nJust bring it back to the original intent of the the framers of it that's interesting I don't know how that's going to work but a big picture of what the president's trying to do is a wise\nOne out of seven sixty K.
