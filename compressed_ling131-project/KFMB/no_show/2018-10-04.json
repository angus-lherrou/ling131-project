like whoa that car just cut it off well then it goes up they go oh my gosh wow they crash I'm gonna tell please what I saw and I thought well what did you see I forgot which car cut off which car first there was a blue carnival or white car\n[noise]\nAnd I make note when it happened I said well that blew\nUp that car off and then like right now to the white carpet blue car off by forget job

Nineteen eighty\nFour manners convicted of rape and murder of a nine year old girl given the gas chamber\nThat was the center at the gas chamber because five I witnesses said it was five nine years later DNA evidence proved it wasn't him [laughter] oh\nFive eyewitnesses so arrogant you remember you ask for the day how often this happens how often eyewitness testimony puts people in jail wrongly so this group the Innocence Project a they have overturned two hundred and thirty nine convictions through DNA testing\nSo a lot like the stories we were sharing early uh Seventy three percent of those convictions were based on eyewitness testimony\nAnd I bet every single one of those eyewitnesses for certain what they were saying was true\n\nIt'll give them their years back so\nNo years back [noise] especially for the guy that the gas chamber\nSo by well there's a lot of memories stuff I've gotten from the the researcher Dr Loftis from UC Irvine she is a a Democrat and is pro choice and says she does not want Kevin on the Supreme Court so she was a total hack she would come out and\nSay oh that memory stuff I'd been researching for decades is totally wrong she's a hundred percent right and that she knows it then she knows it [laughter] but it's not that\n\nShe's the one who throughout the proposition that\nUh\nMaybe she didn't she didn't recognize who she this is a doctor forwards initial proposition was that she didn't know who it was and then went back in the Georgetown Prep your book and saw his picture and because he was the closest to it stuck with it and now it's the she's a hundred percent started with him\nThat she remembers it over and over further reinforcing what she thought that was her\nPotential uh yeah what happened\nSo maybe not in may that that's probably not your\nSituation if you've been assault but you know to avoid not to say\nSo what are we going to do the thing is a thing as or are they are they said they're going to vote on this tomorrow yeah this has been confirmed I did they asked yes he's saying that because we had a little down dime right we had a little delay here in the whole Kavanaugh moving Z\nBut we're supposed to get this done now I'll get a picture here on MSNBC key cabinet and confirmation vote set for tomorrow okay so that so diverse friday so I think you have to have thirty or thirty six\nHours or something of time before you can finally do so good Marlon and then Saturday if they can vote on it maybe right\nBigotry weekends off not for those Eric oh I've got really important\nOne out of seven sixty K. F. M. B. rapid transmission Sandy it was the largest independently owned and operated especially transmission shop so I wouldn't really mind if they were the smallest independently owned and operated especially but there is actually that is because uh they're been of great success for forty six years\nI mean I Do that okay this guy is even better okay so is the capital graduated college in Nineteen eighty seven thirty I area So Apple\nRemembers telling his graduate school roommate about the incident in Nineteen eighty nine Nineteen Ninety capital graduated in eighty seven which means it would've been a freshman in eighty four eighty three eighty four eighty four\nEighty four eighty eight minutes or so ... so anyway this guy told his roommate about it for years\nFor four five six years after it happened that\nRoommate Michael what stone who is now an architect because that's relevant\nConfirmed apples account and said quote it stood out in our minds because it was a ... because it was a shocking story of\nTransgression okay with it so far So Apple didn't see it he was told about it\nBut he didn't see cabinet expose himself to this woman she heard he hers so someone else told them about it okay and then ... years later told his graduate school roommate about it\nSo the New York times the New Yorker has to people so far writing an entire article about that for the entire articles about this to people who weren't that here's our guys even better\nApple said that he initially as he initially asked to remain anonymous because he hoped to make contact first would the classmate who to the best of his recollection told them about the party and was an actual eyewitness to the incident\nHe said they had not been able to get any response from that person despite multiple attempts to do so the New Yorker reached the classmate and he said he had no memory of the Institute\n\nAnd the New Yorker printed that as a piece against Kavanaugh deadline was\nThe FBI probe ignored testimonies from former classmates\nFoot there's no\nThere's no testimony that makes sense to people's [laughter] anything and then that apple is like All right here's the guy who told me there is a guy who told me so then the New York and goes in contact with a guy and says hey did you tell apple it about this do you remember anything about that like I said no\nAnd it burned to\nOffer like we've got all the ... guys clogged [laughter] does we just get us alive inside look up about ... was that a kangaroo court fame so oh my goodness I've never actually seen or heard a kangaroo court\nOh my goodness okay very good I Love the show ended the kangaroo judge the honorable judge rue who pleaded guilty no guilt home all day and that's why I don't like kangaroo court they're so cute and funny looking but they're not get out like I'm Down on the a bright side of the law\nThat doesn't seem like they do that's the subject of a kangaroo court\nWell [laughter] so what is that what article what ... what does that\n\nWhy I didn't know what\nSort of critical because yeah see I didn't investigate that claim to claim the guy who's supposedly was that was that it didn't happen so we're going to believe these two other guys who weren't there and then my favorite part is quoting this other guy's roommate\nSix years after it happened ...\nWhat are we doing here okay or if that's number one that's the number one there's more I've got a certain about how we're going before the number\nTo a number two is uh the guy tab low we told the story yesterday I sent this letter to the FBI and to of course cruises then forwarded it to Democrat Chris Coons who support is a Chuck Grassley so this guy went to a a key\nFront party and saw\nA group of men group of undergrads at a semi circle and in the middle was a prostitute performing a he said it is worth a sex act on someone that's there\nAnd he wrote this out and he told the FBI that they should investigate\nTo see if Brett Kavanaugh was there or not\n\nKeeping in mind that Brett Kavanaugh graduated the year before this happened\nBut the FBI needs to investigate whether or not he was this guy admits he doesn't know if\nKavanaugh was there and why would it be there he already graduated\nMy ... were you there [laughter]\nI don't want the honorable judge rue [laughter] ruling on that position okay so there there's no destroy number two that was printed as an actual thing was Brett Kavanaugh ...\nFrank party than your average graduated\nSome guy says no but maybe like ... or\nIs the most ridiculous the uh anonymous no return address no time no place no location known names Brett Kavanaugh raped me in a car letter from someone in oceanside that the UT published on the front page\nWill have a which of those three stories is the most absurd again refresh my memory\n\nSomeone told me that Brett Kavanaugh did something I told my roommate\nYears later\nI Can't get in contact with the guy who did tell me the New Yorker did and said it didn't happen that sorry that was pretty wild ride the good one that's that's a good one ah I was I went to a party the year after Kavanaugh graduated something inappropriate happened although I was at\nThe party so should know that part [laughter]\nFBI should investigate whether or not Brett Kavanaugh was that and if you don't it's not an incomplete investigators on a complete offensive or anonymous no return address no information whatsoever letter UT published in the front page which is [noise]\nWell I kind\nOf like the local angle that's good
