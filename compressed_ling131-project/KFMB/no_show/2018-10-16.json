from\nNative American so\nThey are these DNA people use the theory that which I think it's true I haven't heard another theory to be honest but uh that people came so people started to Africa\nAnd then move to Europe and then came to the ... the to America what is now America through the bearing lands straight guys member learning about those in sixth grade or something like that so water as sea levels were lower because there aren't as many cars thousands of years ago\nRight so sea levels or lower the greenhouse gases this yeah that's made the bank\nSo there was a land bridge between Russia what does Russia and Alaska today so people traveled across that land bridge and then traveled down through Canada and through America and they kept going they kept going into Mexico and Peru in Colombia right is that was in the years ago so Elizabeth Warren has DNA\nMarkers\nFor Native American but there really are no DNA markers her Native American was she really has or DNA markers for Latin and south Americans which could also maybe be Native American does that make sense so they can't point sure that makes it I mean like he\nStopped here in this land that is now America they just assume well if you have DNA markers for Latin and south Americans probably those people came through the area so ... maybe they're the same\nPeople that we can cause so we can kind of maybe call you a Native American because of that but just to put this all this now here's why does affirmative action uh actually hurts the people that it's trying to help among other reasons Elizabeth Warren she's now she's saying hey listen my ethnicity\nThat saying that she was Native American didn't they did that did not help me get a job at Harvard\nRight I I'm an incredible teacher and I didn't get a job

emails mixture you put that in my email miles\nOkay thank you appreciate that\nAre so Ben Sasse was on the Senate floor talking about the me too movement and how it's a good thing and it is\nUntil and unless it has been so now until it was hijacked by the Democrats to be used as a political weapon and that's what it was during the whole cabinet thing and check out this from Heidi Heitkamp campaign so this is a woman who's running for reelection in\nNorth Dakota messages a Democrat running for reelection in Trump's state\nUh once miles off the phone with Ben Sasse who I presumed as the person who's on law sir I'm Sorry what did you call them up no he called us and said ... yeah look I Will you know what we're too busy bad I got on a different thing now\nSo you you biographer segment Monday at one yes if you or what have you what do you live [noise]\nOff for like four response we don't want that next book\nOver this book already not even a good one um\nWas it I don't know how much is uh when when you're talking about and look up how much Heidi Heitkamp is down in North Dakota right now the Democrat\nAnyway she ran a full page ad about sexual assault how women won't stand for it anymore and women's voices are going to be her blah blah blah right now Stewart teen women on this list I don't know how many people were on the ... the maybe forty\nBut Thirteen Women have come out and said whoa\nI never gave you permission to publish my name and the newspaper so it's like an open letter right so the the campaign is in his boss says Heidi Heitkamp campaign out I got a full page newspaper ads\nAnd the top three quarters of it was this open letter about women and sexually assaulted word domestic abuse victims of sexual assault victims and we're not going to stand for it anymore and we support Heidi Heitkamp for senator and then it listed all these\nWomen names and so far at least Thirteen Women have come out and said well what what what I didn't no one asked me to hold on me to put my name in the newspaper for it so I just got a couple of a Muslim and said I don't even support Heidi Heitkamp and I'm not a domestic abuse survivor\nShould this even be legal using\nPeople's names as part of your campaign another woman said you should be ashamed of yourself I never gave my consent or permission to be involved in anything like this\nI'm sick to my stomach 'cause I thought that not only myself but many others women were taken advantage of for some political corrupted false campaign agenda another woman set up beyond the furious here's the woman her name's Lexie ...\nAnd she ... she said ah basically the same thing right like I didn't I didn't get anywhere permission to put my name and the newspaper for a campaign ad and people wrote back to her and said hey listen maybe it's a different lax these or a loss\nAs you said\nNo no\nI'm the only like seeds or halo is in the country certainly in North Dakota\n\nSo this morning it was it for women and now it's up to Thirteen Women who either were not domestic abuse victims or never gave permission to have their name printed in the newspaper or don't support Heidi Heitkamp campaign and then amazing and some one woman who was falsely named um\nSaid this is horrible if let's say there's a woman\nAnd her ex\nAbuse or an hour access sees her name and the newspaper now he's going to know that she told someone else about her abuse\nAnd that may make him angry again and outputs are at risk again a further abuse one woman said I'm disgusted I did not give any permission for you to put my name and this I'm furious pretty wild right\nSo this is again this is the weaponized zing of the me too movement she's down twelve in the polls so that this is out this is the nail on the call this and this is not a ... she said this is a huge mistake\nThat anyone was included that shouldn't have been a these women deserve their privacy I Can't say I'm Sorry enough I'm so sorry that had happened uh this is a major failing these\nIn no way gave their permission nor do they want their names in the ad I Will not deny that in any way shape or form so you give her like a ...\nThese women in no way gave their permission nor do they want their names in the ad I Will not deny that in any way shape or form so you give her like half\nCredit for coming out with a ... fold\nSeemingly genuine apology as opposed to like sidestepping ... probably should have blamed her husband the collapse I Know that she\nCouldn't do that can't spouse come on come on out off the spouse [laughter]\nShe's the politician I mean they wouldn't just throwing non yeah yeah ... blame your spouse for an error that you should be responsible for ... yeah sorry about that you come back the real problem is\nDespise\nThat the Palestinian spies yes who are running for Senate is that Congress yes around the country yes mhm 'cause they know that\nI'm through with over\nThere is no sugar coating this this was a colossal air or here's one other woman here I I feel so does she do this on purpose was this just like we're gonna run with it and see if nobody notices oh", "year": "2018", "show_name":
