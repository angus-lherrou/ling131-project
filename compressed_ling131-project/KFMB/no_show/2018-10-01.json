breaking\nFor the last two weeks and then I\nTake a break\nThere'll be plenty of time we got a base herself a let me tell you why I wanted to invite our next guest on so uh I've mentioned a few times that my mom has moved from our childhood home so that a couple of weeks ago\nAnd we were my mom and I were doing our last walks through\nOf an empty house and my mom said you know your father really loved this house has said why she said well he pretty much built it\nSo we're talking about\nWhere is he did the floors he built is he a ... and she's just like\nButter butter butter like ... like the door that separating our kitchen and living room that's the door from the original house was that was there before I got there and the countertops are all would but he reclaimed from the other part of the house and this and that there's going to say\nSo she we went upstairs or run into the uh it was a box in the back with the blueprints then my dad Dru of the house the actual blueprint so we're going to frame that we're going to put a lump in my my son's room but I had no idea that my dad built so much of the house and deeply deeply loved it and one of the things that my mom lives there was a fireplace\nAnd um she's like a dead though the fireplace\nSo we're talking about it but the Bible is\nSo when I was young he built the fireplace and then when I was in college he built the mantle around like the mantle and the molding in this whole thing I said well I don't really remember him doing all of that as the I did it when when you were in college\nAnd I should have started off with is my hobby over the last couple of years my favorite thing that I like to do is woodworking super amateur woodworking stuff of built my daughter's crib and stuff like that\nUh that's a darn it\nThis is the thing that I've grown to love to do woodworking and my dad and I never had a chance to share that together before he\nPassed away I wouldn't miss opposite I would've been so much fun I never\nBut I kind of came and I guess I guess I came in during my older maybe I did maybe my dad's influence was still there before I even had an opportunity to love woodworking but anyway that was the saddest part about leave my house was like oh my gosh I never got to share this with my dad so then I came across this book called furnishing eternity a father a son\nA blank and fill in the blank

give us the backstory or what happened\nYeah it's it's interesting that you left the the sort of the ah the explosive word of the subtitle at first because um it's true my dad and I did build a coffin together but um especially hearing your intro and as I write in the book initially it didn't really matter that that's what we were doing\nWhat happened is my dad was my dad was approaching his eighties and and kind of all my life\nThat my my best memories of him and the ways we spent\nOur time together the most naturally was working on projects together in most often either woodworking our

book er furnishing eternity but he has a book a couple years back the hard way on purpose essays in dispatches from the rust belt\nOr you know specifically about the rust belt Ohio but we see a lot of the ... in California as well right these old industrial towns that have seen better days are all over the country\nBut still a major part of our identity as a country and does individual people if you grew up in one of these top by David thanks to stick around so um why the hard way on purpose why did you come to that concluding good [laughter]\nUm well first of all it's it's not just about this part of the country where I live I live in Akron, Ohio I'm the industrial part of of Ohio I'm not far from Detroit and you know in that that old manufacturing region but also specifically when I came of age which is\nAs a member of generation X. you know the people who grew up here and have maintained and identity here recognized that we\nAre the first generation that didn't know what it was to be sort of a boom town um so it's it's the story of growing up initially knowing what it was to be um yeah going through hard times\nAnd then you know making for many of us the choice at you\nKnow either leaving for college or I'm making career decisions are making lifestyle decisions or so forth deliberately making the choice to stay with a place where it's going to be a difficult road and so I was trying to tell my story but hopefully reflect the story of millions of people\nWho stuck by towns like Akron um [laughter] and come to recognize not only that we um have a ... or in some ways doing things the hard way but kind of finding the value of doing it that way\nBut yeah so what's the what's the beauty of places like this that's worth fighting for\nWell I think one of the beauties is is just that it's um you know if the if the ...\nBooks that came out within the past five years or so and\nUm you know ... initially the story of Detroit was ... it it's dying you know and\nBut I think is a country where young enough that we haven't really seen what happens when cities evolve 'cause you know that would be like saying Rome was dying when it burned you know way way way back when it didn't diet evolved and so you know you look at Detroit and\nOther towns and you ... you look at how they\nPull themselves back and they adapt to to changes yeah fast change\nHow has the allies these changes changed the people of these areas are what defines the people of these areas and connects them to the town and the identity\nYeah I think one of the things that defines a second access is the idea that our towns need us that we can't just be citizens and expect that you know pay our taxes and then we get the benefits of\nOf that that you actually have to actively commit in some ways whether it's in really you know sort of direct investment ways or whether it's in sort of like in ways to spread a message that may be different than the misconceptions that we have or whatever it is that it takes and it it takes [noise]\nI'm kind of everybody pulling together to keep things moving forward 'cause it's really you know I'm I was asked a lot when that book came out if if Akron is like back and my answer would be that that's not really the point because a place like this\nIs always going to be in a cycle of as sort of like two steps forward one step back cycle like it's always going to be a grind\nAnd again that that becomes kind of a lifestyle in the mindset and there's something you know how the hip hop that I mean you all have just become acquainted it in a new way with LeBron James our most famous um citizen\nAnd LeBron James whole career and I think his whole philosophy not just as an athlete but as a human has been\nThis idea of embracing the struggle and working harder than everybody else because that's the knows he has to 'em and and all of that and I don't think it's by accident I mean he's he's he's operating on a completely different level of and in every way but I think when you\nBoil him down to his core\nHis truth it's it's it's really very much I'm the same as most of the people\nWho are getting that threaten the Akron is certainly had a big part to do with that it has to it as a master\nI'm David we're going to run a but I appreciate you talking about both of these books were going to put them on a on our website they make so much for having me enjoy their ... alright tickets so the hard way on purpose that is that one and then furnishing eternity well what about on a slate of radio dot com just click on books and they'll both be right there are coming next month talking about um\nThe filmmaker just decided hey this is going to be an important trial I'm going to ask the lawyer for me to follow them around the whole time like every second of his life than during all the back meetings with all the defense attorneys and everything they were all there and got everything which is sweet right now and then it got crazier\nAnd so it's pretty good so far I'm super ... okay let me clarify this point so there's all this me to stop fend a cow at all it's all tied in this uh this is mostly not all but a lot of it is a result of feminism\nSo it's a lot of a a misguided and a failure to turn boys into men and a purposeful way\nThat's part of it\nAnd I feel like we talk about that a lot right so the end of this conversation I don't want to be accused of not talking enough about boys and men which is that all the time I Can't do everything in one segment as I Want to focus on the feminism and its failure to raise girls into women\nBut ...\nAs it relates specifically to sexual assault feminism has told girls among many things first to be equal you two should do keg stands and drink as much as the boys drink until you are black out because the quality\n\nAnd go to any college party and you'll see that feminism has told girls to dress like prostitutes because empowerment\nFeminism is told girls that sex\nAll girls to dress like prostitutes because empowerment\n\nFeminism is told girls that sex is freeing so have sex with as many people as you want because liberation\nDid you think that's what end well\nSo in the name of the quality empowerment and liberation\nWe have feminism that its toll girls to drink as much as you possibly can dress like prostitutes and have sex as much as you want this is going to go this is the\nGuy who like who would think that have you talked to think about it like that and Greg Miller I'm wrong that sounds like a great recipe for gender relations\nJust from the girls perspective boys raising in demand has its own failures which again we talk about all the time but just specifically focused on girls because I Can't do everything at one time\nHow could that be a good idea then feminism its toll girls that men are dispensable who needs them\nWho needs Moody's these dads any way dads don't need to be president so girls have fewer male role models to look to for what it what what they should look for in a husband\nI'd have dad's not around and feminism says dad doesn't need to be then girls who have a harder time knowing how they should be treated Marcellus widely who's that favorite charger\nDoris my dad yeah ah he wrote on Twitter awhile back he said it was a picture of him and his ah older daughter I'm older now I mean a father's please date your daughter's\nRemind them of their greatness their power and their beauty\nComfort their fears and their anxieties and all of us decode the game for them along that line decode the game let them know what's really going on out there so they're not deceived the code of the game for them if you don't the world will\n\nDate your daughters of course the old line is that the girls who are the easiest to get them better those with daddy issues right\nWhy but this is a part of feminism Coney stats well let's get out some implications and in effect on the raising of girls and two women\nSo one reason I bring all this up is because the New York times had a nice little articles a life with is that line life with no males\nThese termites show that it's possible\n\nSome headlines discovery among termite colonies suggests that males can be discarded from advanced societies in which they once played an active role this is a real article in New York Times so it's not what this term eyes have been doing incredible things since the time of dinosaurs maintaining complex societies with division of labor\nFarming fungus in building cathedrals that circulate air the way human lungs do\nNow add overthrowing the patriarchy to that list Dr ... research is the first\nTo demonstrate that males can be discarded from advanced societies and which they once played an active role so\nQuick positive ah we started off with the it's absurd claim that termites have an advanced society [laughter]\nHave always heard that [laughter] is it always been a thing called the dolphins very smart primates very hard for like us turned my well and this and to be fair I did read an article the other day about ah termite colony in a in a way it was it was it\nWas I forget where it's but they were they were just the other day launched a satellite into space yeah was it it'll be ... or there's a direct an anti ... turned my colony sure launching satellite is incredibly buff well you know there are very advanced or not even that across the ... [laughter]\nVery practiced right around but yeah what are you got what [laughter] so termites in humans do pretty much the same we're both equally advanced termites in humans so if termites can get rid of males\n[noise] [laughter] oh\nOh can you if I told my shared with you before the show an article a that was on Twitter about how we got rid of men after nine o'clock the things that women can do you're telling me not nine o'clock every time they do hold them well I mean the termites or any of them share under advanced sure\nOr they're just now we can stop that we need to go anymore in the article a but this is just one example of how progressive ism has taken over the sciences at universities as well and engineering department to write so it's not just the humanity [noise] um so you got a few minutes here let me wrap this up\nMen and women uh let me be fair in the past the patriarchy has given women a subservient role in society that's wrong\nSemitism came in and like most revolutions swung the pendulum to the opposite but equally wrong place\nBy this happens a lot so you're too far one extreme so then we have a revolution and now we're on the exact other extreme but that's just as wrong just just different right so where the patriarchy in the past was a men verses women\nNow you're feminism which is on the other extreme but still just wrong it's still says that genders need to be genders need to be at odds and at war with each other right the gender war\nAnd that's Garbage Men and women are not the same we are complimentary\nThat's the key or not we shouldn't be at odds were not the same we're complimentary feminism has has misconstrued equality with sameness\nRight so there's been this societal effort to make women more like men and men more like women and I'm not talking about transgender isn't here I mean men and this that the\nCultural ... males just look at the boy band we never got into this last week I don't know if we ever will but the boy band the big hot boy band today miles as posters with them all over his wall you to take down the ... boy posters that used to have up there I was actually a ... noodle posters was even alive sure limited I loved it I knew for a minute I took him down and I put it back street boys the ...\nOr ... degrees sorry Ninety degrees and are replaced all with ... be ts there's a big boy band\nOf today bbs I'm just Google be ts and\n[noise] I've I didn't tell you there were a boy band [laughter] wow what an interesting group\nOf girls I think I saw them on ... on the other night on the Internet yeah where where they are where we we were going to talk about this and then we did that stuff that I was a Kevin ...\nUm they broke the Internet today yes wow\nYou're convinced them why on friday we were having Internet traveler it they broke down but I still haven't got it all the way for you to know never K they break the sea [laughter]\nWe don't know who broke the AC today but\nWhy on friday we were having the Internet it they brought in by I still haven't gotten all the way affected enough never K they break the sea [laughter]\nWe don't know who broke the AC today but it's\nA little studying here you know it's it's not fair people by big bucks for a sauna right to vote for some people joined spies since the worst that lose a few pounds when you come to want to go do this is my wife the other day when it was well hot out and she didn't really appreciate that prospective\nOh your way to honor the weight loss of so so ... screw it at night 'cause I was going to be when I was really hot out here I said well you know people love San has\n[noise] Mm yeah and I was kind of like the ... mind very fair a lot of money for the sun it let's just pretend we're in a sauna and will enjoy it more than ...\nAnyway where was it oh yeah the boys MBTA Sarah look kind of like a grown up in a and watch any Disney Channel show and all this the boys are very feminine and what they wear and how they act in what they look like rent\nSo while there's been a history of male abuse feminism has taught", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "San Diego", "day": "01"}
