because it might so all day I say I'm like oh here's what I should have done you know and that game first of all don't take a call ... get a better producer [laughter] we need a real gatekeeper freedom to protect a\nBut I should have paused to the whole thing right away and I think done a lesson in word choice and I think we kind of did that throughout the call but I should have slowed down even more you guys member the opening question or the question after the Columbus thing said\nDo you believe a tax cheat is a patriot yeah wild question like I said something like that maybe there's another weird buzz word in there too but I should have just stopped the whole thing right there and be like alright put on hold and they got everyone knows\nThis is a hack\nTime here's how you can do and then broke down the sentence structure and I really started out because he wasn't gonna hang up because he was a super troll anyway he was going to be there for law so we could have slowed down and and I've been a really nice uh\nIllustrate a moment but it said it was like a weird back and forth and I kind of ruined it some apologized so in the name of that I guess that's kind of ties and I see a here's two articles from duty this morning um [noise]\nSo I guess by yesterday there was a er Cox ... avenue some debate\nMonday morning at what time do we know what time it was a ... ... it was at ten am of course yes Monday at ten am when everybody's listening to watch them to be not exactly prime time [laughter] I was real fired up for the whole gubernatorial debate and Monday at ten am\nWell actually that's a I should interrupt or Eric and I are going to have a John Cox and governors some on our show oh the\nBake all wow the same time what time that going to be obviously much better than a day or two fifty shades of cash oh in there so you have to do that maybe get like the lady who just want\nTo get ahead of you know all the mhm craziness males around the chaos in the world's yeah Fifteen is just not that I Am\nAnyway\nA plus some later today I'm reading about ... percent that's just really want to get to the bottom of it should understand here's the deal is that with the debate broadcast only on the radio during working hours Cox needed a moment that would get repeated play in the media said Jack Pitney a political science professor at Claremont McKenna\nCollege in the morning [noise] the actual quote right there from the live feed of Jack Pitney right now we can we go back to Jack Ma\nQuote his chance for a breakout would have been some kind of rhetorical master stroke that put new some on the defensive are geared as reading saving and they'll put new some on the ... on the defensive and cast\nCox is a champion of the ordinary Americans pit and he said and quote he did not listen to the debate but said media coverage suggested that Cox's performance was underwhelming\n[laughter] why why\nJournalism\nSo the guy reporting on they\nDidn't actually watch it\nYes but bases opinion based on all the other media as a reaction to it [noise]\nYeah that's how you doing [laughter] thing\nIs that your journalism [laughter] you you see so you're used to the old school way where you go you talked to some folks you listen to a doctor what kind of folks maybe the people themselves was dating\nFor maybe who else who else would you have talked to in the old days or the moderator okay who maybe someone someone else political you're crazy object or an expert no outlets or or if you wanted to get an opinion of someone who would be just a random person and what they thought oh sure who would you ask\nPeople through ...\nYeah [laughter] oh sure yeah that's the old school way but the new school way again it's just kind of\nLoose sumo lose it's kinda like this miles takes a test and I just go yeah what he said\nWhat I'm saying yeah I just get along with it is good see mine is what if\nWhat if I was interviewed on CBS say ... ... yeah I'm doing a report and he interviewed me and my opinion on the UFC fights on Saturday yeah and I said wow that's sure what's crazy when what's his name to beep beep jumped out of the out of the octagon like that after defeating McGregor\nSet my fighter who didn't watch the fight or a girl and three did or whatever he didn't really great job and based that opinion based off of one sort or feed that you do did watch it what\nIs that what kind of nonsense that\nIs the only thing he said he did not listen to the debate but said media coverage suggested Cox's performances underwhelming\nYou didn't watch why would they fight why wouldn't they find someone\nWho actually did well I think I don't know I wasn't here quite Travis interview last week but I Know in his book he talks about what happened was the media now would write stories based off of things they heard on Twitter so back in the day without Twitter\nYou can't write a story but people were saying kid rock the reaction to kid rock a performing in any in any trouble all started game\nGuy he's facing backlash oh you're right and that's from Twitter nobody's nobody like\nBut just people on Twitter real fast cars ever for people on Twitter exactly but they can use that wears back in the day there was no I mean like yeah you're right that's that's increased the outrage yeah Bob cycle sure that\nNo matter what happens whatever happens you can find someone on Twitter was outraged by examined right about the outrage about it so what is that\nOkay now but really that's no different than the cabin all reporting right\nHere's a here's a a sworn statement from San jose if I can remember there's a a sworn statement sent the Judiciary Committee from ...\nFrom someone who over heard someone else remember that Brett Kavanaugh exposed himself to a girl and here's my roommate who I told that someone else\nTold me about it therefore it happened and the FBI news asked me about it so that Brad ...\nWho you\n[laughter]\nIt's kind of like the spark notes generation is coming of age now the agar pilot that too\nYeah the short version is I don't know whatever the other reporters I haven't really read them I\nI don't really have time but you know what ... what ... what Cox really needed to do is to have a great breakthrough relied did he have one I didn't I haven't heard it so I don't know what do you think actually or listen to the [laughter] we were talking before she is out here so that in his eye on\nUh so do you remember last year my parents went to an NFL game and then the players Nielsen the anthem they left yeah players protesting or whatever a suicide lined the UT Mike Pence's NFL walkout costs I don't know why it's in the duty today\nI saw the same thing\nSo walkout cost taxpayers three and a twenty five thousand dollars and was likely staged so I don't know why is out here a year later but the words the article goes I'll just here some of the worst\nBecause they are tell us a\nGreat start as a part of our direct lover music twenty five percent more was waiting to see what she said oh pretty good [noise] I'm always tempted to just started doing the news or ah I guess the twenty four hours after she posted encouraging people to vote a forty thousand\nPeople between the ages of Eighteen and twenty nine registered for sixty five sixty five thousand it's sixty five thousand\nAnd I guess in that same period forty thousand people over the age of thirty so I guess they're using that as the control group like normally in a twenty four hour period I don't know I I don't I've know perspire every article I read about it I don't get the proper perspective of like what that means that huge bump\nLike weather ten people register the day before now they're sixty five thousand rather normally fifty thousand people and there was vulgar I have no idea\nI'm not sure but it doesn't matter because we're going to be interesting to see how many of those people\nActually do vote it takes two minutes to register to vote on line\nVoting is what actually takes effort as we talked about I think in the last one or two there was a focus group of millennial voters and one of the biggest reasons why young people don't vote even by mail is because they don't know where to buy stamps\nSo\nYou can vote or you can register to vote on line that's super easy Taylor's fans have no problem doing that but actually walking to a voting booth and ... and ... president buttons or whatever no\nNot there'll be no Taylor bump in that regard um\nCelebrity influence and voting is very minimal that being said Kanye West and Kim K. or doing way more than registering people to vote they're actually doing things so on Thursday\nAnd I hope we get pictures that do you think we're actually getting any video that I Would think so those two together [laughter] maybe they'll wander the lawn together I don't want a little strong around the grass\nMhm Trump ... maybe ... can be big it'll probably be a feature on keeping up with the ... laws is telling me that kind you does it go and keeping up with a ... yeah it's not really ... also it's only going to be well on Yahoo elderly desperation it does in county doesn't even live in the same city same state is is what\nWe're up here to do anything wrong you is a good man [laughter]\nI feel bad for North [laughter] oh wow so I get disparaging hero [laughter]\nSo Thursday Trump Jared Kushner and God yeah I don't know if ... going to be bought ... let me I'm going to find a quick because I think he just talked about the ... really yeah so they're going to be at\nAbout prison reform job opportunities for former convicts\nUh luckily here case I mean we have a program for former convicts that's how I got the job which is exciting and drank grateful for that now bath from [noise]\nSo felon program we now we know it works or fairly\nAnd then also how to increase manufacturing jobs in Chicago what kinda what came out of talked about lowering the corporate income taxes that would be awesome so here's the I'll bring this up only because it's Jared Kushner is all about Jared Kushner Trump's son in lots of ... husband he's the guy he's been pushing prisoner of war for a long time because his\nTom because his dad went to jail\nI forget what year but Charles Kushner went to jail for fourteen months\nFor donating to Democrats illegally like illegal campaign donations I'm not sure how it all went down but uh some white collar crime like that we went to jail for fourteen months\nSo Jared has been pushing for Brazil won in prison for a long time and that's why he's been working with kind of you or would you ask me for a while and knock on who's going to come over and chairs the guy who's getting stuff done on a place called this Nikki Haley yesterday or this morning um she is a of course he's leaving her ambassador post\nAt the un at the end of the year so she's in the news as she was talking to the process she said it's about Jared Kushner I Want\nThat family is in the first lady has been nothing but very very kind to me I Can't say enough good things about Jared and Andrea scary to have I have no\nEnding to redo than after the on the way he began I'm what I've done working with him on the middle east peace of mind it is so\nOffice is a great friend and they do a lot of things behind it I Wish more people down because we're about our country because they're in ministry you also have to say certainly the way the\nWay to play with my ... is that what that people as\nA [laughter] ... short okay [laughter] ridiculous\nJust getting ready for\nThe way to go to\nA we'll get some a lag issues here wag issues\nCome I Do run the worse we were actually gone you know who's coming to the White House he's been terrific guy you know he loves what we're doing for\nAfrican American jobs for so many different things maybe as many as you say that at all time high poverty level at the fast rate meaning the lowest rate so far and ... is a smart guy\nCandidate smart guy who says that\nKind of upset [laughter] those will be the one of the hat the hat ride horse wanna\n[noise] so I have a ton of respect for people like Jared Kushner and this is the guys who get stuff done behind the scenes don't look for praise\nA lot like ... I oh yeah yeah a lot of ... you have to wonder if he's out there and that's what I meant to just I was\n[noise] things get a golf club for Jim sharp [noise]\nHe's a jerk Christian or the ... [noise]\nEspecially pretty good I'm In\nA sense so weird and I know I'll eat all these words it's fine and people like ... who are actually trying to get something done right and working with someone that otherwise they may disagree with like a crash anymore but finding common ground and doing that and it's the weirdest thing about democratic\nAlternate parallel universe where Trump still got elected but Democrats run insane they could have really worked with President Trump resident job was it a New York city Democrat but they totally could've found common ground with him\nAnd done some or maybe even\n... jumped to more democratic and Republican exactly but is it they went out of a Trump\nI think responded accordingly right but I'm plus they're calling for this type of bipartisanship and civility early as they were calling us we'll do it for something that that really most people should agree with and um [noise] they'll attack everyone for\nTwo minutes let me show the story quick about memory and then we can be done with our memory study that we've been doing for like last two or three weeks ago Eric is on his I oh yeah I was just thinking this Taylor Swift thing\nComing out might be a get back at the at a\nA Kanye West\nBecause\nYou don't want was saying you know what you don't be a great story\nHold on yeah\nYou think so is it a possibility I mean ... I never heard that ... like president vice president ticket twenty twenty or twenty miles what year are you thinking about it I agree yeah he yeah way behind you write the story arc it all the way back around [noise]\nWow [noise] glove\nWhere your head that Eric day you might you are if Jim is the ... Christian Slater show you are the avant\nGarde wow wow [laughter] do they have like a chunk of isolation congratulations to you sir I appreciate\nThat what's miles\nNo line Barry [laughter]\n... Baron [laughter] fall asleep in the larger interest [laughter] so\nWe're doing this this this ethic me to analysis that no one o'clock hour I look over ... miles\n[noise] trying to put\nTogether so they ... up to a guy like every single one day one [laughter] home right now\nAre are his his memory thing real quick um\nThat article I read that said the other day about from a sea Gleason about the movie seven\nYou guys member the movie seven Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman\nOh our over to on this we don't know movies you're always come to us I'm not a big movie guy either I never see snow [laughter] I'll tell you what after we have our dinner date\nYes ... ... talk tomorrow during the movie uh-huh oh yeah yeah I'm In no yeah you too far [laughter]\nMovie most story one really makes sense you gotta worry about the seven deadly sins so very short of this uh this guy ac Gleason distinctly remember as a certain seen his whole life is on the movie back in\nNineteen Ninety five for the for the whole life is distinctly remembered this scene and every once in a while would pop back up and is that it was the scene about ... and if you've ever remember if you remember the movie\nBy so he remembers over and over and it or not or would all the time but every once in a while I remember the\nSame so we saw the movie again the other day and it seems that there\nWas like well what I wouldn't do it so where's the thing is that the movie so he ended up watching the director's cut afterwards and it turns out the director says that the drive to this movie seven all the time people come up to them talking about scenes there aren't in the movie", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "09"}
