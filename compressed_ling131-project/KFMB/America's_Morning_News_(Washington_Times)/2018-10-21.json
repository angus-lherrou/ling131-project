E. offer I said\nFree offered today from purity products no strings attached to this is a free offer from a reputable company that's been in business for years just you need the phone number as soon as we tell you more about ha\nNow you see there's a youth molecule in the human body and then it holds the key the visible signs of age you know you've written about this you've traveled to Japan to do the research so so tell me about what is what exactly is this molecule you're talking about\nIt's amazing that most people don't know this word ... acid and of course it's made it's all over our body it's in our skin it's an all natural molecule we can get it orally replace it in our body\nBut more so we've learned that the little bit that we can get as a dietary supplement can trigger your body to make more\nAnd of course why do we need more well when we're young we're loaded with this stuff when we're babies\nWe have what we call baby fat it's really baby H. S. A. it it makes a well as babies fall down and get cuts and scrapes you notice they never really get any lifelong scars from that because they have lots of H. A. on board highly ironic gas it\nAnd to make this easy to understand for the audience I think we can all appreciate\nThat women have smoothing skin thicker hair and so on all of that is because estrogen sends a signal to make more ha and that's why the girls\nHave more limber flexible Joyce they can get in a kind of a load of posture kind of the men can't get into they\nThey certainly have all of those advantages and it's because the estrogen sends a signal to make more ha now women have more ha to lose than men do and you see the skin traveling up the joints and so on as women age but there's a way to get it\nHave more ha to lose the men do and you see the skin traveling up the joints and so on as women age but there's a way to get it back and of course purity products for years now has been talking about ha and they have a new formula just for the joints\nH A joint formula and it's so important today because\nI think everyone's confused an article in the New York times says consumers are confused what to do to support their joints took people are looking for alternatives we need cushioning in between the joints the bones in our joints when a doctor looks at an X ray all he's doing is measuring the space between\nThe two bones there in the knees so it's about a quarter of an inch space without that cushioning\nYou've got bone rubbing on bone\nThat's what H. A. is it's the jello or the cushioning agent in between our bones\nWe lose it either due to wear and tear or age and so we start getting problems the more that we find pain relief\nThe more pain relievers we use the more we're going to use these joints and then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed this people who chronically use pain relievers\nSo we were there taking pictures and interviewing people win eighty three year old Mr ... she became driving and on his motorcycle to deliver his vegetables to the fruit market pat where do we have in the United states eighty three year olds\nDriving their motorcycle down to the vegetable market we don't have it we followed him\nTo his home Oreos up on a thirty foot ladder\nTrimming a tree he works in the fields about four to six hours a day and he introduced us to his neighbor who was Ninety years old without a wrinkle on his face neither of them he was reading glasses\nAnd of course uh he works about six to eight hours out in the field every day this was remarkable I almost fell out I was in some sort of a place where the dinosaurs are still living or something that was so remarkable\nThese people just exhibit a youthful this a a flexibility in their joins certainly helpful mess\nThat we just don't see everywhere else in fact it was so remarkable that the emperor of Japan actually has visited this village pictures were taken there you could see them all over the village there as they had posted him so\nThis had stood out and of course Connie Chung or ABC News twenty twenty had gone to visit there in the year two thousand and this was originally on television you could see the actual pictures for yourself\nBut the ha revolution has come here pat and of course we've had three years of use of ha but we could lose people in the science so they want to know what's real is this for real\nWell it's real for Tom's who writes to us a pharmacist now from Santa Cruz California Seventy years of age participating in the whole lie Iron Man contest in Kona, Hawaii this past year\nSeventy years old he said this new ha formula for the joints did a great job not certainly a pharmacist with no here's John writing to me and saying you know at age fifty five boy when I tried ha I'm now back to playing full court basketball but the twenty year old\nAnd I've even begun to jog again these are the kinds of reports that we here\nLet me ask you a question here you mentioned the glucose I mean and there's another one that is pretty popular MSN how does this agency stack up against those other ones the other ones you have to take them for a while before you even see any results\nDo and most of these are very positive dietary supplements they certainly have\nLots of benefits glucose main takes quite a while to kick in MSN is a wonderful sulfur compounds and again it's an anti inflammatory as are many things like fish oil ... these are all wonderful\nBut they're not dealing with the origin of the problem the origin of the problem is the loss of cushioning and the joy and if we can just replaced it if we can find a way to get that cushioning back that's what we call usefulness that's what we had when we were young\nHere's David right into me from New York twenty five years looking for something that would help support\nHis lower back and of course he said I Can't believe it now he says I Can't thank you enough for this product people have tried all the alternatives they've searched everywhere else pat and they haven't heard of ...\nNow the reorder raids on AJ sort of tell me the things aren't phenomenal the product works the study shows how but what are the customers and what are they telling you candidly what are they seen bill sorry if\nThe horses come back to the trough there must be good water there it's amazing to me how people say just keep sending death it's wonderful it changed my life\nBack to the trough there must be good water there it's amazing to me how people say just keep sending death it's wonderful it changed my life\nHere is Lorraine saying I Can't believe it but I'm able to run I Love it run five miles a day my skin nails are great\nTelling everybody about these are on the line you can go see some of these comments purity product has it on line where people just log in and tell you these aren't edited in any way\nHere's Brent writing says no one that purity products made an outlandish claim about ha joined formula but three days after I started taking it I noticed the difference this stuff really works it's your own personal discovery that's why purity product want you to have this free bottle offer\nYou call nobody's gonna how do you call that number they're going to send you a free bottle a full month supply you just kick in a few bucks for the shipping and your going to experience this for yourself like that people\nWho've written in and set all these wonderful things there's Harold eighty fifth year he says I'm In and says I'm doing very well\nOn H.

also what we called cardio protective\nIt helps to protect the heart it helps to maintain normal healthy cholesterol and one last thing that is really kind of astounding is that ... actually causes your body to produce what are called neuro protective factors in the brain so\nIt causes your body to produce these\nAgents in the brain that protect the actual issue of the nerves in the brain itself there's almost nothing else that we know of that does this specifically the B. C. M. Ninety five that you mentioned offers about seven times the absorption\nOf any other ... human extract so\nWhen you take two hundred fifty milligrams of this stuff you get about seven times the activity that you would if you took say a comparable amount of another Kirk human extract so this in my opinion is\nOne of the most life and Hansing protective totally beneficial substance is on earth and it has just decades of scientific and medical studies to back it up\nChris I Know that we talked about the green tea in the car cumin your new green she she aren't liquid ... formula which purity is given away for free today the first\nTell me about the third nutrient on the list the risk ritual which is super hot right now here was on some of the headlines in the science behind her spiritual I notice from red wine and the French love it but why is it on your shortlist\nWell Rivera trial is one of those remarkable compounds that I just sort of shake my head at how many different things that does\nIt is found in grapes in wine grapes it also shows up and cranberries what we know about resveratrol is that like green tea and also like Kirk human extract\nIt's profoundly antioxidant but more than that it shows significant properties when you look at some of the things in the body if that happened during aging as a result of fat accumulation\nIn tissue and insulin insensitivity resveratrol helps to protect against those things it's a powerful immune regulator and you know our immune system is responsible for keeping us healthy it is remarkably beneficial for the heart and this is why it's\nConsidered one of the key is to the so called French paradox you know the French drink a lot of red wine they eat a lot of cheese they smoke cigarettes and they stay slim and they have good cardiovascular health which just seems completely unfair but is there a trial appears to be key in that and additionally\nThere is a brain benefit like there is with the court's human\nWith blood flow to the brain so when you take resume or a trial you get rain blood flow this means you get more oxygen to the tissues of the brain your brain cells stay healthier longer your mind is clear sharp and focused\nSo this is on my short list for all those reasons and for about a dozen more that we're just plain take too long to explain\nAgain we're talking with Chris ... also known as the Indiana Jones of natural medicine sometimes called the medicine hunters well Christmas laser in on how this wonderful formula you greeted in conjunction with ...

R. today we'll get that number out in a few minutes but first what does the C R D and foreign second you design this formula in a liquid soft you why do you like the liquid soft technology so much\nOkay first questions first it's called green tea CPR which is short for green tea Kirk human\nAnd ... all the big three ingredients that are in this product and meaningful protective amount the recent that it's in a liquid soft shell is that that allows for rapid end very complete absorption\nI'm not suggesting that there's anything wrong with tablets or capsules that contain powders because there isn't but when you have a fluid soft shell you just happen to get more quick break down of the capsule more rapid absorption and to some extent more complete absorption\nInto the intestines that means that your body utilizes more of the ingredients in the supplements so green T. C. R. as green tea\nKurt ... and the reason for a liquid soft shell is it's just a superior dosage form especially for these three particular ingredient\nOf course before we tell our listeners how they get their very own complementary bottle with ... ... if you wanted to buy this green tea plus the ... bc um Ninety five per human plus there was very rich will I mean you spent close to probably least Seventy five dollars for all three bottles in store\nPlus the patented B.
