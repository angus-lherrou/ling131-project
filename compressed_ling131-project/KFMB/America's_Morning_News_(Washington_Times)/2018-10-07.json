statement you and I were looking for an update to the story a\nJust a little while ago and we did that during this past break and a Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell saying that all senators will have an opportunity to review the report\n... over the next couple of rice as we go back and you know because the the cloture vote could happen you know late friday so they could take all day Thursday and all day friday\nA and I suspected that while he may not allow multiple copies to be made again there's only one single copy\nThat he could easily say well OK over the next couple of days we'll we'll take our time with it and it won't be the the one hour restriction a you know maybe a each of them can go into that room are either as a group or individually and they can you know take their time with it\nUm and and they likely will do that but I'm I'm guessing they will do that either and one large group or or smaller groups even a in order to to see everything\n[noise] uh we had seen the story of late yesterday that the top FBI a lawyer a James Baker offers explosive testimony on a normal handling of the Russia probe into the Trump campaign uh and that's a Fox News headline from uh yesterday was going through additional\nMaterials here in the last hour and saw the he'll dot com and John Solomon\nOf who I Believe was with the was a circa ... ... yeah when when they when they release the ... they were the ones that desert or ... or a car to write new I Believe it was both of them that did the story on the Pfizer courts rebuke in the Obama administration this goes back to ... way back in May of\nOf of twenty Seventeen well his story goes to the specifics of it and the specific of the allegation will get into the the the details of it but here it is this the first line congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met\nWith Democratic Party lawyers that's Perkins Kuwait\nYou don't ah you you've got to be careful I guess which way you go keep in mind in the house things may be working for Democrats according to the polls maybe right now but in the Senate\nThere's a lot of close races and there's no one you know talking about a blue wave in the Senate so you have to assume that McConnell still going to be in place uh in the new year but the point being\nA Democrat doesn't want to go out and blatantly violate that rule\nAh because they know internally that's going to create a lot of problems for them going forward\nI'm not saying they won't do it but but uh there's a huge disincentive for them to to to do that but you probably could see them saying look and it it's going to be this it's already this from the liberal media or NBC News on on Wednesday\nWell there are dozens of people thousands of people I think they said over forty people\nThat have said that that that have ah have information at potentially they could be witnesses that is one of the words they use potentially and their story or that that could help substantiate all these claims and blah blah blah\nThat's not how this works they don't get to control that but the but nonetheless that will be the narrative and you'll probably see a couple of senators or during the day on Thursday or friday more likely on friday as they try and hold up an elevator doors open\nThey're going to try and and block they're saying this was not enough the the we need of a greater background check they did an interview enough people uh they didn't talk to Ford or\nKavanaugh there's new allegations that are coming out yeah uh that are uncorroborated too so we need to investigate them since there is no cooperation we need to find the ... I mean it's going to go down to the ... but\nI I I Do believe that because the uh Republicans most likely want to abide by the rule that Democrats will do everything they can to claim\nExample is Adam Schiff has done all along and Adam Schiff for not on this but Adam ships and who will be talking about uh the whole of Russian collusion investigation coming up in the bombshell\nA out of a of a DC uh yesterday about the James Baker mhm uh apparently telling the house or the house uh uh I don't know which paddle it was but uh in in test closed door testimony yesterday\nToday telling them he talked to the Democrats the Democratic national committee's lawyers right before they got a warrant right and and and James Baker top FBI official a at that time which without question shows that politics played a part any talk to them about\nWhat was going on me talk to the DNC lawyers about the Trump Russia collusion investigation that was going on which is at some little league the wrong thing to do right\nNow you cannot nobody can defend that in an investigation so it's getting to where you and I asked questions over a year and a half ago\nIs this where this is going and we ... you know the thing is every question that we asked about where this where what might have happened here in what they might be investigating every single thing that we asked the question on has come true\nIt is it's all come out in a in a series of reports you know if you look at it did it work well at least it's it's there has been people the media has looked into those questions I guess we can say right um that\nWell first of all one of the first questions\nThe big question really was there a potentially is there are we looking at possibly a gross abuse of power\nUnder the previous administration that that uh a person or persons knowingly used false information to which is a the Giuliani pointed out you know there's a there you have it there's your your your perjury\nUm but they they in soliciting for\nBats are Pfizer court warrant\nAnd we'll get to that coming up falling off the top of the hour my point that Adam Schiff is though Adam Schiff\nHas claimed for the longest time that there is collusion their ... and since we can't see it he's able to claim that there's collusion and out of the feeling the Democrats do the same thing here claim that there is evidence yeah you know in this because the Republicans won't release it so if they won't release it all they know the Republicans won't release of because Republicans\nYou know a in a in the in the Senate want to keep\nA this ruling affect that hey we can't be black but not every background check we do have every ... of of every judge we're not going to do that\nAnd so I Believe they'll use it to their advantage and may force the Republicans to release it here\nIn the next couple of days I Believe that will be one of the tactics that we will see tomorrow I Wish you and I could finish the show here\nIn the next twenty minutes and we could just repeat the ... the first two hours the rest of the show go home get some sleep and then wake up at seven AM so we can be up all day tomorrow because I really don't want to miss any of what's going to be going on but uh I I really think that\nYou may see that led set right do you go to markets in Virginia\nMarcus welcome you're on run I Radio Welcome to the show Hi [noise]\nHow you doing [laughter] hey I just what you say an Adam Schiff should be investigated I think he's been a leak in the old time he may into [laughter] I Know yes I mean well I don't know if you ask for it right we all believe yes I mean\nI grew up in a a whole family a Democrat my whole life and even even my father lifelong Democrat my sister my brother and all everybody [noise]\nThey're they're like totally disgusted with what has happened with the Democratic party yeah yeah I can I don't think it's going to last I mean they they ah overplay their hand well they went off the rails said\nThey did but keep in mind markers and and and thank you for the call we all share is a\nBig big old there hey my I got two kids in college fake socialism the greatest thing in the world\nOh sure and and that's what's going to keep the insanity alive that's why it's not really there I don't see them coming back from where they are a because this is now the mainstream the mainstream has to follow look [laughter] uh it doesn't matter a who's a protester is what the causes\nParty the protestors the far left now leads the party they leave the media they're\nVery active in the media like they're part of the media you know that's what the ah you know they were saying former\nCNN officials or or or management uh including Ted Turner\nAre saying they become a scene has become too political and Jeff Greenfield coming out saying who used to run CNN coming out saying you know it's these the people at CNN believe they are part of the anti Trump resistance their activists as we've we've known for a while but\nThis is not going to change but it's not going to end they're not going to they may have overplay their hand here but what they'll tell us we didn't do enough\nWhat they'll tell you as we didn't ramp up enough\nAnd even if he's confirmed this weekend\nAnd we move on from this don't believe that they're empowered because they at least got the delay got they got they got the supplemental background check done and all of that they put the pressure on Trump and and they were able to manipulate\nTrump and the Republicans although it's Jeff Flake and that's that's going to\nBe around it but on the the other side they're going to know\nOr that they're in they're in trouble because because at the Supreme Court at this point than you have\nA a a five four maybe not on everything that would be viewed as originalist store construction in stores they call it conservative which would I think is mislabeled ... of it but they will ah ah you know it's going to it they know\nThat if Trump is reelected in twenty twenty that's why I think they're going to go up up the insanity or whether they win or lose any seats or whether they take over the house or whatever there is going to be pure insanity from now till twenty twenty\nBecause they know that if there's it between now in twenty twenty if there's a Supreme Court a seat that opens I we've seen how insane it's been now where they're promoting the fact that there is no presumption of innocence saying Hi why this is where they are right now so how far would they go\nWho knows but they don't ... I Can't\nI don't think they can imagine Trump being president until twenty twenty four because then there's a possibility of two more Supreme Court seats that was your civil they moderate their message in order to maybe be able to win\nOr will they just up the insanity for the next two years\nYeah the uh the Trojan Horse or a tactic oh we'll just moved to the middle a little bit in order to gain power right which is what they used to do\nThat is what I said yeah but they pretend that moved yeah middle ... six six nine to ride I [noise]\nWas bug bore read are ready to do with a record theory McNamara [noise]\n\nProfessional drivers your favorite magazines are now on stands and ready for you to read cover to cover truckers connection offers great jobs entertainment industry news each month\nJob opportunities for owner operators is easy to spot with a hot right on the cover and the best career options for truck owners inside find truckers connection and job opportunities free at metros traveled centers of America will toes and other truck stops nationwide\nTruckers connection and job opportunities for owner operators we're searching for greener grass just got easier [noise]\nAmerica's find Seventy five years faces am Devon than be San Diego's talk radio\nNews\nHe's CBS News on the hour and sponsored by Tara works relief\nI'm Jim Taylor controversial confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court celebrated campaign style by the president needs some Mendez victory for our\nKevin O's confirmation a state of complete once Republican Susan Collins let her yes vote me no she tells CBS face the nation fan\nOverwhelming on both sides I heard from people that I haven't heard from in many many decades and I and I heard from a lot of protests are sense well as people who support my sense\nOf the entire spectacles so big so emotional political analyst Larry Steinman produce a lasting political effect of a\nTrump base has been organizing motivated to get out to vote potentially put a wall up against the little way whether women are so motivated by the confirmation of judge Kavanaugh that they will go out large numbers organized get out the vote vote and ultimately put a Democratic majority in either in the house or Senate\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo wrapping up another trip to North Korea by most accounts the luncheon date with Kim Jong un went pretty well CBS is Errol Barnett\nSecretary palm pale had a wall not welcome by North Korean officials this time around than back in July when Kim and Kim Jong un effectively stood him up\nThis time Kim shown and secretary Pompeo had a two hour lunch they appear to be quite cordial with each other in front of cameras for cameras then told to leave the room\nUnrest at the highest levels of the Catholic Church\nCanadian cardinal has rationing in three page letter accusing in Italian archbishop will hold on paper promises to resign\nMounting a political ... job devoid of real foundation cardinal Marc ... sat in his letter\nArch fish of caught it on my ... the guy knows accusations that the what the ... of us heart and all the I don't my parents misconduct for years\nMounted to count on me and he had a nation sending a castle ...

the omega three super pill does three incredible things first can lower your cholesterol safely and naturally by up to Fifteen Percent in his little was four weeks now that's amazing it's something no other fish oil product can do\nIncredible I thought about that and I thought about that why would nature devise a system that made that much vitamin D that quickly and if you look at levels that people like lifeguards or roofers gardeners or something they're levels or fifty or sixty or Seventy\nSo that's a natural level and studies very clearly show if you want your level to be ideal your blood levels to be fifty or sixty you have to take five thousand units a day two thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up till maybe thirty two but five thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up to fifty and if you take less than that\nYou'll get some benefits of vitamin D but you will not get the full benefits\nAnd how do I know if I'm vitamin D deficient I mean other than there is a blood test right\nRight there is a blood test and luckily more and more doctors are ordering tests the problem with getting a blood test is first you have to get your doctor to agree to it and then your doctor has to know something about vitamin D and many of them are really too busy to read the current research right then you have to go and have a blood test done\nAnd then you have to go back and have the doctor interpreted and you hope that by the way that Dr order the right test\nThere is there an easier way are their symptoms I could look for the show me pat you're probably I'm not a lifeguard so chances are right and I'm not a not a roofer so probably gonna be vitamin D deficient but under symptoms I can look for\nNot having enough energy is a common one aches and pains that doctors can't diagnose is another one interest only and another is your muscular skeletal system how kind of ready you feel even your performance on the athletic field will talk about that later then I have a paper coming out and\nAbout a week talking about vitamin D effect on athletic performance how sharp you feel mentally whether whether sometimes you're in a fog it seems like you're just not thinking straight vitamin D is crucial\nShall for brain health those are the most common symptoms but it's important to understand that most people who are vitamin D deficient won't have any way of knowing it because they've been deficient for so long they think the way they feel and the way they think\nAnd Wally move is normal yeah so you can't go by symptoms\nNow you've written that vitamin D deficiency is probably the single most overlooked problem we face when it comes to to our health how can you see something that's wrong I mean what what's the scope of the problem here in the U.S\n[noise] well more and more studies are showing virtually everybody is vitamin D deficient of course it all depends upon how you define that I mean if you define vitamin D deficiency is anybody less than thirty\nThen about a half of Americans are vitamin D deficient but but many people many scientists now thinking the ideal level is forty and many of us now think actually the ideal level is closer to fifty and if you use the cut off the fifty than Ninety seven percent of Americans are vitamin D deficient\nYeah let me ask you this when when people started supplementing properly supplementing vitamin D was the product like purity products getting that five thousand I use per day what kind of a difference if they gonna knows he's going to make them feel better\n[laughter] yeah that's probably the first thing that they'll noticed as an effect on their feelings of wellbeing and moved by well being I mean this feeling that\nYou know you want to live you know in some ways what's the point of going on for a month a month to month where you you know you get up and go is gone and you're you just don't really feel like doing anything you know you're not excited about anything anymore you your mood level is low in and that's one of the first thing that\nAnd the clues that we had a sort of interesting the clues we had to move are very similar to the closed we have for heart healthy are going to talk about that later but\nBut people who live the closer you live to the equator the better your mood the higher you live closer to the sun so the higher the altitude you live at the better your mood\nAnd mood improved in the summertime so mood improved in the summertime and worse than in the wintertime now those are clues that vitamin D was somehow involved\nBut just recently there have been a number of studies listen to this and the American Journal of geriatric psychiatry they looked at hundreds of people this is what they found they found that people with the lowest vitamin D levels\nWere eleven times eleven times more likely to have a low mood and then professor Randall nice at the University of Toronto actually did an intervention will study where he gave about three hundred patients four thousand units of vitamin D for a year or so\nAnd what stood out with their feelings of wellbeing and ... ... they're feeling of wanting to live life\nAnd they can feel a difference when they start to supplement Ropper language she takes about a month I let me let me get this special offer because I'm watching the clock here purity has put together fantastic offer you've got the vitamin D at the recommended dosage the five thousand I use per day\nAnd you also ask them to combine it with their omega three fish oils and there's a reason for that I Want you to explain that the synergy you get they seem to make each other even work better plus you're really excited about the fact that you talk to them into a pretty good how are you paying for shipping and the shipping deals pretty good\n[noise] yeah when I approached purity I said you know vitamin D needs again at the the special form of vitamin K that expensive foreign vitamin K to it needs to pour on and I want it to be patented bore on and it needs magnesium and it needs think\nAnd we'll talk about why that's important but then I said it also needs fish oil there to work together synergistic play\nAnd this is what I Want you to do I want you to give away a bottle of vitamin D a month's supply that sixty castles\nIn a bottle of molecularly distilled ultra pure fish or I Want you to give it away for free and they kind of laugh then they said okay I Will do it then\nAnd they asked me why and I said because in a month most people will feel the difference and they'll come back for more but then I said you know I don't want any Nineteen Ninety five shipping and handling charge I don't want any fourteen Ninety five shipping and handling charge I don't want even a nine Ninety five shipping and handling what did you get\nLess than five dollars they agreed to a shipping and handling charge you for Ninety five is up to him for four Ninety five you get a free bottle of vitamin D a month's supply of the complete formula one you can't buy anywhere else in a month's supply of fish oil\nWhen it gets to lose right right what do you have to lose and the reason the purity agree to do this is because the executives are now themselves have been on this formula and they themselves know and that you'll feel so much better after a month that you'll come back for\nMore it's one thing I like about the surety their old school they put their money where their mouth is do they do business the way companies used to do business you're in this country there are so doggone confident their

to see once they go from being vitamin D deficient as you say or to becoming vitamin D deficient how should they be feeling what should the see differently\nWell the first thing that you'll notice there's a feeling in your wellbeing and you're just thing clear but as time goes on if you'll notice differences in your gums in tea\nAnd if you ask anybody who's taking this product and it's taken it for several months just ask them about their fingernail asked them what the change with the different than your fingernail now these are things you can experience through the now\nWhen does it do to your fingernails grow quicker\nThey become harder they become less critical really shiny or it's really a remarkable changing your finger enough but it takes more than a month because it takes about

heart\nBlood pressure muscles spraying brain activity prostate health breast health colon health bone marrow teeth in gums kidney lung retina skin\nStomach uterus I mean I could go on but again because activated vitamin D is a theory hormone it can affect all these organs because there's two thousand genes that it is the key to those genes\nAnd it depends upon which Oregon it is and which gene is involved so there's two thousand mechanism of action that's very important to understand because you know we'd been jaded with vitamin claims vitamin C. and vitamin either going to feel better
