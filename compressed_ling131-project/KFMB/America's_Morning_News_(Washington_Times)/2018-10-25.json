national\nScene with was bridesmaids and sort of this foul mouth the noxious character and she did really well playing that character in a whole slew comedies that have come out over the last you know

then outright forging personal letters from everyone from standing Bryce\nTo uh know coward and selling them from a good amount of money until of course the FBI come after her prefer also is this kind of a down movie it's a lower key movie it's certainly a comedy at times but it's it's definitely dramatic because it has comedic moments especially between\nA Melissa McCarthy and Richard II grant who kind of leaves her partner in crime throughout the whole thing but it's\nIt's a it's an acting spotlight and as we're leading into award season it certainly is an attempt to maybe get some awards for Melissa McCarthy she's actually quite a fantastic in this movie\nOr a little bit Duffy at times it was a little bit maybe more for the literary crowd if you remember a you know the movies movies that I Would have read about ah my my father would have been reading about and variety\nOf a sense that there's a subplot here about forging letters how many stamps or you're going to give them\nLet's give
