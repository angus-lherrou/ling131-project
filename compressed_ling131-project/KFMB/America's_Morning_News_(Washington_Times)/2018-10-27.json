written by liberty a better the mega millions jackpot while you're not being told the truth not being told the truth yes ah in an effort\nTo create jackpots like this one lottery officials have not only made it harder to win\nBut have continued to lie to us about the benefits of the lottery ... about half of Americans play the lottery according to the most recent survey compared to almost Seventy percent of people in the Nineteen eighties\nYou know that doesn't make sense though because I often told the story in the Nineteen eighties I remember I was going to a party ... and I stopped by this liquor store to pick up a bottle of us were Christmas Party and there was apparently some lottery going on but I didn't even know about it because ... ... that's not\nTo to use a cliche the lotteries never even on my radar really is right I'll pass by it as I'm doing show prep for the show but it's something that's never been on my radar at all mhm\nSo there I was in the liquor store and I just immediately I as I got it for about a second I stood in the real long line of about twenty five people\nBut as soon as I got on the line I didn't even look to see what if they were holding bottles or whatever I just saw the long line mhm twenty five people there and I just stood up and got no no no you appear why am I going to cut goes no no no you're buying alcohol\nNobody in line for alcohol the liquor store\nEverybody is in line for the lottery tickets yeah never forget that once I started thinking we're laced with alcohol you already know you're a loser or the way back no\nJust looking at traffic one wasn't a dog it was a coyote and it was just thinking to myself man it's crazy you know you've got all this wildlife like you said it's it's all spread out yeah and you know in this neighborhood here there's wild animals all the time you took a coyote come\nYou think it's a cat but [laughter]\nWe didn't work but it's more like as as somebody when they came over to my house one time and they'd seen pictures of my cat that came over and they said that's not a cab I said it talking about the ... it's the panther fan [laughter] I'm pretty sure he was hanging out [laughter]

says to show gays killing was premeditated will say about the owners of a bakery will appeal to the U.S Supreme Court the EPA report on ethanol that came out we never got a chance to talk about it\nA lot of a ... yesterday and just are are complete and total election coverage and everything that's going on and and I think it's important because we talked about the polls but I think it's more important to talk about the issues\nThat may be affecting what's going on the stock market yesterday in the volatility of the stock market\nYou know caterpillar not worried why because they're building their parts more expensive why the terrorists we look at issues that could possibly affect\nAnd hurt the Republicans one of the things that we didn't talk about yesterday was the farmers yeah farmers aren't happy because of the tariffs look you may you may have destroyed family farms that have existed for a long time\nA big because you have taken away because of the terrorists taking away their supply chain yeah and as we told you win even though the president came out and said okay we're going to free up money for them they said that's not going to save us right because that doesn't that doesn't make up for the last is that right ... and the fact that we're not we're going to be shut out of the supply chain\nThat for ... and we don't know for how long I mean are they could lose their livelihood with farmers I mean this is for them if it is their livelihood so that that towers over Kavanaugh and the caravan and and and anything else that might influence votes\nAnd this is they could lose their lively and you've had a ton of small businesses out there that have been affected by the tariffs on steel and aluminum tariffs you think about that I find that I'm hit them in any industry\nIn any region right and in our region its its oil and gas put a farming ah and in the mid west\nThere are every ... every other business is essentially related to that economy the farming economy so it's not just the farmers but it's the other yet uh businesses in that area that are supported by the\nInternet and that's an unknown quantity right I don't know how you figure I don't know how a lot of these things I don't know how you figure it in and\nCome up with the formula as to what's going to win in in two weeks all I can tell you is the issues\nThat have a great probability of affecting the election both on the Democrats' side as we spend a lotta time on and also the Republican side for what it could hurt the Democrats and what could hurt the Republicans

now that will be ... analyzing\nA you know everything that that uh has gone on I mean there are ... you get every single day I mean I saw\nYou know that uh oh okay that looks like now that the Republicans are going to lose the house yesterday but then I saw other articles dating well no that's not the case and that's why we'll bring you the polls and will tell you what they say\nWe really don't make predictions what we will tell you is the issues and the events that we believe will affect the outcome of the election yeah uh I've always said for me it's very hard\nTo figure out what people are going to do on election day for me just yeah I mean everything the pollsters may ... you know believe in some of the pollsters do get a get a dump a pretty good especially in a presidential election but they've missed major elections as they did for example in Ninety or where they weren't even ...\nOver the summer on a national poll the Democrats had ten point lead over the Republicans now it's down to four so we'll see where that goes within two weeks for cover electronics here's your forecast\nIf you're not familiar with the term nor Easter it's what a good portion of the east coast calls a pretty significant storm with wins out of the north and east\nAnd that's what's moving up along the east coast today and steering those wins right into the shores of New York New Jersey on the Delmarva will see heavy rain and the region today from the Carolinas all the way up through well at least Long Island\nAnd then back into the Appalachians as far as near Columbus ohio a good part of the country though is drive from the Mississippi all the way over to the Rockies will see clear skies today for the northern central and southern plains including Texas\nThe Bible that my tax rate in my town is higher than a quite a bit higher than yours I Believe I'm\nA yeah my my tax rate is is very low which is why it's one of the most attractive areas in terms of people moving to it um but even aside from that if you've got a a home that's worth more than ... your your taxes are higher\nAnd lower rate right so when when you see that and you see the number of of of people and and remember ... ... the the the people that will be at that edge\nA aren't the we're not talking the super rich weren't hotline about what is viewed in many of these high income areas and as solid Republican voters some who are in the middle to upper middle\nClass right and they're getting hit and they don't like it and what's their only recourse right now there's still a supporter\nOf Trump well what's their recourse to send the message my Republican congressman mhm and we've always we worried about that from the very beginning\nI don't know how it's going to affect I'm simply bringing up the issues out there that when it comes to people's individual budget when it comes to bend paying more money I don't care who you are nobody wishes to do that\nEven though won't change everybody's vote it has the potential of changing five percent of the vote yeah which makes the entire difference in a house election\nSo that's that's a you know that's one thing we've talked about the Democrats and we've talked about what what they face the whole cabinet thing\nI'm just the insanity that has come a out of the uh the the Democrats the ... the the the fact that they plan and this was the one thing that may bud ... that is they're coming out bluntly and saying we're going to raise taxes\nSo many of them coming out now I'm going to raise taxes now we're going to raise taxes now we're going to raise taxes now we're going to raise the corporate tax than we need to raise taxes more we need to raise taxes they're actually admitting where they're going to raise taxes which could hurt that we've also talked about the care of that\nBut in ... in the Republican Party that's one I'm yesterday auto auto dealers see slower sales sparking fears it along expected declined is here now the economy overall\nMay not be an end and the terrorists overall may not change a significant portion of people voting in this election\nBut it will change those small business people that are being affected and\nA caterpillar a worse at the the the caterpillar story then they're they're being blunt the terrorists are telling us but the steel and and autumn the the steel and aluminum tariffs by the way that this isn't a China thing\nRight it's the United states and Europe and and and\nMexico that they're still in effect and it's killing them it's raising the price as we said\nWhen the president came out and said there I delivered for you I gave you the I gave you the the new NAFTA or whatever you wish to call it nobody's using the new name by the way [laughter] All right\nAnd and uh the his you know and the only success that that he claimed the the biggest thing that he promoted was what he did to the automobile business and we said that's unbelievable that he's promoting the fact that he has raised the cost\nOf buying an automobile in the United states Mexico and Canada and that's viewed as a good thing\nWhat was the story last week about Ford grumbling going to be losing a billion dollars and they believe the terrorists are going to ... that are hurting them remember every supplier and every small business of deals with board and the United states knows that that's coming\nOr or or a feeling it already and every dealership and every member of the steel tariffs really been affected that we're from China which has increased the cost from the beginning of the year that's actually that's actually nine months ten months old now because the steel prices were a forty percent by the time we got\nTo June of this year so you look at that you look at the fact that automobiles are going to go up in price\nBecause of steel costs and now because of terror cost and because of the new NAFTA\nOr and then the farmers as we mentioned in the last break the farmers that are being hit and you're talking about your your talk if you're talking about a\nManufacturing people with manufacturing jobs at a technical skills\nTon of those people are Trump supporters if you talk about the farmers you're talking Trump\nCountry and you're talking about farmers that are extremely upset because it's not only their current profits but it's the fact that they may be shut out of the supply chain that took them decades to get into and now it's disappeared you made the comment you said a in our personal meaning you said I Wonder if that's\nWhy he went to you know even though was wishy washy ethanol plan I Wonder if that's why he went to Iowa because by the internal polls were saying you're getting killed with the farmers right now yeah there was\nA couple of weeks ago because I Will would be basically the center of the corn belt but the farm belt ... it's not that everything is about the the votes in Iowa or any election in Iowa it's that you're trying to reach that region when you go to Iowa you're speaking to the industry\nThe farming industry not just a ethanol and corn but it's the farming industry uh you you want to reach out with that saying we're going to help the farmers\nAre and and you know in this region in this area in the state\nAnd I don't know what you do in terms of of ah of reconnecting the supply chain this is what they're worried about\nOr they need to have those farmers those companies need to have trade partners all around the globe and when those trade partners for instance when Mexico a set up a port trade with with Canada ah any nation that they're selling to those farmers\nIf they're going a different direction as a result of a threat of a tariff war terrified that went into place a or any of that if they have to make arrangements\nA lot of time a lot of time you don't get that back right away you're not you're not going to get that business back right away and that's the concern that this is why the farmers came out a couple of weeks ago and said look ah thanks but no thanks on this you know a four point seven billion dollar\nA handout we need the business the business is worth a lot more\nIt's still not making up for what our last his All right and we're ... we're we're uh we're out of the loop of the supply chain now we don't know when we're going to get back in ... I took a deck I think one of the ... was it took us decades to get into the world's supply chain\nThe supply chain now we don't know when we're going to get back in right took us deck I think one of the ... was it took us decades to get into the world's supply chain now are viewed as unreliable because they don't know what you will do\nRight uncertainty as a killer this is what we saw after the recession\nThe problem with bailing out all the banks were are putting money into all the banks the coffers of all the banks by the federal government or during the recession or in two thousand they to the end of two thousand a ... and into a two thousand nine they there were three apparently large banks that were on the brink that we're a\nPossible high risk but they didn't want to run on those banks so they put money into all of the coffers well they made all the banks look risky and that's the problem you create you muddy the waters well when you talk about trade\nTrade deals between nations that are set up\nUm you don't you don't reconnect that bridge it's like blowing up or bridge and believing you can rebuild it repair tomorrow\nYou can't\nThat's going to take a lot of planning that is going to take a lot of reassuring but if there's political uncertainty\nAnywhere in that\nThen your former customers are going to stick with someone else or another nation in this case and they're going to get their supply chain repaired\nAnd our discussion right now is not really so much on the the the substance of the economics of it it's more of the politics of\nWhat is going to be affecting this this election we talked a lot yesterday about\nHow the Republicans in so many ways were set up in a way that you don't see a political party in mid term election with a ton of positives and de opposition political party that the Democrats or a complete mess\nAnd that there are many things because the the economy right now but the majority of Americans looks really good mhm well we're talking about is the ... you know in the the impacts that starting to be felt now and making investors very where wary and a core\nConstituency of the of of Trump supporters which are the farmers that aren't happy at all now so even though there's a lot of good for Republicans right now there is still bad lurking out there\nUh when it comes to economics that there are Trump supporters that are extremely wary about where he is you know where he may be taking\nA you know the their particular economy and what's going to happen to their livelihood so we think it's very important to bring up all the issues that may be affecting this election both positive and negative for the Democrats and positive and negative for the Republicans just to give you a more realistic\nUh I I think the
