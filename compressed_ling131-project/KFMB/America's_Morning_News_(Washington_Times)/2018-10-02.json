show Chen has this report from Washington on the deal including how the agreement may affect the price we pay for dairy chicken and wheat\nAnd newly named United States Mexico Canada agreements us MCA came together hours before the October first deadline that\nDeal requires forty to forty five percent of auto content be made by workers earning at least sixteen dollars an hour and requires more of a vehicles parts to be made in North America in order for the car to be free from terrorists\nMaker Ford says it's very encouraged by this quote the benefits of scale and global reach well how to drive volume and support manufacturing jobs in a win for the U.S the deal will also open up some of candidates dairy market to us farmers that could produce better prices in the U.S for things like milk butter and ice cream\nThey must be signed by Congress within sixty days a Congress that that could include a democratic controlled house after mid term elections in ... in Washington\nJumbo Hannah and explains the new pact even further\nIs a replacement in the works for NASA gay and he has a new trade deal that would involve the U.S Mexico and Canada and that must receive congressional approval to look at just exactly what would happen we're joined by\nHappened we're joined by Dr Michael ... a professor of finance would Stockton University and the public policy analyst this would involve I gather first and foremost a number of changes regarding making automobiles\nYeah that's a big one so I'm the agreement we have what China for whatever reason as lopsided in favor of the Chinese and to our detriment China makes a car\nSales are here are we charge a two and a half percent tower if we make a car sell in China they charge us a twenty five percent to have more on some products China was even trying to get out of the two and a half percent Paris and they did that by sending a car that was three quarters of the way finish\nTo Mexico Mexico would put a couple of little things on it the hub cats then a few things and then say we produce the car in Mexico so we can sell it in the U.S without paying any towers at all\nThis agreement says that large percentages of the car and more than Seventy five percent of the car has to be made in Mexico in order to qualify for no a terrorist\nSo that and uh same thing with Canada Canada has uh some agreements that are lopsided in in their favor for instance or the dairy farmers the u._s. can produce a product and the U.S a dairy farmers can produce a product sell it for a dollar\nThere dairy farmers costs three fifty\nSo candidate want to put to protect their dairy farmers they were going to put two hundred and Seventy percent tariff on that so it's something that costs the dollar\nHas a two dollar and Seventy seven tier if it will sell for three Seventy Canadians can do it for three fifty keeps the Canadian dairy farmers in business closes the American dairy farmers out of that Canadian market this agreement begins to and that doesn't completely and it begins to end\nAnd presumably it would be a model for other deals that we do down the road they're principally a one on one with the Chinese when you appear to my nighttime talk show you indicated that some of the trade deals that we have made with other countries are just\nA business they are terribly lopsided against the United states in other words we ... we heard Donald Trump throughout the campaign and we are now starting to learn to things or at least that bad and may be worse\nWhat in your view was the motivation or my personal thought would be that the motivation has to do with the sense that\nThe United states is oh so rich and the rest of the world is also poor and therefore we owe it to other countries do shaft ourselves and uh and therefore make it easier for other countries but which is a pretty lame excuses in my view\nYes yeah I I'm not sure what exactly the motivation is but every single one of the trade agreements as lopsided in favor of the trade partner laughed at what we have with the European Union agreements with China\nSouth Korea which we sort of fixed a little bit last time a last week rather and Japan to their all lopsided and as a result of that were buying a lot of their products that are money flows out of the country\nThey're buying very few of our products are very few little of their money is flowing into the country we have a huge negative balance of trade is a tune of hundreds of billions of dollars every year\nTrump said I'm not going to allow that to continue I'm going to get people to the table quickly I'm going to create a sense of urgency to bring them to the table I'm going to slap\nTariffs on or in a stronger position than they are they're all going to come to the table and negotiate with us\nAnd I'm going to make sure we come up with a deal that is much more fair for the Americans were going to put the U.S make America great again and we're going to put America number one let's concentrate on Americans first and then we'll take a look at other people\nAnd when we look at Americans of course there are consumers of there are producers of things and I guess that the policy up till now has been pretty much one of let's give everybody a slight break on some prices\nAnd a few Americans we will simply a drive a stake through their hearts and will rip out their jobs and and uh in some cases destroy an entire communities but it only affects of you and the rest of us will get cheaper brooms isn't it pretty much the argument has been followed up till now\nThat's exactly right that if if we make things in China where they pay their workers ah they started out as a dollar a day there are a little bit uh over that but if we make things in in China instead of making it in the U.S having a shirt cost fifty dollars\nMaking in China bring it over here it only costs twenty five dollars consumers will be able to buy\nMore shirts they should have a higher standard of living and that's good for consumers in the meantime though we've decimated the textile industry we decimated that the steel industry and Trump said we're not going to do that anymore you can't think of just sucking\nConsumers in fact it's better to have consumers pay slightly higher prices and have us\nBe able to make our own textiles our own a steel rather than the way we've been doing it keeping
