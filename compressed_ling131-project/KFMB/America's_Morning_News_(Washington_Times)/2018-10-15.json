[noise] [noise]\nAm seven six K of envy [noise]\nTo a firm belief in America and American values other than doing the pledge which for some people now is becoming a lightning rod\nIt has become a very big distraction for the national football league\nOr when some athletes thought that they would respectfully show that they thought that our country needs some improvement they weren't necessarily are concerned about the pledge or the flag but just saying that you know if we're going to pledge allegiance to the flag we also need to pledge allegiance to living up to our ideals a lot of people did not liked vat including the president who\nVery quickly turned it into a political brush fire and so that has hurt everybody\nIncluding people who like to watch football games without politics so it's you know which was that inappropriate form\nBats in the eye of the beholder I Will be back to you to decide but bad as those are the issues that we are talking about this morning\nAnd it was the sort of brought to our attention because there's a case in Texas where students has refused to recite the pledge of allegiance to state has cracked down on it saying it's the law and so now there's a lawsuit challenging the rights of Texas law to mandate that you have to say the pledge of allegiance in a public school Clinton metal has some background on his round that Michaels\nIn Texas it's up to parents whether or not their child recite the pledge by state law parent or guardian can sign a waiver to let their child opt out of it but at the student didn't still can't\nSchool children cannot unilaterally refused to participate in the pledge\nMark rye lander with the Texas attorney general's office says the law gives parents or guardians of fundamental interest in getting the education and upbringing of their kids\nTexas is among twenty six states with similar statute that make reciting the pledge of allegiance a regular part of every school day furthermore sixteen other states have statutes do allow for a time to be set aside for students who wish to say the pledge of allegiance on their own\nKids he Landry sued the Houston area district after she says a principal kicked her daughter out of school for studying during the pledge of allegiance she says the law violates their free speech right according to riot lander the cases about respecting the country and the parental rank\nRequiring the pledge to be rich sided at the start of every school day has the laudable result of fostering respect for our flag and a patriotic love for our country\nThis case is about providing for the saying the pledge of allegiance while respecting the parental rights to direct the education of children\nThe gate to separate trial next year Michael\nAll right thanks Clayton level reporting on this case in Dallas and as I mentioned earlier there are some folks who are trying to ...\nFine defies all are trying to find alternate methods of\nUh expressing some appreciation for our country by not using the pledge of allegiance in San Francisco's Unified School district the last week well if they had to change they have a brand new president of the school district his name is Stefan cook\nAnd meetings that always open with the pledge of allegiance but he opted instead for a reading that he says expresses a love of country\nWhen you learn teach when you get give she credits that to a poet Maya Angelou who ah did go to a high school in ah in San Francisco and uh this guy cook says this is not a demonstration and the same way that um the some of the NFL players\nAre kneeling during the national anthem they're talking about police brutality he says\nI was looking for creative ways to express admiration for the people that make the country what it is\nAnd uh so he sort of had nothing to do with President Trump or anything like that but of course it gets controversy because some people do not like you messing around with the pledge of allegiance or there's this there's a schoolteacher in Indianapolis [noise]\nUh I have that information here and ah his name is John ... teaches history in Indianapolis and ah [noise]\nHe says that what he's done is to kind of spruce up um the the flag every day he gets somebody different from the community to come into the school to lead us or the lead the students there in the in the pledge of allegiance or they're doing the pledge but they're finding a way to make it interesting so that you don't just do it by memory or by road or because you're told to do it\nBy having somebody different a leading it he says it it makes it or something that you pay more attention to and maybe by paying more attention to what you think more about it so he's got a different approach to reviving our pledge of allegiance\nNow the thing is can you can even mandate allegiance doesn't allegiance have to be earned kind of like respect\nAnd you know we we just heard the attorney general from Texas saying he believes respect is learned by making somebody recite the pledge what do you think about that costs eight hundred seven three six three six six six when we come back in two minutes\nWe will hear what you have to think

[noise]\n\n\n[noise] well I don't know what's going on around town he gave me to have\n\nAmerica's money answers man on line at money answers dot com [noise] ah first of all it's been a bumpy ride of the late on Wall street why\nOne of the stock market went down very sharply because interest rates are rising there's concern that earnings may start going down and the future that they've been pretty strong right now that they would go down on the future um and the more about with China certainly ... concerning people as well that that's going to slow the economy when these tariffs hit on both sides\nI Want to talk a little bit about the interest rates historically correct me if I'm wrong interest rates are still very low even with the the recent fat increases in interest we've gone from almost nonexistent in Christ up to historically very low interest so\nWhat's got Wall Street so hot and bothered I mean it's not like we're talking about a a fourteen and Fifteen Percent interest like forty years ago\nWe got spoiled Jim basically because interest rates the fed reserve captain pretty much a zero\nFrom the end of the financial crisis in two thousand eight after two thousand Fifteen they've gone up seven times down from there now to two and a quarter meaning the crime rate is five and a quarter but you're a historically these are still relatively low rates particularly with the economy doing this or this well\nUh but we like zero I guess they complain when it goes up\nI guess well some of us like zero I mean and I understand that I'm On the side that that that does I I'm more of a bar where but if I Lived off of interest income which more than a few people do types have been tough of late yeah\nYou haven't been able to ... where ... live off of interest in the last few years because you've been getting pretty much nothing\nAnd that's the irony of this situation the feds been raising rates and the banks immediately pass that on in the form of higher interest on credit cards in student loans and car loans and so on but they have not been passing it on in the form of higher deposit rapes and paying the positives and you've got to do something different\nIf you're just going to sit there and the hope that the banks going to pay you five percent on a savings account not gonna happen I'll give you something I Do myself\nWhich might be of help some of the list as I Do what are called secured real estate fun when you get an eight percent ... minimum five thousand dollars but it doesn't go up and down in value their lending money the short term commercial real estate projects websites that secure real estate funds dot com because the banks are not going to raise that they're paying in any significant way\nOkay secured real estate funds dot com correct all like you mentioned that term a student loans where do we stand as regards student loans\nOne point five trillion and we had about a hundred billion in these student loans every graduation season about twenty percent of it is either delinquent or in the fall\nAnd it's a huge burden thirty nine thousand is the average amount that people are graduating with something they can do as a student I just had a high rate they could refinance it to a lower rate typically two to three percent\nIt's a place called credible that can do that so a website for that would be credible dot com slash money answers I Know it's to me that way you get two hundred bucks off your first payment because otherwise it's just crushing people Thirty years of paying all these student loan debts and in many many cases in a major they're not even involved in it or not not working them anyway\nExecutive that's the part I don't understand here at the take on the amount of debt that some people have six figures of dead\nIs not hard to do for a college education not to do that if that'd be something more than just oh I enjoy the subject matter that will be something that can can pay you back to say you make a living at it and if it just amounts to a hobby that's an awfully expensive hobby\nVery expensive hobby well the latest numbers I saw twenty seven percent of the people who are graduating in a particular major ended up working in something related to that major within a year meaning Seventy three percent do not have a lot of people are not you know using their education directly and for for something this job related\nWill society vested interest is producing productive citizens and that's why I Believe that\nThat ah the student loans in fact financial aid in general should be predicated in large part on the extent to which what you studied get you a job let's say a within twelve but some graduation and it it to something like say civil engineering where I gather there was a pretty high rate\nThen they ought to be more student money available evidence something that you can't make a living at except maybe teaching at and there are limited numbers of places for that\nThat we have no business Lindy people money for that you want to do that do it on your own died\nBut that's already been happening that's been a lot of pressure on the humanities for example because exactly that people don't feel they can come out if they're an art or theater or ... or something like that and and get a job so there's a lot of pressure on those areas\nBut I mean if you go to the academic places they say this as sacrilegious quit his saying this is not a way that's not a job training program this is\nReally it is a job training program from the standpoint of financial aid and again that it's high time we uh we realized that I had to fight a boy or China and uh the tariff war a lot of people have I think often thought of China's kind of having us over a barrel isn't really more the other way around it\nAt the moment it is we are putting more pressure on them and they're putting on us we're both putting pressure on each other we have two hundred and fifty billion dollars in tariffs products worth two hundred and fifty billion we have passed currently ten percent going up to twenty five percent on January first and it's hurting China their stock market\nHas been down to about twenty five percent so far this year and their economy is definitely starting they're much more of an export oriented economy than us we're getting hurt too but I agree China
