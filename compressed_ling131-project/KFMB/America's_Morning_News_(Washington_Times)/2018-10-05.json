Capitol Hill\nA stew of tension but you were literary this early in the morning it was it was well known that senators Steve Gaines of Montana was not going to be there on Saturday I didn't know about this until this morning I Walk in and I see that all by by the way I'm not going to be there on Saturday when you need every single Republican vote because my daughter is getting married and I have to walk down the aisle\nWas this knowing when I scheduled a vote in ... well you know\nThat that could cause them to change the hours and\nFly him back I mean that anything could happen we've had situations before they hold held a crucial floor votes open for hours and hours while they're waiting for US Senator to fly back on the ... district\nOh one one such case senator up last uh apparently a pet parent it passed away and looked at the funeral and they waited for him to come back on airplanes\nSaid yes yes so you know um this is this is a lackey situation and a stranger about a minute\nYeah he he said here I quote a that a GOP leaders caught have literally not said how they will manage his absence for the vote now the clock is ticking so they actually have a schedule that they're supposed to follow so we have a I guess a tell us about the first procedural vote today\nThe first procedural vote isn't about five hours from now\nAnd er here on the east coast five hours from now\nYes yes and uh it it's called cloture it's procedural it's a a it's a turtle that has to be able to come before they can go to the final vote cloture is basically a motion to end debate in other words it sets the parameters for the debate\nSet the hard in time and the heart and turn is thirty hours they did say thirty hours post cloture right so if we do the math that means that the final vote that after this thirty hours will come on\nSaturday but now with Steve ... situation or that kind of throws a monkey wrench into\nMaybe now they're going to be doing the wedding during the Saturday morning brunch or something I'm going to hop on a plane so the thing about cloture votes is now it happens I mean it's not it's not like a regular thing but it does happen often enough where they have to be concerned that somebody might vote for cloture\nJust to move the process along but not been go vote the way the leadership wants them to on the final vote so it's possible we could see you know all the ripple\nThe Republican senators vote for cloture just to keep this process moving and then maybe still vote against Kavanaugh when it comes to the final vote so maybe people shouldn't get too excited about what happens today the only thing\nThat would be very interesting in terms of culture of keeping in mind well you just said is if they don't get enough votes\nFor current event it fails woven then what is the what are they knew that if the benefits just isn't just over at that point\nIt is over at that point they cannot proceed to a final vote if they did not get caught your first\nTime you've been up on the hill and you've been I guess a feeling the feeling the heat and all the uh the strife up their attention now I've heard some people say that the Democrats want this thing over more than the Republicans do do you get that feeling I think\nEverybody's tired of it um I think that the Democrats are are in a situation now where they are so vehemently opposed to this nominee that if if he does get confirmed that they can use that in the midterms\nI'm as a campaign rally if he doesn't get confirmed they can use that in the mid term says the campaign\n[laughter] well it seems like a this whole nomination thing is turning some Senate races around and it may cost them there was a small chance but they at least I've had a shot at taking control of the Senate it seems to be hurting that because\nIt's turned out the Republican base the Republicans there there are ... are being used as an ... Democrats as pretty much closed which means that\nIf you are in some of those swing states they'll probably not swing this time if the Republicans turn out as much as the Democrats will\nAnd maybe they're just hoping people will forget about this and go back to being complacent by the time or the election comes along [noise] well yeah\nI mean anything is possible that it seems like\nYou know this whole thing has energized both the conservative base of the Republican Party and the Democratic base of the Democratic party because they really really are very emotional and have very strong feelings about the situation\nCylinder we're coming up at about sixteen before the hour or so I Want to quickly have you describe how this a reading of this and it's not really an investigation it's really just a supplemental investigate a supplemental background check report is not really an investigation that just took some information of course the Democrats say well you did an interview about twenty or thirty people who are witnesses and have things to say\nSome of these people have actually been calling and writing and trying to get in our waving hey FBI over here you got to talk to me I Know stuff and the FBI of course did not do it not because they probably didn't want to but because it seems as if we're getting conflicting reports\nThe White House is saying that well you know there was the senators told us to to do or who to interview and the senators are saying we had nothing to do with him so we'll\nWe'll find out when the books are written what's the what the story is there but but tell us how when this information was transmitted up to the ... up to the Senate what senators have to do to see this\nIt's a very unusual situation\nOr because of the uh heightened emotion in this particular nomination they've decided that the senators a coup by the way are probably still reading the report right now are are going to a secure room in the Senate or the capital of visitors and around the Senate side of the a\nVisitor center uh it's usually used for intelligence briefing to secure a room\nAnd it's called the skiffs and that they they that's an acronym ... actually what that stands for because it just flew out of my head but uh [laughter] the\nYou know as soon as I Know its security isn't there and facility is the last word I forgot what the other ones are for exactly but it's basically it's the cone of silence\nExactly exactly for those we remember that [laughter]\nNice to have a ... I'm very old\n[laughter] well they go into this gift a label\nOn our increments there's only one copy of the report should be shared by all one hundred senators\nI read somewhere that they were reading aloud to each other\nYeah there's a conference room in their um they've been sitting around the conference table and they've been a reading aloud different sections to each other\nOr they have they're allowed a there's only a certain number of people who are cleared to go into the skiffs and it includes like one eight and a and the senators themselves and yeah that's how they're doing it they're going in and he's one of our increments they are uh sharing this one copy\nAnd uh and it's it's ... it's a very unusual situation they're not all that they can take notes but they can't bring a note out with them they can't take any copies of the report itself out with them a Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia the Democrat who's running for reelection in ... West Virginia\nA was a key came out of the skiffs yesterday and he was\nWas the kind of he had sort of in a painful look on his face when I asked by reporters you know ... what are you going to do and he said I haven't\nDecided I'm going back again to read it tomorrow morning that would be now and ... and uh he could be in there right now\nAll right well I I understand some of the senators may end up voting before they are allowed in there to see it although uh I I Would assume that maybe if they maybe they have kept it open all night it's very interesting to find out such cloak and dagger mystery I mean it's it it gives gives sort of a of a\nCeremonial asked that ceremony or what's the word I'm looking for but if it makes it more dramatic you know when you're dealing with things like this and now you've got to go into a secret room somewhere and then they only have one copy and you can you know and they're not supposed to talk about this the public is not supposed to know whether it's in this report but I think both sides do want to release it so they were going to Republicans can say look see there's nothing\nIn there and the Republicans can say look there's nothing in there so [laughter] yeah yes exactly exactly it's it's it is very\nCloak and dagger it is very unusual um\nNormally uh FBI background checks on judicial nominees are kept private because there's some personal information at their um you know Social Security numbers things of that nature that day on public but the Democrats really wanted this to be made public with those personal items redacted
