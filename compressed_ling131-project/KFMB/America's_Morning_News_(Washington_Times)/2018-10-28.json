we're less than two weeks out found yeah from the the the mid term election I think\nGoing to be a a another fascinating time in in our history to see where this uh uh goes as I said you know you and I talked about this many many times before we don't make predictions we we looked at history of for example the midterms and then we look at the issues that we believe are driving it\nBecause I think it's very very hard you know you can look and you can look at the the the polls overall and you can give some credibility to it and we find the credibility of polls actually after an election anyone I've done that before we you know we have gotten calls we don't get as many\nBecause we have spent his time especially after a presidential elections looking at the polls that actually got it right\nAnd you know we we you know talked about the the the polls even for you know 'cause we were getting the calls after Trump's victories and they said the polls were completely off well they weren't because the polls measured the popular vote not the electoral vote right and on the popular vote you had two or three that were dead on\nAs to you know Hillary winning by what roughly two points I think it was ...\nAnd and so you know there are some polls that are that are dead on so people that say the polls are always wrong that is wrong statement to make a lot of the polls are wrong and a lot of them the sampling that they use\nA you know distort the way that America feels but some polls actually get it right it's just the fact that we don't know which of the polls get it right before an election\nWe have to wait until after so we can look at the issues that are that are affecting at a you know and another thing is and and I don't think it's going to have that much of an impact at all on this election it may\nIf if it goes on for another two years and right and this is this is where\nUh I I call it a a\nTrump exhaustion\nAnd I've I've just clean that were just popped
