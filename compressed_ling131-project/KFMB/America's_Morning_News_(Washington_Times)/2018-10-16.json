yours was that the top of the game that was the Amazon of its time and fears pioneered the whole mail order retail business there was a time when it's big catalogue can be found that almost every home if you're holding company which also owns Kmart was supposed to make one hundred and thirty four million dollar debt payment\nIn dead in a move that wasn't really a surprise fears filed for chapter eleven bankruptcy the company wants protection from its lenders while a tries to restructure the company and its debt\nSears dead holders were pressuring the company to go chapter seven and liquidate\nIn recent weeks several vendors to the ears missed a payment\nThe company was related to close another forty six doors across the U.S not too long ago it closed its last door in Chicago the company's hometown last year's was suffering law says there's more and more people shopped online it also piled on the debt\nThe company's CEO Andy leopard kept ears afloat with multiple rounds of financing his critics say he made matters worse and put his hedge fund at the front of the line to collect payments he's now in an unusual position where he's both asking for protection from lenders while seeking payment for the money to hedge fund lend to the earth Michael\nAlright thank you Steve cast and bomb coming up on Nineteen now before the hour on first light call us at eight hundred seven three six three six six six and tell us do you remember the last time that you were in Sears did you get taken there with your parents when you were a kid you know a bit Steve was giving a list of some of the things that they that they did you know they um [noise]\nOf the things that they sold they ... they actually created a lot of brand names as well and they've been selling those off\nOr you know this is something I read this morning that was a very very interesting uh the Sears catalog was something that you had to have with you if you were a spy apparently spies used it especially Eastern Europe or if they were in the Soviet Union\nA long time intelligence officer is being interviewed and one of the newspaper stories this morning and he said that agents would give the catalog to their sources\nAnd then they're Taylor's would kind of replicate the American fashions\nFashions in its pages and somehow it was a part of international espionage Sears the Sears catalog isn't that amazing of course in some areas where especially where they had outdoor plumbing Sears catalog had other uses as well I've very very useful product apparently\nSo let's go down memory lane now we're

to a close ...\nKevin Hart tongue on the story the rise and fall of Sears an American institution I ah I didn't really use the catalog myself growing up I think we had them in the house because they would just come to your house automatically once a year\nAnd Sears didn't ship their purchases right to your home the way Amazon does now your order would come to the local catalog store which I Believe was different from the department store and then they would call you and you would go pick it up\nAnd ah but I I Do remember flipping through it and you can look at all the toys and things in their page after page after page and it would give you some ideas about things that you might want to ask your parents for\nAt least that was my experience and uh I don't think I think I think occasionally I might have been brought there for a first day of school clothing but uh I remember other stores perhaps that might have been closer to our home but the thing is\nAbout a hundred and forty two of them are closing and also k-mart stores now there are also closing a bunch of k-mart stores Kmart doesn't seem to have the same hold on the imagination I'm not sure why that is maybe because it wasn't around as much or maybe it was more regional sometimes at least in years past\nBut a Sears owns Kmart and the k-mart stores are going down the tubes along with the parent company serious so it's pretty good chance that as we sit here a year from today there will not be Kmart or Sears does that matter to you\nDo you have memories of it do you miss it would you want to go into a
