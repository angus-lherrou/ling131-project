thrill rides that are out there and the holiday travel in the in general\nHow big of a deal is that how big an industry is it for a Halloween thrill rides and what kind of a spectacular special effects are available these days\nThirty years ago this really was unheard of the all the uh the southern portion of the Bible belt\nOr Mexico land or Six Flags over Texas did it nowadays you can find some of the best Halloween uh uh I I guess the facts and and different uh different events at places like universal studios are not scary farming California Kenny ... and ... west ...\nUm I guess I'll Halloween weekend cedar point which Sandusky, Ohio and of course Disney is going to be doing the Mickey not so scary Halloween parties which are great at both ... and of course a scare away the heroines and and uh North Carolina\nAnd a and once you got how this dream so there's a lot of it has become very big business and people just love going to these events\nSo I I guess age appropriate message is important for many of these things right I mean you you can't a scare the the daylights out of the some kid who's five years old\nThrough and the great part about the amusement parks whether it's summertime wintertime or even Christmas Time is that there's something for everyone at the park you've got the the really crazy rides for the kids you've got the smaller ride for the uh you know for the toddlers you've got an ethics shows where everybody really has to audition in order to actually be picked\nOn the food or you know the different types of food and plus for the older people they they list scooters now all 'cause normally takes about four or five miles of walking to visit entire park so these are these are ways that the whole family could come together in a very
