numbers between men and women but higher income families eat fast food more often than lower income families\nAnd this was really about America's workforce and uh you know we've seen a\nWages depressed for a long time and ah they're beginning to end up\nAmazon is also going to begin lobbying for an increase in the federal minimum wage\nThen it was seven dollars and twenty five cents an hour a Amazon Fifteen dollar floor is now more than twice the federal minimum wage and hopefully Congress will take action to raise that\nSenator Sanders introduced a bill last month called the stop base those act ... founded Amazon the legislation would tax large employers when their workers need to rely on public benefits like food stamps Michael\nThank you Steve cast and bomb and Bernie is happy about this by the way he put out a statement saying it was a wonderful thing and Jeff Bezos responded by thanking the senator he says we're excited about this and also hope others will join in\nIn fact they are as a as Steve mentioned they're going to start putting some pressure on Congress to lift the national minimum twenty nine states now have their own minimum wages which are higher than the federal standard of seven dollars and twenty five cents\nThe Amazon median pay last year was a twenty eight thousand four hundred forty six dollars and that comes out to\nThirteen dollars and

follow and\nUh you know it's the law of supply and demand I guess and the workers are\nBoth the supply and demand so that they can call the shots right now so what do you think is a is it a good idea to do this should we be I'm a be happy that the company is doing that is part of some plot somewhere a lot of people are always suspicious you know because Amazon\nIs increasingly investing and automation so in the long run and by the way they say this will cost them about a billion dollars a year\nOr you know that's a lot of money but uh you know they make a lot of money so they can afford that they can either pass on prices to consumers or as time goes on and they do more and more automation I think it's inevitable they will actually have fewer employees on the line and in their warehouses and I believe that's where most of the employees at a\nAt Amazon work they work in the shipping development of shipping area and they're in warehouses and shipping and that's where a lot of those jobs are not like a places like Walmart where people are working in stores and dealing with customers and that sort of thing this wall\nThis will also put pressure on Walmart which of course this was the biggest competitor to uh\nTo Amazon right now or they've been locked in combat for years they're they're both trying to uh become number one and uh as as Amazon has dominated e commerce and that has heard Walmart Walmart is now getting into e commerce they're both getting to the grocery business and\nUh all kinds of things I was pretty soon there's going to be just those two

openings and existed a year ago according to something I saw in the wall Street Journal and unemployment is low a three point nine percent in August so companies have to do something you know it's a a
