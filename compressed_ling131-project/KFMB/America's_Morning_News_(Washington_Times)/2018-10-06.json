I think you're the realization from a lot of people that don't like Trump yeah\nAnd don't wipe where the Republican Party is going where they realized\nA we've got to come home for a while because those people are insane I Know a case you're Cortez yesterday said the writers insane or we'll go through whether she actually had any substance to that but when we talked about the many things out there when you see what what are the left is doing to Kavanaugh\nWhen you see the presumption of innocence is\nIs gone when an allegation itself is enough to destroy someone's life\nThis goes beyond a political issue it goes to what one Trump the election it is the it is the culture war but it's also and and and I say a culture where because it's a war on\nIt it's it's it's about it's about fairness\nIt's about the belief in the constitution look\nWe we were never tremors we've criticized Trump when we were we were never on that never I'm never going to vote for we voted for\n... you and I don't practice political dollar tree we don't worship anybody you're not going to see us at rallies going ra ra ra whatever my candidate does we will tell you who was the best ... well you know who has the best idea and what particular issue and why\nAnd we end up voting for the person who most reflects what we believe not everything that we believe because that would be impossible as and as adults\nWill see that with ... [laughter] I mean\nDon't really know for as I read Rick Perry and one of his well one of his first interviews after dropping out of the election than twenty six being you know well uh you know I guess he wasn't your first choice they told the interviewer will know my first choice was me\n[laughter] and and so I I think when when you see that that ... it it's just been it's been brought back to many of these ... going on and many of them who started making alliances with people on the west or\nYou know trying to build these emotional is ice on social media from some of the people but I Know that are never Trump hers but all of a sudden the brakes have been put ongoing whoa you'd really do this\nI mean you really ... this is what you really we it wow\nWhat will you know we thought you know this is almost like the McCain funeral what we thought that there were actually people out there in the Democratic side they don't want it to come together to find the common ground that we have and now the realization is no they don't and and I think a lot of people this is a wakeup call\nLook the party isn't perfect\n[laughter] if you listen to the show you know when we talked about the Republican Party or listen to the pocket from yesterday showed [laughter] but the the the party isn't perfect but again everything's\nWhen you get to the point of the actual election it's a binary choice mhm it's a choice between this group and that group neither perfect so what do you do you look for the best one\nAnd I think that's what a lot of uh never Trump or is looking at right now saying\nWhoa ... know who you know when when um oh ... who was it a try to think of the the the the person oh oh yeah yeah it was ... was Glenn Beck who said he couldn't vote for Trump rather vote for Hillary right yeah\nUh I I thought this would because I I I saw\nThat a a Shapiro interviewed him or he interviewed Shapiro or something like that I saw it on social media has a lot of people furious same excuse me he said don't vote for Trump vote for Hillary\nAnd and that kind of you know that kind of thought process doesn't exist right now well except for Bill Kristol\nA and and uh that uh Jonathon ... their ads are usually\nOn Fox News on the on the the the money block and I think Fox businesses as well he was one of those otherwise conservatives that came out with the I'm with her remember that yes hash tag I'm with her right yeah by the way that was after\nThe the the house report that house GOP report the eight hundred page report\nOn been guys\nYeah so I I think that's you

lots and lots of Korea Team when we were young we had one of the stuff that was coming out of our ... we had lots of creating our bodies made a lot of it but as we get older like everything else we don't do that is well we have less Korea teen in our muscles you know the good news is that hundreds and hundreds of human studies show that when you supplement with Korea Team\nAid goes to work and go straight to your muscles it's absorbed easily it pumps up at the Korea thing in your muscle tissue and you get stronger you get more powerful not only that it helps support memory and brain health and help support the strength of your bones\nYou know we were talking before the show and you were talking about how it looks like athletes have been using Korea Team for years to enhance their strength and performance and tell me more\nWell this ... is the premier sports nutrition supplement there's no question about that pat you've used the body builders know about it athletes know about it Korea Team is the premier sports nutrient so you know back twenty twenty five years ago the Olympic athletes and their coach is of course\nBeing do about it they knew what made you bigger and stronger and faster they knew was natural to the body it was supposed to be there but there were a little bit afraid to supplement with it because they were afraid it might be considered cheating let it might be considered too much of an\nEdge but back in Nineteen eighty eight the international Olympic Committee they came out the officially confirmed that I'm quoting here Korea Team can be used by athletes to enhance their performance and now that it's not just for athletes anymore because the studies are clearly showing\nThat for adults for people in their fifties sixties seventies this stuff it was amazing and purity has this incredible new formulation\nWe call it ever strong because that's exactly what it does it helps you get stronger in space stronger with hundreds of human studies to help you and it's the purest form of ... money can buy the stuff from Europe this stuff is fantastic\nBecause this is a naturally occurring molecule in the body it passes right through the blood brain barrier\nYour brain or an soak it up like a sponge and it increases your Korea teen phosphate reserves in your brain so now in your brain you have more readily available resources to do was to recharge those neuronal batteries to make more energy inside the brain so basically what do you notice what your memory is supported\nAnd pat scientists have done something amazing research here they found that people that take Korea Team\nIt supports their memory it actually helps the brain to utilize\nOxygen better it supports memory and people that are sleep deprived it's been shown to help people add numbers quicker and for longer periods of time without mental fatigue get this study pat just five days five days of eight grams of ... supported mental tasks in subjects that we're getting rapid fire question scientists were asking um\nMath questions in science questions over and over and over and they found the folks aren't Korea Team didn't fatigues quickly mentally so this is amazing stuff it's like a turbo booster for your brain it's\nLike a super charge you for your muscles are re chargers all your cellular battery so all of your cells tissues and organs have more readily available energy\nI dug I loved that ever strong appeals to athletes and people want to get more reps in the gym maybe get some extra power and their workouts but you're also saying there's a big push a nutritional community to encourage people in the forties fifties sixties seventies and even eighties to leverage the power of Korea Team to stay fit strong and healthy if I Do say\nKorea teen is going mainstream you know I share the story with you before my mom who's in her late seventies now she's taking creating she works out a couple of days a week three days a week she goes to novelist does the free weights because she's got osteoporosis she wants to maintain her muscle mass and she wants to make her bones stronger and as you pointed out creating helps to do that\nAnd then the other three days during the week she'll go and she'll swim now she's not trying to get bigger stronger or anything like that but even at her age Korea teen has benefits\nOh yeah and what blows me away about that story 'cause you told me before is that her medical doctor recommended ... for and that just goes to show\nHow much more mainstream this is it's called every strong and it supports the muscles that supports your power your strengths your speed if you're an athlete you're certainly going to love it\nBut even if you're not an athlete you notice the difference let's go to another study one more review study this out of the journal current aging science December of two thousand thirty and I thought this was very cool\nBecause the researchers looked at the body of research out there on creating and seniors without exercise they want to see what happens when seniors take Korea teen and they don't\nHave an exercise so I'm quoting here Korea ten\nSupplementation without associated resistance training seems to enhance muscular string\nPower and insurance increase lean body mass for those that don't know what that is they're talking about muscle and improve the functional capacity of the elderly they go on to talk about how it supports bone health as well and then they finished with this creating supplementation\nWithout training and the elderly potentially delay atrophy of muscle and improve in Torrance and strength so here again we see bottom line\n... is very very effective it's gonna help you to feel stronger whether you exercise or not it supports your strength and power your brain health\nAnd on top of that it supports your bono pat when you think about it this almost sounds too good to be true right now you're a person that never heard about this and you're listening to us\nYou would think this sounds too good to be true but it is true hundreds and hundreds of human studies back up what we're talking about you're going to love the benefits you get with this ever strong formula\nThat's incredible let me remind everybody they can get a free bottom of the ever strong formula today plus the bonus bottle will be twelve energy melts\nJust by calling us if one eight hundred by eight zero eleven Seventy five you just pay for shipping that's one eight hundred five eight zero eleven Seventy five will give that number out again later in the ... eleven now listeners can only get ... from this clinically tested Korea teen blend from surety products right\nOh absolutely I Know it combines the Korea teen with the vitamin D the coffee very de fruit X be bore on and for those who don't know talked about how these work so well together there's a a synergy and it's also a great value to I Know we have a free bottled today but if you wanted to buy all of these things separately it would cost a small fortune wouldn't it\nOh absolutely I mean if you went out and bought the Korea pure crazy and that's a purist finest pre teen from Europe if you're both that and then you went out and bought a separate antioxidant formula and separate joined formula\nAnd the vitamin D and it's going to cost you eighty Ninety a hundred bucks a month but you're not going to spend that today and that was purely products and your name or going to spend a half that you're not spending forty five fifty\nBecause today it for your job is to be one of the first thousand callers and take it seriously this the flies out the door and the big radio stations be one of the first thousand calls you could you be twelve and ... and your average strong you're just pay six Ninety five is shifting we want to get it right out you know\nWe want you to try this at we want you to be the judge for yourself don't take my word for it\nTry it look in the mirror go to the gym lift some weights play do whatever you do see if you don't feel better\nAll right let's talk about how you take this you have these easy to swallow tablets which are super easy to swallow it also comes in a very refreshing cherry Barry powder so how do you like to take it and give people just choose the tablets are the powder when they're calling for the free bottom today\nYeah yeah you can choose tablets her powder I personally use both you know in my work at these days are making a a protein shake on days I'm juicing let's face it juicing has become a very big these days so if you're doing something like that the jury very powders fantastic could just take a scoop\nDump it right into your juice dumping pure protein shake and that's a great way to take it but if you don't do that stuff I mean the tablets are super convenient they're small they're coated they're easy to swallow\nIt's wonderful stuff now I Know you're chomping at the bit to tell us a little more about this study the purity did on the ever strong powder they tested golfers already found out that not only with these golfers getting stronger and more explosive but they were driving the golf ball gift is\nFourteen yards further that's amazing\nI have such a big smile on my face right now I'm remembering when the researchers came back and gave us this information I mean we were bouncing off the walls this is so exciting the researchers called this\nA seminal study in sports nutrition and this is on our average strong formula the product we are talking about right now the average strong power so\nDouble blind placebo controlled studies thirty golfers took the ... on power for one month no exercise nothing different just took our Armstrong powder for one month in one month they were banging the golf ball\nFor teen yards further ... not only that\nSix percent more power on the bench press more explosive they could live the way faster\nGet older guys spend hundreds of dollars on new clubs\nThe dollars on new clubs to drive the offer\nSo job but you get five hundred dollars on a driver yeah five yards right this is for teen\nYards at people shouldn't just how how about this or your about this this is amazing because let's face it this was a golf study but more explosive and there's more speed more power this should help all sports so if you're a tennis player if you're a jogger if you're any kind of an athlete this has ramifications across the board\nBut again these golfers one month on this ever strong powder we're talking about today banging the golf ball fourteen yards further can you imagine how you get your bottle of every strong you don't tell your buddies take her for a month and you go out and you're banging the both fourteen yards past and they don't know what hit him\nWhile I Would just got a few minutes left here I Want you to recap this amazing story today about Korea Team would you like to call the molecule of strike who needs it and what about this double free bottle offer today with the ever strong plus the B. twelve energy melts\nYou know what at my one concern with this show\nIs it literally it sounds too good to be true right right like when I tell folks about every strong right I'm afraid they're going to think I'm making this up to not possible right you know I Know how you feel because six seven eight years ago when I started to read about Korea teen I mean almost couldn't believe it I said to myself\nIf it's really this good with an excellent safety profile how come everybody's not using it but I started to use it and I noticed some incredible benefits it's just phenomenal and it's as simple as this you're going to get on the strong you're going to try it you're going to get stronger you're going to get more powerful you can look in the mirror\nAnd see the difference there's hundreds and hundreds of human studies backing us up these aren't studies with a hamster in a lab somewhere we're talking human studies I called stuffed muscle fertilizer it's that great and of course we didn't just there to create your Korea Team we've discussed that we are the fruit XP remember that joined health\nWeight of the coffee Barry extract a nominal antioxidant that's more potent than blueberries and strawberries for powerful antioxidant protection\nI added the vitamin D because it's so important across the board rate for bone health but also for seniors vitamin D so important for muscles especially as we get older for strength and coordination so this is a very comprehensive formula again this would easily cost you\nEighty Ninety a hundred bucks to replicate on your own but today it's free and not only that let's not forget about the beat twelve energy emails because we're talking about energy here today and when you think energy you think be twelve ... twelve is critical for making red blood cells to carry oxygen to the two shoes the by attending there is great for the hair skin and then also just make sure\nYou're one of the first thousand callers that's the only catch when this whole show don't be calling number Fifteen hundred you're not going to get to be one of the first thousand called 'cause you're free bottle of every strong your freebie twelve energy ... six Ninety five that's it you're just paying for the shipping and if you don't notice the benefits that we've discussed today purity is happy to give you back\nYour six Ninety five but that's not going to happen it never happens people love this formula due to tell your friends relatives loved ones you're going to fall in love\nIs just too We're talking with Bill ... acid or Eighteen bill you said recently that the H a revolution is under way more and more people are using it tell us why ... such a breakthrough in what exactly can you do for people\nI think the brick and mortar analogy is probably the best for everybody to understand it there are bricks in our body the cells there's mortar in between and the mortar is the college and now within the college and not the college in itself vitamin C. makes college\nBut within that college and there's a moisture rising agent that looks like Jell O and everyone knows you put some jello in the refrigerator and the water separates out after a time and that's what's happening in our body we're losing the water holding molecule ha the body is Seventy two percent water\nAnd as we lose this the connective tissue that connects all of ourselves that connects all of everything that we have begins to lose its water at separates out and then we begin to lose\nThe substance the scaffolding ... the support structure that holds our body together\nAnd of course we've been getting the wrinkle we shrivel up we lose an inch in our height\nWe we see the the brain a shriveled up in the eye and so on all of these things occur with age and you know puns a daily on was looking for a youth molecule and he wanted to find it and of course the fountain of youth the water he was looking for water fountain the body needs water\nBut it has to hold it and of course I Want everyone to think\nOf having something like\nA jello a type of a water balloon filled with jello or one filled with water which one do you want you went to one filled with jello because it's still from but soft cushioning and that's the way our bodies are when we're young babies or even a\nEven a pregnant woman is loaded with this which is an example\nOf how the ha is made more so at certain times of our life but as age goes on we're going to lose that we're going to see the wrinkles that thinning hair\nWe're going to see our joints lose their flexibility we're just telling people that after thousands of people have tried this if you're taking ... supplement it took Thirteen Years\nFor doctors to adopt glue costs ... sulfate at the regular dietary supplement noun drugstores health food stores people ask me well why hasn't my doctor told me about ... gas it well it took Thirteen Years for the consummate it'll be on the front page of time magazine it's just going to take time\nAnd it'll get there because patients are gonna take this to the doctors and pointed out as they did glue costs I mean the revolution starts with patients in people that have issues and want to have healthy joints and skin and hair and eyes and want to see some of these youthful levels of ha restored in their body\nNow you've written a great deal about the role of highly want a gas it into bunnies connective tissue how does each a work in the joints and the connective tissue ...\nIt's a natural cushioning age and pat we're talking about between the bones it also surround the nerves there's this ... addict nerve there's an owner nerve there's a carpal tunnel nerve all of these are going to need the special cushioning that ha can give them there are people\nThat tell us this stuff works here's Bernie writing to me who's actually teaches and plays golf in Dover, Delaware he found this purity joint formula and were telling you\nIt work miracles for him why because purity is not only taken the ha but they've taken a brand new substance called Hydrox that's taken from all as a pet you notice you can put a bowl of olives on your table in a year later come back and except for a little bit of a shrinkage due to just the loss of moisture they're very stable they're still there\nThey didn't shrivel up and waste away to the fungal contamination so\nThere's something very strong and all as we've known it for a long time Dr Roberta Korea an Italian researcher who's now here in this country\nDoing some research on Hydrox the tire is all extracted from olives and found out that it does some of the same things\nThat the molecules to that trigger like estrogen does the production of ha so we began to think why don't we combine this wonderful strong antioxidant from olives\nInto ... new ha joined for a meal you know we're getting results like we've never seen before this is why bill of rights to us this year saying I'm taking ha from my knees it's done wonders for my joints so\nWe get these letters from people there unsolicited\nYou see this is the kind of thing we hear and of course there is founded with this they just can't believe it here's someone writing to me this is a Dr Kelly saying he looks like a man\nThat's Thirty years younger and he says people can't even believe this level of fitness and youthful appearance and he says I tell you to tell them it's just the H a formula and of course he sent us pictures on the Internet\nHow fit he looks for his age and you're going to look a little younger because when you were young you had a lot of this now this stuff works fairly quick much faster than glue costs I mean\nAnd it's all safe all natural its purity H A joint formula and pat most of the people who write to me or call me or not people who regularly fall for you might say\nRadio commercials they don't buy stuff off the radio\nThey just out of desperation knowing nothing housework\nThought that take a risk well there is no risk that day\nYou can actually get this far free purity products want you to get this new ha joint formula risk free you get it you just help them out with the shipping costs that's all and you can get a bottle of this new wonderful H H joint formula why would somebody do that because they know people\nWho try this say hey it really worked for me that's why they want people to try\nTo hold that thought I Want to give the special offer here again our guest bill Saudi here's this special offer the incredible
