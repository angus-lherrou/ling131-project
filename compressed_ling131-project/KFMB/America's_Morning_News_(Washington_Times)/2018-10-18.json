counter family was back on TV the other night but without a central character Roseanne so Kevin how was it the morning Michael it actually\nWas an interesting experiment for ABC to do because they literally had to exercise the main character and reason for the show and the original idea of all those characters out of\nRoseanne and put it into a new show after of course a crazy crazy tweet flurry from Roseanne earlier this year got her um ceremonies Lee fired from the project [noise]\nNow they've got the Connors as basically everyone but Roseanne and turns out the big killed her off or with an opioid addiction so of course they were in danger of the show staying topical the big question a lot of people had is enough enough people watch and it seems like you had\nA you know ... ratings that were similar to the finale of the the new Roseanne revival season so not as big as that original opening but still in some very respectful numbers of course that's going to drop off in the next couple of seasons\nOr the next couple of episodes but the real question is did it work without Roseanne\nAnd I I got to say I think the jury's still out on that completely because you take somebody so key to a show like that out of it and you gotta reformulate the chemistry and I don't think they're quite there yet it really felt like the beginning of a sitcom rather than like\nThe tenth season or something but you do miss the character you knew do miss her dynamic in the show and it'll be interesting to see if they can the over the next couple of weeks you know mold that together into a workable series\nAll right thanks Kevin car twenty seven fast they are and there's more first light on the way [noise]\n\n\nHey I'm Andy if you don't know me it's probably because I'm

they're the ones that we more traditionally think of and of course that has been getting some attention also as this happened and uh so Jim rupe tells us that some are concerned that the policy up in Canada could do more harm than good\nMichael in with a historic day across the great flight doors how's it going to hand it is the first major country second to much smaller or way to adopt a national policy the new law permits adults Eighteen and older to grow by possess end or use marijuana\nI just think this is a really bad idea\nThat age Eighteen says Dr Kevin ... with the group smarter approaches to marijuana is the first major concern Dr\nSchutt okay if you're going to do this we don't think you should but if you are at least make the age twenty five and older so it is crystal clear that as your brain is developing this should be avoided the government didn't listen to the doctors today marijuana is you know twenty to thirty times stronger than the Woodstock stoppage\nSo much more potent than it used to be it's been Ninety factored to increase the strength and it affects the developing brain many profound ways mental illness psychosis suicide motivation\nCanadians Eighteen an older can possess up to thirty grams and cultivate before plants at home right now is Dr cannabis and oils available consumable will be available in legal next year smoking pot is legal in Canada anywhere tobacco can be used\nDr ... who is also a three time former White House drug policy official says there is concern that some will simply violate these laws such as no smoking pot in cars are on boats or in public places where adults and children would be subjected to second hand smoke so he's held to launch a watchdog website called ... watch\nActually it's got to be a one stop shop to report any problems with marijuana legalization whether it's a your neighbor or you know smoking in front of you in front of your kids your kids reading it secondhand smoke wafting through air conditioner vents a liability issues workplace problems\nThe Canadian government says the new law includes strict restrictions and punishment for violators and is aimed at restricting access to the drug for youth reducing the burden of Canada's laws on the justice system and under cutting the illegal drug market Michael\nAll right thank you Jim ... reporting for first light we are at about Nineteen before they are and you know I I can I can feel some folks right now\nGetting on line to get their tickets to fly up to Canada well there are a couple of things you have to know you can't legally leave Canada we'd we'd on you marijuana may be legal in some states here in the U.S but you know there's still a federal law against it and that means it's illegal to bring marijuana purchased say in Canada across the border into the United states\nEven if you are flying into a state where it is legal light Colorado Vancouver international airport is already trying to warn travelers about that they have a sign up saying crossing international borders with cannabis is illegal so that means that say you're going from Vancouver to LAX\nThere that can be risky even though Los Angeles international recently announced that passengers are permitted to travel with small amounts of marijuana there now if you're going to fly with pot from Vancouver to Montreal inside Canada that's perfectly legal as long as you mean the age requirement and carry no more than thirty grams of cannabis cannabis\nNow you may be wondering about what's happening up behind that locked door upfront well\nAh it's illegal for people who are working in the airline industry to light up\nSo ah all the airlines in Canada have banned their employees from part taking in what for other folks as a recreational activity and I guess that would make me feel a little safer or you know flying\nFlying a friendly flies skies and Canada and knowing that the pilot is flying the plane and not him or herself\nSo we have a lot to talk about this morning and also the prime minister there you know they've got thousands of people in Canada who have been put behind bars for the criminal possession of marijuana in the past now they're behind bars for something that\nAh many people consider harmless although it might be harmful to them at times but they are behind bars for something that is no longer illegal so he's going to let them all out I assume a favor are not involved in any kind of violent activity or or widespread corruption you know if they were just arrested for a token up or maybe you're selling a few bags of marijuana\nThey will be let out of prison is that something we should think about doing here because we don't have much space in our prisons\nAnd uh there was some folks who could do should be behind bars you aren't maybe we can make some more room for them and let some other people get on with their lives\nUh outside of prison that might be a good thing to consider I'd like to know what you think about that call us at eight hundred seven three six three six six six times they are a change in how much should we change with them or\nAre there are a few
