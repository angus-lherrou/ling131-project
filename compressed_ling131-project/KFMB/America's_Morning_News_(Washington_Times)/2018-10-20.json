back with you again I was with you in September for weaken as I say the streets of effect that you can I had a great time talking with you the last couple of days and I look forward to the next Tuesday and Jerry ... is actually the Sunday night Monday morning\nI could easily get use to filling in for them especially because you've been so gracious to me and you're kind comments about my work and you can keep in touch with me and see where I Am on the air next on my Web page at the Marcus they'll show dot com where you can email me following me on Facebook or Twitter or leave me a message with a question or comment that I can respond to\nAfter this week I'll next beyond October twenty nights on another show but ... again check it out on my Web page there are number of topics I said I Would get to tonight so I Want to keep my word\nFirst I Want to talk to you about illegal immigration\nI've been talking about this for over ten years now on the air doesn't mean I didn't think about this Twenty years ago and so on but I never wavered in my position the issue and you guys were bringing up the last few days so I thought I Would focus on first a segment at least and see your response\nThe issue is really not that difficult if you'd knowledge the simple fact that people who cross the border illegally have come here legally which is why those on the other side do not want to call them illegal immigrants let alone it illegal aliens one of the college last night said you know markets illegal aliens forget it\nSo you have the term document an undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents as if they miss place them somewhere or loss\nBecause if you acknowledge their coming here legally the argument might be quickly over if they are legal they're not allowed to be here in the store in another caller said that white you know why is this going on is pretty simple\nSo as an example if you own a home and someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in they wouldn't be able to say they wanted your home to go into your home but they just lack the proper documents\nSimilarly if someone walks in tears to your bank and wants to take the money out of your account right\nThey were to be asked to prove that it's their account\nIf they said it was their account but they just didn't have the documents to prove it the bank would not permit them access it's not obvious\nWhich is why it is so ludicrous for the left to use the phrase undocumented is is that can have your house and bank account if only they could find the misplaced documents for years now I've said the left as one of the argument over language\nBut how to not be allowed to come or in the first place and we wouldn't need to care if they cooperate with authorities isn't that obvious how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes that native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate watch this to the evil police officers at ice who has the audacity to arrest people commit crimes that these guys are really clever on the left\nSo the rest of us live with long lines at hospitals ... schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities so what's my solution\nYou take away the benefits like free health care and free schools you enforce strict penalties against businesses that hire illegals even sending some CEO to jail you say in the first CEO to jail for hiring an illegal immigrant and it'll never happen again\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home run we actually had a right to use the wrong language soft there we go again would language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there are no bad if I take them back not everybody a lot would leave and that's what's happened during the recession a lot we leave there are no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs legally\nWe but I Would say that those who remain that's the point I Want to make I'd be willing to have a conversation about with them because they'd be saying for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake enough of the government's sending out the wrong message message with actions like a legal education classes I'm a teacher I Know or bilingual government documents\nA country is United bites language and it's shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and our shared values\nOur ancestors kiss the ground when they landed here at Ellis Island they were so happy to have landed\nAt the land of freedom so let's build that wall and do everything to end dilute legal immigration and take our country back telling me what you think an eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine o seven thirty

six six Ninety ... we're talking about illegal immigration\nAnd let's see what friend in Washington DC has to say about it for it [noise]\n[noise] well\nI'm a\nLanguage that you talk about one of the biggest glaring thing that you even do it yourself\nOr used to do it I'll marry you say American what actually we are us citizens in America and the liberals are not a liberal that's called radical sir they actually have taken that word applied it to everyone on the side of this\nSo when they when they talk an American you know we think that it's just sitting here no\nThey're thinking the whole this whole side of the world and immigration means nothing to them I mean this is just normal stuff we've said great wars when we say American then they they say American they brainwashed\nUs to think that we're saying citizen and ate and ate brainwash us to think that everybody uses American but when you look at your passport if you have what it says us says that's what we are\nAnd that's a huge difference we have to be so deliberate what what state are words have got to be delivered and that's that's got to be a main thing that we have to do even on the air because the radicals or taking those words and\nThat's what I say about\nWell I appreciate your call but I'm not going to give up that word to name I just refuse to do\nIt when I hear that word America Americans in me you know all kinds of patriotism comes to my mind I'm not going to let them use or that and just because they think Americans you know north Americans or whatever they want to use it for looking to let them get away with that oh and and you know some of the songs right\nAmerica the beautiful let's not there's I'm not conceding that to them there's not a chance I'm going to do that\nAgain I don't want to concede the language them at all that's why it's important and legal immigrants illegal aliens I Know people get me on that\nUm but I don't I don't see anything to them and and if you do that and then you're kind of giving up a little bit no we're Americans password United States citizens great I get it\nBut there's something special about this country called America where the United states of America America usa whenever you want to call it\nAnd so appreciate your call that's my take on it and now you're national forecast for cobra electronics\nAn area of low pressure will be moving out of Canada into the great lake region today and that will provide some showers for Chicago at least for the early morning hours\nDetroit so you can look for ... hours throughout the day and then in the region and in fact Monday for the entire eastern half of the U.S we'll look to be rained free but today a few more spots of showers mainly in the Ohio River valley that will extend it into the mid Atlantic region\nAnd again for Texas but the good news there is showers won't be wrapping up today mainly for central and north central Texas we're going to get about another inch of rain today\nYeah well we don't give a to the Soviet Union I mean you might say now Russia there are certain countries you know you might say we get paid like to chime of you might say we give them aid because they take in fair advantage of\nUs but there are a lot of countries where are we going to have a ... actually the\nActually the Russians are helping us more with these satellites right now that we may be helping them financially but that's not your point your point is a good one which is we ought to charge the country's um for their illegals coming here I I I kinda like that idea\nEven though\nYou know it's a it's an interesting idea\nOr a model you\nKnow and as you as as you're kind of indicating this and they they love to send us they're poor right a lot of especially Mexico right to send us send us the poor and is not our problem right [laughter] you know it's your problem\nAnd it and then you can also add onto that will help them to go and stuff and you know let me but\nI I yeah there's nothing like the right and center and that's the point with right now it's been the ... you come here as I said I don't blame them and you get to go to school for free you get to have free hospital care right and you get to a drive in our roads you you know we pay for the roads and listen to you you you know I I Would come here to that's why\nThey're in charge interest and we can make money on it so interesting\nYou know what\nYeah you should have given this idea to President Trump because that's the way they could be paying for all\nYou know any better than I Do oh about ... [laughter] I don't think [laughter]\nThat's a great call things Steve appreciate it very much actually I I I I did apply um someone told me what to do I do know some people and I was thinking you know I'm a teacher too I Love to be a way up there in the department of education but as a person I ... to ... and I think eventually\nHe was didn't work with the president and I have a good friend who's a head of communications for I think the department of health\nUh and so yeah it does happen then you know some people but you know what\nUm it it's tough and and that's one of the news stories that the I think they were having someone else's leaving the administration it's tough to work there\nEspecially if you're a conservative you don't care about the party's you don't you just want to do a good job you certainly it's not the connections you want it's tough it's tough and a lot of the points that out yesterday that President Trump has given up a lot to become president United States you could say well it's an ego trip this power all that kind of stuff I don't think he needed that\nI think that was one of the enduring things who needed the abuse of his family right and and now you know if the Democrats getting power that's another thing I mentioned this last couple of days I think in power not only hearings and subpoenas but you know they're going to go after taxes\nBecause they're they're sure they're going to find something there that though oh probably with the Russians I guess right he made some kind of the old the Russians but even if they don't what business is it um there's\nWhat his tax returns are it's just not their business I Know certain presidents have done on I don't think they should\nIt's it's no one's business what you pay in taxes that that should be a private thing it's none of your business Democrats or Republicans I don't I wouldn't want them to know my I don't I pay what I'm supposed to pay do my share but anybody else's business by the way after the Kavanaugh hearings and all this other stuff if they go after his taxes\nWhy to good people exactly why do people want to serve a pet especially people with assets why and that leads me to another point I think we should consider\nDemocrats loves serving in government of course for them they believe in much more government so here they get a chance to do that they get a chance to maybe be a bureaucrat and tell you how to live your life\nYeah they're the party that loves to work in government we're the party that has to give something up I think it was Daniel Boone who served for a little while and Congress and you know he he was one of those that hey I Can't wait to get home\nIn the case of Republicans and conservatives I think they're much more likely to say I want to go back to my family and to my life because they don't believe in this whole part and that's what illegals don't know what makes America special one of the big things he's limited government\nThat government stays out of your lives and don't you find it ironic to say the least\nThat a lot of illegals who come to our country are escaping corruption in government and big government\nAnd what they do when they get here they vote for exactly the same thing they left it's really bad\nSo the you because it it takes a while like a lot of people said yesterday people don't know what's going on right when they do the those man on the street interviews woman on the street interviews and you know they say who's the vice president United States they can't name that that's not so important\nWhat's important is that they know what makes this country special what makes this country exceptional\nThat we leave the citizens alone we let them live their lives so I teach my students I get and I don't try to indoctrinate them I'd given both sides I get why we need traffic lights if we don't have traffic lights your going to have energy\nBut on every issue you bring before me I Want the government out of my life as much as possible\nThat's why some people question is\nWhy I'm conservatives like a government when it comes to things they can't do themselves that would explain a strong military\nI Can't have a tank in my backyard or grenades or let alone nuclear weapons so there are evil people in the world right that that's another thing that shows this debate in perspective where the illegal immigration they want to open borders on the other side because they think ... mostly people are pretty good I I don't believe that\nI Believe people have a real tendency to be bad and they do awful things like a lynching right like the Germans were out of the strongest tribe and the Eighteenth century and when asked why they did what they do this because we can I don't I don't trust humanity I I don't trust that\nAnd there was something special about this country where we didn't want to trust government and I didn't get into this so much last night's caller mentioned live we have a system of checks and balances the founders were brilliant\nSo there are laws the federal government does their laws right that the states are in charge of and the rest is left to the people they did that on purpose but even there right how do you pass a law you guys know this house has to pass the Senate has to concur and then the president has to agree if he doesn't agree he vetoes it\nAnd then the house and Senate could override it\nAnd then the Supreme Court could say you pass a law that's unconstitutional they really were afraid of big government so that's another big issue with illegal immigrants they don't understand what makes this country so special\nBut most are you guys do and even if you're on the less I Want you to explain to me why I'm wrong\nAnd what makes this country so special but most you guys do and even if you're on the less I Want you to explain to me why I'm wrong about illegal immigration give me a call at eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine

to understand it there are bricks in our body the cells there's mortar in between and the mortar is the college and now within the college and not the college in itself vitamin C. makes college\nBut within that college and there's a moisture rising agent that looks like Jell O and everyone knows you put some jello in the refrigerator and the water separates out after a time and that's what's happening in our body we're losing the water holding molecule ha\nThe body of Seventy two percent water\nAnd as we lose this the connective tissue that connects olive ourselves that connects all of everything that we have begins to lose its water at separates out and then we begin to lose the substance the scaffolding ... the support structure that holds our body together\nAnd of course we didn't get into a wrinkle we shrivel up we lose an inch in our height\nWe we see the brain a shriveled up in the ... and so on all of these things occur with age and you know ... daily on was looking for a youth molecule and he wanted to find it and\nOf course the fountain of youth the water he was looking for water fountain the body needs water but it has to hold it\nAnd of course I Want everyone to think\nOf having something like\nA jello a type of a water balloons filled with jello or one filled with water which one do you want you went to one filled with jello\nBecause it's still from but soft cushioning and that's the way our bodies are when we're young babies\nOr even a pregnant woman is loaded with this which is an example of how the ha is made more so at certain times of our life but as age goes on we're going to lose that we're going to see the wrinkles that thinning hair\nWe're going to see our joints lose their flexibility we're just telling people that after thousands of

for a little bit of a shrinkage due to just the loss of moisture they're very stable they're still there\nThey didn't shrivel up and waste away do the fungal contamination so there's something very strong and all as we've known it for a long time Dr Roberta Korea an Italian researcher who's now here in this country\nDoing some research on Hydrox he tier is all extracted from olives and found out that it does some of the same things that the molecules do that trigger like estrogen does the production of ha so\nWe began to think well why don't we combine this wonderful strong antioxidant from
