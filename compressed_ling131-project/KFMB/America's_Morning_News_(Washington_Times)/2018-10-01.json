talking with you about the investigation by the FBI reopened into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh so and the FBI is investigating now but at its most\nBasic this is not illegal situation it's not really a court of law it's a battle for public opinion [noise] so how does an investigation fit into this let's ask retired FBI supervisory agent James ... James\nShow people said that it is it is not a court of law and they're they're ... percent accurate there but look are predicated on our ...\nThe laws are predicated on our social mores on our culture on or you\nKnow how we how we live as a society [noise] um I Believe as I Know every FBI agent every prosecutor beliefs that people are entitled to the presumption of innocence and due process I understand that this is a job interview it is not you know this is not a criminal case\nBut I just fear that going forward you know if something like this if you can make an allegation and eat it cannot be it cannot be substantiated we're going to move into a\nPretty dark place because nobody remembers that the FBI investigated it need hills charges back in Nineteen Ninety One they put together a report and the reports that they could not substantiate\nAny of them they interviewed people department of education where she and Clarence Thomas work they interviewed people at equal Employment Opportunity commission we're both from work and they could substantiate it it was given to the White House and obviously the proceedings move forward and Justice Thomas made it to the court\nBut people still recalled those days and say well people just didn't believe or or that she wasn't given you know\nShe wasn't taken seriously but no one forgets this charges and that's going to be what's going to happen here nothing\nEven if the FBI investigates is nothing comes of this are not able to corroborate her ... any of it I fear that you know justice Kavanaugh is going to be is reputation is staying are solely in perpetuity whether or not he makes sure on the court that's a political decision and I don't weigh in on those things but I think\nIt is going to be\nNot a good idea going forward if we move into this realm now where\nThe presumption of innocence is taken for granted and we don't give people due process so that's just my opinion is an old seasoned wise and FBI agent look at it this now as a as a as just a U.S citizen\nAnd I guess you have that right Andrea also injure appreciate the fact that you are speaking with the voice of experience retired supervisory FBI agent James ... coming up on sixteen before the hour an hour let's go to the phones and take your calls David I understand you are in Washington DC or the state\nThat the state well good morning very early morning out there and so what do you think about how that will lead but almost three o'clock out here yeah\nAnyway I think that uh this uh\nUh investigations should go forward that bad because this is criminal and I noticed that used to have is that your limitations is seven years for a sexual assault no more it's the same as murder there's no statute of limitations at all\nMhm and I and I agree with that total it if they say that I've been there for the night\nSo you want to go on if they come back in a couple of days and say you know we're we're we're finding some leads now and we'd like another week or two would you ... or do we want to just say look you know you've had your time\nCut it off but they didn't go on as long as it happens to All right just laid out of breath that that\nIs either innocent or guilty of this a sexual assault that he's been accused of\nAll right thank you David in Washington for the call a quarter before they our good morning Jesse you are in the Lone Star state good morning\nBurning barrel you're on the answer\nYes or no I just wanted to say this is a ridiculous man for\nThis woman to be coming up with these charges thirty six years ago and it's just ridiculous\nWhile I think I mean it it ... it is a long time but you know it seems to be the the generally accepted opinion now by people who study these things legal people people who work in the ... as health professionals mental health professionals\nAnd even most of society now is this coming to grips with the fact that this is how this kind of thing works better takes women a long long long time to be able to deal with this and come forward with it and so we know we may not those of us who have not suffered may not understand it but I think we have to appreciate it\nAnd that's where we are that's the that's the world we are in now and uh for better or worse that's the situation that the FBI has to be aware of and you know they're up against them because they've got to track down thirty six year old leads which is which is difficult they do have a bit of a roadmap now with the calendar that are\nThat are being nominee judge Kavanaugh turned over so maybe that will give them give give him some help sooner thanks for the call appreciate it let's go up the coast of Massachusetts Good morning Richard\nHello Richard you're on the honor the money yes the mind well I think that the the uh\nIn this case continue even if it goes tests a week I think that ah Christine Blasey Ford was incredibly credible and I ended up in the Republicans knowing they absolutely no and that's why they dispensed with the Arab prosecutor about asking question\nOkay we're going back and we're going to go after the Democrats\nWith a meat cleaver and talk about how this is a conspiracy but say six year thing or thirty eight yeah thank you know I mean all these priests accused seems a present like use of sexually molesting boys and a lot of cases that's twenty or thirty is\nAll or even more but didn't end so let's ... no that's not the way it works\nShe's a woman and she was a very credible evidence a witness and I I certainly believe her and I think it absolutely with positive people say we shouldn't ... you know we should just have the vote and and then put them on the court when in fact he may be somebody who uh certainly somebody who attacked\nHer and he may have been involved in some of these other cases so I think they absolutely need to do their level best to investigate\nAll right appreciate the call let's go to South Dakota good morning Dave checking in from the heartland\nBy day earnings\nI'd say a refrain from calling people's\nIdiots and that kind of stuff but the ALL this whole thing has such a sham a her just ... poles and everything else that people that claim that\nHer friend was later and she was saying you know I was a ... a failed so anyhow I just don't believe her I don't believe a you know and I've done a lot of ... in the bedroom and yes it takes a long time for someone who could bring it up and uh\nYou know it's just a situation here where the Democrats are trying to run the staying out as long as like in because they think alert or\nOverrun or a hospitals are\nOkay they have the question of timing is interesting because both both sides are trying to manipulate the clock here the or the ... the Senate Republicans want to get this over with they'd like to start calling procedural votes by the end of the week to advance this nomination and we know\nWhy that is they're trying to present the base voters river with a conservative majority on the Supreme Court which you know for for the I mean that is a a reasonable thing for them to do for people who believe that way that is what are the machinery is there within the government for them to do that\nAnd they're trying to you know got to generate some support for the midterm elections to hold onto his many house and Senate seats as they
