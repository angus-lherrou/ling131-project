that us violations of the treaty ah are happening and they don't like that either so they're saying that they hope beneficial word from the Kremlin has that quote we are prepared to work together with our us colleagues\nOn the entire set of problems regarding the INS now of course you have to remember President Trump is a businessman he\nLikes to negotiate so there may be some thought that what he's doing here is perhaps not throwing out the treaty and maybe that's his first bargaining position and what he might be able to do is negotiate a better deal as he did with the NAFTA\nOr with Mexico and Canada you know we're pulling out of this so you have a chance if you want to come in and give us some better and better deals but it's hard to think how you could do this with the Russians because building up weapons and national defense is a lot different from trade because you have lives at stake here\nSo the first thing we're going to do this morning before we take your calls and by the way our number is eight hundred seven three six three six six six and I want to know what you think about this\nAre you willing to trash a treaty and return to the old arms race of the past and put more and more billions of dollars into using weapons or to building weapons that hopefully we would never be able to or after used or would you rather save that money for domestic needs bill some new bridges and airports in training and infrastructure and\nElectrical grids which is your priority call us at eight hundred seven three six three six six six so now Fred pike and has been following this infrared is based in Moscow for us and he brings us up to date on what this just being said on both sides of the Atlantic on this issue\n[noise] I think he was in Russia had it for a\nArms race Moscow saying\nIt could happen after President Trump announced over the weekend the U.S will exit the INS curry\nBecause they violated the agreement terminating\nFrosty welcome for national security adviser John Bolton in Moscow Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov demanding an explanation and warning Russia will retaliate\n... any action in this area will be met with counter action strategic stability can only be achieved on the lake was parity\nI N F stands for intermediate range nuclear forces\nThe treaty was signed by Ronald Reagan at least ... led to the withdrawal of twenty seven hundred from your [noise]\nThe u._s. that Russia has been violating the deal deploying new medium range nuclear capable missile close NATO territory\nMaybe this is just to move to say look if if we don't if you don't strike not we're moving out of this and I hope that the case I Hope we're going to be able to figure out a way to stay within the trading\nMoscow denies it's reaching the ins and it turned blames America for violating it by developing missile defense technology\nWe look at both to target missiles used in the U.S to test the defense systems or identical to intermediate range ballistic missiles they exist as they are in use their production in the U.S could be assigned that I ended up prohibited technologies are in development\n[noise] several of America's European allies safe there about the Trump Administration\nTend to be hearing after decades of calm [noise]\nNuclear weapons could search once again a lot of\nConcern among America's allies in Europe or other places as well of course a lot of anger here in Moscow and the tough meeting of continue for the national security adviser John Bolton he is meeting none other than Vladimir who himself today the Kremlin has already said who also wants them to ... explain what the us plans to do out of us plans to move forward\nAll right thanks to front plate in reporting from Moscow for first flight this morning we are at Eighteen minutes before the hour on for a slight give us a call at eight hundred and seven three six three six six six and you know this is not just a story between the United states and China\nI mean the United states and Russia China is also involved in this because uh right now U.S officials are the U.S has been relying on other capabilities to balance China and places like the south China Sea they're using missiles fired from ships or aircraft\nAnd are advocates for us land based missile response which would be prohibited by this say that's the best way to deter China and their use of their land based missile forces experts are warning that China would put pressure on countries in the region to refuse any requests from the U.S to position their missiles air China kind of like this whole thing because they say hey\nYou know this this will allow us to do a bunch of things and we're going to stop you from basing basing missiles in this part of the world and that would give them an advantage\nWe also hear from a Soviet the former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev this morning he's the one who signed the deal with President Reagan he says that President Trump is being very very irresponsible and he fears a new nuclear arms race\nSo I'll take you back now to December eighth Nineteen eighty seven president Ronald Reagan is in the East Room of the White House standing next to Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev and getting ready to sign the treaty\nWas over six years ago in November Eighteen Nineteen eighty one by first proposed what would come to be close to zero options\nWas a simple proposal one might say disarming really simple [noise] unlike treaties in the past it didn't simply codified the status quo or a news arms deal that\nThey didn't simply talk of controlling an arms race for the first time in history the language of arms control was replaced by arms reduction\nIn this case the complete elimination of an entire class of us and Soviet nuclear missiles\nAnd that brings us to today and by the way that the that treaty\nEliminated thousands of land based missiles or with a range of between approximately three hundred and thirty four hundred miles so that's a pretty big wide swath of a nuclear arsenal and as I said that brings us to today President Trump threatening to withdraw from the treaty would you like to see that happen are you concerned that that will\nTip the balance of power in the world will that will eat up all the money that we need to rebuild our own country our infrastructure our bridges are trains are electrical grid our Internet grid\nYou know our roads we need to be a building things to help us deal with hurricanes we need to rebuild whole cities along the coast there are a lot of things to put money into do you want to put money into building nuclear weapons that\nThey probably will never be using if they are used while he won't be around to enjoy anything else anyway so what do we do with this you know it's international politics international relations with the highest level now this Cold War era stuff and are we ready to handle that\nIt's coming up on fourteen before the hour we will be back

about crime taxes the whole panoply of issues that affect everybody is the immigration issue and in particular as we speak now this a caravan of some three or four thousand Central Americans having

what's best for the host country\nBut that is up to the host country at an aside that I saw in California some months back is incorrect it said immigration is a right no it is not a you may argue it
