Nineteen all publicly traded companies have to have at least one woman on his board of directors by the end of twenty Twenty one all public companies with five or fewer seats at least two of them should be female and companies with six or more board members at least three must be women\nBut there are some problems with this new laws is Jennifer ... with the California chamber of commerce it only focuses on one aspect of diversity and elevates only one protected class\nFor in the situation in which we're considering a new board of directors and we had a potential candidates who are not female but nonetheless it other diversity qualifications are criteria that we're looking for\nIn other words black Hispanic el GB GQ persons with disabilities and\nSo on it there'll be mandates that we hired the woman with anybody out we made the fulfilling for purposes for this\nShe says violates the equal protection laws and both of us and California constitutions as well as civil rights laws\nEven governor Jerry Brown and just signing message said the law may not withstand challenges but says quote it's high time corporate boards includes the people who constitute more than half the people in America and quote or as Jackson puts it\nWe do hold up at least half the sky\nAccording to the law companies that don't comply face a one hundred thousand dollar find the first year of violation and three hundred thousand dollars for every other year it violates the law companies also face a one hundred thousand dollar penalty for not reporting it's boards agenda ratio to the state's secretary of state Michael\nAll right thanks Jim Rupert coming up on Nineteen before the hour now and there are a lot of issues related to this is not even clear that we would get women to actually joined boards in California about thirty business groups and as mentioned the California chamber of commerce oppose the law\nWhich may or may not pass legal must her and there are questions about how many companies in California it would even apply to not still this bill is actually based on a requirements and a number of European countries that they have passed\nAnd uh it is actually has worked fairly well over there evidence suggests that are having more gender and racial diversity in the boardroom is good for business\nAs a group called the Peterson Institute it found that the presence of women on corporate boards and into the sweet ah may contribute to from performance and that among profitable companies move from no women leaders to thirty percent representation\nIs associated with a Fifteen Percent jump in profit some European countries like Germany Sweden Iceland Finland and France they have quotas and finds requiring that the companies have to add women to their boards or Norway I think requires companies to give at least forty percent of their director seats to women\nAnd [noise] and uh they say that some of the folks over in those countries who resisted it initially said that once they've actually experienced it a change their minds and they've kind of warmed up to quotas\nBut that's in Europe quotas have a different a different reaction in this country we are not crazy about being told we have to do things even when we know their rights\nBut we all know that when you bring in women and and people of color anybody who's got a different life experience into perspective\nThan just the same old viewpoint especially on things like boards it makes a difference and a lot of companies on their own of course understand that they're looking outside of their own companies maybe to bringing candidates who are a little more diverse and my uh you know refresh the gene pool a little bit and that's what this was about but the question is\nWhen you start mandating it the\nOne size doesn't always fit\nAbout all well you know just just doesn't work all the time\nAnd we don't know if this is going to be good for women will they be looked upon as serious members of the board if they're on there because they are quote quota hires so it could be because of that can be bad for them all and make some women who feel like\nI worked hard to get to this position I'm qualified for this position I've been here a long time I'm On the board but now people look at me as if I'm a quota higher they may not like that\nSo we have a lot of questions to go through we have a lot of opinions to go through and of course this was a time when uh the uh relationships between the sexes are fraught with all kinds of issues that is such a difficult time this is just one one more thing\nAnd of course I Know a lot of folks will say you know what we do need to have diversity but we should do it only as the marketplace depends and others will say well if you wait for the markets to come around and\nAnd grand for corporate culture to change that's not satisfying for women who want their equal representation now not when they're older when they're dead so you know what's the answer here I'm looking at the calls that are lining up right now I see all men where the women out there I Know you're out there listening you know\nPick up the phone give us a

all male boards of directors and that even goes to include things like non profit organizations now the the reason that this is so important is because when you have a state the size of California what it does has an effect elsewhere it's um [noise]\nUh they tell me that or something like a Seventy two corporations are headquartered in Charlotte in California which would be immediately applicable under this law that's not that many because you know most companies seem to be incorporated in Delaware for tax reasons but you know this one very very big prominent company\nIn California headquartered there and that is apple\nNow most of the companies that are in California are already pretty much they tend to be more diverse when they're out in California and many of them already have\nBoards that are not all male but apple only has two women on it's eight member board now apple is it's one of the most recognized brands in the world it's become the first trillion dollar publicly traded company in America\nAnd so when you add more diversity to its board and I think they would have to put us in one more women on at least well that's not insignificant so that could make changes elsewhere and ah you know other states\nMight say you know if it's working in California will try to say we'll have more and more state laws mandating changes I mentioned before the\nBreak that we don't have any ... any women calling in and that's still the case we have a bunch of our we have a regular panel wind up here but uh I Would like to have some women join in and tell us give us
