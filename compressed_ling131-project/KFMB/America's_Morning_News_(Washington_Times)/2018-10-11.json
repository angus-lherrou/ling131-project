cause a build up a surge ahead of the store and it can prolong the search as a storm as making landfall started as moving at a slower speed\n[noise] it's an impressive the titles certainly you have as a assistant professor in the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences there at the university at Albany state you of New York [noise]\nI can recall a time in my youth when we we made jokes about the weatherman and how accurate they were at by today's standards that was certainly true pre satellite and pre computer in the host of other things\nToday I think we may go the other extreme we feel all these great satellite photos and that you're about things like Doppler radar which most of us don't really understand but it sounds oh so technically precise and I think we tend to think of you is miracle workers and we we get on your case of your off even the even a little bit\n... let's just adjust to what is the current state of a a environmental and that was very understanding\nAnd turn in terms of weather predictions we've come a long way in the last ten to Twenty years and our ability to more accurately predict the weather uh in terms of hurricanes a week on predict uh the the tractor hurts\nThe the track for hurricanes with relatives turn the sometimes even five seven days oh as we saw the Florence um you know Twenty years ago that would have not been off of all\nYou would do research that focuses on tropical cyclone formation intensification and the interactions and for those who don't know by the way a psych loans uh hurricanes and type foods are all pretty much the same thing but in different locations is that right\nThat's correct and and you focus on on those areas first start with formation what is it about a given spot in the ocean that indicates that a tropical depression is going to form their which may then turned into one of these nasty storms\nSo and and the Atlantic a tropical depression is formed from clusters of thunderstorms that originate a off of Africa and then move over water\nUm we typically see about ... percent of the tropical uh what are called tropical waves are developed into a tropical depression is um typically in a sort of the August through October timeframe\n[laughter] why August to October\nIt's because the ocean temperatures are typically the warmest in the tropical Atlantic or the jet stream as the further north around that time of year and the atmosphere is the most humid around this time all three ingredients tend to make for a kind of prime conditions for hurricane so far\nI guess there's no body of a larger ocean anywhere as it doesn't have this type of storm when you appeared on the uh my nighttime talk show last night you would have created that in general with obvious obviously many exceptions but in general\nThe intensity of the uh the Thai food's or the western Pacific tend to be\nHigher than that of the Atlantic hurricanes is that correct and if so do we know what\nYes that's correct and that's just because the ocean temperatures just tend to be much warmer and uh the area of warm water has me a much greater in the western Pacific\n[noise] is it a ... ever do you think like people
