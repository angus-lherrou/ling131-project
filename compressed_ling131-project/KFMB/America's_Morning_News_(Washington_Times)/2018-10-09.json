few times and I'd watch it for a few seconds it looked really cheaply made I couldn't tell if I was watching a comedy or something serious or parity I could not and so I just kept on going so that I make\nA mistake I think you did I used to watch doctor who I go back to the seventies and back then it was it was very cheesy and that was all the way through the seventies and into the eighties\nWhen they reported it uh Thirteen Years ago they put a little bit more production value to it and then the quality of the series is a lot better than the rubber monsters that you remember back from the

some good news for the farmers listening to us in Iowa this morning the Trump Administration is moving to allow all year round sales of gasoline with higher blends of ethanol\nOr doctors in Texas are also protected from any civil or criminal liability meaning that if you're a grieving family member you can't take them to court after they've taken your loved one off a ventilator\nNow there are states such as uh Oklahoma for instance where doctors are explicitly forbidden from withdrawing life sustaining treatment without any agreement from the patient or the patience legal surrogates\nI think are just two other states California and Virginia offer abroad greenlight protections like those in Texas so most states don't allow this but we have a California Virginia Texas I guess\nI'm rich rich or you know has these complicated laws dealing with this unbelievably complex situation as I said there's a little girl at the center of this now we don't know if the little girl is still in their doctor\nSay she's gone there is no brain activity\nThe girl the little girl little Payton is no longer there just the shell is left\nBeing kept artificially resuscitated they're artificially ... having respiration by a machine they say it's cruel to the child to keep the body in that state the parents say we need more time now what is happening here they they have some legal action is back and forth over the weeks and they were given two weeks to find another place to take the child\nAnd that's proving to be very very difficult it seems to me that you might want to have if you're going to have a law saying that a hospital has that kind of awesome power over the wishes of the parents there must be a way to deal with the parents' wishes as well there should be a way to mandate that another facility would have to take that child I Would think\nThat's not the case in in Texas the parents are left on their own there and they could lose their child against their wishes I mean we know the child is probably lost already but shouldn't we respect that family's wishes at least until they can come to terms of what they have to do\nThe mom whose name is Tiffany ... said this is as a a day or two ago as of right now they have not found a facility but they remain hopeful there\nBut she says people are sending them different locations all across the country that they think might want to take a\nOr the girl and they're they're keeping up on it here's here's a quote from the mom Peyton never gave up on anything and I know that in this situation she wouldn't give up either at the fact that the doctors told me that her heart would stop on its own this weekend and she's still alive she's still made it until today that lets me know\nTill today that lets me know that patients not done she's still here to fight so I'm her voice I'll do it for her so that's the situation we find ourselves in the morning it really is no good answer but there must be something better than the family losing the right to uh to make a final determination like that and maybe they just need time to come to grips with it [noise]\nUm you know you're told you know you have a child you love the child you have an active life with that child and then the child gets sick and ends up like this it must be very very difficult probably nothing more difficult in your life would you ever experience and having to make a decision like this and then you have doctors coming along and saying we're making the decision for you\nNow it seems cruel it seems arbitrary but the doctors also have a have a responsibility to their patient the girl is the patient not the parents and so the doctors are saying we are in charge of this girl and this girl's treatment and it is our medical opinion\nA that this girl is gone she's brain dead you can keep the body going for you know who knows another year or two years or however long before the end of the whole system collapses\nBut the girl was never coming back and it's cruel to keep the child that way I mean who is right who's wrong I don't know every situation is also probably different I don't know that one law fits all but tell me what you would do in a situation like this you know would you\nHow do you find a facility that would take the child if nobody wants to take on that burden I don't know if the parents could pay for that that's got to be awfully expensive [noise] uh I don't know what the insurance situation is in Texas it's not one of the more advanced states with insurance health insurance\nSo we don't know call us eight hundred

shows up for work this morning day one of the new job and the sooner or later although I don't think the docket this term includes any but sooner or later the Supreme Court will again have to tackle the thorny issues surrounding the second amendment\nWe thought we'd take a look at the directed to which that might go with Dave workman senior editor at the gun Meg ... dot com and that liberty part press he's also a communications director for the citizens committee for the right to keep and bear arms are there any particular\nA Second Amendment issues that you could expect to see it coming out before the Supreme Court in the not too distant future\nWell there are a couple of cases down in California that I think your trend wind their way up through the courts as we know the the the Ninth Circuit court of appeals in San Francisco the most liberal court in the United states and it's also the Will Shortz heard\nAnd I think there's there are a couple of gun case down there I Believe there is also going to be a new challenge to the Jersey a concealed carry a scheme that they have gone back there or maybe Maryland will come up\nAnd maybe Maryland will come up to a there are several states with very restrictive concealed carry statutes and with a a more conservative more are constitutionally oriented Supreme Court I think some of those laws are going to come under what we call strict scrutiny and we'll see a wooly fair\n[noise] one of the more important gun control issues to come up before the courts in recent years is a D.C versus Heller that is to say a look at the district of Columbia's gun control law I Want to quote what a appellate courts to judge Kavanaugh had to say seven years ago a quote\nIn disapproving D.C.'s ban on handguns in approving a ban on machine guns and in approving longstanding regulations such as concealed carry and felon in possession of laws\nHeller established at the scope of the second Amendment rights and plus the constitutionality of gun bans and regulations is determined by reference to text history and tradition unquote then judge Brett Kavanaugh your thoughts on how this will carry forward into of cases before the Supreme Court [noise]\nWell I think that gives us a hint of four or eight and justice Kavanaugh is going to come down on Second Amendment issues he understands that\nAre all rights can be regulated to some degree but they're not government regulated privileges and certainly the second amendment is not a government regulated privilege it is a fundamental constitutionally protected right\nAnd I think from from reading what he said in that historic descent I thought it was ... you get the\nImpression that he is going to come down\nOn the side of the individual right to bear arms even outside the home or with a permit they they they were really forced by the courts to create a concealed carry system in the district of Columbia District but\nAgain it's not above being challenged again in the courts and you know that may be a case that comes before the high court to eventually\nAnd has been a while since we've had a major Second Amendment issue before the Supreme Court despite the fact that there have been any number of uh uh such cases bubbling around out there which may be symptomatic of a larger condition at the Supreme Court and that is a reluctance to touch hot potatoes I've never understood that\nI was then why Congress doesn't like to even though it's their constitutional duty to do so but they're afraid of of reelection if they vote on some controversial issue that's a chicken but are understandable with the Supreme Court they're there for life\nWhy should they shy away from such issues\nI think historically as we saw with the retired Justice John Paul Stevens [noise] ah there are some liberal justices who have been on the court who really didn't want to take on the second amendment rumor Sanford limits and wrote that great piece or some years ago called the embarrassing Second Amendment\nYou know there's there's a lot to that sentiment ah it's embarrassing but to a lot of these liberal\nThe jurors who think God you know we're stuck with the second amendment I Wish we could just tell the world that this applies only to the militia well we've gone beyond that that horses lift the barn\nOr the second amendment protects an individual right and now they're going to have to deal with that yeah and I think with the justice capital and the high court we probably stand up pretty good chance of dealing with it\n[noise] and then again there's always the worry many conservatives feel that uh we will have another quote conservative justice unquote who doesn't prove to be a idiot logically pure seems a democratic presidents\nHave picked a ... a logical clones probably more reliably than have Republicans us not forget the Justice Stevens\nWas a a Gerry Ford pick\nYeah but you know Jerry Ford was what some people might call her rhino Republican in name only I I never met Jerry Ford gay and you know we'll we'll just let the history decide what kind of represented he was\nA I think with Kavanaugh though we've got a a pretty good idea that he's going to stick pretty close to the second amendment would admit at the time that it was written in what it means today\nAnd you know I think we're looking at a uh some good times I think for the second amendment because ah as my friend Alan Gottlieb but the second amendment foundation has said many times it's time to make the second amendment great
