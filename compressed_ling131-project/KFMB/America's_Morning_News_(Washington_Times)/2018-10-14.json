you and I talked about this before because he said we we had said if you've been listening to the show for a while you know for the last couple of years we've been saying if the left truly wishes to get rid\nThe electoral college in the next step also is to get rid of the Senate\nThere you go yeah yeah you can ... a reporter at NBC News\n[noise] ah over the weekend on Saturday\nIt may not happen

senators don't necessarily represent\nThe population of the United states right necessarily oh that was that was his point yeah uh but you know when when we we've talked about this for the longest

Welcome alive right\nThat it would take like old gentleman you back as far as the cabinet on here and go and and the compilation it it wouldn't have mattered\nBut who was elected president of the Republican side there would have done this to anyone would have been crews ... whoever you know just plain chairs Trump fights back is like a lion and\nAnd and and and and he just makes me very proud to be in the ... and they're actually very proud to say that I voted bad\nI I Would say this Bryan that I I'm not sure and we will we will never know but I'm not sure how another Republican would have reacted to the heat on Kavanaugh if they might have withdrawn his nomination\nAnd I think that's something to consider is that is it that Trump or wouldn't back down and and he refused to withdraw that combination that's a possibility I don't know how to quantify that because we'll never know but it's I think we have to consider that possibility\nWell thank you for taking my call\n... ... if you'd uh you'd take care and but he brings up a point that we have made all along we made it last week made of the week before and I you know well this is what you get when you get Trump now this would have happened no matter what\nIs this the the the craziness surrounding it and and the less behavior definitely would have happened I'm In the past Republicans other Republicans might have been\nApparently not Lindsey Graham but [laughter] but other Republicans might have because we talked about how the Republicans in the past have\nHad been quick to eat their own I don't I don't know I Can't say that about a is it because we don't we'll never know if Ted Cruz at one or is he mentioned a Rubio or anybody else another Republican were there or Mike Pence I have no idea\nUh we don't know if if they would have withdrawn the nomination\nUm when the press this president basically said okay fine we'll do another FBI background check 'em you know giving it the tire\nA vetting process of seven complete background checks [noise] so I don't know I but I Do know that this president has been less willing to back down I'm as unpredictable as he may be at times\nHe did not backed down from the barrage of stories from the media\nI thought you know not one\nNot too but a total of four they're really really voting for Ted Cruz and so our time for science I'm ... and and I thought I thought to myself you know okay that's that's a that kind of enthusiasm\nUm even if we were to show that uh we don't do and we don't do investments because again as we mentioned earlier I don't believe they really do anything and tells it it might tell your audience which way you're going but there are the the point is is that we have the discussion\nOn the ideas and we believe that our audience than the rest of the country is smart enough to make their own decisions they may be willfully ignorant not our listeners but others may be willfully ignorant along the way they can make their decision\nOr you know or are there still capable of finding the information whether they choose to or not but ultimately it is about\nA wind that person is elected if I\nIf I'm campaigning for them if I'm doing a volunteer work for them if I donate to their campaign I'm skills from day one going to watch them on on the issues on their work you judge them on the work and then of course a head of that work\nYou are back them in order to you know uh to to\nHave them do that work to keep them in place to do that work and you see a George W. Bush or anybody else that came together and most did on the right or for judge Kavanaugh's confirmation and it really was about\nWhat the work and and and the results of the work of this president by nominating Kavanaugh but also the Senate or more importantly and more recently uh the work there\nAnd why it's important for Republicans in this case right now to be banded together or because it used to be where we could have the discussion will still have them I'm sure of the you know the far right conservatives on Capitol Hill versus the moderates\nUm but the ... and one of those moderates along the way would include Lindsey Graham\nI was just going to I was just going to um mentioned that that we knew that three weeks ago mhm that the left was motivated because I hate Trump right uh I don't know how much more motivated they could get I don't know right to sway motivate them more or whether there will be a a whether there'll be more of a sign of of despair\nIt's fair and hopelessness we know the young people and I haven't seen a change in the ... young people that vote Democrat are are not enthusiastic about voting in this mid term whale that and that could hurt the Democrats\nBut what I Know now know\nIs that the Republican Party you mentioned Lindsey Graham you might look at look at Lindsey Graham ... fight to defend Trump and his peck yeah because if you are defending his pick your defending Trump right there is a unity there if you see that George W. Bush or read that\nCalled Collins numerous times or didn't tell her how to a vote when you see the colon speech\nYeah and and except for ... really are ... there were some things I disagreed with her on her speech or like when she gave a Dianne Feinstein the pass and the big past what she shouldn't have done because I've\nDianne Feinstein was the reason that we got to this point to begin with and just say that I Know that she would never leak anything like that is forgetting about everything else that she\nDid wrong and uh but the fact is Collins speech was very very thorough walked through every single a point and came across as very very common sense and this is Susan Collins defending the great Trump pick\nOf Brett Kavanaugh\nUm you know you can only fight so much within your own party before you realize it's working against you and the things that you wish to\nUh uh get done as a Republican the Republican Party right now is a pretty big party some pretty big party going from conservatives to moderate liberal really is as many when it comes when it comes to spending culturally uh probably a more rights than they've been in a while\nA more constitutions listen they'd better in a while when it comes to social issues not spending issues are there as bad as Democrats have been in the past ah ah ah right now and you know but and and that's a shame but overall when you look at it\nYou have unity in that party\nAs I said last week like I Can't remember when we had such unity part of it is the fights or from the president but the president has always had that fight in rhetoric\nBut in some sense you know when some of the people that he picked and how he would change his opinions or a ... on them and\nNot stick with them and you know even you know going out perceptions as you're still goes after them as he did others early on major think OK doesn't really know who is picking this really of confidence in the people out there and him sticking by Kavanaugh\nWasn't just rhetoric it was the substance of no he stays and we're going with him and I don't know whether that embolden other people to say what they what they said\nI don't know you know ... what was\nThe spark that drove Lindsey Graham to still be on the Sunday Morning new shows same he'll GO Campaign anywhere in any purple state\nYeah right ... you know and that's it because\nThat's where the effort has to be we can still have the discussions within a the right\nOn issues of where we need to go especially putting pressure on them to control spending to change fiscal policy\nOr to the extent that it is going to be meaningful and mean great things long term for this country I think we are light years right now or to say that this kind of momentum can get us to that point where we can change the spending habits\nI mean for Republicans and their mentality on that is is not there yet we're we're probably away from that because that goes back to again but we said the base uh the the rank and file Republicans and and what they want out of their government but again that's a discussion we can have\nUltimately what has to happen though and this is this is you see this to some extent on the lap while in social media and then the protests calling out or or even officially the calling out of a Dianne Feinstein I mean before this process the uh Democrats of California you know not backing her officially\nA for her run and that kind of again ... that's their that's an anomaly\nOften on the left they are better than the right at\nLetting the uh mansions of the world\nAnd even maybe a high camp uh uh do what they do in their state\nBecause it gives them the seat ultimately on other end the vote on other issues I'm On the right there has to be I I guess a greater unity politically on Capitol Hill of\n\nBuilding building the wall really if you if you think about it that guards guards this nation\nAgainst the kind of behavior we saw over the last few weeks this is not this kind of behavior is not over they believe they almost got there they believe they did change the process they do believe they can change the process on other items if they get a head start which is why they start with well we need to do away with the Senate\nAnd we predicted this at the moment they talked about getting away with a good well in the way with the electoral dial the Democratic senators won't before that don't that's it's not going to have you know it's not right now but the point being is their behavior is not going to change and they'll work to that and and\nIt means if the because if they're willing to you know to talk about and and maybe even get some kind of moving growing movement and the calling for doing away with the Senate which again will never happen\nThey are willing to do and and work in any in every direction to do away with this and that and those little things and that guard has to be built that power that castle if you will that wall that mode has to be built around this nation to protect this constitution\nYou can get a few things done if you're not unified but I Believe you get a lot more things done when you're unified especially when you're unified\nOver the substance of of an issue in the substance is here I'm a very easy presumption of innocence right due process constitutional issues not defending somebody\nWhen you talk about those are all ... ... moral issues and that's what has United the Republican Party I Hope it continues to unite them through the election and if they are able to take the house it'll be interesting to see if they can take that unity into two thousand Nineteen in two thousand twenty\nAnd get legislation passed that is extremely productive and conservative\nAnd hopefully give Trump a chance to win in twenty twenty against state yeah [noise] ... or a book or right\nBy the way I remember after the Roy Moore last that's when they got the tax deal done and that's when they got that legislation done they couldn't get it done before they lost that seat when they lost that seat that was motivating it shouldn't have been they should have been ... motivated before that\nEight six six Ninety read

applauded development of purity products about I'm exciting new product available exclusively through purity bought or sold the omega three super ...\nWe've got a special offered me a free bottle offer stay tuned we're gonna be given out that phone number ... Jesus must get to ingredient number two because this will make us three super pill does something that no other fish oil chronic can do it actually lowers cholesterol talk about these plants symbols explain how this works and why it's so important\n[noise] right well I don't know anyone who isn't concerned about their cholesterol if you have high cholesterol obviously you want to lower it if you have normal or healthy cholesterol obviously you want to maintain it sure well in the world of dietary supplements there is one compound one ingredient\nThat stand head and shoulders above anything else they're called plants they're all they have over a hundred and forty human clinical study shown to lower significantly lower LDL cholesterol and again LDL as the bad cholesterol\nHDL the good cholesterol right though obviously you don't want to lower HDL plant thorough only target LDL and the studies are pretty dramatic they show that in as little as a few weeks four weeks you can see anywhere from five to Fifteen Percent reduction in your LDL level\nSafely and naturally absolutely no side effects very effective they've known about plants they're off in the Nineteen fifties and they work to be a very different mechanism than Staten trucks so I wouldn't tell people to stop taking that and drugs or not\nDrugs were not trying to position this as an alternative to Staten Staten work by preventing the production of cholesterol in the liver plants that rolls work differently\nThey block the absorption of cholesterol in the intestine plants there also are similar structurally to the cholesterol molecules and they basically confuse little cells in your intestine called my feels into thinking that the plants they're all\nOr actually the cholesterol particles so the mice deals pick up the plants their roles instead of the cholesterol particles and the cholesterol particles in that sort of just get passed through urine test and then you ultimately excrete them instead of absorbing now\nPoint is if you're on that and you can take slants they're off as an addendum therapy to help control your cholesterol\nStudies actually have been done to show that they can amplify the benefits and of course this particular product you get obviously first off the full clinically tested amount of the plants they're all to deliver the benefits as shown in the study\nThat's something that's very important because a lot of products out there that you'll see that have plants cells on the label may only deliver a tiny fraction of what any study as ever showed any benefit for purity delivers the full amount that you need to get these benefits\nNow let's talk about the third ingredient in the formula co Q. ten which is also becoming one of the more popular nutritional ingredients all of them will tell us about co Q. ten and why it's valuable for our health what is what is it do\nWell co Q. ten is found that every single cell and your body if they're from the moment you're conceive until the moment you lead the earth\nUnfortunately as you age you lose co enzyme Q. ten so by the time you're in your senior years you've only got about half as much co Q. ten as you did when you were about twenty now when you think co enzyme Q. ten\nOne word should come to mind pat\nEnergy you cannot make energy\nWithout co enzyme Q. ten is being\nCritical pivotal energy component of every cell in your body Ninety five percent of all your energy is related to the amount of co enzyme Q. ten in your body without an adequate supply you become energy efficient you technically would have energy the fish and sell so\nCohen's on Q. ten delivers a whole panoply of different benefits were putting in fifty milligrams a perfect dose for you to get every single day it's going to support healthy blood pressure is great for your gums\nYou're a person who has tender gums maybe when you lost their brush your teeth you noticed a little ... maybe a little bleeding could be a sign that you've got a co Q. deficiency coincide Q. ten supports immune function\nIt supports brain health and cognitive function it's a very powerful anti accident in fact one of the most powerful anti accident ever discovered they're actually taking a look now at coincide Q. ten in its role in exercise and muscle performance\nOne other interesting note coins on Q. ten really has become popular in the United states as a topical beauty products you're seeing a pop up and beauty products where\nOne study recently showed up to a forty percent reduction in wrinkled death and his little was ten weeks or so when you use ... a very potent ingredient very safe and greedy and so the three in one product we're talking about these three amazing ingredient extremely safe for long term use for short term youth in any dosage\nAnd I don't know if you saw that report the other day but basically half of Americans are taking one or more pharmaceutical drugs so I Know a lot of people out there listening already taking something they're thinking is this safe should I take it to my doctor\nThere may be no three safer ingredients and the three we're talking about today\nNow Jason as
