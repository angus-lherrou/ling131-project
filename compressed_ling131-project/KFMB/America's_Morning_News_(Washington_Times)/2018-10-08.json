she did kind of surprised people and she said that she would she would someone said let's put put someone else up against ... and a ... attack against such as ... which is why she went\nAbout me and everybody sort of took it seriously um for about a New York minute until she treated again it said you know basically you know I'm just\nI'm just kidding but\nShe may not be she may not be so does her parents family has a home in Maine so she does qualify\n... that's interesting well you know there's there are a record number of women running for Congress this year so I guess it would be no surprise of Maine has a another woman running against a woman senator Collins who's been there for quite a few years now\nSo you know on television we can see what was happening on the Senate floor things look fairly normal\nUh I guess the TV cameras up in the gallery looking down don't really pick up a lot of the interpersonal relationships and how that works what was it like up on Capitol Hill are our people did they get do they have I contact with each other across the aisle do they swap each other on the back of his all that just gone right now\nA little of both um this particular vote on a confirmation was unusual in that well in many ways but it was unusual in that the senators all were in the chamber at the same time\nAnd they were voting from their seats so everybody could hear their gays or nays normally they just go up to the recording clerk and uh you know just talk to that person or raise their hand a thumbs up or thumbs down and then they leave the chamber\nThis was one of those very high profile votes and everybody was required to\nBe there in their desks stand up for their desks will say how they were going to vote uh I did watch a lot of the inter personal communication that was going on of course the Republicans were huddled with the Republicans the Democrats were huddled with the Democrats there was a lot of conversation going on\nUm but uh you know that not many people talking to his wise or at least ... uh which is interesting body language\nA but it was it was a one of those rare occasions where there was a lot of milling about and ah and also just uh\nEverybody in the chamber at the same time you you may not do this or you may Michael but a lot of people think that the chamber's full when they vote usually do or even when they speak from the Senate floor but they actually tend to be speaking to an almost empty chamber\nBecause everybody is monitoring the proceedings\nMonitoring the proceedings for on closed circuit or in their offices in the office buildings so uh they\nAll these fiery speeches and such are usually given just to the recording clerk in the uh the presiding officer\nSure well I guess they expected that there would be a lot of people watching at home on television and plus there was a weekend so there are probably more people available at home to sit down there and just watch this for hours I Know that\nI kept running into people who are who are saying people who would not normally be interested in politics thing or even during the week of the week before when when the hearing was on that they were recording it on TV are just to make sure when they got home may be able to watch the intense public interest in this\nIt's Eighteen before the hour and on for a cyber talking with our Capitol Hill correspondent Linda Kenya I'm so what happens next I mean a Congress has not in today as a holiday plus it's a Monday\nSo I mean they don't have any work days left before the election do that\nVery few in fact the house has already off the house to the entire month of October all so they could go back to their home districts and campaign the Senate probably would have done very much the same had it not been for this cabinet fight and they still\nHave a few things on their agenda to do and then we'll go to cross the I's dotted the\nIf you will on the um on taxes they're hoping to to bring that up again\nSo then what they want to reverse was another round of tax cuts is that correct\nAnother round of tax cuts that's right that's right and that bodes well for the uh for votes during the elections but you know all spending package is generally\nWhat are supposed to begin in the house and how it's done so it's going to be a lot it's a place holder legislative items in the Senate agenda\nOr not the least of which will be a number of confirmations as well nothing is high profile as Supreme Court nominee mind you but still so low or just lower a level judge ships and things of that nature some some more a lower level um\nUh administrative positions federal agency position there's always those to go through 'em\nSo not a lot of high profile stuff left because keep in mind you know the Senate a lot of those folks are up for re election and they they really want to get to their home districts as well\nSo am I come back when river ... highest who might be a lame duck session\nWill they take up some things van and I'm Wondering how the election returns might ... you know affect that because I say the Democrats take the house or maybe even take the Senate which doesn't seem likely but it is a possibility but if they take the house\nAnd do the Republicans at that point try to ram through everything that's on their wish list or do they look at the election returns and say maybe we'd better mend our ways little to get more in touch or if the Republicans maintain their hold on the house then do they just ram everything through and what happens to money for the wall do you think the president in a lame duck session might get the money for his border wall but he wants\nWell they have until December seventh to figure out\nThat issue because that's part of the art and she knew resolution on Sunday\nA that was passed up before the house went home for the entire book to October and it also it will have civil defense money so they do still have to work on that uh they deliberately made sure that the ISI are would go past the mid term so that it will become an election issue\nAnd so that is going to have to be dealt with but other than that\nAnd that you know the last of the appropriations which are also important that they are\nUh that's really the only thing that they're going to have to do and they will probably try and read that through knowing that the they risk a government shutdown if they don't\nMhm oh government shutdown while I Would be interesting if it happens in a lame duck session because what happens if they if they can't get it finished before the before the calendar runs out on them I don't think they want to be there on Christmas Eve Christmas would not be a good time to have a government shutdown one would not think well we've\nWe've been there before on Christmas Eve although as I recall it was for health care not shut down but we just tend to go very close to the line they shut down\nOr something or think about All right what else was going on we before we let you go anything else we should know about as as a as we look to see what Congress does and you know for the next couple of a couple of months before they before the new new Congress comes in and whichever form\nOr they get better question would be what Congress doesn't [laughter] is it a little joke\nUp on Capitol Hill we don't know which is worst Kobus being in session of Congress being out of session aren't you know that we're not sure yet what they're going to do it's mostly going to be a case of passing she are and are\nMostly

with Rob the general counsel and director of the center for the American future at the Texas Public policy foundation their website Texas policy dot com\nA long and painful procedure but uh for the administration has been a significant victory your thoughts about the lessons that you hope we should look we have learned or that we should have learned from this entire process\nHas the oral wherever the past several weeks but the right outcome we got to at the end I think in the wrong path a Jew and there's two lessons to learn on is that when conservative stand up and do the right thing\nAnd have courage that we can get to the right outcome\nAnd the second lesson is that and looking back over the past ... this is an experience that the American people should never be drugs through and she never made it to any person again as what was was done to judge now justice capital\nI Would I Would agree with you one other thing that I think that we might keep in mind and that is\nBut in mind and that is that if someone suffers a sexual assault that is a terrible thing one can hope as the person who did that is a brought to justice is try if convicted is sufficiently punished\nAnd I am prepared to bend over backwards offering all kinds of ah a consolation and an simple to do some people however when such a person then goes in the direction of accusing someone else will having done this\nI'm afraid the standard has to be considerably higher neighborly you've got to have some kind of goods to actually offer you've got to be able to be specific to offer the kinds of things that can in fact lead to a credible accusation otherwise it's not enough to say that I was one sexually assaulted and\nLet's pick some guy whoever's handy because any will do because they're all pigs that doesn't cut it\nWe were so close and this to setting a new standard that the accusation is the conviction itself and we saw that start to snowball when you started to have the completely absurd accusations ... non uh mostly\nUh alleged against justice Kavanaugh after the first couple of allegations began to to gain traction and\nIt quickly spiraled out of control I think that the Senate Judiciary committee should be commended as Karen Grassley at bringing this back to a disciplined focused process\nThat gave their fair opportunity for credible accusations to be evaluated a but also move to that through and got to an end point\nWhere with sufficient information that committee was able to make an informed choice than this one I think it was the correct one to confirm justice Kavanaugh\nAnother lesson that I Would hope that would be learned would be if in fact someone does suffer a sexual assault it may be terrible you may want to banish the memory from your mind if you wish justice you should make yourself sit down and write down details names places times\nAre all kinds of information that they can actually be used because if in fact you allow the terror of the moment to adjust to\nWash away the details you cease to be a credible witness but that's another lesson that I think perhaps that that we might learn on the confirmation process itself a or their reforms that should be made or is it just a case of live the gross national attitude\nYou know I think the lesson anything for and what the reform is that I Would like to see as I Would like to see accountability\nAgainst those that abuse the system I would like to see accountability against any staff at the Capitol that leach confidential information\nI Would like to see accountability against individuals subject to the penalty of perjury that intentionally provided false information to the committee we have to draw the line and say the truth matters\nAnd the windows are going to use the process there has to be consequences so that hopefully that will be a just waiting to anyone to try to repeat those types of abuses nature\nRobyn McGee general counsel of director of the center for
