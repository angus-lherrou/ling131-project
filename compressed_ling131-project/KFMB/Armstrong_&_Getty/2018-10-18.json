trends and voter turnout and ways of campaigning and there's so little of the conventional wisdom and divisions that still applies um or we don't know how much they applied because everything's changing so rapidly politically speaking\nAnother reason if you're a Trump fan you might want to the Dems to win the house is uh it's just easier to run against something and Trump can run against the Democratic house stopping them from doing all the good thing if you own the whole government\nEvery problem is put on you yep yep and it's tough\nWell in in appropriately some extent so anyway ah

H on one of one would have it but they're trying to\nTeach you the you know the basic theories the basic principles but supply and demand rent control causes housing shortages\nA few people benefit beautifully\nAnd and it sounds good meaning cruel landlords can't raise your rent over and over again until you have to move out\nBut overall it does much more harm than good in fact in ... Linda ... was the sweetest to cash Swedish economist who chaired the Nobel Prize committee for many years and they are no conservative fireman's oh once declared that rent control quote is the best way to destroy a city other than bombing\nWho the hell of a that's a good quote ask her [laughter] kick in the ass or Linda ...\nUm and so ah there was a a group of ... that were looking specifically at rent control in San Francisco which estimate Tori is Lee high housing costs if you're not hip to that I mean you've got to be rich to live in a dog house instead\nResidents to San\nI housing costs if you're not hip to that I mean you've got to be rich to live in a dog house and Senate rent is too damn\nI agree um unless you bought it you know your dog has many years ago and then you're you're trying to figure out you know how to handle your taxes when you finally Philip but anyway um this uh this woman uh Rebecca Diamond\nAnd her colleagues used data from private company that was able to combine public records to track the addresses of all San Francisco residents between Nineteen eighty and twenty sixteen even if they moved out of California it that's a little scary [laughter] they\nKnow where you've been and they know where you went but they study the effect of changes in San Francisco's rent control policy specifically in Nineteen Ninety five and in the long or short of it is\nStatic analysis failed landlords had\nStrong incentives to either convert rental units into condos or demolish older buildings and build new ones that were not grandfathered out if you know what I mean 'cause older been all the newer buildings that were affected differently ... so they adjusted what they did to avoid the policy that was going to screw them and\nLandlords affected by the policy reduced the rental units supplied by Fifteen Percent\nSo if you put all landlords under\n... you know the the the the sort of regulation the chances are very very good that rental units supply will declined dramatically\nAnd\nThen the very people you you would tend to hurt get screwed it's of very cold comfort that there's almost nothing you can do about rising property values and rising rents except let the market work and if you're the person who has to move to the suburbs and you don't wanna\nThat sucks and I agree with you it sucks but sometimes life sucks John\nIs in theory is the free market solution to to high rank kind of reducing building restrictions are zoning restrictions to enable more support like what I Would ... the ... what is the free market solution\nTo that that would help a great deal if you get a little ... if you moderate you're building a regulations\nOr if it's super complicated especially in San Francisco because a I don't know if you've ever seen it on a map it's surrounded by water a and they pretty much thrown cement into as much of the bay is they dare to create new a new land\nIt's also incredibly earthquake prone\nSo it's never going to be cheap and easy to build housing in San Francisco you can go up\nBut there are the beautiful Nate [noise] beautiful colorful neighborhoods that that\nPeople value in our aesthetically wonderful but you don't necessarily want a line of high rises and so so it's complicated but yes that would that would be helpful also if it wasn't water locked\nBut that would help um ... it's it's it's tough but like ... another great example of that I'm Sorry I'm really end of this stuff\nIf you make it too expensive for any school teachers to live within a reasonable distance of your schools\nThe market

been having trouble selling out games in their temporary home in LA the step hubs center the tiniest stadium and then the NFL and that a large number of the seats that are sold are actually going to fans of that game's opposing team shore yeah\nA very common a little Twitter game by a lot of football reporters are taking a picture of the home game that the chargers and saying can you find the chargers fans in this crowd while at the sea of red or whatever the opposing team's color as\nWell you know I could absolutely see a lot of people around America especially in football season saying hey do you want to go to LA to watch the Packers site\nA play the rams and uh well I'm Sorry not the the rams but the charge or they're in the San Diego chargers which there is a God um I could see that being a reality or the other hand\nThere been a more predictable outcome\nIn LA which loses football teams over and over again because they just don't get fans support because there's too much to do and people are at the beach all of a sudden having two football teams and that being a disastrous idea has there been a smaller surprise in the history of sports how dumb\nBut not even looking ahead to forecast for the chargers future revenues once they moved to the new stadiums that doping in twenty twenty are not really dazzling NFL Owners and executives at one of the major clues coming from the season ticket prices the charges announced the new stadium\nNot they can be called chip cheap given the fact you can always watch games at home for free\nWhich is way better I I don't think I Will ever go to another NFL game really uh no I understand why some people go because it's an all day party with my friends that you do it like that but in terms of\nWatching the sports game way better at home\n... times better terms that a third of the new stadium seats twenty six thousand will be price between fifty in Ninety dollars perceived per game and the seat license beep and the

should that phrase out of their eyes right hey got thermal imaging eyeballs that same thing this has all this has led to a lot of concerns about what can be done with all that data\nBecause the information is sent to an Internet Internet based portal that helps security forces on the ground [noise] they don't Kay says the information's all secured is only seen by the security agents that is controlling the robot\nI realize this is as obvious as the chargers should not moved to Los Angeles but uh the privacy of dead dead dead dead 'cause I like this idea we have ... where the ... their

the final page of the article from the New York times and the guy who's running a private homeless camping his property or he can see there have been problems uh an opioid overdose several uh an ax attack\nCriminals fugitives trying to blend in lots lot arguments Akron police officers have responded the property more than a hundred and twenty times this year sometimes more than once a day and managers of neighboring apartment complex for low income seniors have complained about harassment trespassing and discarded needles that settled that shut it down\n\nOn a completely different topic although it is financial Alex short and joined us Alex is a Washington Post reporter covering national breaking news which has got to be exciting work hello Alex how are you\nHey Joe has done\nA terrific it's nice to talk to you we're going to talk a little bit about the use the strange and curious economics of lottery prices and the way people respond to them and and how the lotteries have managed to get as long as your your story\n[noise] absolutely so um you may have noticed that you know mega millions of dollar ball has been in the news\nA pretty frequently the last few years and that's why a ... and the reason why as a mega millions last October they sort of changed the formula of how they operate 'em so they made prize is a small ones anyway more a common but the jackpots even bigger\nConsider hilarious around here that not only that people\n[noise] who wouldn't cross the street for three hundred million dollars or a dance that it will will leap at six hundred but not only that but those people who wouldn't cross the street for three hundred million dollars once it gets to seven hundred million will get in a pool was Nineteen other people for a fifth of the you know anyway\n[noise] absolutely and I think they figured out a like a formula they're like you know people who you know there's a a a group of people who had virtually play every drawing but then there's some who maybe they stop at the gas station they say oh it's up to six hundred million now I might as well jump in you know why the hell not so\nUh you know the the lottery conditions have definitely taken advantage of that psychology to sort of harness this phenomenon\nSo long story short they are dividing the pie differently now the the ... the super jackpot winner gets eighty percent of the pie we're used to be of all the available weddings it used to be smaller more evenly divided\nOn that that's not really what's driving the thoughts it's just um the the odds are that much greater I mean before so making millions for example um lashed last year before October your odds of winning the jackpot where one and two hundred and fifty million now it's one in three hundred and two million how they do that\nWell just buy an increasing the number of those balls that\nI'll be sure of the game the structure of the game so you can win the small price as you can win your two dollars back um and maybe have a better chance slightly of getting a million dollars but since\nThey introduced ten more you know now you have to pick from twenty five used to be Fifteen yeah now it's just that much harder so these these pots grow and grow and grow and they don't have winters like the last mega millions winter was in July I'm so it's grown since then\nYeah I'm going to quote from your article if you don't mind officials were worried that the relatively smaller but more frequent prizes a poultry one hundred million dollars for instance would result in jak pot fatigue and so they tweak the game so less often bigger amounts\nYeah absolutely and I think you know when you have those smaller amounts that people are heading more frequently\nUm you know people who are otherwise skeptical and don't join in will never never approach it so they figure they have to make those those numbers as teachers that can go yeah um and and that's really paid out like the last you know since October and this game it's been out since Nineteen Ninety six but since last October three at the top six have been in the last year\nUm including the one on friday which will be you know about nine hundred million dollars\nAnd you also mentioned in your piece in the Washington Post who drew law have Lincoln Armstrong and getting dot com that the last time somebody hit the mega millions was in July\nYeah a man that's becoming more frequent it's get they're getting bigger they're getting more um you know there's a lot fewer chances for people to hit them so they're just to keep rolling over and over and over again and the same thing happened ah with mega millions as well with our ball\nYeah you know it's it's so funny Alex ... you know we're we're kind of practical uh you know ... a flannel shirt wearing Midwestern guys um and I would love to see the lottery say we're going to give a million dollars to six hundred and ... what is it that it's eight hundred and sixty eight now or something like that would call it nine hundred million dollars\nWe're going to give a million dollars to nine hundred people I mean how exciting would that be I think that'd be great but nobody wants that I guess\nYeah that'd be a different tact I think it's just like that huge number you know once you start to kind of like well I can be an incident like half a billionaire you know that's I think that's what really draws people's attention but yeah that would be an interesting a case study of but I think it's just that just a huge sheer number is is what's driving a lot of it\nOut of the Washington Post Alex great to talk to you thank you for having me\nYou got it if I Can't buy a sports team with it I'm not getting to tell you what's the perfect lottery amount to when I\nTake the cash jak things to the uh the every twenty year increments things probably good because it keeps you from doing anything to her to kill us I mean to foreign ... yeah I I'm not worried about that just 'cause I I don't tend to roll that way but you get half of it up front if you take it up front\n[noise] and then half is going to disappear in taxes 'cause the government deserves half of what you got because they um well the roads or something in school um\nBut you don't want to be internationally famous because that would turn your life into a living hell you could retire go home for the ...\nOn depends how old you are on a couple of million dollars two three four million dollars and you would live whatever lifestyle you want it unless you're the sultan of Brunei for the rest of your life if you're saying your fifties I think the perfect prize\nIs probably about fifty million dollars\nYou opt to get that twenty five million dollars you end up with twelve and a half million dollars\nYou buy anything you want to go you know depending where you live go buy a two million dollar house for cash that's mine now you've got ten and a half million dollars what are you going to do by a couple of cars boats as their ... give away as much money as you want to charities and you'll never have to work another moment of your life\nTo deliver costs to buy the company that all my enemies workforce so I can fire them ... depends on the company's certainly certainly you don't need to do more math before I get the number of them if vengeance is your\nPriority usually\nIt might be happy if it might be a happy thing to win you know a little more than that but I think fifty might be the perfect amount then nobody care that you wouldn't even make your local paper [laughter] I don't think\nMarshall

Trump who's also a top Baxter in voters' decisions two thirds of voters say candidates support\nFor or their opposition to Trump will be a factor in whom they support depending on their political leanings the eye can see that I mean I Hope people understand that if\nYou if the party you prefer\nControls the White House and the Congress you're much better shape so that makes sense President Trump meanwhile seemed to threatened to withhold funding to fight wildfires in California the state doesn't clean up the state's forest Trump was saying during a cabinet meeting at the White House yesterday after the agriculture secretary\nTold them about the forests services ongoing efforts to prevent forest fires Trump had this warning for California\nI say to the governor or whoever's going

horrified\nDonald Trump may be remembered as the most honest president in modern American history [laughter]\nDon't get me wrong Trump lives all the time\n[noise] something for everyone he said that he had an active and and to be patient all he\nAll he all as they used to say back in ah like working class Chicago\n[noise] he said that he an act of the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history actually they are the eighth largest and that our economy is the strongest it's ever been in the history of our country which may one day be true but not yet\nIn part it's in New York thing everything is the biggest and the best that [laughter] I saw a comedy skits once were was that Letterman the old Letterman show where a guy was going\nInto oh no no no no it was it was kind of Will Ferrell an elf where he sees the sign says world's best cup of coffee [laughter] hey guys you get grants that that is very much in New York thing\nBut when it comes to the real barometer of presidential truthfulness keeping his promises Trump is a paragon of honesty for better or worse since taking office Trump is done exactly\nWhat he promised he would he kept his promise to move the U.S embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem something is three immediate predecessors also promised to do but did nothing about didn't even try he promised a crushing destroying ISIS\nTwo years later on the verge of limiting the Islamic State's physical caliphate which is key to their ah appeal in the wacky do extremist Muslim world\nHe promised to impose a travel ban on countries that he saw as posing a terrorist threat after several false starts the final version of his band was upheld by the Supreme Court he promised to punish Syria used chemical weapons on his people and unlike his immediate predecessor he followed through not once but twice\nTrump pledged to nominate Supreme Court justices in the mold of Antonin Scalia\nNow Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh sit on the high court Trump pledged to fill the federal appellate courts with young conservative judges so far the Senate has confirmed twenty nine more than any recent president at this point in his administration he vowed to pass historic tax reform signed the first major overhaul of the ... tax code in in three decades\nHe vowed and unprecedented regulatory roll back with a strict policy to eliminate to existing rags for every new rag and his first year he achieved eight point one billion dollars in lifetime regulatory savings that sort of numbers really difficult to settle on but it's billions of dollars' worth um\nDuring the campaign he told African American voters who I Believe some day we'll understand the fraud\nThat the Democratic party has perpetrated on black America it's personal note anyway during the campaign he told African American voters and I quote what do you have to lose I Will straighten it out I'll bring jobs back we'll bring spirit back\nThen on his watch African American unemployment reached lowest level ever recorded and his tax reform included a little noticed provision creating opportunity zones to try to write revitalize struggling towns and inner city communities\nI'm now ... somebody all might be saying he's inherited the momentum of the Obama years and we'd be going this well um even if he hadn't changed much policies I think you're wrong\nBut there's enough truth to it I might as well tip my cap to it every president gets more credit more blame than they deserve\nA on the economy and and this is this is really quite amazing and I apologize for reading a list to you but after a while the bulk of the list is the point he promised to cancel the clean Power Plan\nTo withdraw from the Paris climate accord to approve the Keystone excel in Dakota Access pipeline open the Arctic National wildlife refuge to export oil exploitation I'm Sorry exploration he fulfilled\nAll of those pledges da da da da da de ... George he kept his promise to oh that's that's on George that's Trump right okay he promised to withdraw from the Trans Pacific partnership which I think it was a mistake\nBut he promised it and he did it and impose tariffs on steel and aluminum which I think is the little silly he committed to reading of renegotiating NAFTA on the trail and he's done it that was good\nAnd the U.S Korea free trade agreement recently signed new deals with Mexico Canada South Korea a committed to imposing tariffs on China to force it to open its marketing stop at theft of intellectual property and his following through on that pledge whether you like it or not and I like it I think it's great our trade relationship with China is completely screwed up\nIt's all based on a decades old notion that China's a poor struggling emerging economy and there's still some truth to that but um and they're also an economic colossus and they don't need crutches anymore\n'cause they they keep whacking us in the head with their crutches shy yeah that's right Mr President\nHe pledged historic increases in defense spending and delivered pledge to bring back manufacturing jobs in manufacturing jobs are growing up the fastest pace more than two decades\nHe pledged to sign the right to try legislation that we've gotten behind give dying Americans access to experimental treatments he did it he pledged to take on the opioid that could happen the epidemic and will soon signed\nA sweeping bipartisan opioids package in the law I Believe that package will do very little good I Hope I'm wrong because it's such a scourge it's a it's a nightmare it's a disaster\nBut he said he do it and he has done it ... promises not kept yet like building the wall or repealing Obamacare hasn't been for lack of trying\nIn a few are instances he has backtracked on a campaign pledge like complete withdrawal of U.S forces from Afghanistan he's reversed course which I think kind of had to um\nPut crazily enough for a guy who says all sorts of wild crap that's not true and and behaves like in New York\nReal estate promoter when he's the president which bothers the hell out of me I was just he he makes me crazy but if he says he'll do something he's probably going to do it\nWhich I think it's remarkable a remarkable record of presidential promise\nBetter or worse depending on who you are and how you view the world [noise]\n\nJeeze he's the chief in ...\nAnd on who you are and how you view the world [noise]\nAnd then\nHe's the chief in ... and I mean he's coming in the room where he comes to that
