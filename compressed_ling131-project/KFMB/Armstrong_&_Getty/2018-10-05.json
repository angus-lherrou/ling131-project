... oh a and they don't actually carry that much weight Shonda reports themselves just because they if if if I were nuts\nAnd said you know Sean Thomas the uh you can tell you what he uh he does a lot of dog fighting\nI mean he's run a dog fighting ring for Fifteen Years number dog he's killed\nAnd then they go to you and you say what the hell are you talking about I Love dogs I Would never be engaged the dog fighting and they took they talk to everybody you've ever known and everybody you've ever known said there's no way he would do that my words would still be in the FBI report

obviously thought it was true there are legitimate newspaper\nThat a friend of Dr Ford's was pressuring Leland I'll call her legal in because that's how Dr Ford referred to her and her to lend her first name well right but and then they call them is Kaiser everywhere else so yeah there are too many people and I never and they all get along that line that's legal in because I remember the ... stuff right ... I'm\nA Wall Street journal says the doctor for it had some ah friends that were pressuring leave when to change your story and to me me take away from the whole thing should be this sentence that we've known for weeks by the way from Leland\nWas in the testimony we've known it for weeks she was a person\nThat Dr Ford says was closest to her at the time was that the party they all ran around together with Kavanaugh this was her star witness and we were in fed and I quote in her friends were trying to get her to the water this down a little but she said and I called\nTwo weeks ago she does not know Mr Kavanaugh and has no recollection of ever being at a party are gathering where he was president\nTo me that's the take away from this whole thing right the star witness for missiles forward from is Ford says I don't know Kavanaugh\nMe for saying they ran around together parties and stuff like that everybody knew everybody she said I don't know him and I never liked yeah me too me now and the FBI couldn't find any more than that and I'm Wondering what are you going to do right person quoted it in the big hearing that the whole world watched\nSaid I don't know what you're talking about you're never gonna satisfy people you're never gonna satisfy my angry relative who Vince ...\nThe sperm doesn't change or or you know there's not a mark off the politicians don't pass

do with a couple of twenty two year old ... not going to do right\nUm they they barely recall when they were twenty two in their life is quite a bit different at this point in their attitudes [laughter] but anyway having said that\nUm ... here millennials are a more open to socialism and this wasn't socialism is not defined in any of these things as their whatever their perception of socialism is\nUm and the ... and that's true overall but men are twice as likely as women to be open to socialism twice is like I'm shocked by that\nI I'm I'm I'm blown away I was expecting you were going to say women more than men and a a candidate who calls the refers to themselves as a socialist\nThirty seven percent a millennial men said that would make them more likely to vote only Nineteen percent of millennial women so again almost twice as many men is women liked the idea of the term socialist with a candle out ... that's a pretty big divide available for the longest time and

mere presence there promoted anger and shock among many Facebook employees some of whom said they took his action is a tacit show support for judge Kavanaugh as if it were an endorsement from Facebook itself\nCapital himself said I Want to apologize I recognize this moment is a deeply painful one internally and externally\nThe unrest quickly spilled over on the Facebook's internal message boards where hundreds of workers have since posted about their concerns\nTo quell the hubbub Facebook's chief executive the anti Christ Mark Zuckerberg\nLast friday explained in a widely attendance staff meeting that Mr Kaplan was a close friend that judge Kavanaugh's and broken no company rules which was what a grown up would say I'm not ah they're grown I'm not sure I'd grown up even should have to
