really good\nYou know what else is really good money we we get a chance to talk to a news maker we're we want to do this with like creative types who\nUm musicians moviemakers and stuff a nurse or the tax the future of the Armstrong and get his you're talking to each other's for an hour sculptor measure you want to talk to my improv comedy troupe no okay so we talked to a Mike Rogers who was the chairman right of the primitive alec committee on intelligence in the house\nFor a long time he was an FBI agent among other things these I'm writing and commentator and consulting now is really bright and interesting guy I\nTalked to him about a number of topics here a couple of the greatest hits let's have cut number one please my\nRight now ... number one or a\nWise that was not surprised that FBI agents have political opinions everybody has a political opinion or or or certainly certainly but he was smart shouldn't have one\nUm I was pretty surprised that people have strong opinions that they share among each other in the midst of investigations about some of the particulars they're talking about was that shocking to you talking about of course the the struck page text and that sort of thing\nUh well what shocked me most was the volume of those tax I don't know how either one of them got any work done\nThat there was seriously from Iraq and they were texting\nEach other yeah um\nYeah it does I mean listen every FBI agent has has some political beliefs uh it's ingrained and to you as a young agent or certainly used to be that none of that is allowed to filter into your work\nUh you know where there's no grey area and the bureau you're either you know you investigate the crime you find that details you find the facts you turn those over the prosecutor for prosecution or or not\nAnd so when you see that level of that discussion now it was now as a part of their work and I think you know if you're going to make that claim that it impacted their work you'd have to show me how that did that but clearly what was distracting to them was their relationship which was in violation of FBI rules are in effect cetera\nThat's one very small portion of our discussion on that topic we also asked him about his experiences on the house intelligence committee\nYou know a lot more than the average person having been an FBI agent and then on the intelligence community can we handle the truth is there a lot more bad stuff going on in a way more than the average person realizes we'd be horrified to know what you know\nUm I mean as far as politics or this particular case\nOr just in general being an FBI did not have any bad people are there out there doing bad things being on the intelligence committee and all the stuff coming in from around the world isn't ... significantly uglier world than we think and that's\nWhat ah there is plenty to keep you up at night I Will tell you that no shortage of those stories are for sure\nUh and you know that to me that's just the way it is I mean just think about a police officer in a city who doesn't say much\nHis likely because they've seen the worst of it in those cities or you know and that's it stick it becomes almost common place for them and they do their job and it keeps it away from the rest of the law abiding citizens at least we hope and so I think that's exactly what you see and then so I was I mean what's what people don't understand is what America has\nEverybody wants a in a lot of them are willing to do really bad things to get it and so when you look at even nation states the way they're changing tactics about how aggressive they're being\nA spying on the United states and trying to do disruptive cyber attacks meaning cause harm ... uh you know economic harm to American businesses and jobs and other things all that's real\nAnd it's coming and it's here and so just because your iPhone works every day and you think that you can you know be fat dumb unhappy strolling down the street\nThere are there is really good people trying to keep the lid on this whole thing so I Do believe that there is a little bit of a gap between what Americans know\nUh and and or think they know and what is really happening I took the war in a cyberwar in the United states uh most Americans don't know it and we're not necessarily winning\nAnd most Americans think as I said gosh everything works and I can I have on land biking now it's all great I don't care\nWell it it's it is\nI mean it it it's it's seven days or nerve wracking matching if this power goes out in a city like you know to fill in the blank New York city\nAnd for not for a day or two or three a week well how about forty five days or sixty days before they can get it back up and running because we had a destructive nation state attack on our electric grid mean what if people knew right there's no food no water there's no sewer there's no cash what do you think happened\n... million people lately going good lord [laughter] you'll have to listen to the fabulous broadcast to hear what President Mike Rogers a policy about cyber attacks would\nBe I'd never heard anybody throw that is a possibility really handsome and he's the guy who shared the intelligence committee had the intelligence the highest level thrown out the idea of New York with no power for forty five days holy cow and\nWe also did around the horn with him since he has a a intelligence and foreign policy expert about various uh nations around the world not least of which are was China number eight please Phil let's jump in a time\nWhat they would call their defensive region so they put our troops in a jury duty right that's a big departure from a country that says we only have a military for defensive purposes they're now making a court so call with their navy in Latin America and other places around the world that certainly not in keeping with their\nAt least their public statements but they're just a defensive nation creating the islands in the south China Sea and then militarized sing them not in keeping so they have all of these\nActions that don't fit their rhetoric of ... we're just trying to you know feed a billion

own\nConstituents are and flakes case running for president or whatever yeah there's that we use which is phoney and despicable and that's the business there and that is the business or and also as I put out earlier and this is an incredibly unfair thing to say and I'm not really comfortable saying it since\nYou know they're actually in our listening audience and these are real people I think there's a decent chance that the FBI report you know once they talk to more people in nailed down the facts makes Mrs Ford seem a little ...\nIt doesn't mean that is something that didn't happen to her but right or even being cabin on doesn't hold up there is just a bunch of things that just don't match up and then she's got some problems yeah yeah it wouldn't surprise me with that whole need the next door can't fly can fly right ... that\nThat may well be true is make or a bad person no I'm I'm where I've always been it's unknown in um knowable um what happened to her and then who did it and the rest of it\nUm [noise]\nUh let's see Susan Collins when the three ah since Thursday that it appears to be very thorough investigation but I'm going to going back later to personally review read the interviews\nUm did you say seven hundred pages did you make that up I mean that oh okay\nI just I was thinking it could be very very long I mean depending on a number of people they interviewed ... one of the transcripts or ... oh let's see there's nothing in it we didn't know already said Chuck Grassley\nAnd and these reports are essentially just these are the things\nThan any of those grandchildren are very long story about steamboat\n[laughter] sorry shot [laughter] I knew there was an ... somewhere around there it took me to get there you are saying\nUh so these reports that are that are in there there there are certainly these are the the verbatim testimonies of that they gave us under oath denied any sort of and he said he seemed to look around a lot and it was a little shift you know we're right which I think is interesting but yeah apparently they don't do that ...\nMichael if I might play a bit of audio I don't know what you're staring at their on your screen I'm\nGuessing it's porn while I Would like to I Would like to bring us\n[laughter] if I might\nThe last thing I'll point out the next person that refers to an FBI reporters being worth\nAnything obviously doesn't understand anything\nThat vi explicitly does not\nIn this or any other case reach a conclusion\nPeriod period\nSo judge is no reason why you should know this the reason why we cannot rely and the FBI report you wouldn't like it if we\nDid because it is in con close as they say he shed she said and they said period\nSo when people waving FBI report before you understand they\nDo not they do not they do not\nReach conclusions that\nI Would vote for that man if it were Nineteen Ninety six [laughter] so as Joe Biden said there so the FBI\nReport has got name I'm On a new judge Kavanaugh in Nineteen eighty two and then the court for them right\nOr they might have something like ... and if there were FBI agents listening and I know there are actually um I also think they might say we were unable to corroborate\nThis a statement or ... the subject said that Joe Jones\nA was also there we contacted Mr Jones and he was unable to corroborate that or said he had no memory of being there it made it will probably have that sort of information\nAnd so is that is why these things kind of turkey so much weight since they don't come to conclusion visit because there is such a bigger penalty to lying to a FBI agent as opposed to be our intestine\nMinds no that was the argument that Democrats were making last week was uh when the hearings were going on and wherever there in front of a microphone they were saying that\nThey live in a sworn testimony that they supplied to senators that's a pretty good quip went to the same penalty this line to an FBI agent you can be prosecuted for it okay I'm a I mean I Would have to look at the statute I assume it's similar punishment but um ... what was I going to say\nIs a line ... ... oh a and they don't actually carry that much weight Shaun the reports themselves just because they ... if if if I were nuts\nAnd said you know Sean Thomas see a here and tell you what he uh\nHe does a lot of dog fighting I mean he's run a dog fighting ring for Fifteen Years\nNumber dog he's killed\nAnd then they go to you and you say what the hell are you talking about I Love dogs I Would never be engaged the dog fighting and they took they talk to everybody you've ever known and everybody you've ever known said there's no way he would do that my words would still be in the FBI report quote\nSean rent a dog fighting ring you killed so many dogs and anybody could publish that because if it's late because it's in the report so that's an incredibly dangerous thing\nSo they make you read it and then determine when we got forty other people who say they got nothing oh right yeah exactly so my determination is he doesn't run dog fighting ring correct each individual ancient senator\nMine's getting requiring on the reading comprehension top branch no sometimes octogenarian\nI'd like to know how many of them actually read it that'd be an interesting one but they won't tell us that but\nLet me tell you about the birds is on the Lusitania [noise]\nGo dribbling you might imagine [laughter]\nA stage of the [laughter] the ...\nOf the worst sort oh hey this is good news I think I think it's good news yes goodness I've decided it's good [laughter]\nI generally speaking I yeah I I\nI don't have a great deal of interest in when great books are made into movies there are ... uh he sure don't there are absolutely exceptions to that you know general\nThought but a hillbilly elegy did absolutely brilliant ... Vance about his people poor white Appalachian types um blow for some white [laughter]\nSo whether it's still an athlete you're having a migrated to in his case of Ohio I'm absolutely brilliant book I'm a you know just read it just read it I can describe it to you at greater length but it's one of the great books ever written about the way people really are\nUm ... anyway it's being made the rumors rather a ... ... well substantiate rumors B it's being made a into a movie with Ron Howard at the helm but that's a good sign as he was just spotted in Middletown, Ohio that's a good sign opium self was there ... around\nUm\nAnd uh I Hope they stick to the book\nAnd it's not like based on hillbilly elegy and it's kind of similar but there's a little extra love story a mayor or hero that wasn't there or something\nYeah interestingly JD Vance who's one of my favorite people and and we're trying to track him down to the broadcast right\nYeah um he told the news he was approached as far back as six months ago with several directors looking to make hillbilly elegy into a movie\nI'm a pretty private person felt uncomfortable about it he said it was hard enough for me to write the book where the movie is a much bigger stage it's a much murdered larger invasion of privacy I can see that you also have issues over relinquishing control over was very personal story\nYou write a book you have complete control over and over what goes into it how you present your family and then a movie is really someone else's project you're sort of necessarily trusting a complete stranger to tell a story you think needs to be told after denying a few relatively famous filmmakers van city shifted\nGears and agree to talk to them that included Ron Howard [noise]\nRon was just this incredibly kind and thoughtful guy\nYeah I Would take Ron I put it in runs hands more than practically anybody\nThere's more to that quote we'll get to it in a few minutes movie trades for that [laughter] that's coming up and you know sit empty chair ...
