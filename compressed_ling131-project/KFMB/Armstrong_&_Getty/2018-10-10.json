warning which to my surprise appeared in the u._s._a. today\nUm at least on line it's written by a a\nA woman by the name of Kelsey ... who's an opinion contributor and I'm going to read most of it for you\nUm for a couple of reasons number one I thought it took tremendous courage to write it\nAnd I don't want anybody to think I'm just sharing it with you because if it happens to fit in my world view because it's a it's just it's very good\nWrites a belief or based on feeling the doctor Christine Blasey Ford's testimony would have won me over I was unable to stop the piers is for described the days following the alleged assault by stating she'd convinced herself but because she wasn't rape she should just move on and just pretend it didn't happen that's quote\nWhether or not she's telling the truth about these allegations the feelings that she identified are very real for survivors of sexual assault I noticed because I Am one\nUm and then she describes a link that she was at a party as a sixteen year old and there was an adult male who used to hang around the party supplying alcohol\nAnd that she woke up to being raped or sexually\nSexually molested in some way and then he continued even as she was awake\nUm\nUnfortunately I just ... she did not report it\nI'm a ultimately are justified it the way for describe just move on and just pretend that didn't happen and I look back at this time in my life with such empathy for that teenage girl I used to be\nAnd if I'm honest with regret I Wish I had come forward to seek justice I Wish that this man who assaulted me while I slept and continued to salt me long after I had awakened would've faced consequences of some kind of often shoulder guilt for my silence wondering how many other girls he might have abused after me\nThen she describes the reasons people have for not reporting sexual assault fear of a broken system social\nStigma not wanting to relive the trauma of painfully public way I'm In my mind that balance these fears with the knowledge that each passing day my story became less credible is any evidence would have that would have existed would soon disappear [noise] it is also difficult to make these judgments when you're in shock and your mind is still reeling I get it\nBut even though I regret not coming forward I Am thankful that I cannot today walk into a courtroom named my attacker and condemn a man for life because of what happened fourteen years ago\nI said this not because it wouldn't be justified and not because he didn't deserve it but because I Would not have a single shred of evidence to support my story I'm a sexual assault survivor and I don't want you to just take my word for it\nAnd there is nothing more terrifying than living in a world where unsubstantiated allegations are accepted as truth just ask someone in North Korea\nThere must be a standard otherwise known as safe from having a life destroyed by wayward accusation due process is not an obstruction of justice it is a foundation of the American rule of law and was meant to be a barrier to hasty judgment and conviction by public opinion\nUh she goes on than in that mode and in some detail you know I can hit you with more of it but I thought that was a gutsy thing to say and it also it represents the point of view that many many women who listen to the show have sent us but guys are\nReally

New York on heroin needles the pile of excrement between parked cars the yellow soup losing out of it you better hope it's soup yellow soup losing out of a large plastic bag by the curb ... fold Persian carpet dumped on the corner\nIt's a scene of ... that might bring to mind any variety of developing world squalor oh good one but this is the San Francisco the capital of the nation's technology industry were single span of ... street hosted an open air narcotics market by day and night is occupied by the un sheltered in drug adult slumped on the sidewalk\nThere are many other strict like it you know it's going to say one measure is the dirtiest block in the city I was gonna say you could pick a lotta streets that looked like that but so that they they nailed down any ... particular dirtiest block if I'm going to have to check that out three hundred black eyes street and get a just a Fifteen minute walk away or the offices of Twitter and Hoover\nI'm ... that's something really when you think about it yeah this dichotomy of street crime and world changing technology of luxury condominiums and grinding persist in homelessness and the dehumanizing effects for those forced to live on the streets that's one way to put it well\nOn I Hope at some point in his aren't going to point out and San Francisco in particular along with California gives out more stuff that's why one out of three or what ever homeless people in the old country\nYou're what ever homeless people in the whole country in California right let me finish this paragraph because you're going to like you know lack act like it's because Twitter's there that the homeless people showing up\nThe dehumanizing effect for those forced to live on the streets provoke outrage among the city's residents for many who live here it's difficult to reconcile San Francisco's liberal politics with the misery that sounds them surrounds them I mean is that difficult to reconcile or why don't you try for a minute why don't you think about it for a while we get the most\nUm but they are mentioned back to some of these statistics which will shock you the city has replaced more than three hundred lamp posts corroded by human and dog urine over the last three years\nAnd save is more than two feet up it's human according to San Francisco public utilities commission man how much\nDo you have to urinate on a lamppost before to degrade quite a bit I'm guessing\nCurrently conducting a non official or sanctioned study at a lamppost by one of my uh favorite spots I'll let you know no progress yeah\nKeep us I'm not big on hold and strong became more urgent after one collapsed crushing your car and I remember that team remember that how about the thousands of heroin needles discarded by users and we're talking this house in the public works department in a nonprofit organization and the tenderloin picked up a hundred thousand needles from the streets over the last year\nThat's just them the public health department which has its own needle recovery program\nA retreat one hundred and sixty four thousand needles in August alone that's incredible both through disposal program and through St clean up's that's incredible\nHundred and sixty four thousand in a month that's one organization\nNumber of people they met on a high streak distinguish between the residents of the tender line many of them immigrant families and those they called strict people\nOn shelter drug users are congregating capital on sidewalks and the dealers pedal crack cocaine heroin or variety of amphetamines disputes among street people a street population of common sometimes result in violence at night bodies lined the sidewalks I don't think they mean bodies bodies but\nA flight the land of the living dead set a resident who they talked to for a while and thinks that the city is just allowing it to go crazy and the tender line so it doesn't go elsewhere\nYeah that's the that's the Vancouver model I remember when I went to Vancouver years ago and I read about\nTheir area of town where they I think they they hand out needles there and all that sort of stuff and they tried to keep a contained and I went over to that area than 'cause there was actually a\nCool music club over there but it was just disgusting the rest of Vancouver was just glittering beautiful ... one neighborhood was disgusting I'd never seen anything like that Twenty years ago now you can see it in San Francisco right I've never seen anything like that in the United states and interesting strategy yeah it is\nWhat will make one area's just ... you wouldn't want to do their right to make the other part of the city cleaner Nunberg\nSan Francisco you as yet hasn't figured out the and the rest of the city's cleaner part\nSo they uh they're halfway there are so many many thousands of arrest\nSome form or a mayor of San Francisco and leading candidate for governor next month's election God help us back to the editorial opinion I'd like to apologize for injecting it\nHe told the San Francisco chair on a gold or the editorial board last week that the city had reached a point of enough is enough and I'm quoting you can be to permissive and I happen to think we've crossed that threshold in this state and not just in this city you see it as just disgraceful I'm\nBut I'm Glad to hear him say that it's a fault for one thing it's a true and I think politically expedient because\nAs I talked about many times even left leaning cities have said All right that's it yeah oh yeah you know I Wish like leaning what would I meet dominated by the most utopian of people have said that's enough right\nWish Gavin would run his Gavin\nOn what he actually believes of course that would be a hell of a thing for a politician to do and I realize this is a new yacht and naive and utopian thing to ask but because he's we know I'm a little bit and he's he's a practical guy but he understands politics young understands how to get the union money and the rest of it so he's advocating some things that are just on completely out of work\nWhen when he runs for president which I think he's going to do and he's trying to appeal for a broader swath of America it'll be interesting to see a moderate\nWe need to talk to me or London Breed who has done some really interesting things that you know there's plenty will disagree about but she's a a an energetic and um and and I think she's a serious woman about or get\nOn she has some announced plans to provide initial thousand beds for homeless over the next two years which will probably just draw another thousand homeless people from elsewhere absolutely I'm a including you know elsewhere in northern California and but I was also this is really into oh go ahead I wouldn't\nBe in favor of spending this kind of money on the problem even if you had borders for cities um\nUm but if you don't have borders forget ... what's what do you what are you trying to do right right [noise]\nIt's like your town passing a green emissions laws you know it's a waste of time just you know ... but she's targeting a relatively small group of people living on the streets who she says are beyond the point of assisting themselves\nThis concept the concept of this involuntary remover was known as conservators ship law recently passed in Sacramento strengthens the city's powers of conservative ship with a judge's permission she says the mayor\nThere about a hundred to a hundred and fifty people who are clearly mentally ill and who are circling cycling through the system and need to be forced into conservative ... your ship we know all of them\nAnd according to the mayor's office twelve percent of people who use the services of the department of public health account for Seventy three percent of the costs wow yeah how about that and well percent soak up Seventy three percent of the cost majority of these heavy users have medical psychiatric and substance abuse issues according to the department got in that I always say\nHow do you help those people\nAny that easy to get a drug addict to stop being a drug addict or it's really

Washington Post is an enormously powerful and influential in widely read newspaper as is the New York times\nAnd um it reminds me of the old joke the Washington Post is read by people who think they run the world the\nWall Street Journal's read by the people actually run the world New York times I Can't remember but um those two newspapers compares or I'm I'm Sorry they ah they control so much of

grade us history for many years I used to give students have tested the beginning year to see what knowledge he already had the person students knew the most about by far was Martin Luther king\nOther than Washington and Lincoln the vast majority of students do nothing about us presidents the striking thing was how much they knew about king versus Washington and Lincoln almost any student could write me a ... page or about to Dr King is early life describes protest those are persecuted him\nI'll bet more of them could identify Bull Connor or George Wallace than say Teddy Roosevelt or Thomas Jefferson\nTheir knowledge of Lincoln or Washington was far more rudimentary after a few years I did some digging and discovered that in our feed her elementary students learned about ... in every single grade\nSpending a week two a month on the civil rights here every year there's continued in my middle school sixth grade classroom even though their curriculum was supposed to be ancient world

equal time for some time I\nI grew up in an era where they hammered the founding every year of my life and the disappointed me greatly that I never got to learn about World War two for instance yeah the Vietnam War um\nBut you know the founding of your country is a pretty big deal and the fact that now we do with Cesar Chavez in terms of world history give me a free can break yeah\nYeah it's amazing you know I I Know a fair amount about demanding his work and it's really compelling it's really interesting stuff but the founding of the nation the ideals upon which was was founded in the
