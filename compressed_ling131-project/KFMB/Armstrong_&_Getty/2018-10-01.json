my mind something that was said soon after July night\nAfter the Lusitania sank I'm Sorry that no not fair that suffer he's making a point\n... said that tells me about a political strategy that has carried on here the way it has to lay and delay and the way and the way because he said\nI'm going to fight judge Kavanaugh nomination with everything\nIt it seems like that has happened over the last Ninety Days senator [noise]\nThank you Mr Chairman [noise]\nWe're living in a divided time [noise] this\nCountry is divided right down the middle [noise]\nThere is an enormous amount of anger\nThere's rage\nThere's hatred [noise]\nWe see demonstrators screaming at each other [noise]\nWorth watching that race reflecting that anger [noise] I don't know they're a great many Americans [noise]\nWish we could and believe we can\nGet back to an environment where we treat each other with civility indecent [noise]\nGetting back to an environment where yes we have policy disagreements we disagree on what the right legislation has to pass and we even have vigorous debates about what the right policy is\nBut we just out of context that respects each other\nThat doesn't demean the humanity of each other [noise]\nThe character and drag people through the ... [noise]\nThe politics of personal destruction\nBut we have seen on display in recent days [noise]\nIs Washington DC it it's very ugliest [noise]\nAnd all of us should remember that we're talking about

through the mud\nWas a hurtful thing to do the wrong thing to do [noise]\nPay to has been dragged through the mud for the last two weeks in a way that has no precedent [noise]\nPolarized society we live in today it's almost ...\nWhere you go there you go to the tribal eyes thing the thing I was talking about earlier I I I think that something has changed that we went from being a tribe of Americans we're on the same tribe of Americans\nAnd had differences and you could argue pretty good about it but in ultimately are tried was America yeah to that is going away in our tribe is our parties or ideology or whatever it is ... and so we fully\nFull on believe the other side of the enemy yes and I don't know it's a subtle thing to try to view or understand I don't know how you get back but I Do think that's where we are do think there is something different I Wish I could go back in time machine to the sixties and and you know take it in through grownup eyes or whatever you know what I just I just feel like\nI Can't believe that we've always believed that the other side was just this morally repugnant yeah we do know how\nIt goes in cycles I think it's it's probably the inevitable and of many years of peace and prosperity\nAre we just want to separate into private tribes and if there's some cataclysm or or war some major change to the the world the landscape we will come together again and then sooner or later we will devolve into tribes get everybody's got an ethical everybody says that including huh\nThe world the landscape we've all come together again and then sooner or later we will devolve into tribes again everybody's got an epidural\nEverybody says that including us so the cure for this problem is something so horrific either economically or militarily that we come together which isn't exactly you know ... to live through either know\nYou'll probably have to be really awful and for a sustained period like a World War two or the great depression or something like that yeah yeah to become Americans first and then we disagree over policy as well and\nI Would also argue kind of in a you know a contrary to my previously state opinion it could be that the tools of disseminating\nUm hatred misinformation announced so effective and easily used that um it's going to make it harder to come together those who profit on division are very very good at their jobs I Would say look to the to the here and look to Washington DC so I Wonder\nThe problem with that is so you believe as one of the senators were not yesterday to fuel I bought anything yet throughout all the testimony that they do in court so they are going let's say if he was lying about you know it'd be lying about what the definition during as your book which I don't know how we would now but if he was lying about that then he's like about everything that's the argument\nSo back to the drinking Barnett 'cause I Want to get this one because I thought this was quite the exchange of the day and it and uh after the break Mr Kevin actually came back and apologized this was with a one of the senators questioning him on his drinking\nSo most people have done some drinking in high school and college um and many people even struggle with alcoholism and binge drinking\nOn my own dad struggled with alcoholism of his life and I had gotten in trouble for it and there were consequences I still in a an age Ninety and he's sober and in his words he was pursued bankrupt and that's how he got through this [laughter]\nSo in your case I you have said I'm here and now there are places that you never drank so much that you didn't remember what happened\nBut yet we have hurt not under oath but we have heard your college roommate say that you didn't drink frequently these are in reporting this report that you would sometimes be belligerent um another classmate said it's not credible for you to say you didn't have memory lapses so drinking is one thing\nI don't I I actually don't think that's the second call it's correct on the first court if he wanted I provided some material that still redacted about the situation with the freshman year roommate and I don't really want to repeat that in a public hearing but just so you know\nThere were three people in a room\nJimmy Roach in may and it was a contentious situation where Jamie did not like Dave white I was at all and\nI mean this okay I thought I was a white came back from from the home one weekend and Jamie Kirchick moved all his furniture out into the\nOut into the courtyard okay and so he walks in and so that's your source on that so there are several drinking as one fan and there was much more work at the redacted port portion of what I said I don't want to repeal right in the public can't well can I just ask one more question acted information about\nOkay drinking is one thing but the concern is about truthfulness and in your written testimony you said sometimes you had too many tricks I was there ever a time when you drink so much that you couldn't remember what happened\nPart of what happened the night before\nI Know I remember what happened and I think you probably have beer center and and so\nYou're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before are part of what happened\nTo you're asking about yeah blackout I don't know have you [noise]\nCan you answer that question which I just couldn't do that that happened is that your answer yeah and I'm curious if you have I have no drinking nor do I okay thank you\nAnd so after the break and I would uh when I heard that I thought that I'm not sure that's the best way to handle that probably not helpful [laughter]\nThat's what I thought I mean you apparently thought so too when he came back after the break\nI Am ready and can I say one thing\nTo say I'm starting to my last call if we like saying to serve homework trial\nMuch I respect her and respected what she did the last year and she has to be a question at the end that I responded by asking her question I didn't sorry I did that this is tough process I'm Sorry about that ...\nThat I Would like so fair enough that's the way we have some\nSo you're getting into the EU there's three of us living in a room\nSome\nMan so you're getting into the you'd there's three of us living in a room ... two of you apparently got into a beef I'm guessing over a girl in some fashion that the ... or or just roommate bicker and I mean to be anything but anyway well one of them was gone the other one ... stuff\nOut into the parking lot time honored [laughter] so\nI Would like to read the redacted part is probably very interesting yeah you flip with his girlfriend or something like that you think that I Can't imagine though trying to lay that out in a in a in in the bright lights would senators asking me questions from that many years ago it just seems so weird yes\nYes yeah yeah I remember the first time\nA friend made a specific reference to not being able to remember what had happened the night before and I thought that was one of the most extraordinary things I'd ever heard it shocked me at that really yeah you get your way my language that you get used yeah I just I couldn't conceive that um\n[noise] and I know other people who who don't have to drink very much and it's all a blur a complete blur right um it's just different people's brains work the different a different way I I also remember it was gosh how long ago that\nUh probably in my late thirties\nAnd uh and got got too\nDrunk and um and that happened to me for the first time and it absolutely terrified me\nAnd probably should yeah and I I made a rather significant life change or the next day which has stuck with me to this day switch from wind a white one of those people didn't know they got to make sure I got a fulfilling next on a so but yeah the idea that\nYou know somebody saying yeah I saw him drunk a couple of times ... pretty drunk and cuts so the idea that he he never forgot what he did is just not credible\nIs I'm Sorry you do not have nearly\nAnything close to proof it's not a compelling argument different people's brains were different ways\nSo it's coming up your news large shovel well we've got Ted Cruz and the ... of American politics it turns out to be

a here's ... under the correspondence proper\nUh let's see uh it was so awesome\nRight to actually see that Matt Damon the rest of Hollywood is found the courage and voice to speak out against the sexual assault that may or may not have occurred thirty six years ago and was allegedly committed by high school boy or was this courage this anger this outrage as they looked away while the Harvey Weinstein Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose of the world consistently and ... the medically\nAbused women what a joke and\nI Am a writer leading libertarian who cannot stand the Trump is a man and would never vote for them but you better believe I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure these complete hypocrites uh never have control\nWhere the leaders of the leaders are leading the hypocrisy and let's see what else do\nWe have you seen a sixty minutes last night I did not I would have thought that wedding it was a season premier and um they went with Jeff Flake and his decision in the in those those girls that stopped them in the elevator that the difference that sitting in for his own son at that definitely what made the difference was was ... girls in the elevator\nSaying I was right do you believe me to do with the other case I I don't get the logic of that but a lot of people that really powerful wow I'm astounded but I Know\nWhat went on about a more later but yeah that's it argues unfamiliar with the concept Jeff for what ah let's see and none of us wants to thank us for our even handed coverage of the capital of disaster\nBoy you're you're the one everybody else hatred for being too far this way or that way\nWell simultaneously\nYeah I Wish more people in media would follow your example then she makes the point a number of people have made\nOkay here we go am I the only woman who's experienced the same type of thing that Dr Ford has in more than a couple of times in two didn't think it was a big deal oh no I'm hearing the Rush Limbaugh liner in my head now in addition to the rest of the crap we saw the other day I really just don't understand what all the horrible trauma is about it's on welcome but come on\nYou know it's one of those things um you know like a ... somebody ... being groped and the whole you know hand over the mouth allegation then the rest of it I thought I was going to be murdered and raped and the rest of it\nI mean if you're terrified you're terrified but I think it it it you know it's the eye of the beholder isn't it 'cause I've talked to plenty of women in real life who said\nYou know so you got groped and you push your hand over their head away and left the room it happened to me six times it doesn't matter I'm fine\nBut you know I was listening to old that Dr Ford is is she is a quirky character\nNo doubt and if she is like extremely humid and fearful and something like that happened to her I guess I could see where it freaked her out\nUm what what do I know there's a nice note from John I'm a proud member of The Elders be deep the community the long bed diesel truck community also wants you to let the let you know that short beds matter to a K I think that some sort of play on political

don't know you just had in your mind for some reason this number is not where you wanted to be well\nI think for instance when somebody is thirty seven they can't claim to be in their early thirties anymore I remember having that yeah yeah exactly\nYeah I remember when I turned twenty five and I thought I'm closer to thirty twenty oh my God [laughter]\nYou'll band yeah which seems ridiculous ... of course but uh yeah so anyway ... birthday today and um\nWe kind of did the birthday over the weekend just because it's not a school day in a work day and one more time to uh to enjoy it I bought a side by side I didn't even know what they were called until recently a gator John Deere gator she's been on one of those for a long time and you're getting\nCloser to telling me something I can understand that a vehicle\nYeah their vehicles they're like little a little little tiny dump trucks drive around\nNow yeah I can get your one of the ... ... ... expensive if you get the loaded new ones which I bought an unloaded really old one [laughter] but that's because that's where I Am but this is somebody told me that this is why\nMotorcycle sales are down for Harley and all your big things like that is guys in that crowd have moved on to side by side and that's what they do on the weekend the head up into the hills in their in their ... that are like thirty thousand dollars right\nAnd they and they do that sort of thing but anyway my kids were driving around in really enjoying it unless that's illegal in which case they weren't driving around and I'm\nJust saying this for fun um anything goes on private property ... certainly freaking should yeah but I'm a member of that but so they want their thing was they were going to make mama birthday cake and they were going to have a cake baking contest and make her a cake\nAnd I didn't pay a lot of attention to what they were doing we went to the store and bought all the supplies and it was a it was an absentee father on this little project a and they and they were putting all this stuff into their cakes like candy bars and\nFire bottles of sprinkles oh my God my fifth obscene strands of licorice whips gummy bears and you're causing diabetes to the radio audience and then when you bake that at all just kind of melted together and\nI like an hour to bake and he's still just to ... to mess with the way of getting that can be held a candy bar was fine he kind of ... but it was it was the bags that gummy bears labs [laughter]\nAt least it was all edible stuff they have made cakes in the past that includes wind acts and buy food so they're they're improving shows on cable diner food huh no dog food animal things as far as I Know but I'm so they they they both finished their cake and they were so excited\nAbout it in a way that little kids get I mean just thrilled with the idea of a mom and dad eating the cake and judging who won the contest\nAnd we were both dreading having to pretend to eat these thing after the dinner and we we really we wanted to do the you know look over there and not even take a bite but they were doing they were too intently watching and we each tried to choke down a bite of them and I mean man one was just horrific\nOne of the worst thing I've ever had in my mouth and I've had I've had cow crap in my mouth [laughter] this is one of the worst things I've ever tasted that was back in your I'll eat anything for ten dollars [laughter] and uh and so we both Chuck choked down like a small\nBite of each and then Laura gave a warning the smiley face one of them

question free in front of God to answer honestly\nThat Mary liked to drink [laughter] are we talking foreign or domestic [noise]\nI drink American beer you get\nI'm from Saturday Night live we probably should ... should play a little ... are talking about SNL he worries ... for his song there toward the end he was bullied bullied backstage and uh he had a rant about Trump I guess but that didn't make it on to the air so I'm not sure how\nSignificant that it'd be a hundred people in the audience and the cast thought so and it didn't stream I think it's streamed on line\nThe videos I you know there are a cell phone videos of people in our homes\nYeah so a good weekend had anything the least bit pro even open discussion it's got to be one sided so the whole Brett Kavanaugh beer\nThing this is one view of the New York times Frank Bruni who's ... who's one of your\nOpinion columnist the Supreme Court nominee paired up from the beverage with identity politics with the idea that\nBeer was his beard and he was bald with it he was telling the button course grown and Heineken burgers of male American middle America that yes the coastal shark named types in piano nor liberals were coming from them and we're not found the fond of such hallowed traditions tailgate parties fraternities and drinking games it was a dog whistle the middle America\nAbove to beer and were beer people and I'm a beer person so used to support me which I\nDon't ... I don't think was on his mind at any point I think one of his arms around or does he likes to drink beer beer drinking guy and drink a lot of it and so was that Frank Bruni needs to be analyzed yeah even mentions at some point probably came up with the strategy with Trump to appeal to the Trump voter by mentioning beer so much\nNow are so here's the latest poll numbers for some of the numbers and then I'll mention a a great column I read in the\nWeekly Standard which I Can't dig up off to figure out who wrote it because he made a good point uh I think I tweeted it actually vote to confirm vote against too soon to say no to ... from\nThirty five percent vote against thirty seven percent that would be a tie the margin of error is less than the two percent divide so that's a tie or more you know and then too soon to say is twenty eight percent which is about where America is I think on this sort of thing\nYou got a third that clearly he's a good guy a third was gonna say clearly he's a rapist and then a third that are going to say well I I don't\nKnow yeah yeah well and listen to it serves my side of the argument and I get that but given the way most people get their information by uh you know the mainstream media and or the big tech companies and it's funny or do we mean\nWhen we see the say the mainstream media do we mean Yahoo and Google and Yahoo I never had a\nBig sites I'd never paid attention to Yahoo News for whatever reason and I started reading their uh their headlines for the day every day\nOr so left oh yeah wow it's not that there are ... their way beyond

I was on his land entire career on a bed gum Yahoo\nRight right coach it's a good point um so anyway but my point is that you've got to grant me this that your polling the average folks who you know maybe news junkies maybe not but\nSurely their opinions have been formed a to a large extent by what they've taken in in the media sure and I have read has been wildly on\nSurely their opinions have been formed a to a large extent by what they've taken in in the media sure outrage within wildly on\nBalance of course it would be I like to six takeaways from the Ford Kavanaugh hearings from the

D. Vance author hillbilly elegy as well for melting pot or civil war a son of immigrants makes the case against open borders\n... Lama joins is the author of melting pot or civil war a son of immigrants makes the case against open borders right on welcome to the program\nThanks for having me\nAnd you're getting a lot of attention for this book I'm Glad because this is a topic we cover a lot what\n... what made you write the book\n[noise] honestly I just became so alarmed by\nThe rank tourists ness of our political discourse and how much it seemed as though people were talking past each other when they talk about immigration you have this tremendous self righteousness on one side\nAnd on the other side you have people who seem as though they're demonizing immigrants and immigration and I just couldn't recognize myself in that conversation so I wanted to add some common sense\nYou know it's funny I've been thinking about political science a lot ... that was my you know feel at school and my youngest is taking all those classes and\nYou know you take political theory classes and they're all about you know the different political systems I'd love to have a political theory class it's all about how to whip up mobs and how to get them on whipped up because it seems like the the center of the conversation is just shouting at each other\n[noise] there is a lot of truth to that\nAre whipping up fear and anger is a great strategy a politically in the short term it's a very dangerous strategy if you want a free society and I guess my view is that when it comes to immigration you need some kind of balanced sensible middle ground position\nThat is going to allow us to go forward in a world that's changing because of automation and globalization and much else\nThat's why I Believe we need controlled managed immigration that in the national interest\nWell it hasn't been controlled or managed for quite a few decades and is that how we ended up in a situation where you you press one for Spanish and people are worried waving Mexican flag that the u._s. sporting events\n[laughter] yeah I mean unfortunately I Do think that\nPeople are assimilating but they're assimilating into very different ways there are some people who are assimilating into the mainstream but there are other people who are assimilating into marginalized\nSegregated communities where they're cut off from the mainstream and that builds a lot of resentment and I think that that's going to become a bigger problem in the future even that it is a precedent and it's already a problem\nBut why do you think it's happening like that\nWell the big picture is that\nThe whole global economy the world is very different now that it was one hundred years ago one hundred years ago you had a large amount of immigration but you had a large amount of immigration into a society\nThat did not have a welfare state number one certainly not all the scale of what we have today but also it was a society where there was a premium on ... on that is people could do back\nBreaking labor and then somehow\nClimbed their way into the middle class that's much harder now because you know again we have machines we have off shoring we have all of these other alternatives to that kind of labor and what that means is that low skill labor is just any much tougher position in America today than it was the case a century ago\n... found on the idea of the welfare state and how that plays a role in this 'cause it's always seem to me that this would be self limiting if we didn't have the welfare state you wouldn't you wouldn't show up to a country where you are not going to uh you know be able to feed yourself get medical care if you can find a job\nOh limiting if we didn't have the welfare state you wouldn't you wouldn't show up to a country where you are not going to uh you know be able to feed yourself get medical care if you couldn't find a job\n[noise] it really is true a hundred years ago when you look at that big wave of immigration that came to United States\nA huge number of those folks actually went back to their native countries and the reason they went back well there are lots of reasons but one reason is that\nHey if you found that it was a real struggle to support yourself and to support your loved ones you might have decided to pack it up and go back home now in contrast we have a very different perspective we say okay we want to lift every one up we want to invest in people's kids if they don't earn enough for themselves\nWe provide them with food stamps and Medicaid as you alluded to and much else and those programs they're not free they're not cheap we subsidize people's wages with the earned income tax\nCredit and and you know the refundable portion of the child credit because we're saying hey you're not able to earn enough to lead a decent life so the government is going to step in and under those conditions immigration is a very different story\nThe debt joke Corning grown worthy but also one of the simplest ways to share a moment when you're you\nHave to care for one thing and [noise]\n\nAnd kids that spend more time with their dad grow up to be smarter more successful\nIn getting in trouble with\nAny luck funnier adults wide scale down because he had any body to go away dad jokes [noise]\nTo take a moment to make them on it\nIt's as easy as going to fatherhood dad goes rocky by the U.S department of health and Human Services and the ... or any\nNot

vote no your legitimate I Love to bake the whole thing I have seen in my time in college in Seventy sixty talk\nThe Armstrong in Getty show\nEveryone's you on a boat lands gets a lot of attention melting pot or civil war is one of those books\nThe son of immigrants makes the case you open borders Brian ... is the author and we'd been\nThis ah talking with them and it's interesting stuff indeed yeah thanks for hanging around we appreciate it\nIt's great to be here so listen it's difficult to\nCounter an irrational argument with a rational one but you know those of us in and we have a very moderate to my mind reasonable view of immigration but we've been called racist ... many times how do you suggest folks in the audience or we respond when somebody says oh you're just a racist\n[laughter] honestly it's really hard to know what you do it depends on your relationship with that person if that someone who is close to you\nOr you know you've got to try to repair the relationship you know there there might be other things going on [laughter] ah but if it's someone that you don't know if someone you know you just have to basically that person's telling you I'm not listening to you or that person is telling you that they don't\nThere you know people out there who have hateful sentiments and what have you but I think that the vast majority of people who are fired up about this issue really care about whether or not we have a system that's working for all Americans particularly a working class Americans\nWell don't you anytime you mentioned Donald Trump people immediately go into their camps and it gets complicated but three of his attendance for immigration poll very very well like in the ... percentile with the we're the Republicans and Democrats approving of\nEnding chain migration she carrying the borders and making a merit based as in you you you know we we decide what sort of person we want and let them in a why can't we make that happen\nOr if most people agree on those three things\nWell one of the issues is that you could pretty much get a poll that's given you any answer you want right to their people on the left who have other poll results that give you a different answer but fundamentally\nWhat you described I Do believe is a very broadly popular with the American public and I do think we could get there\nThe barrier is that there are a lot of people who feel like they can make political hay out of preventing some kind of reasonable agreement and that's what we're looking at now he demonized your opponents then it becomes really easy to make it seem like they're totally reasonable broadly popular proposals are somehow crazy\nAnd I think we're seeing a lot of that right now\nAs we often point out on on the Armstrong you get your show many politicians would rather have an issue than solving issue\nYes and I think that when you're talking about chain migration in particular I Do believe that there's a better way to talk about this and it's simply saying this remember when I mentioned before about how how many\nImmigrants to the country now are older they're over the age of fifty you know one thing you could just simply say and you saw this and one of the reason the Republican legislative proposals is is you can bring\nYour elderly parent into the country if you make sure that you purchase health insurance for your elderly parent so that the government doesn't have to pick up the tab so the taxpayers don't have to pick up the tab that\nIs a very reasonable proposal you can say this across the board there all kinds of areas where you have a common sense proposals\nThere are over four million people who are waiting for green cards\nBecause they have relatives in the United states and you know we don't have any priority for them we don't say if you speak English if you have a job offer if they're going to be able to support yourself then we'll move you to the front of the line we don't do anything like that that seems so simple and straightforward instead we just argue about these\nThings that are just totally they have nothing to do with what are the actual facts on the ground\nWell I've always hated the phrase doing near the jobs Americans won't do now with unemployment as low as it is now you might be able to actually make the argument but people were making that argument he wouldn't unemployment was quite a bit higher than American shouldn't go do these jobs we should imported underclass that will more lawns and work in our kitchen that seems like a racist attitude\n[laughter] that is really dead on it's incredible because even now with a tight labor market there is a simple answer if there are folks who won't do the job you pay more\nYou offer higher wages and then if you find okay well that's tough we can't pay all of these folks higher wages you know we've run out of people who are willing to do it or desperate enough to do the job for that wage well then guess what that's\nHow you have that's why you have automation that's why you have innovation you know there was a time when we had horses are dragging everything right we didn't have trucks we didn't have automobiles doing that you develop that innovation because later wound up being too expensive\nThat's where productivity gains come from [laughter]\nThat's what you make economic progress so I think that high wages are actually call me crazy I Believe they're a good thing because they actually spur innovation they spoke productivity improvement\nFan it's always struck me as bizarre that our friends on the left instead say no no no let's let's import a bunch of brown people and have them do the work for for wages are white people would never accept that the progressive a prescription\nWhen it's also not just brown people right at the people of all colors but the ideas that you're going to bring folks and and then you are simultaneously going to say that\nYou know these folks are in desperate need of the safety net they're in desperate need of Medicaid and snap and oh by the way we actually need these workers who buy your own logic or not being paid enough to support themselves\nIt kind of boggles the mind and I do think you're right\nThere is the danger of creating some kind of underclass that's locked out of the middle class and then you know that creates lots of problems down the road I Want a melting pot society in which Americans of all colors are United by their belief in the American dream are part of a large prosperous middle class\nBut that's not where open borders will get you open borders will in my opinion get you to a more divided society\nAnd we've got about a minute left the time was melting pot or civil war do you actually is that just a ... a jazz he tried to get attention do you think we could actually heading that direction if we continued on is that\nAnyone who has been paying attention to the news for the last few weeks sees the level of rancor and anger this feeling that were already in that kind of cold civil war in which Americans just feel like they they just can't live together\nAnd I'm afraid that the title I'm you know ... it's becoming more vivid by the day I agreed a melting pot we need a unifying story about this country\n... author a melting pot or civil war son of immigrants makes the case against open borders we can talk to you for a long time good stuff Brian thanks very much\nAnd thank you yeah it's our pleasure well done yeah I Am a man it's frustrating trying to just argue reasonable commonsense and get it you know these emotional slogans thrown back at you\nAnd this idea of a civil war I wouldn't have said this or we could go but after this last week of the way people

it was not far from the uh the heavily armed getting compound in the woods actually and um and it it was nice I mean the the bride and groom could not be better people are really fond of them I'm a listeners to the show by the way lots and lots of fags there at the wedding\nUm but the rounds of Armstrong and getting it correct yeah I'm a great families too I mean unionized so hit it off with a bunch of family members and friends and stuff it just\nIt was funny it was like wait these are my people these are people I like I'm comfortable with 'em and I felt that before I started drinking so was that um and I thought well how do you\nIs there some can there be some sort of website designed for like just meeting people you connect with the in the eye to eye with I guess that's what clubs in churches and stuff for for um\nUh but it was it was funny just to be a mix among a bunch of people we felt completely comfortable with almost immediately so that was cool\nI'm In and I like doing it I've done a couple two tree uh weddings and uh I have a a a lovely scurried that I uh you know change and improvise a little bit um about\nMarriage and and we're happy marriages and and that sort of thing because you know anybody who doesn't understand if the marriage not the wedding magical nice\nNice wedding and you're fine for that's all you're just going to make sure you get everything\nWill be very expensive you know expensive of course exactly ... location insurers so long happy marriage\nThe more ice sculptures at your wedding I'm so laundry or be married food is hugely important\nTo whether or not the wedding is going to be the marriage is going to be happy oh yeah yeah yeah you argue that the did you spend a lot of time on the eighth each other and what's\nMore important kill each of your mom's hate the other [laughter] that sticky you sir parking is it your your wedding you'll be divorced by the end of the night ah so anyway that was very nice and I I enjoy doing it but I don't want to do it a lot um because they are saying\nIs you will marry anyone and so they should tax to support when oil or nine five gay over my or my or there will wear them\nLet me finish my thought Jack and and this may be self limited because I have an idea so I don't want to do it all the time 'cause it's it's time consuming and I get nervous because it's such an important day for the bride and groom especially but the families and everything and\n[noise] the Armstrong show\n\nScott press conference going there and the rose garden or whatever that is outside\nThe White House by the way my Newton's wearing sunglasses little to cool man I Know you've got the hot young blonde wife and all that but he's like a zillionaire or something it was like oh yeah well most of them are like his pockets he's got no damage to give\nSome Trump sitting there and he's taking questions and everybody's trying to ask Kevin questions he said no I'm not answering questions and then I Want to talk about the trade deal which is a big deal\nThis is what he ran on this is what he's been talking about since he was thirty some years old this sort of stuff and Canada is our number one trading partner they yeah yes and this is what he cares about\n... and ah anyway so you want to do that one or a woman ask\nA question and tried to get a cabinet ...\nYou ever tried question ... ... if you'd like to someone else getting them to someone else give them a ET wouldn't let her ask a question um\nBecause he wanted to talk about the trade deal which I perfectly understand he said he would take some capital at the end well were there so now he's going to jump into the cabinet and stuff and I have no idea how this is going to go\nBut it was a factor absolutely and and the deal [noise] okay let's go come on you want to I guess get off trade I don't think people are falling asleep with trade as I get sick to me is the most exciting thing you can talk about that generally\n[laughter]\nGet it correct to\nSay that your limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into judge Kavanaugh but your own statement on friday made it very clear if that isn't that the Haitian not the limited and so which is that\nWhen I didn't hear anything about what I said is less a Senate decide whatever they want to do is okay with me and also the FBI I think the FBI should do what they have to do to get to the ... at the same time [noise] just so we all understand\nFishes or seventh\nOf a man\nWhat a change she's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma\nFor a man that never had any\nAccusation any statement about him he's led I mean I think he was number one in this class it yeah he was number one in this law school at Yale and then he's gone through over the last three weeks is incredible so\nNow is that true because there was a guy behind Trump I don't know who he is somebody involved with the trait thing the kind of had a look on his face it looked like he was shaking his head a little bit like saying that's not true\n[laughter] yeah it was on them\nAll along those lines\nDown\nEverything has to be always got to be the best ... exactly\nEvents investigation so it's not like that you know just starting [noise]\nI Want them to do a very comprehensive a\nInvestigation whatever\nThat means according to\nThe senators and the Republicans and a Republican majority I Want them to do that\nI Want to be comprehensive I actually think it's a good thing for judge Kevin ... I think it's actually a good thing not a bad thing I think it's a good thing that would that being said I'd like it to go quickly and the reason I like it to go quickly very simple so simple because it's unfair to him at this point\nWhat his wife is going through\nWhat his beautiful children are going or is it the wrong he's had described but\nWhat do you think it should be doing well yeah Mr President let me take over a listen we have empowered the FBI to do what they need to do but it is absolutely undeniable that the Democrats strategy is to delay this nomination as long as they can to get past the midterms\nThey are doing that by assassinating a good man's character I'm not going to reward that\nBy granting them an indefinite the way we've given the FBI plenty of time to do what they need to do but I Will not let the stretch on forever next question\nKind of feel like I Need to skip ahead 'cause I'm looking ahead like eight minutes Hansen or you are following this looks like there's some good stuff come up here a little bit yeah I Want I Want to fast forward ahead a little bit here the old on hold on I don't know if I can find it it just the right spot\nGoing to go back about a minute I write spot right there [laughter] check this out here we go go ahead Michael\nJordan I spent a good thing is now the press finally get said now they'll finally treat me fairly\nAnd worse now than\nBelow go but that's okay\nI used that word because of the fact that we made a deal with Mexico\n[laughter] really happening by\nTrump became over there you go\nDown thinking about going back to ... I'm going to be next year and I I didn't know I thought you'd like to go ahead\nI have two questions about judge Kavanaugh at first there are now concerned that he may have lighter myth characterized his drinking while testifying if they find that he did do you think that barred him from being here Supreme Court nominee\nWhile I watch I watched him I was surprised at how\nA book was about the fact that he likes beer\nAnd he's had\nA little bit of difficulty I mean he talked about things that happened when he drank I mean this this is not a man that said that alcohol was absurd that he was perfect with respect to alcohol though I thought he was actually going back so many years I thought he was a\nExcellence the interesting thing is nobody asked them about what's happened in the last twenty five thirty years during his professional career because I there are no bad reports I mean there are a bit reports\nMost of the people sitting down there ... except for my parents were [laughter]\nWe find one on him that um I think that's that's going to be ... will be the greatest shock of also report showing everybody\nI'm looking at people I'm sort of\nLook at some of these people asking the question okay\nPolitically Blumenthal he lied about Vietnam he didn't just say hey I went to Vietnam snow for Fifteen Years you said it was a war hero he fought in Da Nang profits we call them ... Richard Donna I'm not sure I'd done a\nLean too heavily on a Vietnam Era Mr President sir you're he'll start hurting\n[laughter] to Vietnam\nAnd he's up there saying we need honesty and we need integrity this guy lives when he was the attorney general's Connecticut and he lied I don't\nMean a little bit and then when he got out he actually dropped out of the race that he won anyway because Democrats are always went in Connecticut one very close probably the closest over but he's got ... and now he's up there talking like he's holier than thou you know what take a look at his record and when he got out\nAnd we apologize she was crying tears were all over the place and now he acts like how dare you take a look\nThe judge who has led an exemplary life [noise]\nI mean you go back to high school because he had beer I think the judge has been a\nPretty amazing about describing his situation with alcohol and with beer [noise] let me take a look at Cory Booker\nShe ran Newark New Jersey into the ground he was a horrible in there and he made statements that when he was in high school or college while he was doing he actually made the statement and now he's talking about judge Kavanaugh\nAnd I could go to a whole list of okay\nBoy he goes there does me from always goes there\nYet doesn't mind a bloody lip or a minister ring one boy now so I'm a little bit ago he did say that the FBI could do a thorough investigation and that seems pretty unequivocal the me other than the length of time\nRight which I suppose will still be criticized\nWell yeah of course and and I get legitimately so because you know that's a serious limitation on an investigation but I I completely understand why they have to do that\nI found it interesting that in response to the question of\nAir for judge Kavanaugh was or as a reporter was saying was lying about the periphery it on the periphery of what they are discussing that reason enough to not further him forward it just goes through say no everybody lives you know it's true but that's an interesting response to barbecue\nYou know I mean we're thing was pants censored and we never find anything about him oh ...
