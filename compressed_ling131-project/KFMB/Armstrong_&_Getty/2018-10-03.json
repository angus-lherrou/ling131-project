weeks ago\nHappen to learn about Brett Kavanaugh they come in one of the people\nThere was a short list it take to the Supreme Court\nOf ... I don't remember exactly what it was about six weeks ago and\nThen I became aware of Dr Ford and her description of what had happened to her at\nAlso had a capital involved and I started to think back to my days when I was in\nThe early eighties and like a recount in Maryland and\nThought that I might have some information that might corroborate some of the things that she has faded so you only thought about coming forward when you learned about Dr Ford\nBecause I did not know how close by catalog was to possibly becoming the next Supreme Court justice I just want to get the timeline right about this because he was nominated in July\n... for a doctor 'cause somebody for came forward in the Washington Post more recently in September with little September that you\nKnow it's it's it's been several weeks but I'm not somebody who follows the news not political at all\nOkay yeah that kind of fell apart there then she came forward before Dr Ford's allegations because of ... All right well that settles she came forward because of them before they exist\nAndrew ... according to the timeline Andrew anchor reporter for the Weekly Standard took him to sort of medicine has some thoughts on it and it was written for the Orange County register the American spectator daily signal and uh and others hello Andrew how are you\n...\n... what is the big takeaway from the interview Andrew\nOkay takeaway is that it was bizarre it didn't make sense we shouldn't I mean we we should not see this as a credible allegation in my in my opinion I think I think that um\nYou know I I end up you'll now because we've we've we've tried to keep it up as open in mind as possible these things you know I I think that a doctor bloody Ford had pretty credible testimony\nBefore the Supreme Court before the Judiciary Committee last week I think this allegation from Julie sweat it does not help her case but I think that she\nYou know I I I have a hard time escaping the conclusion that she's either lying or\nHe's either lying or there's something not right going on there because uh it it seems like what you guys were just saying I mean it just doesn't stand up under the slightest pressure because I mean this this NBC interview with not a hard hitting interview you know the interviewer was not trying to trick\nJulie sweating up at all and yet it seemed to every question she she you know somehow managed to cast doubt on her own story\nDid she have a creepy porn promoter ... by her son\nUh he was not he was up there with her during the interview but that's it's interesting you bring it out because he is as I Am I as I watched this thing unfold the thought they kept occurring to me was wow there you know I could almost to believe that this was this lady was like\nSort of false flag some sort of person who had been paid by Republicans to\nUh to to bring forward or dislike clearly not believable allegation against Brett Kavanaugh but we know that's not the case because this woman is being represented by this guy who is you know really trying to use this this allegation in order to springboard his own a democratic presidential run in twenty twenty\nSo we wondered about an hour you know we wondered about that last week that where it might not end up helping Kavanaugh and the Republican side in that some people who are kind of barely paying attention will just kind of makes it all together in one motive horse ass right because this woman so unbelievable\nBut right I mean yeah it's a it's a very real possibility it certainly doesn't help Dr ... here's what I mean you know she she fell apart in a million different ways last night but\nHere I think is the crux of the thing is that I Do not believe Julie ... when she says that she was unaware that that Brett Kavanaugh was close to being confirmed to the Supreme Court in September a\nEverybody in America knew that Brett Kavanaugh was\nOn the verge of being confirmed to the Supreme Court in July and August it's going to have security clearances she's worked in government she's paying attention to these things and and and and then\nTo her allegation it comes out last night is not that she had any specific knowledge that it was Kavanaugh and that it was a judge who are running this suppose at a rape praying or in high schools in the eighties she just reimburse them being at the parties and standing suspiciously near the punch bowl but he doesn't know how\nMuch it it it bears belief frightened right if she didn't have any specific knowledge that they were the

OJ over net neutrality\nChore so on Sunday night a governor Jerry Brown signed a the toughest state and any tragedy law\nState and any comedy law um that uh you know has ever been written in the United states\nUm it was designed to replace\nA and supersede the FCC's own let neutrality regulations which the FCC voted to roll back last year and officially did that uh got that on the books this year um and uh the Justice Department within about an hour of the bills getting signed um a file a lawsuit\nTo try and block California from actually moving forward with this legislation\nDoes Jerry Brown understand the Internet is it like the ... there's no check points at the state lines\n[noise] well that's a great question I have not spoken to the governor myself so I couldn't speak to a to his understanding of Internet technology but the argument here\nUm you know is that uh the that California and tried to set up um a state level version of the net neutrality rules um is a is violating\nThe constitution because the federal government typically takes precedence I'm ... in these sorts of issues\nFor pretty good reasons or just to because it would be chaos for companies if they had fifty different sets of regulations are okay and this will probably drag on for many weeks and months right this battle\nAbsolutely and you know this is also happening just as where uh you know we've got at least two or three other lawsuits going on that each rally at the same time and these are all kind of related so it'll be a really interesting to see how um you know all of this litigation plays out\nBrian fungus Washington Post it Brian thanks a million well done my pleasure\nGood to talk to you this reminds me a lot of ... grade or before the Judiciary Committee talking about the courts have to do all this now because Congress passes these incredibly vague laws empowers agencies to do what's necessary now we're done and then it all gets fought out in the courts

a the Trump the president and his siblings she set up a sham corporations to disguise millions of dollars and give\nIt a sham corporations is that maybe in the eye of the beholder\n[noise] indeed and that's an ugly term because businesses regular normal clients set of corporations all the time for business purposes some of the times as business purposes workout sometimes they don't there's a ton of\nThem around and and again for somebody else to say well that's a sham no no no\nAgain there there's all types of innuendos here and things I wouldn't want to as as an attorney I Would say okay well what are the facts and that's part of the problem I have with us and again in our tax law remember there's two purposes to it one is the one we all know about collecting money but the other one is the government\nGives us all kinds of incentives to do things the government is good for economy look at the current tax law the current\nTax law gave so many\nAdvantages to real property owners

nightclub but the prosecutors figured out she made it all up I'm for whatever reason um it just gives me crazy people are everywhere greedy or whatever there is probably civil suit and make if that\nDoes not prove anything about Kavanaugh nope nothing no but I thought it was interesting that that was a headline today moving along usually it's for money\nYou're either really crazy or two for money or that happens a lot with the athletes in stars and stuff right right\nAh somewhat sort of kind of related\nStory pizza delivery man goes to deliver a pizza when the woman who was their mouths with the words help me to him\nI Believe she had a a a black guy pointed toward blackout oh my God right oh my\nGod now Michael you're gonna have to get over the fact that the pizza delivery drivers name was Joey grumbled\nAlright roof damage over it is what it is said Mr ... [noise]\nIt's kind of scary gave them is pizza noticed behind them was his girlfriend she pointed to a black guy that was quite visible as Sean pointed out because he couldn't sit still and let the host run the show [laughter]\nShe mouthing the words it seems like an odd time the town that are ... you're right in the middle of\nA kind of Hama or a semi colon [laughter] she mouth towards called police\nSaid the the ... a pizza delivery driver I'm copper showed up and yeah it turns out to this this woman's a live in boyfriend was a ... a ... little Bruton had been doing terrible things and thank God he's been apprehended and\nMy God I Hope she's All right\nBut anyway as a beach guy you'd think this so I got to be careful because obviously this is a violent person\nRight right um and you know I could get into specifics but they're ... they're terrible um but anyway good for the pizza driver recognizing or somebody who needed help 'em and and doing something about it\nLuis C K is dropping in and performing at night clubs in New York in particular the comedy cellar which I'm told is legendary for the super heavy weights of the games are just dropping and try new material which should be so very cool oh yeah uh you know there aren't a lot well it depends who you are and how you live\n... I was going to say to me in my life right now there wouldn't be a lot of advantages living in a giant city I don't think I'd like it when I was younger would be zero\nRight now [laughter] zero yeah a younger yeah I I get a ... and I love big cities but ah like living downtown in the big city would be of no help to marry the fact that any friday or Saturday or Thursday for that matter you flip through the paper and find\nA great musical acts playing for instance always that would be cool oh sure I'm\nGoing club and man Dona\nMusic clubs and listening to bands I've never heard of is one of my favorite things I never do it anymore but anyway uh so at least the K unexpectedly return to stage Sunday night at the comedy cellar\nThat was five weeks after his first an unannounced appearance set off a broad controversy controversy among bronze no large controversy [noise] I'm In\nUh apparently the long and short of it is some audience members are offended that his very presence there I think that has to be worn or or excused or get their money back his comedy clubs regularly have some pretty freaking edgy material yes I mean really edgy yeah I realize he yanked it in front of people but\nWhatever get up and walk out if you're if you're appalled by it what does he never supposed to work again I don't understand well right or or leave but the seller the comedy cellar\nEdited a disclaimer on tickets swimming\nWomen your own risk it says with an icon of swimming figure we never know who's going to pop in if an unannounced appearances not your cup of tea or free to leave on a crucible please no questions asked your check on the house have any of those people ever attended professional a sporting event\nAny of the people that are performing for them at that event yeah the ... out\nIt it's unlikely that I go to a niners game and they announced while I'm In the seat that they assigned OJ Simpson one game contract when he's very old Shawn but they're often people on the field that into my mind have done something worse than Yankee and from what I Want to do that when I purchased the ticket\nGotcha that's true uh when I get up and walk out I wouldn't like cry or the mention that a number of comedians have done Louis the Cape beds at the comedy cellar\nAnd not and he probably thinks that's hilarious or maybe the matter no uh and ... including comedian ten ... uh who didn't like the audience's reaction says what is the guy I have to be convicted of sexual assault to get an extended ovation [noise]\nHe said do you want to live in a world where a man can't politely ask your colleague if you can take off\nAll his clothes and masturbate completion is that where we are as a culture [noise] five minutes five and a half minutes it is great that's funny and that's very Luis C K yes it is I Wonder how he I Wonder if he admired\nOr some world class sarcasm right yes [laughter]\nWhat's coming up your news Marshall that Governor we've got senators now wrangling over whether or not to make the FBI background report on having off public wants his release than we've got a Nobel Prizes this time for chemistry we live and exciting time\nI got a chemistry sent I've been working on it all year long had given the St Louis Armstrong and getting\nThem seven sixty KF MB\nAnd Roger Hitchcock with the Roger report\nWell Jerry brown but governor of California signed eight hundred and fifty nine bills into law it was his turn after the legislature concluded his business\nLet's take one of those that have built one hundred this law says to prod California to buy one hundred percent of its electricity from renewable sources by twenty forty five course of complete does it\nWhat to say that it's a very scary time for young men in America when you can be something that you may not be guilty is a very very very difficult time\nWhat's happening here has much more to do that even the appointment of it's a free Georgia so it\nYou're going to be somebody that was perfect your dire allies had somebody could accuse you of something that has to be a woman has everybody say what somebody good again as you think you're\nAutomatically guilty but it is around you are generally guilty until proven that one of the very very bad things that that gave like\nThat to be of the the two things that aren't bothered the most by this whole thing are\nThe regularly the referring to white men as trustworthy just because they're white man you can't believe them they can't be in charge of anything racism is okay now in a in a number of senators talk or what the person who was just talking about who are saying you know due process relieves into thing\nIn this particular case [noise]\nWe have to assume he's guilty and he has to prove these not which is not the way we've ever\nDone it that troubles me well it troubles me that it's an impossibility you can't prove a negative much why we don't have that system right or have it in the past anyway\nNo I Know Jack you I've been following the Nobel Prize or being handed out this week\nI got my chemistry set I had a little strip ... papers trying to figure out what was the base and ... around just getting under the bed time like I said that to the uh the Nobel people\nAt your wedding by the phone for the call but I'm afraid to you or were not among the winters to Americans in a breath are sharing this year's Nobel Prize for chemistry\nKept the million dollar prize is going to go to Francis Arnold for the Cal Tech scientists work on speeding up chemical reactions to benefit

successful in various applications\nAnd suggested how that might be done [noise]\nSo this kind of crazy now the other\nA crazy now the other two below ...\nGot their fellow American George Smith answered Gregory Winter they're going to show the other half of the prize for their work with a virus that infects bacteria to produce antibodies they can counter act a number of diseases including some types of cancer Folsom\nSo there's really no yeah so there's another a big move towards a you know in the battle against cancer show you got chemistry that's category jacks kinda got bad locked up in terms of the show with those last or base experiment\nTo economics I'm Still waiting for my\nBy low sell high concept that I forget that prize you got literature we could take a hacker than anybody this this will be the easiest one I just want to be a regular person I mean certainly very difficult ball you could try how 'bout Nobel Peace prize oh there you go oh buddy calmed down\nAnd reality now I see there you go I could have won any idiot can win the Nobel Peace prize is we've gone through because these are all completely different things they have different groups of people making the decisions and everything they're like different ... they're like different companies are practically from\nAnd so the Nobel Peace prize is its own crazy deal\nAnd that the the way to get to submitted Ford is just [noise]\nLaughable somebody dominates yeah dollar fee and practically anybody can do that right oh yeah then you got physics which I guess there's like\nAdams waves and stuff

when I first heard this I certainly think it's true by now is the most famous person who's ever lived on planet\nEarth mhm at the time they were alive no doubt about it oh yeah yeah\nWe we've heard from so many people have traveled from various places and people ask him about Donald Trump or anywhere you go in the world all we got a note from a beloved listener who's traveling the British Isles in every TV in every pot was on the Capitol hearing\n\nA Donald Trump's or various traits here and the Pew Research poll\n'em and you were you there said yes this describes him or no it does not describe him\nIt's kinda interesting how it breaks down by a by a party or only for a couple of them there's only one number as I mentioned earlier that the Republicans dipped below fifty percent and that is even tempered [laughter]\n[laughter] I could see that is even only forty five percent of Republicans believe he's even tempered at ten percent of Democrats Democrats given low numbers on everything except for a majority of Democrats say he stands up for what he believes which will get you a long way\nIn politics that sealed Osama bin Laden when when what did he say when people see two forces fighting they go to a strong horse yeah um\nYeah well I think a ... ... standing up for what he believes guy in the White House because there's so few politicians that you look at him and think okay there's sincerity\nYou might not like what he believes brawl you believe that he's he believes it and he's going to try to do it right I've heard I've heard they eat in a really left the I'm a I'm a pundits say he has done more of what he promised on the campaign trail than anybody they can remember oh yeah oh yeah by some distance\nI'm but Republicans Ninety One percent say stands up already believe Democrats fifty two so majority of every body\nThan it does splits quite a bit able to get things done almost Ninety percent of Republicans only twenty percent of Democrats keeps his promise only twenty two percent of Democrats ... percent of Republicans that's interesting a strong leader or eighty percent of Republicans say yes only sixteen percent Democrats\nWow wow\nAgain I is amazing I I Would say he's a strong leader you might not like his leadership style or the things he does I don't know how you could not say he's a strong leader yeah\nUm well informed [noise] Seventy seven percent of Republicans say is well formed only ten percent of Democrats I don't think personally I Would call them well informed in general on a number of issues he certainly this trade thing this is his thing man this is what he's been working on since he was young um\nBut we know from the campaign trail that a lot of issues were really new to him\nAnd I mentioned to you that the uh the head guy at the Federal Reserve or one of the head guys said uh this kind of means too good to be true\nI don't want to hear that shut up mind your own business by the way you could flip these numbers for\nI think uh probably Obama and George Bush would be similar because people are just so partisan or cares about people like me you'd have the vast majority of Republicans saying Obama didn't care about\nThem I'm In ... I'm not sure that gives you anything\nEven tempered Lenny doesn't bother me 'cause I don't care about those people either [laughter]\nEven tempered one is kind of interesting that a a ...\nA ... a minority of Republicans even think he's even tempered but he's not you know white people think that because he's not even tempered\nDid they ask impulsive that'd be a good one that\nDifferent\nThan other Miller similar as we mentioned how his approval rating has been more constant than anybody in modern history any president in modern history he's been All right around just under forty percent and it's been from day one on through right hasn't moved hardly at all\nAnd there has not been a Wilder administration more\nShocking headlines more controversies more real or imagined in food is a support\nComing back and yet there's approval rating sits more or less the same number that's wild it's as if it's a you know it's a sound and fury signify nothing or just it's it's all self canceling\nHis approval ratings have been remarkably stable during the first year and a half much less changing his predecessors um and as I said he's right below forty percent but a large majority of blacks and Hispanics disapprove of the way Trump is handling is jobs whites are evenly split\n... when you look at those numbers you might want to keep that what about Asians you racist it didn't look at Asians should I yeah absolutely should wow has that actually no I got white black and Hispanic I got ... college grads some college high school or less\nUm\nApproval rating goes down as the education level goes up which some people will say smarter people understand a dummy is although people who tend to have a lot of education also tend to lean one direction politically so\nYeah yeah yeah I'm I'm ... I Will never ever be anti education or anti learning\nBut you know to get back to our previous discussion about college campuses there's a hell of a lot of quote unquote knowledge that's being disseminated that I think is utterly perverse and his or if the opposite of a enlightening\nWell I mentioned to the other day but I'll say it again in case you didn't hear 'cause I thought it was interesting the number of times that\nUh ms forge testimony has been a it's been pointed out that she's got a very high academic degree as proof of something for the rest of the world I don't think looks at it that way people in academia me believe that the higher degree to more believable\nStable everything you are I'm not sure the rest of the country thinks about\nI don't think the average I didn't go to college guy thinks people with a lot of education are more normal fact I Know they don't get you know what's coming up your news Marcia Lindsey Graham getting salty about the Kavanaugh's nomination in California bishop sued over sexual abuse\nIs injustice somebody's in jail\nYou're listening to the Armstrong\nAm seven sixty KFC will be\nHiring tries zip recruiter unlike most job boards zipper critter find candidates for you and actively invites them to apply you get qualified candidates fast try it for free as zipper critter dot com slash joins\nYour carpets looking it's hard to say because they get a little bit dirty or in a little bit dirty or and and you know you get used to sell incomes and they spilled all over your car because I just got a lot earlier really quickly of course the medical director\nAnd it and it gets in the way of I think rooting out the problems here there's a lot of people don't want to get into a you know anything that comes within a hundred miles of it makes it look like on gay people are pedophiles which only a\nNut job believes that\nBut there is that culture as um [noise]\nBooze our friend of mine ...
