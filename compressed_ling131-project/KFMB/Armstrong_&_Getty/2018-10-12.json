that\nBut I think we have a ... whole play by play and political and now here not because that was her fault on our White House was a combination of stream of consciousness I felt like I sit in on us psychiatric visit and a commercial for Donald Trump\nI saw was a minstrel show today him in front of us\nFront of all of these white people mostly white people embarrassing himself an embarrassing Americans but mostly African America\nWow that's from CNN yesterday on their panel one of them went on to say Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read wow sack of a thing to say black guy said that but like I said that if a white guy so that you ... your career to be over but I'm I'm not even sure you should quote him\nYeah I was twenty so Tucker Carlson was talking about that last night which I guess he got against on who obviously like a hundred and eighty degrees warm and they may ... yelled at each other that fabulous [laughter] you know I don't know I don't find that entertaining but um\nHe kept saying and say you have somebody calling ... inward and the guest have to keep keep saying negro was not the N. word [laughter]\nUm our nation's discourse at this point but that is a heck of a thing to say this\nIs what happens when negroes don't read well and Don Lemon look at them in front of all those white people well mostly white people well there are some white people while it looked like America there are all sorts of people there\nAnd some minstrel show was a whole race baiting thing we've got a friend who was top told me his story yesterday about somebody throwing the race card at 'em and it was just an eye rolling had shaking are you kidding me\nAnd let's get God the if Well Don lemon is cynical estate calming he understands audience when the ... and what they want but if it if anybody actually thinks that sort of thing is advancing I dunno understanding or or empowerment or anything\nThat wrong blows it simple is what the right in saying about that comment that it's a lot of the black community or black media at least\nReally unhappy anytime somebody black steps out of line yeah oh yeah there was only only mice to be paid you can only believe this way if you believe the other way to know that some sort of minstrel act don't go Tom thing you can actually you couldn't actually come to the ... on your own two conclusions you agree with this side\nRight it's not even taken on as a like a mistake in conclusion is taken on as a being an Uncle Tom heartland it's not that way for white people\nThat if you choose one side or the other it's because there's something you know something has to do with your race in ... or whatever sure yeah and I've been saying that for many years hey Hispanic people you all have to vote like this we're going to put you in pans like animals and we're going to tell you how you have to vote because certainly you're not individual human beings with\nA conscience and and an intellect and needs desires and philosophies know Europe common beefed get in this pen and that's the way you minorities are treated politically in America and I find it degrading as hell\nBut it did it wins elections for the Democrats it what's it like a figure I'd\nSomebody said this the other day and I didn't you know to ... to verify it but if the Republicans could peel off Fifteen Percent of the black vote no Democrat would win office ever again you know I don't know that that's true but it it it's\nClose enough to being true to make the point\nWe're sending Kanye West of the White House to talk about these issues because he can't he doesn't have any depth it's anti intellectualism it's simply isn't cool\nA communist is what happens negroes don't read\nSo how about the other side of the argument or maybe it's the same so is it the other side of the center about the argument that um that Donald Trump knows Kanye West is mentally ill but he's a black guy who supports him so give them a platform to uh go on a crazy ram\nA ... there's probably a little truth to that I you know I think is quote unquote mentally ill but if he's not like psychotic or paranoid or anything like that I think he's bipolar\nAnd when he gets going he says some stuff that's pretty out there in a little tough to follow can organizes thoughts original thoughts are crazy\nIdea of him having the idea that there are\nThere are too many black people in prison or you know not having fathers around the bad thing those ideas aren't crazy or having apple make an airplane [laughter]\nThat is kind of agreement well it would be very sleek but you'd have to buy a plastic guard the put around here would break every time it land they would look really cool but if you use it the way it was built with the gifts raschke yeah\nCan I say I want to scratch plane can hear a clip number well that do I guess we're spending the wheel account you can pretend that or we could just listen to that clip number twelve\n[noise] so\nOf person to the concept of racism because they know that we're very proud of most people when I said I Try to like on a liberal they'll say\nOh he's racist you think of races okay it\nA I\nThink I Know what he's driving at I think if I'm sitting there and and his answer to I heard Joe get he's racist racism most got me I'm sitting there thinking oh hey dude how about for a little Joe is not ... in with your rent but he didn't quite get there have we heard\nA Fifteen and we played that I Can't tell 'cause you know it's hard to title east because they're kind of all over the place you know and I think it'd be cool to have easy id\nAsian says er which should be a mix of\nEducation that\nGift of modernization like sometimes people say this yeah they have this guy is eating a peaceful\nWe have more say in a\nYou learn as you said in the morning we are at stake mental health and our rafts back into the back to the city\nI'm not sure about the whole basketball master [laughter] I agree wholeheartedly with him I Know exactly what he's saying you're teaching math I mean basketball in grade school and zero we're still at zero zero\nZero zero perhaps we'll just focus on the concept them zero in western mathematics today what's thirty five shots mind is zero baskets made\nIt shot is worth two points and jak Mrs every shot he paid right how many points does
