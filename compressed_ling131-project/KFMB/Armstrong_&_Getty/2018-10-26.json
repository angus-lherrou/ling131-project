begin to wonder how they can be productive members of society and are attracted to the Catholic priesthood because they believe they will be able to avoid they're sinful nature and contribute positively to the world if they become celibate priests I imagine some succeed but\nMany do not this is how we ended up with such a mess in the Catholic Church I'm certainly not saying everybody says sexual deviant um sexual devious believe they can atone by becoming priests I'm so is that ... so is this\nPerson assuming you're ... you realize your sexual urges are not\nLegal slash ethical slash acceptable in in culture right and you think I just got to not have sex and you're a good person so you think I'm not I'm not going to I'm not going to do that right you go to an institution where

guest Jeff Anderson of ah Jeff Anderson and associates has been bringing cases against the Catholic Church since the eighties and he was involved in a high profile case right now are against the Vatican for on behalf of the victims of sexual abuse in the bay area of California\nUh and joins us now Jeff how are you sir\n[noise] very well nice to be with you\nThanks so why don't you give us a quick uh outline of who the plane to learn what they are alleging\nWell yesterday um we filed suit on behalf of two very courageous survivors a gym Canaan and Kathy stole and break your\nAnd against the Holy See also known as the pope or the Vatican [noise] and ah they're both uh individuals who are\nUh violated multiple times by serial offenders and in both instances ah those offenders became known to the Vatican and in both instances one of them being a bishop by the way the Vatican a suppressed a the evidence and continued\nUh the offenders ministry and so we had a direct tied to them as a result I have cells to add to feel that ah they're both qualified to stand with us using their names are when they didn't have to\nTo really tired at the Vatican and the dangerous practices they're employing as we speak what\nWhat level of abuse are we talking about here\nWell in both instances is multiple instances of\nPenetration over many years as he was so [noise] the the ... the significance is a of of their their abuses at a severe a but more importantly is is\nIt's a part of a pattern that at a practice that is employed by the Catholic officials\nAcross California across the country um that ultimately is reflected in a a requirement at a practice that begins enrollment as employed at both of their cases so I've had those\nThousands of survivors it all worked with and continue to work with hundreds of ... of survivors who they spray of serious injury this farm like this but the real problem that we're really trying to address to this question is\nIs at the top top dollar whether they should uh till the Vatican is if feels the heat of the pressure oh we're not going to see any change and and as a result others are serious terrible that we are trying to address\nHow solid as your evidence that knowledge of and or cover ups of the ... go all the way to the top\n[noise] we've got a documented evidence that in both services showed that the Vatican suppressed a and head and continues to hide the evidence of of all and then in the case of ... who is a serious or\nA serial offenders in the old with area are they actually documents show that he saw late ... early ... from the police to buy the Vatican\nAnd the Vatican settled letter back saying oh\nYou're too young to remove you from the priesthood even though we know you abusing his kids to keep you they quietly kept them and they continue to abuse and they didn't have a a a a remove them till later I was too late for many because uh they chose to do that\nAnd in the case of the other uh individual who the Vatican directly suppressed we have a large volume of documents\nAnd that involves at our church bishop ... who is a a superior or the archbishop in Saint Paul Minneapolis and while here in Minnesota and the Irish bishops it was well known to uh to uh\nUh the officials here that he was engaged in a sexual\nMisconduct with the understanding areas ... much like charged them with Carrick and then he also was engaged in a relationship with the serial offenders here and then when that surreal offender became known to him and his lieutenants he suppressed\nSat and didn't report it and then the investigation is sued\nAnd they bought that investigation about suspicious sexual conduct and his cover up of criminal conduct directly to the pope's representative cargo battle\n[noise] uh in Washington DC and met with them and at that time the pulp and cardinal dial or to the investigation to be halted and suppress the investigation\nAnd as a result our bishop nine that continued in ministry even though he resigned as another spaceship he went on to continue to this day\nTo be made it keep his status and so in both cases we have a really powerful\nDocumentary ... all the Vatican concealment\nVatican cover up the Vatican's suppression of evidence and Vatican uh decisions made by a Pope John Paul this segment of Pope Benedict formerly Cardinal Ratzinger Ratzinger and no Pope Francis\nSo whether it's hardly one scene or a congressman in Washington D. C. or Catholic churches around the world what often happens is somebody comes forward with a check and the uh the cases over and and and somebody gets and I'm not making a moral judgment on that 'cause I'm not sure what I Would do or recommend but if the Vatican says hey here's a million dollars each year or is developing over\n[noise] well you know that it's it's a good question because oftentimes it can be other survivors to when we were ... uh it it never is just about getting the money and keep it a confidential\nThe question because oftentimes it can be\nOther survivors to when we were ... uh it it never is just about getting the money and keep it in a confidential I'd they're working with survivors to thirty five years and the first survivor of sexual abuse that are represented by Catholic clergy and they get eighty three\nUh after we uncovered a cover up they offered him a million dollars in Nineteen eighty three but they demanded it requires that it'd be kept secret he said he had the courage to say no as a result we published and there was as a result we've been going public every day is all in this kind of thing\nAs a result we'd never engage in gay orders of confidentiality agreements\nAnd having said that James Keenan the one who sued\nThe Vatican yesterday in northern California [noise] in his case ten years ago was offered a close to a million dollars just to the little way\nFire the immune system getting it ready to recognize the flu and learning how to kill\nHelping lead better life if you or someone you know is struggling with addiction please call this toll free number right now eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight\nThat eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight by calling your addiction team you're taking the first steps to recovery to help you need to be one called the weigh eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight make the recall now eight hundred\nThree nine zero nine five to eight ... a third party advertiser for every street and centered in place networks individual results will barriers that you weren't decent team dot com forward slash turns for more information\nRight now the he marched dot com for a limited time even ... you can point to blast and fame land ... protests forty nine dollars on single they laugh as eighty nine dollars I'm correct that do and that's a good deal so we offer that heightened\nOver five hundred frame which makes it a great deal I'm going to the humor dot com to lie to complete parents think they can glasses part in forty nine dollars or two pairs of progressive ... eighty nine dollar mark and we're here to help heal damage actual five teeth I pretty doubt I'm right by the cats and says he I guess\nYou just received your highest electric bill ever ... has this illusion ghost shoulder and moving American style of Brazil or was he said he goes local and veteran those children reading contractor for\nVery limited done up to six thousand dollars to declare independence from the electric company goals that Brazil nervous right\nToday by three nine eighty five sixty three a day five eighty five sixty three fourths of Brazil numbers dot com or something like that which I can make a deal the U.S will be like what I Do if\nYou're considering the remodel do Bismarck hell design and remodeling free kitchens bad some more seminar Saturday morning November ten speed Marcel design consultants and get all your questions answered this is a great starting point to talk to the people that are going to be designing and working with you\nRSVP for the free kitchens bats are more seminar Saturday November's heads with complimentary lunch to follow caloric hallowed six one nine for for one Ninety three hundred and four four one Ninety three hundred or does a trust your home to US DOT com [noise]\nUm sometimes the most watched show on Fox\nBill O'Reilly was for like Twenty years Bill O'Reilly was most watch cable news show period long burned time every once in a while making Kelly would do a bump up there and be the most watched in she was pretty big deal and uh I've never liked her that that's just you know my taste um\nAnd uh NBC wanted to get get her out of there\nI don't know if they wanted to get away from Fox to help him in some B.

Dell or solar dot net that dollar solar dot net\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nFortunately doesn't\nHappen all the time if you hurt or killed by an idiot you know less sailing indeed but what I'm Wondering\nIs that the experts are are thinking this is a you know we're dealing with a real mastermind here or a\nKind of a an idiot well let's dive in a on a question others with chief Robert boy some of the former New York city chief of detectives and has been kind enough to extend his day to chat with us on the west coast and we appreciate it cheap are you sir\nGood morning I'm doing fine thank you\nFirst date a preliminary question I have a feeling this is a massive investigation how many individuals who would you guess from no to that you know was shot in the dark are actually involved in this investigation at this point\nWell you have the joint terrorism task force and that's a multi agency a unit on their case responsibility so you were talking\nAbout hundreds and hundreds of people who attacked us most of the case has now shifted to southern Florida right now however from what I understand we just found that the other two devices city\nIs it also says so we're still busy there might be a day we're still covering that bought the focus of our investigation is a southern Florida part of that task force the joy terrorists as well is is the U.S postal inspectors there was quite a significant role in getting the origin of down to Florida so that's where we are right now in that case\nThe FBI or announced yesterday that this is their highest priority so that's a lot of people uh yeah in two more package is one of the Cory Booker in one of the former I'm a intelligence chief uh James Clapper cells um so it is anything stand out about this um\nThe in your mind so let's talk about what we know about the device itself it they all have very similar um design and I'm up or ability and the applicability is what is the question right now now they all have\nA powder to them it's unclear if his flash power blackout or a smoker so I Can't tell you right now because spinning allies Quantico, Virginia but it is a political material each one so it's really not a hoax as they could go up to their potential\nPotential ... however the the triggering device is what is the question right now is that enough of occurred to ignite works to explode this these devices can ask what's being bandied about right now\nMy sense is that that anybody with a average above average intelligence spends a half hour on the Internet and buy some stuff at home depot they can make a ... a bomb that accurate or inaccurate is a pretty hard to do that's\nThat's fairly accurate it's not difficult to do what is the uh getting the materials um you can buy a Home Depot and this is PVC by the way so it it would not show with a metal detector and um the uh\nThe digital clock you can buy all over the Internet for about two or three dollars on each one of what you have your own scope is quite dramatic you have devices being sent to two former the homes with two former U.S president and vice president has pretty pretty fixed up here\nAnd this um this guy who ever uses his in a world of trouble\nI Would say is and I think the investigations that we've asked as and culture closer I'm Deborah strong um direction now in South Florida\nOr what I did in New York City was I had a you know I was very fortunate because the amount of cameras that we had threats to us so we were able to we are still able to identify\nCriminals know quite easily through who are going to bring on video digital evidence so I don't know if that location Flora has that\nBut uh we'll we'll see going forward if they do\nI think they're getting closer closer\nWhat's your gut feeling do you think these devices were actually designed to explode or not\n[noise] ah I think they you know it's difficult to say I think they are they can explode and it's here's the thing is my if you if you put in there let's say ah some some nonsense kitty litter from for example may\nLook like it but it's not that is a hoax device and it was a hoax device is often do cycle the next day you know just as much because\nIt is a explosive material it is a potential ball so what right now is getting into the minds of the perpetrator\nOr perpetrators and I believe it's the same deal along by now um\nIt's it's you find out what they're going to be is it is possible it's enough to scare was created this this drama or these you know throughout the country so I Believe that's what that's what they are\nWhen your guest would be that we're going to figure out who this is fairly quickly\n[noise] just because of the overnight the way the case of Vince I think that getting very close\nAnd how important is the profiling and all of this is it mostly well it's obviously mostly about physical evidence but the profile is working on it and that's the case as\nWell as the ... the ... the um the FBI has profiles I'm sure there are quite good at this there's no question\nCheaper ... I'm Sorry go ahead sir going nuts but\nSo so so the answer your question is yes I Do I Believe it is important however the evidence is is what's ... what's going to solve the\nThirty five years say in the NYPD retired is\nNone of these have gone off we we have no idea you know I found that the chiefs answer a bit cryptic about if it's a hoax it's a\nOut of the news the next day so evidently he believes it is a gunpowder it's something that could explode in there but there was no mechanism to make it explode\nUm you know sending explosive powder around is unsafe\nLord knows what it's a different thing than sending a bomb that you are convinced will explode in Maine or kill but it could be more on his Saudi add a bomb that was going to explode which is yeah crappy time or something like that was the I think if he was more on on that level low but that that I don't know it'd be caught already\nUm 'course they might be close and they might have some moron under surveillance right now and the minute he moves it'll snatch 'em up but they're still collecting evidence sure I think it's going to end up\nBeing three four days total from Bombay showing up to catching him so uh can't can't wait to find out what the guidelines although I think I have a guess I'm\nA couple of things that was a big deal back when did the bomb makers handbook come out late sixties whenever we talk the other day and I'll just a book yeah\nI'm a we talked the other day about how in the early seventies we're having five bombs go off a day in the United states right five bombs they blew up somewhere in the United states would just mean Mondays are the most partisan times ever jak will get much attention all bunch of bombs that didn't go off\nGetting top priority the FBI and everything we used to five and actually go off per day but it was a huge deal when somebody put out a book on how to make a bomb because back you know pre Internet getting information was the thing well now all the information for whether you want to make an atomic\nBomb or whatever you want to do it all out there on the Internet but don't they are not bombing each other and we're not bombing each other\nWas was there a point where that was that book it was not good to be caught with that book\nOh I got to a man who was extremely controversial guy who wrote that book I saw him interviewed not long ago actually uh he really regretted that the way it was used\nHe was just trying to like send a message or not gonna put up with his he didn't know people were actually gonna try to make bombs and blow things up [noise]\nWhich is often the case where\nYour rhetoric exist like second angry people on social media [noise]\nI'm Still working on my nuclear device in my garage and try to disrupt hurricanes with it\n[laughter] that you're planning to stop hurricanes yeah with atomic bomb the so called experts say would never work the wrong [laughter]\nMarshals news that hey we put off mailbag and clips of the week so all that coming up on the Armstrong and getting [noise]\nSeven sixty K.

the same species as me here's the review and then I'll explain to your best as I can why a really good are you can't explain why it's good art in an article you got to see it right you got to listen to it you gotta you can give a clue\nBut or I'll give you a clue um this review or in the New York times that I went to see free so low for a second time after I couldn't get it out of my head I still can't the film is a drug it causes your pupils dilate your homes to sweat and your mind to boggle\nEven as you know that ... going to make it to the top you can't believe what you're seeing and then he gets into why the movie is what it is and it gets into\nThe purpose\nOf life in the way we live our lives in it he said it's messed up everything he does but somehow the documentary uh brings home the point that this guy is crafted life where every single thing he does is consequential\nEverywhere he puts his hand or anything he puts his feet all this training every little bit his gear everything he does what he ate for breakfast everything has some meaning wow in his life while with with with with life and death on the line and how that brings purpose to life\nAnd you know anything less than that is not being a human being just kind of you know floating through your day eating junk food thinking about stupid crap which is I'm Talking about myself [laughter] until one day the ticker static exec yeah that's making me sad again\n[laughter] no I totally get that that's why I'm really\nBeen reading a drive by Sebastian younger and it's freaking me out a little bit speaking of Sebastian younger he wrote the book ... what was the name of Restrepo Restrepo and eat it 'cause he was with a he was with someone Marines in Afghanistan and one of the things he mentioned that book when he got back to the United states how how difficult it was to adjust back to the mundane\nJust wasting time crap and life he said over there how you tied your shoes in the morning was a life or death situation\nEverything mattered and how much more alive he felt yeah in that environment right um so it fits in with the rock climbing thing I don't know how exactly with you know raising kids and doing a radio show I Would craft a life where everything is life and death and I'm not sure I Want to write\nWell and there's a guy who suffers from a vertigo white guy related freak outs ah I'm not sure I could sit through the movie Kenny write a book place I'll read that\nBut I guess the point would be to ... to ... have more consequential things in your life make you feel more alive and where are you out [noise]\nEverything being consequences and get some point\nYou would have to manage that you have to see\nWith some of the different balance how 'bout sitting on the couch with a

three World Trade center he says the bombs were most likely based on what he's seen not\nDesigned to go off they were designed terrifying not to kill not not to explode based on what he knows as an expert in this sort of like okay I think that's kind of interesting yeah I think that's pretty likely the case that many bombs not one\nOf them went off right right no ... and ... good good\nSo unlike the Unabomber packages which were cleverly disguised so the recipients would actually open them and many people got injured as we all remember these current devices were mailed are delivered in padded manila envelopes with very little effort to disguise their contents\nI'm In ... he could also be a complete nut job right so it really is\nYou know based on what we know so far which will change it

there are some reporting that there was a confrontation with the FBI and who knows that is true or not\nBut he had a van in the parking lot looks exactly like the sort of a fan of crazy guy would mail bombs would drive and ... and older van with all the sort of thing you see driving down the road\nBut the tone of like posters stickers on it because I think there's a ... job windows but they're all covered by the messages you want you to rate exactly and now the FBI ice covering up the band so CNN and everybody else has got a helicopter and they're trying to zoom in on the van because we all want to read the bumper stickers does it say\nFeel the burn or does it say Trump or what does that one of the bumper sticker saying at some weird religious thing God Knows he I'm scanning social media I'm just not finding anything but dang it the the uh the FBI covering the van with a blue tarp all into one that\nGot me it was meant ... well that's my independent investigation doesn't have to be to keep that information from us why do they why they do that when you see the van\nI don't know so somebody has to do it all as we got to zoom in so it doesn't get a ... a contaminated we've got as Lulu man on the side of the van now you can't read any of the words but needs it but it's a big looks like a presidential seal with Donald Trump's picture in it on the window of the van\nNow could say underneath that this man is Hitler I don't know but I'm\nProbably not [noise] but he got this this is the guy or the person you see driving around with all kinds of hard to explain don't make any sense political statements on their car right\nUsually those people aren't dangerous thank God\nHere's the back windows and those are just have a lot of touched on it but you got to be a long red light to get three to walk on the back of this guy's it almost\nLooks like newspaper articles um I mean like tons of pictures and tax I mean he was while he was one of those people that had a lot of opinions about things that would seem right and was burning to express them obviously\nAnd as I was just saying to Hansen what is it about guys in their fifties where that's where they they get they often get\nViolent or super crazy as it just I'm running out of life now it's my time or not or something I think probably there's anger and disappointment in and then your health starting to break down the amount of the world is changed in your lifetime I I just sort of critical man that's been going\nOn and so if you see the below the presidential seal thing I'm kind of the right side of the window there there's both Republican elephant right and the Democratic donkey on there to\nShow that he's a moderate he is clearly we're reporting this man is a moderate voter he could be anti both parties who knows he's a crazy person so white\nIt out of there because it's obviously evidence is probably bomb making supplies and who knows what else in there yes certainly could be I don't know why don't get to read the ... yeah come on come on FBI what about our right to know don't you understand how TV shows work\n\nUp with ... with people ... somebody had to get a good picture of them van
