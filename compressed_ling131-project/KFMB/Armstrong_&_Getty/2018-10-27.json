I've been deeply involved with tumor researchers in India and seeing all of that and with raspberry trial I've worked with scientists in Europe and also in California and she'll lay in South Africa all of which are major\nOr a trial I've worked with scientists in Europe and also in California in ... in South Africa all of which are major red wine producing areas so I've had the opportunity that investigate these things in the field meet with the top scientist than my conclusion is that\nGreen tea Kirk human from to recruit and ... from red wine are remarkable health and Hansing agents that everybody can benefit from the very very substantial way\nWe're supposed to talk about these big three and it's interesting that they're found in our diet in all considered super food the green tea human human spiritual why do you want to combine just read there's always a message to your\nYour madness if I can see it that way because you combine these things together because they have a synergistic effect they make each other worst corner real game changer\nWell you know when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason path to\nPut them all in separate products they do go very well together as you said they're all food derived so it's kind of like\nYou can make a salad if you choose out of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and while that's a little bit simplistic the fact is that all of these are very very rich\nIn groups of protective compounds that are both antioxidant so they actually retired the aging process of the cells\nAnd our bodies and protect our organ systems so they maintain a healthy inflammatory status in the body and this is really a big breakthrough I also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract curriculum and extracting resume or a trial\nIn one product with truly meaningful amounts of each one and not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nLet's dive into the headlines and the research especially on the green tea because it's absolutely amazing\nI knew what he shouldn't have been using it for thousands of years for the G ... what are you seeing recently in the press you know you told me the nutrition research journal in July twenty twelve issue revealed the green tea significantly increased\nPlasma anti oxygen activity and have lunch unify on you recap\nSome of these headlines and tell me why you're such a green tea advocates\nOkay what you just said about increasing plasma antioxidant activity is really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume\nThat don't actually wind up in the body or they don't wind up in the body in any significant amount\nThe green tea antioxidants which we know are among the most highly beneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed\nTo support healthy dieting immune defense joins comfort in so much more clean your complimentary bottle call now one eight hundred for nine nine\nSeven five zero five one little catch\nFree bottle offer is not available in stores and you won't find it online either only through today's ... limit one free bottle for households call now one eight hundred for nine nine seven five zero five one last time for those running down here we go one\nEight hundred for nine nine seven five zero five okay Chris talked about some of the headlines just on the green tea the we didn't get to you and I understand the dieters just loved green tea because the supports ... metabolism is that right what does the research say about green tea when\nThis is one of the especially wonderful things about green tea pat we know that green tea has thermo Jenike properties that is it has heat generating properties and the body so it actually causes your body\nTo burn more calories so when you eat a meal you're going to burn more calories from that meal as a result of taking a good well made concentrated green tea extract\nIn addition it has a specific fat oxidation properties said actually burns that I'm not suggesting that you're going to lose twenty pounds in a week but I Am saying that this is going to help your body to metabolize fat more efficiently\nOver time taking a green tea extract can help you to have a better fat to lean muscle ratio so from a weight control standpoint this is very good news additionally\nGreen tea helps to stabilize blood glucose or blood sugar and unstable blood sugar is one of the contributing factors to increased wait\nSo by stabilizing blood sugar\n... and unstable blood sugar is one of the contributing factors to increased wait\nSo by stabilizing blood sugar you have an effect on weight control in weight management so it's really quite remarkable stuff you need enough of it we've got enough of it in green T. C. R. it has to be the right extract we've got the right to extract but the science is there for healthy weight management\nRight now Chris you see that with surety formula it provides you with about three cups with green tea in each to capsule serving of these cutting edge liquids off so you know the green tea is concentrated benefits for energy for heart health for alert and it's just too soft ...\nPlus you get to her human in the ... too so it's easy you call your daily short cut to better health explain this idea of a healthy short cut and explain some of the top benefits as well\n[noise] well I mean you could for example drink three cups of good concentrated green tea each day\nEat at least one really rich curry made with a lot of tumor accrued and drink a couple of glasses or red wine you could do that every day most people will not do that every day but they still might want the benefits of three\nOf the biggest superstar protective health and Hansing nutrients on the entire planet\nSo when I call this a daily short cut I'm simply saying that you can get in a capsule and a good liquid soft gelatin capsule or you're the otherwise have to get by drinking a few cups of tea eating at least one large you know tumor Laden curry every day and drinking a couple of glasses of concentrated red wine\nAgain we're talking with Chris kill him the medicine under now in this new green T. C. R. formula purity it's really about the research share it with some of your favorite studies in the headlines on the human that we didn't get to yeah I Know this is one of your favorite ingredients for joint comfort and even for brain ...\nWell I especially like the liver protective heart protective and joint modifying properties of this stuff the liver is our greatest detoxify Oregon and we know that we're constantly bombarded by toxins in the environment and in fact\nBlood studies show that newborn babies contain two hundred industrial pollutants in their blood at the time of birth so we need a functioning super healthy very strong liver\nWe might not think about our livers that much but we need that and we know that Kurt him and protect ... detoxify deliver it keeps a strong from a cardiac standpoint it's highly beneficial for the heart\nIt's very good for maintaining healthy cholesterol and healthy platelet levels\nAnd from a joint standpoint we have in numerous bolt studies showing overall improvement in joined health and relief and stable inflammatory activity\nBetter joint mobility as a result of taking Kirk him and I like the brain protective studies as well you know I think everybody wants a sharper clearer mind and Kirk human delivers solve this so\nI regard it as one of the single most important things that you can put in your body and I'm very well aware path that most people are not going to eat\nEnough rock tumor recruit to get the benefits that they should and that they can get from a concentrated Kirk him in the abstract\nTo want to remind people did in ... to get started with the free bottle of green tea see our dirty products dishes are unique green tea formula secret human and the ... virus role model today just before Ninety five for shipping coal now operators are standing by one eight hundred\nFor nine seven five zero five again one eight hundred\nFor nine nine seven five zero five\nRight back to the show 'cause I don't want to get to technical here but these anti oxygen green tea or classified as police females and there really aren't super powerful and well respected by scientists but in his green T. C. R. formula there's more it's got the green tea Kirk human the risk variants world we talked about\nClass grape seed extract behind bars bio flab annoyed vitamin C can you talk to me about this is a ... a really super anti accidents and poli feels that you put into forming\nWell yeah I won't say that we kind of went over killed but I Will say that we really really developed in the fish and comprehensive program here\nGrape seed extract and pine bark extract both contain a group of highly specialized antioxidant compounds\nThat not only do much of what I've already described but also enhance the physical integrity of tissue in the blood vessels and the skin so we put those in there for\nExtra boost in antioxidant activity but also for a specific type of activity that isn't as much addressed by the green tea the curriculum and then there is there a troll the bio flap annoyed\nAnd hence the overall activity of vitamin C. and vitamin C itself is one of the most important nutrients that we can possibly take and so I Would say that we were very very thorough you know when we went through what could be in this product we said you know what would happen\nIf we put in grape seed extract\nPine bark extract ... noise and vitamin C. we realized that we would have an orderly superior formula and just to reiterate pat I Want people\nExperience dynamic health I Want people to feel great this formula the green tea the our will make you feel great and that's the purpose of it\nI Love this green T. C. R. combination formula and remembered the CRC ins for human inner spiritual loved that was his complimentary bottle today our listeners to get started for free that's great value what would people expect to pay if they bought all these separately in the store\nWell I think if they bought high quality products that contain these ingredients they'd be into it for about Seventy five bucks or so possibly even eighty yeah so they wind up spending appreciably more than they're going to spend on the green tea see our formula and they still\nWouldn't get the grape seed extract they still wouldn't get the pine bark extract the bio lab and always or the vitamin C.\nAnd Chris what kind of results can people expect to see what can they expect to see a once they start taking swimming\nI think that people will feel greater joint mobility and comfort\nI think they'll feel more energy because these ingredients also help to stabilize and maintain natural healthy blood sugar control I think they'll have more sustained energy throughout the day and I would just suspect that people will have an experience of greater vitality when you detoxify the body\nWhen you have a more highly functional immune system\nYou just feel more energy and better overall it's kind of you know like those days when you get up and go wow I feel great this is a while I feel great formula\nNow Chris the green tea see Arlen industry to provide you ... ... worth of green tea and each to camp serving plus you get the anti accident with one of several servings of fruits and vegetables plus you get the ... we have one of several servings of red wine and the joy comfort in ...\nTons of fruits and vegetables plus you get the ... quiver one of several servings of red wine and the joint comfort\nAnd brain function benefits of the Kirk human I mean while the only one formula in the last two minutes talk to me about this short cut to better health and why you want everyone listening to this program to call now for that complimentary bottle of green tea see are\nOkay fortunately\nThere's and the man's body of science that has been growing steadily for the past Twenty years and it's really rich science now we know that of the various plant derived substances that exist green tea extract Kirk human extract and resveratrol extract or at the absolute\nTop of the list of protective vitality and answering overall health promoting compounds there just isn't anything like these there in the green tea CRC our standing for Kirk human interest fair trial\nBoosting revitalizing cleansing super foods and every scoop\nWe added sixty seven percent more fiber for improve digestion elimination for cleansing the tops define it as the blueberries the strawberries we added broccoli milk fissile to help deliver cleansing detoxify system there's carrots for the eyes green tea for energy and metabolism\nCranberries for the urinary tract opposite ... hail and I'm just scratched\nThe surface here all of these fruits and vegetables and berries specifically chosen for the incredible benefits\nThat they gave you're going to feel better with O.

J.

I was in the health food store the other day I grabbed a bottle of blueberry juice a hundred and ten calories pat twenty six grams of sugar\nWhile in Milan serving I grabbed a popular pomegranate juice a hundred and fifty calories and thirty one grams of sugar\nPer serving such crazy and that's because they're removing the fiber in the process that they use their concentrating the sugar\nWhat we do ... is the exact opposite where's the hydrate and the greens at low temperatures for maintaining all the goodness of fiber is there a fighter nutrients the antioxidants\nThe vitamins and minerals the plant and sometimes it's all there one serving or ... or ... it was only forty five calories and that's because all the fiber is still there remember this is made from real organic produce all we're doing is removing the water at low temperatures locking in all the good news you can taste it you can taste the organic\nFruits and vegetables berries you just add water shake it up and the free shaker cup get it into your system and it goes to work helping you\nAll right what about the science behind these certified organic super fruits and vegetables found any organic juice ... what does the science say about getting seven nine servings of fruits and greens predict how important is that to consume those on a regular basis and what percentage of us really given us\nLook at my patient base I Would say maybe it's one at if you want to get seven to nine maybe I'm wrong maybe it's one out of fifty I rarely see it\nAnd the problem with that is that the science is crystal clear that the study is by the thousands are done and the results are in bottom line if you eat more\nFruits and vegetables hopefully seven to nine servings a day you're going to support your focus your concentration definitely your energy your skin will look better helps the eyes the brain digestion elimination it's going to support your liver pat in its job of cleansing\nSurgery your skin will look better helps the eyes the brain digestion\nElimination it's going to support your liver pat in its job of cleansing that the talks to find your system also fruits and vegetables they're powerfully antioxidant plus they ... the body that's so important world to asset and that causes a legion\nOf calcium from the bone so by our allies in the body you support your bone health listen if you're a fifty plus or like me and you notice that maybe your energy isn't the same if this sounds a little bit familiar to you and you're not getting seven to nine servings fruits and veggies that this\nIs one of the main reasons you're feeling this way and that's where O.

often out to the max\nAnd uh what I was a\nChecking I I've had some issues with the battery drain show right now it's got a brand new interstate battery in it okay and uh and after a few days a couple of days actually it it was a failing to turn our Oprah show I checked a parasitic a\nBattery drain on the car this morning and I'm seeing a hundred and thirty ... and I just wanted us that would be normal on that a year of our\nThat's it well it depends on\nIf the modules have gone to sleep or not or when they're testing it but are you saying we like under fifty ... you know once everything's is late to be honest with you we just had a Chrysler ah\nIn this week that was six hundred and fifty million ... never went to a sliver was asleep today that would kill the battery dead I mean dead dead and what we found is uh the after markets stereo what's causing the problem um I doubt that's with your jeep because I'm sure it's got the factory stereo when it does\nGive us a little bit more leeway on some of these over option vehicles you know sixty Seventy ... maybe but not up in the hundred and thirty where you're\nAt now you get you get over Seventy Milly am saying and and if it's three days or so that the battery will be dead on the car for sure so okay so early\nSo now it's time to start pulling fuses and find out what's causing the\nCorrect well the first thing you need to do though is make sure that all the models are actually going to sleep on the vehicle\nSo how would I Do that\n[laughter] this is going to have to bring it in 'cause it takes a special equipment to find that out yeah yeah yeah it's one of those things but the the\n[noise] you you could start pulling views and find a circuit that is actually doing it that that will help narrow it down if you like 'em but uh yeah ... it's a process for sure\nI'm In something and and if and if that is if everything's we'll see what I'm what I'm saying to you is um when you did this test on it did it uh um had the carbon shut down for a while or was it right after you turn the car off ... ...\n... cars completely coated it in on it and turned off overnight and I went out this morning and a set up for that and of course I waited for the interior life\nIs going to close the door so he made sure all that was\nA ... life no could light on no stuff All right oh hell yeah\nWell then that yes you have something that is is continuing to draw for sure yeah so yeah it's going to have to debate because it will continue to kill the battery without unless you could probably get away with that if you drove the vehicle every day all day right but uh um if if you let it sit for two or three days yeah you're going to have a problem\nYeah okay well let us know if you can find out what it is by points of view is if not to we can help you out probably\nPerfect thank you hide British thanks for the call one day a week and be safe\nYou can buy you a great question or yeah\nAnd to some of these models on these cars and it's a tough proposition ... which one\nCan take awhile ask a question about that and you need to know what you're looking for for sure he seems like he he he got audio grabs the idea around he's doing so good\nAnd but if he tried to find and locate every module connected yeah they're all over the place and they're an every panel they put them everywhere that that is a fact yeah for sure but one scotch darn it should be able to leave your car sitting for three days and you know they'll start when you come back out\n[noise] [noise]\nYeah me a good thing I like to my truck starts when I come back out everywhere absolutely it's a good thing might be in a hurry to get away [laughter] said isn't so never know [laughter] ...\nActually we fix the [laughter] sometimes\nThere was there there was a nice customers that in that that brought her car and and and uh\nUm [noise] she had bought this vehicle [noise] it was a modest stuff and it didn't have automatic door locks didn't have electric door locks\nBad added electric door locks the easiest way to do that is to add those little or are you back to yeah to let them do their thing and ... anyway fine\nBut in the ... the other easiest way to control it remotely is with a a um an alarm set up right but the alarm thing was going haywire kept going on so I told her I said well\nWe can disconnect everything alarm wise on this and and when you put it'll just work the automatic door locks\nBut it was hooked up kind of funky like so it was a hard thing was that she wanted to be able to jump in the car push the button and walk on the doors because she's had heard her girlfriend when they were in high school got chased one time okay so\nIt's not funny but an experience and somebody has an ... that they want a grain and then well yeah well um but the funny thing was this was\nSo it's not funny but an experience and somebody has it it it that they want a grain do them well yeah well um but the funny thing with this was\nIf you're close the door the ... the button wouldn't work a whole I said you're gonna be yes has yet to yeah to open the door hop in push the button locked doors and inflamed the drivers are alright well she'll get that returned out we got down to take it out but the other part was we had to read disconnect was\nIf you are when you did this\nThe only part that was still connected with the lights that plastic right that mark her life that flashed when you unlocked the lock that they\nWell the alarm thought that it would so it would it would that would last for like a a minute and a half hour to drive in Iraq [laughter] I said well you're just going to that too yeah if we need to bypass at a system exactly exactly just finally stopped you know what those are just figuring out what what do you think\nSo I don't want this thing going off it keeps going off all time neighbors keep getting upset so they obviously that with the we got rid of all that\nEasy easy stuff there for sure\nThey'll question [noise] oh yeah I uh\nI got to come clean Brian down and I did some yesterday that I probably shouldn't have but ah it felt good [noise] [laughter]\nWhat it is you know not have\nThis gentleman combined he had this blazer and he wanted to know if his monitors if he got the last monitored runs we get a small uh and uh some talking to the guy and I've never met him and he's kind of like all over the place you know just settle down a dog walked on I checked his monitors real quick can you hadn't had his air injection monitor run yet\nSo I'm listening to the story while I'm checking that she's been dealing with this for about six months while I just got an ... probably didn't want to spend the money to have it fixed so he tries clearing is codes all the time driving adjusted enough to get to all the monitors to run except for the event and tried to get somebody to small get\n... back up so you have a problem right and they always causes like come on\nUh-huh so he's trying to show you always clear just coach uh-huh tries to try to drive cycle [noise] to get everything Iran\nExcept for ... and then quickly get a small ... and then the next time next trip evaporated comes out but I'm listening to the story is six months she's been chasing this chasing as well it's a Chevrolet is air injection monitor hasn't run\nParental I'm Sorry she still got to get this air injection monitor on he was like I just keep battling and balance them just like why don't you fix the that's why I say I want you to pay somebody fix the problem was that was a longer story that I I just didn't have the heart to tell him\nThat he can go over to the referee center on because you know they have a problem with those air injection monitors running and and if all the other monitors are satisfied the referee sometimes can deal with the injection monitor that will not run on the show really just couldn't bring myself to say and\nThat so sick on that are [laughter]\nWell and it's an amazing thing and it's letting emissions out there yeah so that's the ... you know what\nYou're listening to this whole story about how he's trying to circumvent the system I just ... my lip that otherwise I could explain to somebody in great detail that everything else is fixed in is fine we just got this last little hurdle get over the referee can help you out yeah\nBut you know one for his own circumvent the system and those systems are on the car to for the question about it so it everybody else's play everybody else pleased by the rules so extra car he drove away and I was just like you know or contrary in some people's belief\nWe we do what we do to fix cars properly yes so that they operate the way they should not to circumvent the system or not just to get your car smog there right things like that you know so yeah\nBut now if you everything's pass\nOn your car and you have a car to the event of monitors hard to run and you can then smog it and that's the law that's fine but it's not because you have a problem right off monitor\nAnd that's why during ... right now all the monitor satisfied except for ... but uh yeah I just drove away and I'm like you know I probably could have told me I said you know it's probably best you know\nWhat kind of car was this show trailblazer transit fix a car that's kind of what I what were the ... are on it\nOh I didn't even get that far I was just\nThat when he drove away I'm like wow you know what I'm not really going to regret that [laughter] could've helped him out was you know the way he was doing trying to do an end run I should just let him keep running yeah just keep going six months of dealing with this instead of fixing it yeah everybody else place by the rules he didn't so he didn't get that one little piece of information from if\nHe's listening today he'll go over the referee I doubt it yeah on a worse\nTime folks one eight hundred and seven six okay up and be the one eight hundred seven six zero five three six to winning the automotive related otherwise you got to listen to me a damn keep talking to each other so\nIf anybody out there hello gosh I come back and what happens Justin you want to call the show and make sure the phone lines do word [laughter]\nIt's got the a pillar date set up on them right there to the left or the driver yes\nOkay gotcha yeah yeah that's easy enough to diagnose and figure out what's going on there and if they gave her place to gauge or you know there are available for sure\nOK yeah one less thing it is their stuff you get that will make it to get better mileage\nDepends on the mileage that you're getting [laughter]\n[laughter] well what I'm saying is if it's running properly and dialed in and and you know I mean you get I mean there there there is a bank systems available for them they say get a little more power in in my ... um the best thing for those is just making sure that that everything's working and operating properly and then that's probably about the best deal mild you'll get\nYou're not tied you're leaning towards a tune earning already be\nNo I don't yeah don't do that 'cause I Love those love to take transmission

F. and be as one eight hundred seven six zero\nFive three six do what's your age I think we start up a show would be market volatility that we're having kind of scary and some people and uh I don't think it's going to stop on Monday\nI don't think so either I mean it it it's been on say it's been a wild ride it seems like it's been a wild ride but you know again what we talked about was we did have some volatility back in February that was pretty short lived\nTo thousands Seventeen really ... two thousand sixteen was pretty quiet I Believe it was two thousand Fifteen was the China scare and the beginning of two thousand sixteen was kind of the oil scare and we had that drawdown is oil was kind of moving in la boxed up\nYeah and the beginning of two thousand sixteen was kind of the oil scare and we had that drawdown has oil is kind of moving in la lockstep with the stock market\nThing too is that these are the votes how he seems bigger than it is because oh my gosh I'm firemen and point drop well back when the when the Dow was you know five or six thousand you had a fifty point drop no one really blinked about it because fifty points no big deal but now we're at twenty five thousand points\nSo vibrant point drop is not really big deal when you compare it to the numbers are looking for a one percent a movement sometimes and\nIt's just like oh it's terrible and this is actually the norm\nNot the regulators\nYeah and I I don't like quoting things in place I mean it just\nIt's hard to understand it's like as you said it makes it seem a lot worse if I go down eight hundred points out my gosh that's a big number\nAnd it's really relative I mean yes it's still a big decline when you look at the percentage wise as well\nBut I I think it helps you understand long look at the percentage change rather than the points and then you have the S. and P. oh my gosh that was down forty seven points well that's not as bad as the Dow being down three hundred points right well actually the Dow being down three hundred points was better than the forty seven\nWhen the industry's up twenty nine point for uh I Do see the current ratio is one point one same as the industry but\nTold that the equity one thousand two hundred and sixty nine versus foreign forty six I'm Wondering I think they now carry maybe allow their own credit perhaps I Would I Would hate to see on people have that much debt but you have to understand do they carry you know there are ... and I'd be comfortable with the debt when they\nDon't have those credit cards and so forth maybe on a credit card to themselves\nA mom maybe not because now I'm looking at the return on equity is three hundred and sixty eight percent versus a hundred sixty fours that tells me that was in a balance sheet they probably have very low equity\nNet profit margin nine point eight versus seven point eight receiver ... forty eight same as the industry in image or turn over five point one there's a four point for salon numbers here that really need to be checked chased wants to share the news with us going\nForward for I get to the earnings I'd want to talk about that balance sheet a little bit I Do believe they borrowed money to kind of buyback stock\n[noise] I Know they I Know they bought back last stock and it it might not be direct kill we borrow the money by backed stock\nBut I Know they borrow money and they bought back a lot of stock\nWhich when you buy back stock it reduces your equity and of course if you're increasing that well that's going to increase your debt to equity so that could be problematic especially if the stock price continues to be pressured because what Home Depot was doing was they were borrowing money to buy expensive\nStock ... when companies do that that's the worst thing they can do and you ask yourself ... don't borrow money to buy an expensive stock I mean even your own\nAfter that so I think that could have been problematic and I look at the bounty where you're coming yeah 'cause I Do wonder as well\nWhen they um do carry those Super Bowl is I mean they do have some higher and things where I Wonder if they have you know twelve months same as a famous cash kind those types of things I Wonder if they carry that financing that's one thing I Would look into Paul to understand that balance sheet a little bit more 'cause that could be [noise]\nMake it look a little bit better when you look at it that way current price so as a hundred and Seventy two dollars and twenty three sense it is well officer chewy ... two hundred and Fifteen dollars and forty three cents between glows hundred and sixty dollars and fifty three cents so has slightly recovered from that fifty two week low\nTo look up to January two thousand twenty the estimated ... ... basis\nTen dollars and twenty seven cents what goes to target cell price of a hundred and sixty nine dollars and forty six cents so Phil enforcement below that current price I think there are a lot better housing plays out there that aren't as expensive and we said home depots inexpensive for a long time\nEven with this pullback I feel a little pricey I'm not intrigued at this current level yet a into\nThings to wondering about Home Depot and this is kind of personal things I'm I'm a veteran iguana lows that they check my service state and so forth fine Home Depot maker so bit difficult oh you've got to have your service cart I was in the service like forty years ago like I got my service guarded just irritates me sometimes they're not\nGoing to say I'd be careful because I Know maybe some home maybe it was just that person because we did get a\nNot a complaint but an enlightenment from a listener that said it was actually not one person because I I I've been there three times I'll say no we got a ... same store or same store so I mean how in management there so it would be okay so maybe maybe maybe somebody else will be different listeners gotta gotta\nAnd it has the same store or same store\nSo I mean how would management there so it'd be okay so maybe maybe maybe somebody else will be if they are listening I got a kind of effect or jak I'll just put that away and it's kind of personally but I Do look at the bounty and this is is not good uh back in two thousand fourteen had fourteen point seven billion dollars in debt\nDoubled to twenty seven billion dollars and whatever I really do not like to see as their equity a back into the un fourteen twelve point five billion\nIs now shrunk to one point for buying it could be right there probably are buying back stock which can hurt that but still that kinda worries me and again I I I think Home Depot is a great company but I Do not question the value of that fair trade act So Paul I got the ... we talk so much about it or do you hold are looking at buying it\nBy ... and all that now\nYeah I I I I just can't get excited about it and and uh I Do stop and as you can tell sometimes but I Would not buy the stock and I did look at the cash a statement they did buy back about seven point seven billion dollars worth of stock last year so far this year they bought back about three billion so they are on aggressive buyback but it's just\nAnd then went back expensive last year the fence of yeah not a good good management move around thank Adam [noise] so probably would not say by
