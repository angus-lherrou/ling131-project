D. Vance author hillbilly elegy as well for a melting pot or civil war a son of immigrants makes the case against open borders ... Lama joins is the author of melting pot or civil war some immigrants makes the case against open borders right on welcome to the\nProgram thanks for having me\nWhen you're getting a lot of attention for this book I'm Glad because this is a topic we cover a lot what ... what made you write the book\n[noise] honestly I just became so alarmed by\nThe rancor assess of our political discourse and how much it seemed as though people were talking past each other when they talk about immigration you have this tremendous self righteousness on one side and on the other side you have people who seem as though they're demonizing immigrants and immigration and I just couldn't recognize myself in that conversation so I wanted to add some common sense\nYou know it's funny things about political science a lot ... that was my you know feel in school when my youngest is taking all those classes and\nYou know you take political three classes and they're all about you know the different political system I don't want to have a political theory class it's all about how to whip up mobs and how to get them on whipped up because it seems like the the tenor of the conversation is just shouting at each other\n[laughter] there is a lot of truth to that\nA whipping up fear and anger is a great strategy a politically in the short term it's a very dangerous strategy if you want a free society and I guess my view is that when it comes to immigration you need some kind of balanced sensible\nMiddle ground position that he's going to allow us to go forward in a world that's changing because of automation and globalization and much else that's why I Believe we need controlled\nManaged immigration that in the national interest\nWell it hasn't been controlled or managed for quite a few decades and is that how we ended up in a situation where you you press one for Spanish and people are worried waving Mexican flag that the u._s. sporting events\nYou know I mean unfortunately I Do think that people are assimilating but they're assimilating into very different ways there are some people who are assimilated into the mainstream but there are other people who are assimilating into marginalized\nSegregated communities where they're cut off from the mainstream and that builds a lot of resentment and I think that that's going to become a bigger problem in the future even than it is a president and it's already a problem\nOr why do you think it's happening like that\n[noise] well the big picture is that\nThe whole global economy the world is very different now than it was one hundred years ago one hundred years ago you had a large amount of immigration but you had a large amount of immigration in society that did not have a welfare state number one certainly not on the scale of what we have today but also it was a society where there was a premium on ... on that is\nPeople could do back breaking labor and then somehow climb their way into the middle class that's much harder now because you know again we have machines we have off shoring we have all of these other alternatives to that kind of labor and what that means is that low skill labor is just much tougher position in America today than was the case a century ago\nExpound on the idea of the welfare state and how that plays a role in this 'cause it's always seemed to me that this would be self limiting if we didn't have the welfare state you wouldn't you wouldn't show up to a country where you are not going to uh you know be able to feed yourself get medical care if you can find a job\n[noise] it really is true a hundred years ago when you look at that big wave of immigration that came to United States a huge number of those folks actually went back\nTo their native countries and the reason they went back there are lots of reasons but one reason is that hey if you found that it was a real struggle to support yourself and to support your loved ones you might have decided to pack it up and go back home now in contrast we had a very different perspective we say\nOkay we want to lift every one up we want to invest in people's kids if\nThey don't earn enough for themselves we provide them with food stamps and Medicaid as you alluded to that and much else and those programs they're not free they're not cheap we subsidize people's wages with the earned income tax credit and and you know refundable portion of the child credit because we're saying hey you're not able to earn enough to lead a decent\nLife so the government is going to step in and under those conditions immigration is a very different story\nWell I I've found intriguing the uh the argument your book about the middle class who's who's in the middle class who can rise in the middle class locking people out in the middle class can you explain them for folks who haven't read the book what you're talking about there\n[noise] there are all sorts of ways in which our society has made it really tough for people whether you're native or foreign born to enter the middle class [laughter] think about how expensive housing is in some of our bigger cities or think of\nHow expensive is to get a ... a college education and much else you know those are really big barriers and it's kind of lie I fear that our society is more divided in class terms\nAm seven sixty talk and breaking news [noise]\nChicago was scams that more than eleven thousand dollars via Bruce Springsteen impersonator she met online scams can be tricky but one way to tell that someone is not the real Bruce Springsteen is that he asked to borrow eleven found [laughter]\nThen we never did that story last week so this woman got pets by she thought it was Bruce Springsteen and he said I'm going through divorce right now and all my money tied up but I I I really need eleven thousand dollars to come to visit you and everything wow this woman sent who she thought was Bruce Springsteen eleven okay\nWow [laughter] wow what do you do for someone like that you can't help someone like that Kenya will\nNot let him go on line I mean seriously somebody who would fall for that lacks the capacity I mean they're like a blind person you can you can yell at them all day long no no no you\nNeed the object but it's not going to help she's got a blindness it's not much crazier though then remember the story I told from the quite the NATO biography\nWhere just random woman called him up got his phone number somehow said she could get him and his ex girlfriend back together but you need to come to New York and have sex with me and he sort of wool okay All right [laughter]\nYou know and how slow hand slow burn [laughter]\nHey President Trump is doing a is taking questions from reporters right now now he's hot to try about this um an agreement\nThat he got with Mexico and Canada and they tried to ask them Kavanaugh questions he said no no no I Want to talk about this which I don't blame him I don't think that the dodge he's had this huge when economic weigh in on something he's been working on for a long time and it's what this is what he cares about more than anything\nSo I understand him only want to take questions I had but he did say you might take some Kevin on questions at the end so if he does with maybe we'll bring those to you\nKnow we're all in on that we are All right fabulous great so hey ah back to the subject of of men and women and love and the rest of it as I mentioned very early in the show this morning I officiated a wedding\nYesterday uh absolutely lovely kind of ...\nPlay kind of a traditional American Christian e type of wedding like this is what I'm picturing or are you sacrificed or anything or oh no no\nNo animal sacrifice it was actually I've done president it was out in [laughter]\nSo it was brand just behind the scenes um it was it a a woodland setting\nA it was not far from the uh the heavily armed getting compound in the woods\nAnd I'm ... and it it was nice I mean the the bride and groom could not be better people are really fond of them I'm a listeners to the show by the way lots and lots of fags there at the wedding um but the friends of Armstrong and getting it correct yeah I'm\nA great family too I mean Judy and I so hit it off with a bunch of family members and friends and stuff it just it was funny it was like wait these are my people these are people I like I'm comfortable with 'em and I felt that before I started drinking so it wasn't that um and I thought well how do you\nIs there some can there be some sort of website designed for like just meeting people you connect with the eye to eye with I guess that's what clubs in churches and stuff for for um\nUh but it was it was funny just to be a mix among a bunch of people we felt completely comfortable with almost immediately so that was cool I'm In and I like doing it I've done a couple two three uh weddings and uh I have a a a lovely screen that I uh you know changing improvise a little bit\nI'm about ... marriage and and we're happy marriages and and that sort of thing because you know anybody who doesn't understand if the marriage not the wedding\n... can nice nice wedding and you're fine for that's all you're just going to make sure you get everything\nWill be very expensive you know expensive of course exactly location insurers so long happy marriage\nThe more ice sculptures at your wedding I'm so laundry or be married food is hugely important\nTo whether or not the wedding is going to be the marriage is going to be ...\nOh yeah yeah yeah you argue\nThat did just spend a lot of time on the eighth each other and\nWhat's more important to each of your mom's hate the other [laughter] is that the key you serve pork in the jury year wedding you'll be divorced by the end of the night so anyway that was very nice and I I enjoy doing it but I don't want to do it a lot um because\nIt was saying is you will marry anyone and so they should tax to support when oil or nine five gay over my or my or they're willing to\nLet me finish my thought jak in in this may be self limited because I have an idea so I don't want to do it all the time 'cause it's it's time consuming and I get nervous because\nIt's such an important day for the bride and groom especially with the families and everything and\nAnd I'm like oh please don't screw this up please don't screw this up please don't be the joke that everybody has for the rest of their lives and do you remember that idiot her dearly visual so ... and I got to put on a suit and everything so I don't want to do\nAll you both and and you know what I did for the first time I think\nIn a decade to shave or were you a bearded efficient of beer to ... I think it makes me look more fatherly [laughter] anyway um uh I did something I have not done in a decade\nWould you like to guess what that is the editor John ... deodorant Michael good guess no that's not correct Shawna guests sprint a quarter mile [laughter] place was there a bear [laughter] well then you have your answer no I button the top button\nIn my shirt and kept it buttoned first time in a decade I hate that\nI never do that I don't like things touching my neck [laughter]\nI Know that about me usually I just kind of leave the top one on button but since the tie up enough that it looks like a button but anyway so I don't look\nPhysical difference in that or is this just a mental thing of I'm not a top button guy\nOh no no that that would make you where do I on correct sized shirts [laughter] my weight tends to fluctuate jak as your your your turn purple [laughter]\nExactly [laughter] when it cut off my airway I Know wow I Need to buy a bigger shut up but so anyway of I've decided how the limited because I Will marry folks if they're interested um flashed desperate uh\nI get\nOne percent of your firstborn child earnings wow that's a for the entire life [laughter]\nYou know just keep it in the back of your mind maybe you're not even going to have kids none of my business but if you do if if the fruits of your loan leans emerges from the marriage I think the five [laughter] I get one percent of the kids are next so this was in addition to 'cause I Know you kiss the bride first that larger thing\nFirst I Will consider venue cancer you know you know what it's nerve wracking is you're you're there like you know as the efficient and the bride and groom are right next to you\nI mean you could reach out and touch each one of them with your elbows and everybody's staring at you know oh yeah and\nIn the bride\nOr in this case the these fabulous Becca um\nIt you know it's it's a huge state for the girls who obviously but the pride is really invested in the planning of it in in the press and who's going to stand where and the rest of it anybody who's ever married ... gotten married noses I'm\n... and she's like a foot and a half from me and it's like doing like the most critical thing involved in your job with your boss literally at your elbow and it's just a psycho don't screw this up don't screw this up she's going to be so mad if you screw this up don't screw this up so just to nerve wracking\nAnd they care so much about how they the the when the women's day which is fine but they're you know what you're wearing who's standing where all that sort of the guys just don't care at all\n[noise] no either because it doesn't strike as ... ... them as important yeah frequently there are so GD nervous they they if they would they wouldn't know you know you could have a six hundred pound gorilla wander in and sit in the front row and they've never noticed that that's a wedding\nDid you have anything to drink before he did this oh no no no no no see aren't like Kavanaugh stumbling around slurring her words [laughter]\n... God hey hey look at those bridesmaids to look at 'em hey hey we're in the middle of the ceremony mess now that there was none of that\nThings got a little festive later in the evening though\nMan they're mixing up some really good cocktails and plenty of wine at dinner and yummy ... that was fun so\nTrump's during this press conference on trade he's gotten into the cabin on questions he tried to shut down a woman asking a question and been so they're off into the questions about cabin on the scope of the FBI investigation so we can bring you a little bit of this when we come\nBack [noise] and yeah yeah yeah you know if you're not willing as a Trump fan to admit that keep punches down and distracts themselves [noise]\nKind of nasty when he doesn't need to be there's something wrong with you and if you can't admit that he seems to be doing a hell of a good job crafting trade agreements or something wrong with true\nTrue I'm so we'll bring you that when we come see the Armstrong and gives you shine catty conscience nation\nThe um seven sixty KF MB you're thinking about selling your San Diego area home you need to call our friend Dan beer of the beer home team they do what works and don't do what doesn't work for instance somebody just put an unrealistic price on the home the home sets home serves as a way to gather future leaders but it does not sell Dan beer is not going to do that\nYeah he uses method that do work that way he can have that guarantee that they will sell your home at one hundred percent of its asking price small terms apply ask for program details\nBy granting them an indefinite delay we'd given the FBI plenty of time to do what they need to do but I Will not let this stretch on for ever question\nKind of feel like I Need to skip ahead 'cause I'm looking ahead like eight minutes answer you are following this looks like there's some good stuff come up a little bit yeah I was on a fast forward ahead a little bit here the old on hold on I don't know if I can find it it just the right spot\nGoing to go back about a minute in order to write spot right there [laughter] check this out here we go go ahead Michael\nJordan I spent a good thing is now the press finally get to that now they'll finally treat me fairly they got worse and worse now than ever below go but that's okay I thought I was going to use that word because of the fact that we made a deal with Mexico\n[laughter] really happening by\nTrump him over there we go\nNow to thinking about how they're going to be next year and I I didn't know what you're talking go ahead\nI have two questions about judge Kavanaugh first there are now concerned that he may have lied or Medicare tried his drinking while testifying if they find that he did do you think that bars him from being here Supreme Court nominee\nWhile I watch I watched him I was surprised at how\nVocally was about the fact that he likes beer\nAnd he's had a little bit of difficulty I mean he talked about things that happened when he drank I mean this to this is not a man that said that alcohol was absurd that he was perfect with respect to alcohol though I thought he was actually\nGoing back so many years I thought he was a\nExcellent the interesting thing is though nobody asked them about what's happening in the last twenty five thirty years during his professional career because I there are no bad reports I mean there are bad reports on everybody in here\nMost of the people sitting down there ... except for my ... [laughter]\nWe find one on him that um I think that's that's going to be that'll be the greatest shock of also\nReports don't everybody I'm looking at people I'm sort of\nLook at some of these people asking the question okay look at Blumenthal he lied about Vietnam he didn't just say hey I went to Vietnam snow for Fifteen Years you said he was a war hero he fought in Da Nang profits we call them ... Richard down on that that's not sure I'd done that he\nLeaned too heavily on a Vietnam Era Mr President sir you're he'll start hurting\n[laughter] to Vietnam\nAnd he's up there saying we need honesty and we need integrity this guy lives when he was the attorney general's Connecticut she lived\nI don't mean a little bit and then when he got out he actually dropped out of the race and they want anyway because Democrats are always went in Connecticut one very close probably the closest ever [noise] but he's got ... and now he's up there talking like he's holier than thou you know what take a look at his record and when he got out\nAnd we apologize she was crying to tears were all over the place and that we actually like how dare you take a look\nAt the judge who has led an exemplary life [noise]\nI mean you go back to high school because he had beer I said the judge has been a\nPretty amazing about describing his situation with alcohol and with beer [noise]\nOr we take a look at Cory Booker here in Newark New Jersey into the ground he was a horrible in there and he made statements that when he was in high school or college what he was doing he actually made the statement and now he's talking about judge Kavanaugh and I could go to a whole list of ...\nWhere he goes there does me from always goes there\nYet doesn't mind a bloody liberal or a minister and one\nBoy now so I'm a little bit ago he did say that the FBI could good to do a thorough investigation that that seemed pretty unequivocal the me other than the length of time right which I suppose will still be criticized\nWell yeah of course and and I get legitimately so because you know that's a serious limitation on an investigation but I I completely understand why they have to do that\nHave to do that I find it interesting that in response to the question of if judge\nKavanaugh was as a reporter was saying was lying about the periphery the periphery of what they are discussing that reason enough to not further him forward it just goes there's no everybody lives you know it's true but that's an interesting response\nI don't know what else we're thing was pants Jeff censored and what am I find out

interested in going when they give us\nHighs and I'm a U.S today only headline on that unfortunately\nIs that a woman has won the Nobel Prize for physics [noise] first time and fifty\nFive years a woman has won every headline about her being a woman every question to answer about being a woman\nWhich I think you you you perceive as doing good for woman kind where I got to believe she's thinking I dedicated\nMy entire life to figuring something out nobody else would ever figured out if I were a man you'd be discussing what I figured out but because world mom a woman we're discussing the fact that I'm a one isn't it wonderful that you're a girl and you got a prize\nYeah we're in a professional conference not too long ago where that happened there was a leading woman in the radio industry instead of asking are about\nYou know what she thought about this that and the other in radio they're asking you about being a woman\nIn that position and is it\nWas [noise] I think that gives you a lawful laced effort into buying woke or something I think that's just awful it's all about how she's a woman ... what did you think could you believe a woman can you believe it's been ... do you know how many women have won I rode along in her house\nUh she uses they use lasers this tweezers to like pick up I'd Adams or viruses or what yeah although although they claim that she demonstrated that use by using a hair dryer and a tennis ball which\nI could do so I'm not sure ah I I don't think there has ever been a Nobel Prize in physics that I understood force either if I could understand that it's not that good it's not groundbreaking right exactly right optical tweezers\nSony like heat the piece of rubber so it's more ... you know something like that I could get that oh I get it\nBecause like when it's cold and frozen stuff and now that it's hot it's bending\nUh-huh that but that probably wouldn't win the prize would\nMailbag\n\nGlazer tweezers [noise]\nWell first of all I'm very

English teachers extremely walk they don't use over headlights because they cause aggression\nHe has a special non aggressive purple lamb but they use them class he also uses a lot of essential oils to make the classroom calm in a special Noyes lives fan to walk them through the class you're kidding me I Am not they read only walk literature and catch suddenly the classics because they are ethnocentric or something ah\nAnd she describes and physically I don't think there's any point to that last week my daughter and her friends did it skipped the premise was that my daughter went to this delicious taco truck we haven't down her friend who was a taco truck employee but she spoke Spanish to take the order my daughter then used or Spanish one Spanish to try to order tacos she said things like el asked me ...\nWhich is ah what does that mean um who is my father who's your dad I write and dum de ... where's the bathroom\nBecause she loves the kids all laugh with the English teacher pulled the two girls aside and told them it was a racist skip the Hillary's pardon my daughter's friend is a freaking dreamer she's a fair skinned Mexican who speaks super a perfect English\nEnglish teacher told them Mexican kid that speaking Spanish in the ... was racist I'm Still a little fuzzy on my English terms but I think that might be irony [laughter]\n\nOh that's great you people are so twisted in knots below go\nRight and you say that because we did a deal with Mexico [laughter] I should probably pay\nTo solve since I brought it up this this this that was the worst\nUpdate on major league baseball you pass we ever have on any radio it's hard to imagine who that served as the Yankees play one game a\nWinner take all game yesterday right in the eighties [laughter] no not against the against the Rockies in one winning the division one game playoff going again gave the rock I'm Sorry the Dodgers the Dodgers played the Rockies to win the division [laughter]\nWhy one game playoff update isn't much better than the last one I didn't bring up the Yankees the AIDS play the Yankees that's a different thing tomorrow night right but they'd be Dodgers are the\nDivision champion but there was a one game playoff winner take all for for a teen in our in our listening audience who was it and we had no idea the doctor okay the Dodgers just trying to clarify but how did we not know that\nI did I not know that this is why I turned to mark his sport 'cause I only sports really\nWhere we really don't know [noise] ought to be aware of that I should have been aware of that well All right then\nBeen thinking about your guest today and the civil war or the or the or what was the name of that book again the or the or the son of an immigrant thing yes civil war melting pot right melting pot it right okay Dodgers Yankees uh been thinking of your about your guest today suicide of the west other discussions in recent media\nWere asking what's the source of our current tribalism why not and why now not in earlier generations uh than our our correspondent um mentions a world wars and our brought everybody together and and serving together helped and\nUh the question as to your guest today was what would start a civil war what would that look like one scenario has been hinted at in that state's wanting to leave the union we've already seen those cracks forming\nAs more people who disagree with one party rule of their state follow the Atlas Shrugged playbook and moved to states more in line with their politics we'll likely see greater polarization of the states\nLeft these get left ear and conservatives get conserve ear [laughter] and with the ... foreign gasoline on the fire and pumping the ... the flames seems only like a ... a matter of time before we're calling for ... odd sweet media of death\nBoy that's not hard to imagine if you had a um a bunch of people a gathering a state with the Texas attitude with a bunch of people gathering and stayed with the California attitude you couldn't you couldn't picture skirmishes on the border\nI suppose or just one succeeding although God I'd I don't think anything would they

I think I read that then I heard on CNN this morning that he started the bar fight so I have no freaking idea and again as I said earlier today do you have anything that's less than Thirty Years' old anything anything at all so\nI don't seem to ... billion bar fights only one that the cops ever ended up yet although I didn't go to Yale maybe they are\nYeah have a different tolerance oh yeah I'm In the the cops now and again it Illinois if some of the big bars of fracas would begin but they're hanging around wearing the owner of a scrape up the blood and get the music going and sort of a ... she can actually getting drunk [laughter] I'm trying to get like a you know we don't really have time for this but I Will tell you this ms Mitchell\nThe sex crimes investigator who was hired by the Republicans to do the questioning as questioning at the hearing it incredibly slow pace has unleashed to report to the committee and I've heard of characterized in various ways in by the mainstream media but I actually delved into it and starting to read it\nShe lays out that the timeline changed every time Dr Ford talked about it this is not the most compelling stuff to me uh the mid eighties became the early eighties and back to the mid eighties she was in her early teens then she was in her late teens\nAnd she crossed out early in the early eighties and the statement for polygraph report that was never explained um and so the timeline keeps shifting\nAnd keeps shifting oh she alleges she struggled academically in college but it's never made any similar claim about her last two years of high school which were immediately after the event that you know that could be the vagaries of human psychology I don't find that all that compelling\nUm and then the part that I thought was really curious was Mitchell explains that Ford's inability to remember where the house where the event took place raises significant questions as those or inability to remember how she got back from the party door house\nAnd this is from ... Mitchell Lee investigator she told the Washington Post that the party took place more than seven miles from childhood home that it was roughly a twenty minute drive from my childhood home\nShe also great for the first time in her testimony that she was driven somewhere that night either to the party or from the part of your both but she has no memory of who drove over or when nor does anyone come forward to identify him or herself as the driver\nGiven that all this took place before cell phones arranging a ride home would not have been easy indeed she said that you ran out of the house after coming downstairs and did not state that she made a phone call from the house before she did or that she called anyone else asked thereafter Dr Ford testified that her friend Leland apparently the only other girl at the party did not follow up with Dr\nFord after party death 'cause she has suddenly disappeared\nAnd she goes into detail how in the world that you get home and how can she has

I guess\n... what is the big takeaway from the interview Andrew\nOkay take away is that it was bizarre it didn't make sense we shouldn't I mean we we should not see this as a credible allegation in my in my opinion I think I think that um\nYou know I I I and a lot of people now obviously if we've we've tried to keep it up as open in mind as possible that a lot of these things you know um I I I think that Dr Blass before had pretty credible testimony\nBefore the Supreme Court before the Senate Judiciary committee last week I think miss a allegation from Julie sweat it does not help her case I think that she\nUm you know I I I have a hard time escaping the conclusion that she's\nEither lying or there's something not right going on there because uh it is exactly like what you guys were just saying I mean it just doesn't stand up under the slightest pressure because I mean this this NBC interview with not a hard hitting interview you know the interviewer was not trying to trick\nJulie sweating it up at all and yet it seemed to every question she she you know somehow managed\nTo cast doubt on her own story\nDid she have the creepy ... by her son\nUh he was not he was not there with her during the interview but that's the way I it's interesting you bring up because he is as I Am I as I watched this thing unfold the thought that kept occurring to me was wow that you know I could almost to believe\nThat this ... this lady was like some sort of false flag some sort of person who had been paid by the Republicans who\nAre trying to bring forward a dislike clearly not believable allegation against Brett Kavanaugh but we know that's not the case because this woman is being represented by this guy who is you know trying to use this\nThis allegation in order to

that some people who are kind of barely paying attention will just kind of makes it all together in one load of horse ass right because this woman so unbelievable\nRight right I mean yeah it's a it's a very real possibility it certainly doesn't help Dr ... here's what I\nMean you you know she she fell apart and a million different ways last night but here I think is the crux of the thing is that I

OJ over net neutrality\nShore so on Sunday night a governor Jerry Brown signed the toughest statement neutrality law um that uh you know has ever been written in the United states\nUm it was designed to replace a and supersede the FCC's own neutrality regulations which the SEC voted to roll back last year and officially did that uh got that on the books this year\nUm and uh the Justice Department within about an hour of the bills being signed um a filed a lawsuit to try and block California from actually moving forward with its legislation\nDoes Jerry Brown understand the Internet is it like there is no check points of the state lines\n[noise] well that's a great question I have not spoken to the governor myself so I couldn't speak to a\nTo his understanding of Internet technology but the argument here um you know is that uh the that California and try to set up um a state level version of the net neutrality rules\nUm is a is violating the constitution because the federal government typically takes precedence I'm ... in these sorts of issues\nFor pretty good reasons or just because it would be chaos for companies if they had fifty different sets of regulations are okay and this will probably drag on for many weeks and months right this battle\nAbsolutely and you know this is also happening just as where uh you know we've got at least two or three other a law suits going on net neutrality at the same time and these are all kind of it are related so it'll be a really interesting to see how um you know all of this litigation plays out\nBrian Fung the Washington Post hey Brian thanks a million well done my pleasure\nGood to talk to you this reminds me a lot of bin ... greed or before the Judiciary Committee talking about the courts have to do all this now because Congress passes these incredibly vague laws empowers agencies to do what's necessary now we're done and then it all gets bought out in the courts because the\nLegislature will do its job and it tries to do way too much so Jerry Brown thinks he can treat the Internet the way they treat bananas up in Truckee me new legal Netflix downloads bringing into the state no\nJust coming back from a
