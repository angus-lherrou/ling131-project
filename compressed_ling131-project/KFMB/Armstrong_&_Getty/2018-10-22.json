is why I Am good at quite a few different things and very good at nothing\nIs that is sad reality that's probably why I'm that way also you know I can I can get competed at it kind of competed and a lot of things really quickly but being really good at it and you get sick of it and that's always been one of the most amazing things to me to get really good at it\nAs that way with golf eventually ah any musical instruments or lots of different things I just think\nWow you want to do that all day yeah I admire it yeah I just yeah yeah\nI don't know if it's a strength or weakness it's almost

B. A. V. he's the guy\nThat runs the U. S. E. as a lot of a lot of initials wasn't into an I Try to overhear yes the United Arab Emirates\nNBC is hard core look Iran's gonna is going to the beat us down\nAnd not just like they'll have the it they're going to eliminate us that's what they're trying to do can I saw\nIt on mute cetera NBC has been on that train for a long time NBC hated the Obama administration making the nuclear deal with Iran look you don't understand what these guys are up to ... sort of like Nazis they want to take over this region of the world and destroy yourself like kill us right\nI'm Israel's vote on that too and ... got NBS his ear early on as MB NBS was climbing the ladder there in Saudi Arabia is MBA [laughter]\n\nThey joined the n._r._a. turned to NBC [laughter] so in ... started the sitcom and got on TV shows the [laughter] ... the New Yorker yeah these are the ABCs of the right so and they claim is\nShould they ever get the weapons that we're all worried about them getting we are going to be the first targets oh yeah they're yeah they're going to kill us they're going to as NBC and M. S. N. B. S. and\nJared Kushner believe Iran is out to destroy everybody that's not them and take over which they are I think that what you're saying and so NBC spent millions of dollars in op eds in lobbying in the United states for these puff pieces about him BS that made us all believe\nHe's been coming Gorbachev job gundy of the middle east told ... spent so much money influencing the country that we all had the point of view whether it was Washington Post pieces or that sixty minutes apiece and got an Obama's ear and everything\nLike that because he knew my boy am NBS was on my side against Iran who is blowing the whistle\nOld man could show me yeah well so they hate the Muslim Brotherhood a lot and busy and NBS in ... in with the Muslim Brotherhood I don't know what role that place\nI don't have any idea but the Muslim Brotherhood has the largest Islamist group in the world and and to show he was a member of them at least for a while seem to be very sympathetic to their their views of the world and um and and these guys are absolutely not\nThey also launched that war in Yemen because they believe that that is you know one of Iran's many steps toward\nTrying to take over the middle east and we're not in favor of that but you're pushing it talks to NBS all the time to time south which makes it weird on how from at least a couple of times that said there was going to be major major price to pay for this seat talking s a thesis or does he mean\nSteam released found I don't know what's coming in March of el asserts are rushing to what may be a shaggy crime scene will have the latest on that the Lakers rockets on court fight yet punching shoving fitting coming up spinning wash\nBring a vote saw [laughter] why he got to bring the bones are you ready [laughter]\nYou're listening to the Armstrong Indonesia [noise]\n[noise] I Am seven sixty chaos and we had to say\nThis is a branch will see president of will see Asset Management and also smart investing show on Saturday mornings are you concerned with the high the market maybe you're not getting the investment returns you would like at will see Asset Management we use a proven strategy for investing that delivers good returns\nMissed wow a run on I ...

we're waiting to get all the facts and figure out what's true and what's not true and what we need to do and\nI still baffled by this whole story yeah um but more on that coming up later indeed well the ah the Washington Post with us\nIs that are still intact and using floppy disc to store information so for a long time now governor that trying to get tax experts to come help out comes fix some of these agencies trouble and what we're seeing today is the Trump Administration with tents they've got a bunch of tech\nCompanies gather today to tell them to make it possible for workers to come to tours of duty in government\nNow um there there are some talk of going back to floppy disks for safety reasons but that's not the reasons some of these agencies are using floppy disks and they're just stuck on twenty five thirty year old technology\nYeah they've got some real outdated stuff first time that because they lack the expertise sometime that because they don't have the money and still other instances they lack\nThe expertise that my mom and dad have in the seventies and\nAll that and the third part is that it's hard with the lumbering federal bureaucracy to change course right you got to fill out all these forms and do all this stuff just to buy a computer much less you know put the entirety of the Pentagon on the cloud\nI so there are a lot of challenges that they trusted ministry shit and any president for that matter which case when it comes to technology and so they're hoping that the folks at\nAmazon and Facebook and Google has lent their workers to maybe more for a couple of months to a year to address some of those challenges and then go back to their old jobs\nBoy I Love that idea I I I think in the pitch for the story somebody mentioned that the you know helping vets get the appointment to the VA making that run more smoothly 'cause there are human beings if the business end what the government does and so this idea is really appealing is there any chance that happened was Tony\nWell they're already art programs and government that let workers do tours of duty there's an effort called the U.S digital service they came about under former President Obama today created after\nThe health care doctor knelt down and they've been working for a long time it just takes a look governments troubles but in this instance while there is the opportunity for workers to go help that child that dentistry shouldn't they may not want to we\nHad a lot of fight between trucks and Silicon Valley and the tech companies a lot of ... they don't want to go to support president who doesn't share their values\nAnd even even with that aside um\nYou would be doing it as a as public service 'cause I I Can't believe it's going to pay as well as if you're really good your options and the private world\nYeah I mean compare what they have in government which is what you just as the fact that at Google you're making a billion dollars basically a cafeteria free food every day you're not going to get that\nIf you're working at the department of health and Human Services that much it's certainly true but the political obstacles can be discounted

unanimous or not those Travis his name's travels and he wrote a really long email about race and racism and that sort of thing is really interesting you know I Would suggest to revert to brevity the solar with the tribes but\nOne of the ... one of my favorite parts of it he says I Believe the ah the thing the good thing about the young Elizabeth Warren deal is that she's completely decimated um\nSome of the cultural myth of race and racism by proving that anyone anywhere can claim to be any race that any time and if the smallest in Tel Aviv DNA confirms that you can be you can claim to be part of that culture or group of people\nWhich was the you know the point to South Park a parity was making there\nAnd he uses a ...\nQuote unquote Hispanic people as an example\nSpanish come ... raped and pillaged across the Americas creating a DNA subset of Native Americans and Europeans which are commonly called Hispanics Hispanic being Spain\nWhich by modern definition would make Hispanics

just get to claim to be\nI mean given ... and we're all Africans\nOne hundred percent of us if we're Americans were African Americans since all of our DNA originated God Knows how many years ago in
