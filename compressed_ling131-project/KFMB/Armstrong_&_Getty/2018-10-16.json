guess I'm just going to die [noise]\nAnd I'm absolutely correct I'm decent analysis on the climate change thing absolutely hey there's been fast on the TV we're going to talk about that coming up because he's got a new book out in which he talks about how many friends do people have now versus not very many years ago it's going the wrong direction or thousands of Facebook\nFryer so much to say

so well look for a little\nChange scenery wouldn't that be something that some of the great great growing grounded in the world for many many years yes they abandoned the crop right it'd be some so we got a lot of great so this hour to get to\nTalking about this very into the show friday I'm ... dug deep into it and wanting to bring it to ... one of the ongoing themes that we've had on the Armstrong and getting show through many years of its existence\nIs if you will get a wildly distorted view of America of Americans of the state where you live of\nJust life if you take\nIn ... ear your information by the media as opposed to real people with real interactions which is one of Ben Sasse was points I think it's funny how that that dumped pills um so I hadn't even thought of it the Lord's came out of my mouth but\nI'm ... and ... and the here's a great bit of proof of that\nAnd I love the way this article a opens its from the Atlantic which was dead to me when they got rid of Kevin Williamson but I keep the courtroom because it amuses me it opens with this on social media of the country seems to be divided into two neat camp scold them to walk and the resentment the resentful team resentment is manned by\nPeople who are predominantly old exclusively white mostly men team or because\nThese young likely to be female predominantly black brown or Asian though they're white allies do their part these teams are roughly equal in number team resentment and team walk and they disagree most vehemently and routinely you bought the catchall noticed political correctness\nWell reality is nothing like this and they describe this giant study called hidden tribes a study of America's polarized landscape that interviewed many thousands of people did a bunch of a ... hour long interviews focus groups went on for almost an entire year\nUm\nAnd it turns out there are seven distinct clusters\nIn America from progressive activists traditional liberals passive liberals the politically disengage moderates traditional conservatives and devoted conservatives about twenty five percent of Americans are traditional traditional or devoted conservatives\nAnd they say that their views are outside the American mainstream that that quarter of people some eight percent are progressive activists and their views are even less typical\nNow I'll grant you that if you live in the bay area of California for instance um ... it's more than eight percent ... if you live in Portland India it's more than eight percent I'd say but in terms of the national conversation\nThat people really driving a lot of the social justice warriors stuff is less than ten percent of Americans ... percent among the media\nOh boy if you if you include not only progressive activists in traditional liberals\nUm it's probably Ninety five percent something like that for certainly eighty five um\nThen this from the study by contrast the two thirds of Americans who don't belong to either extreme custom to an exhausted majority\nTheir members share since the fatigue with our polarized national conversation a willingness to be flexible and their political viewpoints that a lack of boys from the national conversation I think that probably sounds very familiar to a lot of you I Will point out uh however and and I do this partly because I come from a conservative point of view on some stuff\nIs that the they talk about the two extremes one is three times the size of the other\nFor what it's worth but to them to the topic of political correctness and they break that down I'm a [noise]\nIt's it's using the right nomenclature for people and issues and that sort of thing they they're talking about using the right words by political correctness expressing yourself in a way that won't get you in trouble\nEighty or Palin more solar dot com\nHere they are just the facts Dr Peter how big an east San Diego is obviously an educated man\nHe graduated from the

Meyers was not many of us get to be miraculous some of us are happy with passable [laughter]\nOh man I got some interesting stuff about ... aging an attitudes that's really good it was actually an open mind improves attitude I'm On the wrong side of it I'll tell you that I'll admit openly that I'm doing it wrong I Hope I get to passable one day that'd be great [laughter]\nWe all hope that Sean when I was a but I have any ... who's the host and so ... in the news a lot last week as as we all know\nRock Obama once said this about Kanye West river jackass that was over that whole Taylor Swift she got the word and he ran on stage then yeah Seth Meyers hosting Saturday Night live told the story\nThey anticipate ... way no that's not it it's this story\nWhere can I just I don't know if I hear\nA still a lot of people are surprised Kanye supports Donald Trump but I Am not because I haven't met Tanya a\nAnd I am incapable of being surprised by him here is a true story about Kanye West and let me preface it by saying I'm a huge tiny was fan when I was here no one did more memorable performances in Kanye West well one's on\nHe was the musical guest but we heard you wanted to do is still we pitched in a sketch where and he would enter up different award show speeches saying they made a mistake and one\nTiny that that is because I Do that [laughter]\nElse away [laughter]\nAnd we had kind of a interrupt the kids' choice award the Nobel Prize around the state fair because he was upset his pumpkin didn't win [laughter]\nA great experience but here's the thing here is the reason I Will never be surprised by Kanye West that's gas was in two thousand seven and he interrupted Taylor Swift in two thousand nine [noise]\nMine was telling you that story you thought it was based on interrupting Taylor Swift [noise]\nYeah it's about how crazy it was he interrupted speeches and then two years later he was an award show and thought I didn't do it again [noise]\nI was there anything [laughter]\nIt's weird blue and [laughter] yeah anyway it's worth pointing out he interrupted Taylor Swift to say beyond say should have one right yeah yeah yeah [laughter]\nThere's a jackass and that's how the bronco bomber respond to that\nTo further fanned the flames of this is somehow a weird like Obama didn't like Conyers sort of thing Obama was very chummy with Jay Z and Beyonce who can't also had\nA falling out with so I'm just throwing that in there because I think this was all hilarious man of falling out or Kanye and Jay Z yeah yeah that when he did his the concert I went to worry that ten minutes and then rented and walked off the stage yeah brought up about it ever call me back\nAnd yeah he won't go yeah they they had a bit of a foreign\nWhile we're doing celebrity news are you on a ... and ... David some of Saturday Night live split up I'm walking around here that are raising kids still no details on exactly what happened in their five months whirlwind courtship that one from her meeting him on the show\nI think when she was musical gas shouldn't do we have time to be talking about the sort of thing when Elizabeth Warren's Indian heritage [laughter]\nGood nations conversation gets dumber and dumber no kidding so she actually did bill like one of those twenty three me type of things to figure out how much Indian she's got an airbag grass since she apparently had been mentioning that in speeches her whole life\nAnd some time between a hundred and twenty three hundred and Seventy five years ago apparently she had an Indian forbearers right yeah which is ... ... it doesn't mean anything would be and if she hadn't it doesn't\nMean anything it would be a strange thing to be either proud of or ashamed of either one I Would say and and then in the history of the world there's been a lot of uh of\nBoth you can become a king of some country if you had that little royal blood you also could be murdered by certain groups for having that little certain kinds of blood\n... or so racist even though blood is blood and we all decided that stupid yes it's horrifying it's morally indefensible unless you're a ... a social justice warrior when you spend all day obsessing over what ethnicity somebody is and what\nKind of blood they'd gotten her fame so lives with Warren bringing up at all is just unless you just bringing up as a joke like you do the Neanderthal thing right well if you're bringing you know there has any serious some bearing on anything that's just crazy I'm a Gerald buyer fighters showed up to my neighbor's house they're having a medical problem\nAnd all the doors were locked so I'd better their front door down with my head because you're 'cause my thick thick Neanderthal skull so there's some pride there so a Gerald gonna walnut tour to it took several wax\nHow do you pronounce his first name J. E. R. Y. L.\nJournal I guess [laughter] Gerald bearer of the Weekly Standard\nTweeted if it turned out that Donald Trump had a black ends and sister six to ten generations back and he started talking about is African American heritage you tell me what the response would be wow and no kidding well said no kidding\nThe whole thing is so repugnant to me you're going to tell me people wouldn't say that's raised the [laughter]\nThat's a crazy thing\nTo say can you imagine of Dr King was with us right now and asking him what if people judged your children not on the contents of their character or even their color of their skin because you know one twenty seven of them is whatever\nAnd people judge them for good or ill on that one twenty seven of their DNA material Dr King what would you think of that he would probably punch me in the face as a committed pacifist that's how sick I find this whole thing back\nThis one less times when I have to bring it up again so Pete Davidson who has six Ariana Grande tattoos including one that says piggy smalls across his belly for their pot bellied pig and they've been together five months who got engaged after a month I think Oh yes on Ninety six thousand dollar and I'm I'm his tattoo\nArtist had told him how much he stopped getting partner stopped getting partner inspired tattoos until you're married because he had had to cover up one for ah the David girl Larry David daughter was dating the Davidson and be David\n... got ... ... per oh and so he had to cover his tattoo artist had to cover that up and started her slowly has history would turn it into an already on the ground a tattoo or something seems to me one of his courting maneuvers [laughter] yeah what they look what I\nWouldn't that make most people go run screaming into the night you got a tattoo of my main we've been dating for two weeks\nOh yeah that's a gang out of the room slow I mean that's warning lights and ... and bells going off\nBut so his tattoo artist didn't interview with the New York post saying hey I I told ... do let's just stop with the girlfriend tattoos until after she's your wife but he didn't take the tattoo artist advice and got more oriented ... man that's sad well thing sad David Sims an actual mentally ill person as he talks about a lot\nHe's going to be doing fine there's a there's an entire slew of people who now saw him attached with are you on a ... day and for some\nAnd what are you on a ... day and for some weird reason that no elevates his status in terms of the other one I think you're right I think you're right\nHe is seen as that level will be fine he's completely nothing else that is not going to be fine dining side for another guy you're going to be great [laughter] Gretchen royalties for that David since our\nYou know I like like we got and we won't we won't we won't [laughter]\nThey see life as a parade of disappointments aches and they all minced confusing technology children who don't visit and her doctors I'm more in that camp unfortunately I think that's the way maybe I can turn it around I'm not that old but uh\nI I I Do spend too much time thinking about how things are just getting worse\nAll the time my body is breaking down it just never ends\nOther friends many who's aching knees and hips are the least of their physical problems find comfort in their ability to accept old age is just another stage of life to deal with\nI Would use the word heroic to describe the way they cope with aging as a dream strength from their minds and bodies so they would quickly dismissed such a tournament is an overstatement\nOne such friend recently called from a hospital to tell me of a sudden brain seizure that had rendered him legally blind interrupted me as I began telling him how terribly sorry was he said mom it could've been a lot worse I could have been deaf instead of blind\nDespite all the time I've spent lifting weights and exercising I realized I lacked the strength to said those words it's suddenly struck me that I've paid a price for being a gym rat\nThere's one characteristic comment of friends who are aging with a graceful acceptance of life's of salt it is contentment\nSome with life altering disability my blind friend another two percent of legs are more serene and complain less than those with minor ailments they accept the uncertainties of old age without surrendering to them if you told me that the wisdom they've acquired over the years has made\nA aging easier to navigate the chaos of adolescence it's interesting people say I'm actually happier now Mm [noise] yeah I understand that it was clear that I laughed and had to find contentment those friends that attain the hours I spent exercising had given me confidence but not content\nThought that was really interesting the the title of it is the secret to aging will contentment despite having many friends in their seventies eighties and nineties I've been far too slow to realize that how we respond aging as a choice made the mind not in the gym\n[noise] yes yeah yeah well that's that's clearly true some of us have an easier time achieving certain mindset than others\nOf us and I know you know what I'm Talking about in terms of the we're born to a certain emotional set of characteristics you cannot if you're a hyper competitive ... had me as serene as a summer breeze like somebody who was born that way you\nCan work your way more toward that like whether you can get ten percent closer eighty percent closer I don't know if you know it depends on the question\nIf you've ever looking for in a different drummer guy can get through in difference in a hurry I got you\nKnow it was interesting is guide worked really hard to hold off the physical part of old age and it was looking around him and his other old friends and they were\nThey were happier than him yeah and their bodies were falling apart right me thinking why aren't you unhappy you can't even walk whole voice better attitude sure huh different priorities I don't I don't know it it's hard it's hard it's hard so hard to argue\n[laughter] you're bringing me down ... down you know this was that there's something happening this is this is supposed to bring you are the ones that aren't tens like it's not happening aging yes yeah I write area and and potential housing catastrophe [laughter]\nNot comic downturns oh yeah this six may on the octane when I'm\nReading I'm dreading the economic downturn that is going to happen you know why because they always happen that's just the way it works or read a book if you don't [laughter] I mean but when it happens is waning at all on Trump\nNow I suppose you could say well he's taking all the credit for the term that started when Barack Obama was depressed\nSo maybe that would be an argument for blaming it all and I don't\nBut they they go up they go down presidents tend to get to stay in office or get booted out of office depending on the timing of when the election happens with the terms and now they're not saying they have no control over obviously they knew nobody in my time at it too much lame though yeah government policy does having an influence on the economy but it's gonna be it's going to go up and down no matter what just is sure\nYeah yeah yeah that that conversation is a little tiring honestly the whole president responsible for the economy thing um ... what how much time do we I'm Michael\nWhat how much suddenly I'm like well okay\nMaybe the thing to think about the old stuff is if you got a friend who can still run a marathon or do fifty push ups or whatever assuming miserable like this all yes or go behind his back in and make it miserable engage in subterfuge sabotage while I was there and misery is your joy about\nZero sum game not physically happiness that's exactly right but it's my own happiness and what message I yes okay yes\nSo there's just no time to do this or this

from them Sherry precedent of ABC News is reporting on\nCertainly on first scene aspects of at home DNA kits and what they're being used barrage area where you guys I'm great how are you good you know I've done this I enjoyed the heck out of it I found it really interesting I turned out to have in the Ninety nine percent of all of a Neanderthal DNA\n[laughter] not surprised\nAnd if you've ever did you ever saw the size of my not getting that wouldn't be a surprise to 'em but to tell us about the things that are emerging with at home do you make it\nWell you know it's it's a lot of the things that you think you know you might have one sitting on the side and going you know I I'm thinking I Want to do that but I don't know if I Want my DNA and the giant database for everybody to see I'm not sure if I've done that it turns out it doesn't really matter because you know a couple of scientists recently checked out\nMore than a million of these DNA testing kit to what they found out is that about a third of us um can actually find out who your related to even if you've never even submitted the DNA because so many other people have so many of your relatives\nUm have submitted their DNA so they've found you anyway\nOne of them says you even kind of think of it like um you know peeling back the layers of an onion the further you go back you know the more layers you have with each layer from the center of the onion represents you know more and more distant relatives and when you get that far back the chances of a link to you are a whole lot you know more\nSevere than there are more tired it's like the old six degrees of Kevin Bacon bring I suppose if you get an ... that have happened submitted their stuff the beer information's out there\nYeah and they found out recently not not too long ago that you might remember this that um you know ... and Dick Cheney or very distant cousins I don't know if you remember\nThat when that came out ...\n[laughter] but they but I mean you know you find that stuff out and you're like okay well I don't maybe don't want that stuff known about me and\nUm they find out about it anyway well you can also um take into consideration when you're talking about this is that sometimes people can use this information to try to do bad things I mean it's had a case recently with my father in law when he um he he actually\nHad it got a phone call from somebody who claimed to be my son who said that he had been picked up for a DUI and he needed money right away you know he he he stopped at any time but we called the police and they said that yeah people have been using these tests and other stuff like your online profile and things to find out things like that and names and where you live and\nTo try to scam money people\nMost of this this has more to do with the ancestry and of like ancestry a website to try to help you figure out who your family is that what I did wake purely you know I'm ... percent Iceland they can in the ... on the rest of it I didn't try to connect with anybody\nYou do that but anyway ... when you do that that's what you find out do you find out these members of your family who they are what they are you know and you you might find out that\nYou know you thought maybe something a health wise ran in your family and then you discover through this that no it doesn't when you do the DNA you know people you thought were related to you maybe aren't related to you people didn't know who are are related to you\nSo I mean you know and some people we've had some people say I don't want to be a part of this this isn't one that something might want to do but yet the others are finding out who they are regardless of that\nDefine at home DNA tests this just may not put the saliva her skin or blood or whatever I got two and a computer at home and sent it off\nYeah you'd take 'em all of your saliva then your mail it into the company and and you can also do\nLike from all kinds of things urine

shown\nSo I Believe this is from the folks at Business Insider they did a bit of a man on the street test where they were testing the philosophy of regret avoidance and what they were incorrect avoid the fear of regret I done poorly at them\nAs I have ... from guardrail to guard right on my lap and back and forth\nSo that theory is if you are you're trying to avoid future regret you you can often
