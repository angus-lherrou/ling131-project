correspondent for the Washington Examiner enjoys and joins us now hello David how're you\nDoing good use of this caravan deal you know it's it's an annual event rank more or less\nMore or less yeah I I mean it's it's an interesting and understandable political message from the president he's trying to highlight of the Republican Party's support is border policy and warning that you know as if for asking for Congress\nHis control national security somehow it won't matter and the terror of el ... storm it so much for that so called for\nThe I'm always such an issue uh taken in some of the the show's over the weekend your TV shows you meet the press your faces of the nation there's so much discussion of the ... of the numbers with various races around the country the one thing I have no interest in talking about is the you know who's likely to win and who's not how we wait till it happens\nAnd you know and we don't we don't do that [laughter]\nYeah a lot about is likely to win or lose right now or to actually and it was you know what we're one more emotionally prepared on an election\nBut the conversation never pitch to policy or or ... or or anything that would mean for the country or the citizens of the country if the Democrats one or the Republicans won I think because it wouldn't matter much like\nLook I mean I think I I think it's actually fair to say that if you actually get out there and travel\nThink because it wouldn't matter much like well\nLook I mean I think I I think it's actually fair to say that if you actually get out there and travel which I've been doing them a lot of my colleagues have been doing most of us\nThat covered is that's what the candidates are talking about Republican and Democrat I mean look I was in a two states last week talking to candidates and talking to voters and they're not talking about what we're talking about and neither are the\nCandidates I'm I was in Michigan in a suburban Detroit house district I was in Montana covering that all of a sudden competitive Senate race and everybody out there is talking about issues as well as however I should add as well as some of the political messaging that that you know they're in favor of on both\nSides of the main issue you're hearing as you as you listen to people thought well if you're covering Democrats\nWhat they're talking about his health care I mean just plain and simple direct democratic candidates sleep or not it's not talking about impeachment they're not talking about Trump's latest tweet they're talking about um healthcare they're criticizing the Republican tax overhaul um they're talking about you know things\nLike that maybe they're talking about putting it you know check\nOn all Republican controlled Washington what it's talking about balancing out President Trump a\nBut that that's what they are largely talk you know you and what you talk to Republicans and they'll they're talking about how well the economy's doing and why would people in charge that have to reverse the president's policies and they're also talk talking about immigration from a policy perspective they're talking about\nNational security from a policy perspective Democrats are talking about national security policy perspective in terms of the president's a trade policy that they think of a\nDamaging and in terms of you know Kim picking fights with with American allies so\nThese are the discussions that are actually happening out there and it's funny I don't really I've been out there so much I don't really think about it even voters and most of the time when I Want to know what voters think about horse race or the caravan or you know everything else I actually have to raise the issue\nOf that is high oh damn bid for global warming is that on that list to\nWell if you're a Democrat you're talking about climate change and if you're a Republican you're talking you know if you're talking about it it's about not over regulating um and and things of that matter and it depends on where you go look you're you're in Montana\nAnd the weather's perfect or more or less than you and your you don't see a a you know

uh so yeah I think that we we have our eyes wide open I think that\nAgain to the president's focus on what's good for America what are our strategic interests\nUh you know where do we share interests with other countries let's work towards those but but yeah every day we deal with people who are trying to Deceive Us different ways but our job is to see through it but also the to stay focused on what's best for the American people and the president is fully committed to doing that\nThey don't yeah your brand I don't know about you but I couldn't have ... I couldn't uh totally who that was based on the voice and he has been uh\nAnd on the president's fully committed to doing that who is they don't yeah your brand\nI don't know about you but I couldn't have ... I couldn't uh Tony who that was based on the voice and he has been at least in the past a fairly major player in the White House that you do it Jared Kushner sounds like it's only sounds like\nThe rare male vocal fry and he and M. B. S. or have been fairly tight over the last year and a half or two years they they ... they want stayed up all night long talking about the middle east and plans for the world are measuring\nSo fascinating guy murder NBS oh both of them but NBS in particular oh my God yeah but anyway what an extremely dangerous guys well I just wanted to interview Jared which he said we're waiting to get all the facts and figure out what's true and what's not true and what we need to do and\nI still baffled by this whole story yeah um but more on that coming up later indeed well the ah the Washington Post with a really interesting piece today about an idea of the I guess the White House had to wound tech workers to swing by for a little while\nAnd help straighten out a number of challenges that the gigantic federal government has and Tony rom wrote a piece and we've found really intriguing wanted to talk in areas hello Tony how are you\nAnd good thanks for having me\nOh it's our pleasure Tony rights of up to attack and all sorts of stuff for the Washington Post so uh do we know whose idea this is why don't you explain to folks are what the ideas\nYeah it'll probably come to no surprise to anybody that the federal government is still figuring out what to do with all that tech stuff right we have some agencies that are still intact\nAnd using floppy disks to store information so for a long time now government that trying to get experts to come help outcomes fix some of these agencies troubles and what we're seeing today is the Trump Administration that they've got a bunch of tech companies gather today to tell them to make it possible for workers to come to tours of duty in government\nNow um there there's some talk of going back to floppy disks for safety reasons but that's not the reasons some of these agencies are using floppy disk and they're just stuck on twenty five thirty year old technology\nYeah they've got some girl outdated stuff first find because they lack the expertise sometimes because they don't have the money and still other instances they lack\nThe expertise that my mom and dad have and the you know I certainly isn't at\nAll then the third part is that it's hard with the lumbering federal bureaucracy to change course right you gotta fill out all these forms and do all this stuff just to buy a computer much less you know put the entirety of the Pentagon on the cloud I so there are a lot of challenges that they tried to demonstrate shit and any president for that\nMatter which case when it comes to technology and so they're hoping that the folks at Amazon and Facebook and Google has led to their workers to maybe worked for a couple of ... a year to address some of those challenges and then go back to their old jobs\nBoy I Love that idea I I I think in the pitch for the story somebody mentioned that you know helping vets get their appointments at the VA making that run more smoothly 'cause there are human beings if the business end the what the government does and so this is the idea is really appealing is there any chance that happened was Tony\nWell they're already art programs and government that let workers do tours of duty there's an effort called the U.S digital survey that came about under former President Obama that he created after\nThe health care jak no doubt and they've been working for a long time it just takes a look government had troubles but in this instance while there's the opportunity for workers to go help that tried to demonstrations they may not want to we had a lot of fight between trucks and Silicon Valley and tech companies a lot of calories male why don't you go support president who doesn't share their values\nAnd even even with that aside um you would be doing it as a as public service 'cause I I Can't believe it's going to pay as well as if you're really good at your options in the private world\nYeah I mean compare what they have a government which is what you just as the fact that at Google and making a billion dollars basically and yet a cafeteria free food every day you're not going to get that\nIf you're looking at the department of health and Human Services that much it's certainly true but the political off people can be just as you hear a lot of Silicon Valley workers just aren't interested in working for this administration even on issues where they share common ground like modernizing how it works\nWell I said I Would suggest in Tony you'd need to come in either way on this it's a beautiful example of how politics is completely eclipse the idea of serving your fellow man\nOr your country or whatever if you help vets get to their appointments and don't get screwed out of their appointments that's not somehow being a lack of Trump's that's helping your fellow American not find that\nMost of these times are troubling I'm troubled Tony Tony ... is a a Washington Post staff writer up so [noise] well I liked the idea and and I hope they can get a going to some extent a is there any chance we can make government service compulsory and direct people out of Google by force\nOf well that certainly will see that could happen there's nobody that talking about that sort of thing but the earlier played the White House actually\nHas the same common that huge you which is that it thinks it surely thinks they look ... valley are willing to put aside the political differences and they're willing to go in all of these agencies but when I talk to engineers you care to the coin right there are some folks who are afraid that they like the ...\nOr something related to immigration for example and that they could be put to use in ... controversial policies around the track\nPeople who are here legally or illegally so you know there there there's a despot moral considerations that some people have but the transmission keep saying hey this program to outlast us this solves the problem is that had nothing to do with as far as he doesn't say early\nTony wrong with the Washington Post Tony six million well done base rather than a\nGreat to talk to your uh yeah I it's forced conscription of Silicon Valley engineers that's right I'm calling for it openly as if it's you know Seventeen Seventy and the British navy of snatching up our sailors unbelievable I don't want to help the Trump Administration\nThat we had a a family friend who was a computer whiz my super high level computer was being courted by all the major universities in the country to to get his PHD there and um and he was looking at these various job opportunities\nAfterwards and the government wanted him DARPA wanted him but he didn't want to be involved in anything that had to do with war and\nKilling people now why do you see the ad I mean it's going to really hamper\nOur uh our our\nTech advancements in the country if everybody that's really good at it is anti Republican Party anti war anti\nThis ... can be difficult to move forward yeah yeah\nI'm so here's why I'm so confused by this whole Saudi thing I I don't I don't get this sort of thing has been going on for as long as we've been friends with Saudi Arabia that also goes on with a lot of other countries were friends\nWith and we just including our current buddies in Afghanistan and Iraq\nYeah example being from the Washington Post is Max Boot wrote a column and and he said he's not sure either he was he was wrestling in his own mind about Rio politics to use the example of or seek\nThe guy who was the police chief there in Afghanistan and got blown up last week by the Taliban now one of the reasons the Taliban hated this ... so much\nWas it just because he was on the side of the Afghan government and the United states he was really brutal guy he he had massacred a bunch of people he was he was really really rough stuff I'm both the Obama and\nReally brutal guy he he had massacred a bunch of people he was he was really really rough stuff\nUm yep both the Obama and Trump administrations pretended not to notice his human rights abuses is linked to the drug trade his torture and killing of people who turned out to be innocent of every various things is heavy handed methods because there's one official told Max Boot in the Washington Post this was during the Obama administration\nHe may be mad dog on a leash but he's not a bad one to happen at least he's on a leash right I mean that's the way every country operates in the world that's the way the Obama administration operated in Trump operated with this guy now all of a sudden dude in Saudi Arabia kills a journalist because he wasn't on the right side of things at the time\nAnd were acting like this will not staying we're willing to blow up an eighty year old relationship over this\nWas going on some crazy is going on\nFor six to five seven that's eight eight eight nine nine four\nSixty two fifty seven plus I'm\nI'm shaking in your flip flops I Need to buy a used car but I'm kind of scared

it's bad for your own personal view of life\nOr talk but um\nThere's a couple of articles on why it's a good idea to buy lottery tickets I don't know if you if you could stay completely emotionally detached from it ... you're not going to miss a dollar or two so it only makes sense right\nTo do it but that most people I Know they spend a lot of I'm just like a lottery and that's just crazy to me um but here's a story a lawyer is saying don't get into those office pools which practically everybody is doing right now right\nUm I got an example of a a couple of different lawsuits that have happened across the country where a of the office does win and then somebody sues somebody and this is what happens a lot and I could see how this would happen\nSo we buy tickets together\nMarshall wins and he says yeah but it wasn't I didn't win with one of the tickets that we all bought as a pool I bought a one with one of my own tickets\nRight Todd he proved that are not oh boy unless she took the time to nail down you know documentation of which tickets are yours and who's going to most people aren't going to do that could all use going to get rich the lawyers ... most people wanting to do that because you all know you're not actually going to win right\nBut there would be pretty easy to say that's what I'd claimed screw all you\nI bought my own lottery tickets ... this is my own lottery ticket right now the pool when last sorry\nSorry on personal didn't want to watch out for that\nOr look for the turning on your co workers viciously so black and white in front of Sean has made his choice what about the idea of buying up every possible a combination\nThat was last week I remember for a particular drawing last Wednesday it was like a chances where one and three hundred million well your your odds don't change of winning no matter what\nYeah that's one of the reasons why some gamblers say your your value per ticket since the odds don't change it's actually a better value once the jackpot ... reading certain shows in the\nMega millions drawing five number balls are drawn from a drum with Seventy balls final mullahs malls drawn from a drama twenty five malls\nYou gotta match all six numbers to win the full jak pot there are smaller fixed prices so as there are\nMillion a hundred and three thousand in fourteen possible combinations of first\nThere are smaller fix prices so as there are twelve million a hundred and three thousand and fourteen possible combinations of the first five numbers\nAnd you have to multiply that if you know about probability you multiply that by the twenty five options for the final ball you get about three hundred and\nTwo and a half million possible mega millions tickets at two dollars per ticket then you'd have to buy every possible combination it would cost you six hundred and five million dollars hundred and fifty thousand seven hundred\nNow presuming you have that much money in the bank and your little scheme or any worked um you know your costs to be a six o five you're payout would be nice to meet you make about three hundred and Seventy four million dollars which is a great idea unless\nUh somebody else gets well there are a number of\nCompanies and I hope you're the only winter yeah including the first problem is is the actual physical active buying more than three hundred million mega millions tickets and filling them out by hand\nWhat is taking so long and that's why I'm just trying to buy a monster drinking some cigarettes I'm up to eighty million I got like two hundred and twenty to go\nI'm well how are you\nExcellent thank you so ah how extensive the tests are we talking about how much tunnel what's happening\nSo it's a it's about two miles of tunnels so it's relatively short but the the big news is that on December tend that test titled be open to the public for the very first time\nOkay tell us what this thing is what what does it do\nShow that the test tunnel is designed to just demonstrate the feasibility of this underground tunnel network that that mosque envisions for this high speed alternative um to help us a deal with with the the nightmare that is LA traffic and traffic elsewhere across the United states\nHow high speed so he says this test tube will go as fast as a hundred and fifty five miles per hour for passengers\nAnd as I mentioned yesterday when we were discussing this if you can average thirty five miles per hour across ballet it's a miracle\n[laughter] so that would be great are you aware of they'll Hamza that Californians ancient governor is planning a choo choo train that will slowly chunk from the north to the south why wouldn't we embrace an incredible new technology like\nThis you don't have to answer that if you don't\nFeel it is is this is this just a basically a subway that goes faster\nThan most subways or what is it\nSo so what are the key differences that mosque says between this system in the subway is that they'll just be a lot more stations and it won't be these kind of congested central terminals but this kind of a de centralized a number of hubs that don't have this kind of giant footprint on the street level\nAnd that it's kind of seamless for you to\nEnter and exit and that all routes will be espresso there's also not multiple stops to get to your destination\nDo you are sitting in a chair and wear a seatbelt or worse or how does that work you know\nIt's it's it's unclear but but there are two scenario so the one is actually you're just in your car and the car kind of latches onto this this this what's called the skate\nAnd then you you are shuttled to your destination and another scenario Europe a death street or a cyclist so I can imagine they're being seats in seatbelts but um it it's like I said there's also another scenario where there's a there's a car and there's no pedestrian\nQuoting you're fine piece of journalism for longer routes this vacuum based system could move people in cars without wind resistance with bombs traveling faster than six hundred miles per hour it's impressive yeah that\nThat's that's really up that's so so that's mosques kind of long term vision is that these this tunnel system that he's building in pondering now will pave the way for it even more advanced what's called the hyper loop system\nThat deals with pressurized cabins they'll they'll travel even faster than these high speed networks that he's building now\nInterests but she I don't believe you can hurled people along it's six hundred miles an hour and then have them stop without their hearts and livers getting squash flat [laughter]\nWhat what's what's crazy is that that speed is about how ... how fast um airplanes travel so you're you're basically\nGoing as fast as
