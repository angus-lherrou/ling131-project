R. E. E. offer I said\nFree offered today from purity products no strings attached this is a free offer from a reputable company that's been in business for years just you need the phone number as soon as we tell you more about ha\nNow you see there's a youth molecule in the human body and then it holds the key the visible signs of age you know you've written about this you've traveled to Japan to do the research so so tell me about what is what is that we as this molecule you're talking about\nHad it's amazing that most people\nThose people don't know this word highly ironic asset and of course it's made it's all over our body it's in our skin it's an all natural molecule we can get it orally replace it in our body\nBut more so we've learned that the little bit that we can get as a dietary supplement can trigger your body to make more\nAnd of course why do we need more well when we're young we're loaded with this stuff when we're babies we have what we call baby fat it's really baby ha it it makes a well as babies fall down and get cuts and scrapes you notice they never really get any\nLifelong scars from that because they have lots of H. A. on board highly ironic gas it\nAnd to make this easy to understand for the audience I think we can all appreciate that women have smoothing skin and thicker hair and so on all of that is because estrogen sends a signal to make more ha and that's why the girls\nHave more limber flexible joints they can get in a kind of a load of posture kind of the men can't get into they\nThey certainly have all of those advantages and that's because the estrogen sends a signal\nTo make more ha now women have more ha to lose than men do and you see the skin shoveling up the joints and so on as women age but there is a way to get it back and of course purity products for years now has been talking about ha and they have a new formula just for the joints\nH A joint formula and it's so important today because\nI think everyone's confused an article in the New York times says consumers are confused what to do to support their joints took people are looking for alternative we need cushioning in between the joints the bones in our joints when a doctor looks at an X ray\nAll he's doing is measuring the space between the two bones there in the knees so it's about a quarter of an in space without that cushioning\nYou've got bone rubbing on bone\nThat's what age eight is it's the jello or the cushioning agent in between our bones\nWe lose it either due to wear and tear or age and so we start getting problems the more that we find pain relates\nThe more pain relievers we use the more we're going to use these joints and then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed this people who chronically use pain relievers\nAre going to have more bone where so what you need is the actual cushioning back there to lubricate the joint and that's what ha does that's what ha is that doctors call it's the ... flu it they\nHis vegetables to the fruit market pat where do we have in the United states eighty three year olds driving their motorcycle down to the vegetable market we don't have it we followed him\nTo his home Orioles up on a thirty foot ladder\nTrimming a tree he works in the fields about four to six hours a day and he introduced us to his neighbor who was nine years old without a wrinkle on his face neither of them use reading glasses\nAnd of course uh he works about six to eight hours out in the fields every day this was remarkable I almost felt had I was in some sort of a place where\nThe dinosaurs are still living or something that was so remarkable\nThese people just exhibit a useful to stay a flexibility in their joints certainly helpful mess that we just don't see everywhere else in fact it was so remarkable that the emperor of Japan actually has visited this village pictures were taken there you could see them all over the village there as they had posted him so\nThis had stood out and of course Connie Chung uh ABC News twenty twenty had gone to visit there in the year two thousand and this was originally on television you could see the actual pictures for yourself but\nThe ha revolution has come here pat and of course we've had three years of use of ha but we could lose people in the science so they want to know what's real is this for real\nWell it's real for Tom who writes to us a pharmacist now from Santa Cruz California Seventy years of age participating in the whole lie Iron Man contest in Kona, Hawaii this past year\nSeventy years old he said this new ha formula for the joints did a great job not certainly a pharmacist with no here's John writing to me and saying you know at age fifty five boy when I tried ha I'm now back to playing full court basketball but the twenty year old\nAnd I've even begun to jog again these are the kinds of reports that we here\nLet me ask you a question here you mentioned the glucose I mean and there's another one that is pretty popular MSN how does this ... stack up against those other ones the other ones you have to take them for a while before you even see any results\nAnd most of these are very positive dietary supplements they certainly have\nThey certainly have lots of benefits glucose main takes quite a while to kick in\nMSN is a wonderful sulfur compounds and again it's an anti inflammatory as are many things like fish oil ... these are all wonderful\nBut they're not dealing with the origin of the problem the origin of the problem is the loss of cushioning and the joy and if we can just replaced it if we can find a way to get that cushioning back that's what we call usefulness that's what we had when we were young\nHere's David Wright and to me from New York twenty five years looking for something that would help support\nHis lower back and of course he said I Can't believe it now he says the cat thank you enough for this product

author\nAnd pharmacists and always great to have you on the show such great information Sherry can you share with us a quick study or to to sort of back this up highlight the science behind the elite asked his anthem that's found in the FX 'cause I Know there were dozens and dozens of studies maybe you can pull out and highlight a couple of your favorites\nFor sure so Dr Mark Miller he's a PHD a biomedical research or he explains that well he's talking here about how free radicals compromise and undermine function\nAnd sell you the performance in the body he\nSays after that and it's simply the herd at negating this as evidenced by clinical trial showing improved performance and accelerated recovery in fact research published in the journal of medicine and science\nIn sports and exercise found that those who took four milligrams about this than than daily over twenty eight days scored better cycling times with greater output\nAnd those who did not take it for the fight I\nMean remember this after that and it's one of the few\nThat fireball antioxidants that can actually neutralize three radicals even at the site of the mitochondrial membrane if like fail her body armor protecting yourself your joints blood vessels brain heart and Oregon's on many levels\nSo listen to this mark and there are fourteen clinical studies on after that in ...\nFor brain how seven studies on skin health fourteen studies on I help including research for depth perception and focus fix studies showing after than than supports cardio function\nForty two studies on healthy aging and cellular help and there's a ton of research on human performance to showing benefits for energy stamina endurance and the south that fact it's incredibly powerful and versatile it helps you stand the game of life they energize active alerts healthy and even stronger\nBarriers impressive on so many levels so much information there and I know this last ... about a dozen happens to I'm looking here I see\nThere's a patent for promoting I helped\nThem reducing Ice T there's a pattern for inhibiting the expression as cytokines in sales and a patent on composition for body fat reduction there's one for improving muscle atrophy an older adult Sherry I like to be a little bit of a skeptic here how can this one simple nutrients\nMagically do all of this disaster affects you give us so many benefits I mean really\nYeah I Know it's it sounds amazing too good to be true but it really is true many studies that I'm referencing here or there ... met these are reputable clinical studies conducted by leading researchers around the world that really back\nThe benefits of asked his aunt then by the way muscle I put it that are with us does that than to and this comes from after that the research published in the international journal sports nutrition November two thousand and eleven this with another study done with cyclists they took four Nelly ... than than it was a small study but very positive showing that cyclists\nImproved their trial time by two minutes and twenty kilometer bike race\nI mean that's a meaningful improvement in a race like this and the researchers said that they also bring fat more efficiently which makes sense\nBased on this research purity can actually make the claim that asked FX will promote and improve power output\nIn your muscles I mean I tell people asked FX in strength and power out\nIts transformative if you like energy and this was found in other studies to like one that looked at hand grip strength\nSo much great information but just tuning here we're talking with pharmacist an author Sherry Turkle here on your host mark Larson on his hand ribs study the you mentioned I understand there this involves what a twelve milligram dose\nAnd they saw in Ninety three percent boost in hamstrings but people who struggled with so at tennis elbow now that's a big deal but our listeners might be saying well okay maybe I don't play tennis ... what about me what does it mean for me right\nRight so so think about this uh Ninety three percent increase in a person who has some repetitive stress in their album it's an almost doubling enhanced strength so just think about all the\nThings that you're doing your daily life picking up groceries your kids your grandkids gripping the steering wheel of a car playing golf for tennis gardening or

one of the first day I was in college\nHealthy inflammation in more can you share some of the incredible headlines on human and tell us why you use this we talked about this off here a few minutes ago just patented B. C. M. Ninety five formula of course human which seven times greater in Georgia\nOkay well first of all I think well people might not know the term Kirk human they may well no ... which is a yellow spice and it shows up in curies and\nIt's part of the five thousand year old Indian ... system of medicine I've been studying tumor Rick and its derivative Kirk humans since the Nineteen seventies\nAnd I'll say this right off the bat that they are almost no plant materials in the world as extensively studied as there's a couple of thousand studies can be found in the scientific and medical literature we know that Kirk human is powerfully antioxidants we know that it has a remarkable\nCapacity to protect the liver and deliver is our primary detoxify Oregon\nIt greatly enhances joined health so people are experiencing joint discomfort due to overuse this really helps to relieve that and it's also what we called cardio protective\nIt helps to protect the heart it helps to maintain normal healthy cholesterol and one last thing that is really kind of astounding is that cook human actually causes your body to produce what are called neuro protective factors in the brain so\nIt causes your body to produce these\nAgents in the brain that protect the actual issue\nOf the nerves in the brain itself there's almost nothing else that we know of that does this specifically the b._b._c. um Ninety five that you mentioned offers about seven times the absorption of any other current human extract so\nWhen you take two hundred fifty milligrams of this stuff you get about seven times the activity that you would if you took say a comparable amount of another curriculum and extract so this in my opinion\nIs one of the most life and Hansing protective totally beneficial substances on earth and it has just decades of scientific and medical studies to back it up\nChris I Know that we turn to oversee the green tea in the current humid in your new green tea yarn liquid ... formula which purity given away for free today first\nTell me about the third nutrient on the list the risk ... which is super hot right now here was on some of the headlines the science behind was very ... I Know some red wine and the French love it but why is it on your shortlist\nRivera trial is one of those remarkable compounds that I just sort of shake my head at how many different things that does it is\nFound in grapes in wine grapes it also shows up and cranberries what we know about resveratrol is that like green tea and also like Kirk human extract\nIt's profoundly antioxidant\nBut more than that it shows significant properties when you look at some of the things in the body if that happened during aging as a result of fat accumulation in tissue and insulin sensitivity ...\nHelps to protect against those things so it's a powerful immune regulator and you know our immune system is responsible for keeping us healthy it is remarkably beneficial for the heart\nBeneficial for the heart and this is why it's considered one of the key is to the so called French paradox you know the French drink a lot of red wine they eat a lot of cheese they smoke cigarettes and they stay slim and they have good cardiovascular health which just seems completely unfair but was there a trial appears to be\nKey in that and additionally\nThere is a brain benefit like there is with the current cumin with blood flow to the brain so when you take resveratrol you get rain blood\nFlow this means you get more oxygen to the tissues of the brain your brain cells stay healthier longer your mind is clear sharp and focused\nSo this is on my short list for all those reasons and for about a dozen more that would just plain take too long to explain\nRight again we're talking with Chris ... also known as the Indiana Jones of natural medicine sometimes called the medicine hunters well Christmas laser in on how this wonderful formulas you created in conjunction with ...

D printed out a little ticket it said attached to the bag of shrimp and color manager or and so the manager came over and a U.S but you know what this could possibly be and she said we really don't know we all we looked at the expiration date or wasn't expired didn't expire till next year\nI'm In and I said well maybe there was some kind of recall a and the manager said you know that that's entirely possible or the you know at this point we don't know so I've looked since then to see if there was a recall on any kind of frozen shrimp and there had been won in a couple of years\nI'm ... is that maybe there's a recall in process and it just hasn't been announced yet but they would not let us buy that bag of shrimp\nBad is fascinating and it's a mystery maybe will unfold over time but that is the kind of thing that's coming is that we will before we can get out of the store\nThere will be items that are still on the shelf that have already been identified as being a risk for whatever reason and before that item could end up at home you watching football and suddenly not feeling so hot\n'cause not cause your team lost but because it was shrimp or a a like a sack in your life or you\nGot ... for a big big loss anyway you'd never had that happen\nNo matter you know I I think the manager out as I said you know I'm Glad this happen in and I didn't end up exactly where where you're talking about Clark\nWell the good thing is that whatever the issue with sort of the shrimp it didn't happen to you and the fact that we're going to have more and more circumstances where we don't have to worry about as much the safety of the food we eat that's nothing but for the good\nThank you very much and thanks for having Brian's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Brian five

[noise]\n\nYou're listening to retire right when David Steen Bradley white on the retirements news network\nFor saying when it today they says retire right with that scene in white tenure hosts generally jak pleased to be here alongside\nDave ... and Brad white they are with Epstein and white retirement income solutions we're talking today about some of their with some of the day what is that you had into retirement there are a lot of things you need to think about before you just jump in can't retire made aware you won't have that steady paycheck anymore\nIs that we're we're talking today Brad air you were sharing a little bit earlier about some of the things that get overlooked I think one of those what asked for a lot of people is certainly Social Security what if I take this wrong or what if my benefits aren't what they thought they were going to be\nYou have a story to share with that said that how you and Dave were able to help somebody a figure something out with their Social Security and I wonder if he would just start off this segment sharing that with us\nYeah absolutely so um we had this one of them come to one of our Social Security events which I've I mentioned the last segment we host Social Security events every month you just simply go to our website obscene in white dot com and you'll see our vents page when these next events are and you can register\nFor them so she had come to the man 'cause that was kind of one of her main you know financial questions and our world is what to do about Social Security\nShe'd been retired for a couple of years\nAnd um had been very successful just a very successful um three of our employment for for many many years\nAnd had built up a she had a couple of pensions that she was fortunate enough to earn and between the pensions and she had saved up um again very very good saver amenable IRA four one K. accounts and non Iraqi accounts and our trust as well and what she's been doing for the last couple of years since she's been retired as the\nBetween the pensions and a lot of evidence an interest from stocks and bonds in her non Iraq how she's been able to generate enough dividends and interest or to stack on top of the pension that that's pretty much been meeting her needs and that's what she's been living off for the last couple of years and she's in her mid sixties currently\nAnd so you know and she's got a very healthy Social Security a very very good so scary but as good as it gets and so kind of this has been the underlying question of you know I don't necessarily need it right now because the pensions and dividends and interest\nI could take it right now but I get a big growth rate you know my Social Security ... percent per year from sixty six to Seventy and for her that's a big growth rate and\nWell it will I just was it worth it for me the way I just don't know if that's what leads her to come to the event and I know for a lot of you listening that's pretty much what happens for most of us you know what how should I take my Social Security and when should I take it in in a very common and I'm sure that's what you're thinking of is your own situation as as we talk about hers so when you look at an entire plan\nFirst blush you might sit there and go wow you know her Social Security is going to grow so much as she waits so we might as you know we let's wait all the way till Seventy let's maximize this thing and you'll get says all much more ... life and we did it\nWhen you do an analysis of Social Security in a vacuum you know if she were live 'til nine years old or more and she's in good health there's no reason to think she won't she'd get a hundred thousand dollars or more something like a hundred thousand dollars or more of actress Oscar de over lives if she waited till Seventy\nSo if you're working with someone who you're trying to do this and you're not trained in you're just like a little scary that would seemed obvious that she wanted to wait and that's what she was thinking\nHere's the problem though she's going to have a I don't want to say a big problem because it's a great problem the habit required minimum distribution for her are are are going to be there and if you don't know a requirement um distributions are whether or not you\nWant to pull money out of your ... and you're IRAs whether you want to or not by the time you reached Seventy and a half the IRS will make you start\nIt's called required minimum distribution so you're required to pull at least a certain amount out and I like it or not and if you miss a Braley is a fifty percent penalty or in other words you're doing and you're doing it so if you've got a million dollar IRA\nYour first year percentage just three point six five percent which means you have to pull thirty six thousand five hundred dollars out of your foreign hit irate that calendar year whether you like it or not which is taxable income\nThat's a nice round number so obviously if it was your ...\nIf it was your IRA was a half a million you know it's you know Eighteenth outlaws\nEighteen plot centers to mail in your at Seventy two thousand [laughter] well yeah so for her were sitting there we're going\nWhy would you be polling from your non Iraqi accounts now with all this evidence and interests are draining draining draining as if it goes right as we ... it could be growing better if you weren't taking the day when it's an interest right\nAt all from this after tax nice money that no one's ever going to force you to take if you don't want to and you can take whenever you want what you're doing this now building up in building up your IRAs so that you are and these are going to be that much bigger by the time you get to Seventy and a half\nAnd if you wait to take Social Security when you're Seventy you're going to have all this infusion of Social Security coming in at the same time you're going to have these big required but I'm distributions coming in so it just doesn't make sense not when you look at full strength in a vacuum if I knew nothing else about this woman that I saw that Social Security benefits and knew that she was in good health\nYeah waiting till Seventy makes all the sense in the world collect a lot more Social Security over like by doing that\nBut everybody's situation is different and so and I urge sanitation sorry if it ever situation is where she's got a need to why not take the government's Social Security now which lets her preserve her ... interest in stocks and rows of that\nAnd we still have to start figuring out what to do about requirement of distributions anyways right now obviously this is a very advantageous position to be an okay so\nAgain I I don't say this is a problem and it's a good problem if you want to think of it that way it's really just more of a consideration we need to start doing a couple of things we need to think about Ross conversions right now before she turned Seventy potentially especially now when you think about maybe repositioning portfolio think about that\nThere's nothing wrong with the evidence stocks are inches but now we need to literally read tool her portfolio to not create as much evidence and interests\nBecause if we turn on Social Security that solves her income and we may not why would we pay extra taxes on dividends and interest when we're not going to need to spend them any more so now we can retool\nThis portfolio into more kind of tax sensitive growth strategies for her so that's how powerful Social Security is Social Security is literally got allow us to help her with their future requirement of distributions it's going to literally causes to want to change the investment structure of an account and all these pieces flow in and now a beautiful picture custom for her exactly perfectly\nSaid ... you know if you missed us kind of in the first part of the segment I kinda liked the way that rolled off Dave where we mentioned that your work\nYour whole life was your plan right it's solved your income needs that solved inflation for you it pays for health care\nIt makes you not worry about the market's going up and down along the way and you didn't have to you know taxes because your taxes are what they are with our paycheck exactly so your work was your plan your whole life\nBut now you need one right work is not the end at the end of your work but at the start of your money's work for you exactly Casey need a plan you need this blueprint that's what the F Siena white retirement income master plan is there's a few ways we can help you right now we're going to build you your own custom retirement income plan\n... the price of the market doesn't tell you the value of the market whether it's cheaper expensive first and foremost\nRight because the price of the market might go up but remember the markets based off company earnings right this isn't like a mythical stock market these are just businesses these are companies companies and companies generate earnings and if earnings grow a ton of earnings keep growing and growing and growing\nThen the market itself could actually go up but be cheaper\nNow I'm not saying that any particular moment that that automatically means the market's going up or down because once again the theme is we don't know but right off the bat a lot of people have never been educated that just because the markets hired doesn't mean it's more expensive so I Want you to think about that\nA lot of other rhetoric that that's been happening a lot for a little while though is are we in the late stages of our cycle is the is the cycle over as the economic cycle over\nAnd nobody ever knows that entirely right there's a lot of what's called leading indicators and a lot of things that economic economist in a market professionals use and you and you know these things are important that professionals use then\nIt helps make predictions but nothing's perfect but one thing that our own portfolio manager um taught us day that I really like ... and you know where I'm going with this as he was looking at ... you know let's say we are kind of at a peak trade let's say we're kind of in the peak cycler late version of a cycle you know in his word and our\nAnd our portfolio manager David ... words just because you're late and an economic cycle doesn't mean it's over and die early and he took a look back at 'em all these periods in history where earnings growth had Pete and then how long it took for an actual recession\nAnd there were about a dozen times from Nineteen fifty three three two thousand and four um but he looked at about a dozen and if you looked at the average amount of time it took where the economic cycle in ...\nWhere the economic cycle in earnings peaked until the recession that was the average was forty nine months\nAnd some huge returns were made during that forty nine month the average return\nWas almost sixty percent fifty eight point nine percent over that span over that forty nine month average fan ran other words if you look backwards at all these dozen times where we can look back and see the things that peaked\nIt still took an average of forty nine months and if you were pulled out of the market just because quote unquote earning to get a missed out on the fifty eight point nine percent return over this fall in months\nSo just because their names of Pete and we point that that does that mean automatically now we've got forty nine great months ahead no because everything is different right I just told you the average over that decade there is one time from September of Nineteen eighty one is one earnings Pete\nAnd we didn't have a recession Islam Nineteen Ninety in July\nThat's a hundred and three months but it

have measured G N E but we will be talking to one of the uh the founders are the principles I Believe that's Nick stone of soccer city\nAnd the next week we will have to be talking about the San Diego state measure\nUh so we have e today and gee\nNext week and then maybe we'll even consolidated and have a little mini debate than there after I don't know what I mean\nI I Would like to do that um is as long as it can remain under control so uh so we have a Knicks don't coming up in about ten minutes and I do not leave or or move that dial as they say in radio\nBinocular because it's confusing folks it's hard I have not\nMade up my mind yet I'm inclined one way or another but I've not made up my mind I Want to hear Nick today and I'm not sure who are the representative is for the um the San Diego state folks but we will ah we have somebody in Studio next week as well so uh we're going to keep our minds open and go from there\nUm before we can do that let's talk a little bit about as we try to do each week a kind of what's happened over the weekend legally well we have a new Supreme Court justice right like them or not we have them\nAnd uh this was the most partisan\nVote ever ever in the history of this country and\nAh normally you don't see people lined up or I mean so closely and we had one Republican defect we had one Democrat defect and a ... you know as as as to be honest with as Donald Trump says elections matter\nAnd uh\nI said at last week and I'll say it again Brett Kavanaugh is qualified and every general way to be a Supreme Court justice\nAnd uh you know I Will you might not like them or you might feel\nThe temper miniature whatever it might be but the reality is he is now a Supreme Court justice so um it is the way it is guys and uh people are really some people are extraordinarily happy and some are not and that's how our country works or it shouldn't work part of some wise I Will make one statement and that is\nWhere there are two parts where were the same between Angie good victory and energy or both private development and both misery and measure gee fully need universities long term need to expand so there's no difference with respect to long term education expansion potential\nUm they're just too private developments measure gee private developer and trying to take a couple of hundred million bucks out of the city's pocket several hundred million out of the schools pocket six cetera to help the private development there and we don't think that's right this is the city that said the people that that they should get full value for\nSo let me ask you a question are just going to jump in as well uh with regard to your initiative measure E. ah you're going to have more a development is that correct more retail stores more entertainment more public use versus university used would that be fair\n[noise] so we will definitely have more entertainment options and and more sort of the sports entertainment district is the the new very successful version of retail done in LA than Atlanta popping up all over the country\nWill have a lot more than that we then measure gee we think that makes it valuable for every San Diego and three hundred sixty five year because let's face it there's not a lot of places to go in the valley to get a good meal today\nOr to find a live music scene\nWill create that ah credit corner of ...\nOkay so so now the the uh the argument I think that the other side will will put and and it seems like somewhat of a valid one is that you theoretically gonna increase\nMovement and and and people in that arena\nA to a high degree that traffic will not be able to be controlled in a way they are going to be it's gonna be crazy what's your answer to that that's one of the big deals that they're saying is that traffic is going to be just insane [noise]\nYeah and um so the the couple of thoughts first everything that gets built there's going to create more traffic but has there\nBe just insane\n[noise] yeah and I'm so there's a couple of thoughts first everything that gets built there's going to create more traffic but has there today break so um that's why we're spending fifty million dollars in traffic improvements or or expanding friars radical laid over the freeway were increasing the including the flow through it into and out of the site\nUm it's fifty one of the traffic and prevent what what's really telling guys between the two that is the kind of core ... of the developers opposing us and backing as the U.S [noise]\nAnd I actually thought with this whole thing started that that was a like potentially reasonable argument we went and looked at it we concluded that our houses was right the city has subsequently confirmed it at our analysis on trips is correct\nBut most telling lead the SDF us plan measured gee says no traffic improvement in the state is legally prohibited from doing it because of the way the sequel laws have changed which I can talk you through if you're interested\nSo what it really comes down to his traffic is is like a red herring this the emperor has no clothes moment is when you realize hey they're complaining about trafficking plan that the developers are posing as are backing does no traffic improvement and yet ads within two percent the same number of rush hour trip to our plan\nBecause the one thing that we do guy is by being more mixed juice\nIs we spread the number of trips were creating over the course of the day but no real genius their people come out from work at the end of the day they want to go for happy hour they have a place to go to if you have an office and you have no bar to go to for happy hour afterwards where do you go right same for a meal et cetera\nUm so we're we are doing fifty million at traffic improvements were the only one who's committed do any trapped improvements and we actually create\nTwo percent more trips at rush hour that the other side so the traffic was a pretty balanced for the times that people care about and we're spending fifty million bucks to fix it and that's unique to us\nIs just so Nick Justin I think here um I I have a question too because I'm pretty involved in soccer community here I've been a part of a deliverable supporters group in San Diego in old I'm a member what's it called a little Italy for a while\nAnd there is a lot of people who wants a soccer team here there's a lot of people who are are hoping to have something here since the chargers left and my question to you is is what is the analysts doesn't grant is a team\n[noise] yeah so look first off I think that's an incredibly low probability if we win I mean they want this market you know on a ship group includes a landed Donovan after whom the MVP trophies named and include their most powerful media broadcast partner ... or ... and like stone is the brother of\nThe commissioners best friends are like really well positioned from a from the ownership perspective Anna market perspective\nHow many we have a nominee above Venus are being considered now because I understand the word it's there is only what three or four I I Am right now that it's being considered or can you tell them you know\nSo there there are ten slides left or ten cities vying for the two slots they're laugh Tucson says and so we've got we're down to um you know really timely Austin has just decided to build a new stadium a national has just decided to build his new stadium since he's at that there's\nThey're all doing that with tax dollars\nAre and so we're we're reasonable unique we think and not asking for any a taxpayer dollars adjusting to your point\nFirst off if we don't get a ... a team will never touch a inch of land\nNever touch an inch of land I mentioned valley and we have to have a team in order for the development to start and should we not get a team actually the university hardwired into an issue to our initiative is allowed to step into our shoes to ensure that we've protected their long term expansion opportunity\nSo I'm Sorry you saying that your initial games or your development is contingent on and the last team\nIt is one hundred percent on ...\nSo what happened to see what happens to everything you guys have invested ... saying enlisting isn't granted you said ten cities for two teams two thoughts you know there's\nI and I look I I Know that you might have kind of an inside track here but if you say hypothetically no team is granted then all of this ... what happens\nIn the university will step into our shoes and they have a really easy development path to build their long term goals for what they needed a site on and we'll have will have spent a ton of time and effort trying to create a university development opportunity but doesn't this is why we're aligned\nRight we clearly have a real incentive to go figure out how to get a team and you're seeing as put our money where our mouth is on that front and say look we're so confident we'll get one that\nWell I ... I Will say this new that I made everything I've read in San Diego is one of the top cities in the ... in the world well especially in the United states I guess I I'm not sure about the world a that support soccer in fact I think the ratings here in in a World Cup boarded the highest in the United states of any city that correct\nThat's completely correct yeah we actually watch more soccer World Cup and in the last in San Diego per capita than any other market in America are we we play more soccer\nI mean look we are helped by the fact that our climate it's awesome for for the game um but but the sports intersection for soccer you're in the market is is amazing and you can kinda see that\nWe do in on the world cup final day we had to organize a party or in North park and um put up two jumbo Tron just displayed the TV the onto big jumbo Tron\nAnd when it was like eight o'clock on a Sunday Morning and it was France plane crash that we thought man we're going to be in trouble but Thirteen thousand people came to sit on the street and watch the game together Thirteen thousand people there was a soccer's really is popular and beat or something of outlet sports we just don't have that\nAnd the concentration we need and\nThat is true and I I Would personally attacked this too because for our our ... group like\nAre we actually started this uh my friend and I see that about four years ago with only a couple of people we had five hundred people show up to our champions final and little Italy and we had to turn away almost three hundred and fifty people and then the bar that we turn them away to actually filled up\nPretty quickly too and then had to send to another place so I Know the fans are here uh I'm just a little concerned that you know if there is no team granted then this you know that sounds sounds like there was a lie that might be just kind of for nothing and then at the new kind of takes over\n... well look I mean here's what I Would say the un I talked to lead a lot\nUm I I've talked to them three times last week and a and I feel really good that if we win our vote in November\nWe will have a team they want the market they want to be here they have to have a soccer specific stadium to planned and they won't be a tenant in a university stadium that's not brand a line for them so those two things are really clear\n'em but they love his plan I mean Don Garber came only to one ... cities unveiling when all the plans are first unveiled back in January of last year and have a San Diego so we have been fortunate to be able to figure out how to keep them around as the city has sort of taken a lot longer than we expected when we started\nTo make a decision here but but I don't stress too much over that because I feel very good that if we get at the stadium deal and we win that vote in November we will get\nBut but I don't stress too much over that because I feel very good that if we get at the stadium deal and we went to vote in November we will get a team\nSo ... what happened is it's okay so so get it and and there are some differences your view on the ... the state wants to purchase land\nOr I'm not sure what the big differences there as far as how that worked in the Sierra Club is back to San Diego state because of the acreage that it is it for open areas and so forth\nThe question I have is is it San Diego state\nMeasure um gee wins or what would be the difference in a soccer team still wanting to come here\nOr in other words are they going to just turn away because you guys didn't get it or or because San Diego state also wants to have a soccer team and a and use the stadium for their own as they would but you as well\nSo so are you saying that you're just so much better that you can lower at team better than ... you know measured you would\nDoing nothing and we have two uh two measures to vote on either dreary we have Nick stone who is\nInvolved very significantly in the project or by shocker city and uh let's get the phone numbers out of you have any questions we love you to ask them one eight hundred seven sixty camp and be one eight hundred seven sixty five three six to eight nic um what\nWhat's the significance of your group a leasing the land and how long would you lease it for versus San Diego state purchasing the land\nSo we will actually end up purchasing all the land under which we have buildings guy and the significance there is that's the real um between the two ... both of purchasing\nBut only one piece of property tax so soccer city pays for property tax for all of our site um because all of our our buildings will be under owned land on top of on land what that means\nEvery single year we're creating twenty two million dollars in surplus for the city and the county and the schools in eighty percent of that coming from property taxes\nNow by contrast I mean if you look over the life of the project for the schools is worth like eight hundred and fifty dollars for K. through twelve education if you look at ... veggie\nBetter GPA something called ... that three interest tax it's not full property tax at all and in fact you know independent totally independent accounting is as I said it's typically significantly less and the blueprint development that they're talking about for the site pays no property tax\nSo we're losing at least hundreds and probably many hundreds of millions of dollars that the what the schools could be getting from the site by giving what is ultimately also a private development\nTo set up private developers and measure gee because they don't pay for property tax and that is the huge distinction here between these two it's not there is an effort to try and make the higher ed versus soccer it's not that at all actually cause Irish salt in both cases what it really is a distinction between as\nA full value for taxpayers it's Akron city and misery\nAnd hundreds of millions of loss for the taxpayers and measure gee\nI have a question about that because I Know that the that San Diego state has an economic impact Internet itself so they I Know it's somewhere in the I think it's over a billion dollars each year\nThat Estes you has an economic impact with everything that's involved with that new students teachers and ... anything and everything that deals with that\nSo if we were to expand as the as you or a mix used with UCSD or something of that nature then wouldn't that offset any potential losses that would be incurred from not having the full property tax\nNo actually in fact quite the opposite because I'm really interestingly the university has said we need thirty five acres to expand that sort of publicly in a letter to the ... so it's not I'm not making the number of\nA mid march of last year that the requests for thirty five acres and we provided for all thirty five acres that they say they need in a form that is exactly equivalent to what they have it asked us us so the economic impact of the universities contribution to the two is actually equal and the two plans\nBut soccer city is creating more office it's creating more I'm sort of sports entertainment district that is a huge additional tax base over and above what measure gee creates\nAnd and so when you look at our project before you at any university\nFor creating two point eight billion dollars a year and economic impact twenty six thousand permanent ongoing jobs because companies\nWe're creating two point eight billion dollars a year and economic impact twenty six thousand permanent ongoing jobs because company suddenly have a place to expand and we've had some very major fortune five hundred companies say we're\nReally interested in this should you get it through the vote because we're looking for corporate campus type opportunities and it really hard to find in San Diego so economic impact for from an economic impact perspective we're actually materially better than measure G and were equal on the university's contribution parts so\nUh in all circumstances soccer city has a higher longer term economic impact the ... well\nThere's a there's a ton of people that have supported or put their support in the local law officials um for both sides actually but certainly for for duty as well as your club as I mentioned the chamber of commerce\nAh what's their ... you know take off your hat for a moment and try to you know so we can be as transparent and open minded as possible\n[laughter] what's missing in your measures that that people ought to know that you know is in the other measure I mean it's not all it's not all sides right I mean it's not like you guys are a perfect and they're horrible or vice versa [noise]\nUh there's a lot of in between there for sure as a matter of who gets the money I mean let's let's just be Frank about it I mean they're both going to be private developers although San Diego state will have more opportunity is not true to expand their facilities under this they're measure not yours would that would that be a fair and accurate statement\nWell not from what we've seen them say publicly uh for what it's worth I mean they said they need thirty five acres they have the full thirty five acres that they need with us so and and actually interestingly I get a debate yesterday it was sort of me versus jak gravely proponent for just us\nAnd Scott Lewis kept asking him like what did they not having soccer city that you eat and then there is I mean that question that has like four times with no answer to your point about which developers getting it is I think a very valid point and fully admit one of our deficiencies\nHere I mean our our investor group is the former vice chairman of Qualcomm you know guys who have built on cereal businesses and the biotech universe six cetera I'm the CEO of the largest global social impact funded a long time entrepreneur in San Diego we built businesses for Twenty years we haven't done for Twenty years give political contributions\nUm and that that's a huge distinction between the two\nUh you know you've seen a lot of endorsements where the group of developers have lined up on the other side are actually sitting on the board of the organization that's doing the voting and refusing to recuse themselves to ensure that goes right way a lot of insider politics stuff like that\nIs that when you say though that that I'm One of the arguments that I think is is is accurate and\nMay be detrimental based on I think what you're saying and tell me if I'm wrong is that you're saying that you guys are going to be quick or a\nAnd the reason you you're going to be quicker I'm not sure about a decade but maybe six seven years or is that there's more transparency more public input on the SDF you measure than yours would that be accurate I\nSo I'm so you are definitely right we're quicker and where are you going to go and you're you're also right that one of the big distinction\nHere's the sequel or a secret process so uh I think it's really informative to look at the secret process is done\nThrough want you to explain what sequel is because a lot of our lives down in what that is\nSo the California I'm a quality act basically had does two things one it provides a lot of um disclosure\nAnd so we've gone through and done all that is because we have twenty five hundred pages of ... an ounce of sitting on our website that and have a path Eighteen months to the other side's a soldier poor through um [noise] so it's a disclosure option it is also a lawsuit mechanism [laughter] or if if you kind of cut through it\nThat allows for what typically are very significant delays\nIn development and and the best example for this guy is is what the university is doing right now on campus so the University in May of this year approved the expansion for the next eleven thousand students\nNot to grow up I live in thousand students the state has to give them the money to grow and the state of giving them the money for a hundred and twenty five students here has a pretty long runway on campus right now for the justice through the process that had one secret process not to that started in two thousand and five\nAnd it got its final approval this in May of this year the courts still has to validate it goes all the lawsuits that were Thirteen Years in to that process for just one sequel approval said not to\n'em and they're now about to have the capacity to expand for the next eleven thousand students at LA\nWouldn't be such a big deal if the city went on to hook for six million bucks a year and subsidies plus it wasn't giving up you know twenty six thousand jobs every year and twenty to land a surplus\nBut the ... cost\n[noise] so if you're a sequel diehard you you don't like our plant because we're a lot faster and we're not delayed the secret process [noise] um the transparency point I've never really understood to be honest because\nThe way it will work for as the U.S us all of that decision will get made by an unelected board is yes you appointed that but a board of trustees at the theater has um at the same system that's been appointed by the governor\nThat's where it goes they make the decision as regardless of whether or not the community likes it or not and you can see that in again that's eleven thousand suit expansion of campus\nWhere they approved it and said we're going to do no traffic improvement\nAnd the city had to sue them all the way up to the Supreme Court and ultimately when the force of the University of traffic and prevents because it's not the sequel to process the traditional sort of community planning group process that people have come to know in San Diego this is an unelected board that's doing it and that still took Thirteen Years\nThat so so your argument\nIn some ways now don't get me wrong is somewhat similar to climate change\nWell let me tell you where I'm going a lot of a lot of businesses feel you know the climate change and I know this is a stretch but I'm trying to make a point and maybe not a good one but don't try and that is a you know the a lot of businesses say I want to use fuel this way because it's going to increase our profitability is going to be quicker and blah blah blah blah [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Armstrong & Getty", "city": "San Diego", "day": "07"}
