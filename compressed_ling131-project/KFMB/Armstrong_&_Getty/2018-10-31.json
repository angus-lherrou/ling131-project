we have a lot of respect around here is perhaps finest warrior leader of men in combat I have ever met\nA his credentials in the United states military are impeccable a he has led to quite an interesting life of leadership and his new book as leaders myth in reality General McChrystal joins us now how are you sir\nI'm ... oh it's our pleasure you don't just another book on leadership didn't really hold any interest for me um but then I started flipping through yours I looked at the table of contents looked at all the different styles of leadership and the leaders throughout history you took a look at now I Can't wait\nWhere your car and we really didn't want to write another book on leadership until we realized we don't think we understood leadership and so we took this one on\nWell listen let's talk a little bit about your your day job or at least you're all day job a commanding troops me in a general\nA ... you know both jacking are for military families we do a lot of work for military charities and so were you know fairly familiar with the culture um as much as civilians can be ... it's been sending me many times that the higher you rise in the military the higher ranked unless you're a soldier and the more you're a politician\nUm it was that a challenge for you\nIt's a challenge for everybody I think because you you're a socialist out of a soldier that's what you want to be that's where you identify when you find yourselves in also politics it's complicated sometimes it's a little bit distasteful I guess it's necessary business but it's not something that fits comfortably\nWill ... you still have responsibility for the the lives of well being of a hell of a lot of soldiers who are looking to you and I think it would be an awful thing to forget you're a soldier\n[noise] well that's the thing and you know they require you to represent them and sometimes you're trying to translate a pretty complicated situation of the war and something that many of the politicians have not experienced personally you're trying to put that into terms they can understand it Dr decision\nComplicated situation than a war and something that many of the

you're not in command in Afghanistan what was the biggest number of uh people you add underneath you at one point\nWhere we got two hundred and fifty thousand a NATO troops us and NATO troops and then we had about three hundred thousand Afghan forces which essentially not under my direct command but worked with us so it was a pretty significant number of people\nSo you're trying to I'm a you know you you've got ideas of what you need to do who needs to go where and do what to accomplish the goals you want to accomplish you have to run them through the politicians and then you have to have the support of the people back home that's got to really add to the difficulty\nWell that's right and you learn over time that does become utterly critical if you can't keep the support of the people back home if you can explain to political and policy leaders well enough\nThey have their support than anything else you do won't work because it just won't be built on a solid foundation and we found that in wars Korea Vietnam and whatnot that regardless of how clever your military actions maybe if you haven't got the other part trite you really can't succeed in the long term\nYou go through a whole bunch of different uh famous names in your book and talk about their leadership ... who's the greatest leader of all time\nOh boy it's an impossible question of course the leader of the leader in\nThis book that I admire the most interesting laid off as Dr Martin Luther king junior and it's not because of his cause that the civil rights causes righteous it was because his skill at taking all the disparate groups that actually made up the civil rights movement\nManaging and leading that effort against pretty stiff resistance and some tepid political support\nWas an extraordinary and yet we tend to think of him is given the I have a dream speech and yet it was really this master because he was never elected are appointed to anything [noise] he had to do it by ... scale\nSo that's a perfect example than for the for the direction I wanted to go because I've read enough about Martin Luther king junior no he didn't want to do that he he wasn't he also because we often think of leader of people having leadership bill abilities that they you know that they\nUh they indicate when they're first graders know through grade school and that sort of ... super here and they're driven to be a leader and everything like that and he didn't want to do that at all yet he wants to what is it in some people that you just born with it it's charisma what is it\nI think it's the moment actually you know obviously Dr King had good schooling good values from his father\nOr he was prepared in some ways but in reality the moment met the man the Montgomery bus crisis in December Nineteen sixty five fifty five he's at twenty six year old pastor who is suddenly asked to lead this thing which for more than a year has all the African Americans walking or getting to work other\nIf you look

of those benefits to kill us history they chose to end\nOn is ridiculous and it has to end but you can at that so that's the end of the story\nWell perhaps not the president talking about birthright citizenship what it means what it doesn't mean when it ought to mean and to further the discussion we've invited Dr ... east when did you want is ... is a professor at Chapman University feller school of law\nOr a lecturer thinker writer he also clerked for Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court which is quite non or a doctor he spent how are you sir I'm well how are you doing today excellent thank you a first for folks who are not steeped in constitutional history can you talk a little bit about how the fourteenth amendment came to be white came to be\nWell fourteenth amendment is one of the so called\nCivil war on that and ah and and this one in particular was designed to overturn that a big moment if Supreme Court decision in Dred Scott that said African Americans can't be citizens and it says was passed in Eighteenth sixty eight and it\nSays all persons born or naturalized in the United states that's the part I'm and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens\nOf the United states [noise] um and and it created automatic citizenship for the African American former slave of it also anybody who was born here and subject to our jurisdiction\nOkay well let's just go ahead and then stipulate as they say in the courts um that everybody understands the importance in the value of the fourteenth amendment for the freed slaves and and and God Bless Abraham Lincoln in the Congress I'm On the other hand how it applies in the modern day is is very different when we go there next\nWell sure that the the big fight it or what that phrase subject to the jurisdiction names and quite frankly it means something different in common parlance today that it met at the time does subject to the jurisdiction today immediately\nThanks are subject to our laws and therefore everybody that's born here maybe maybe not diplomats and foreign armies who've invaded but anybody else are subject to our laws therefore they're subject to our jurisdiction and therefore their kids are automatic citizens but that's not the understanding of the phrase at Eighteen sixty eight\nUm ... the phrase that had to maintain where'd you subject to a complete jurisdiction touches you owe allegiance to the country over your subject with what they called the mere partial or ...\nPaintings were you subject to our complete jurisdiction such as you owe allegiance to the country over your subject what to what they call it the mere partial or territorial jurisdiction that meant you had to comply with the laws all within our boundaries but but didn't know any allegiance to the country\nWhere I can explain that says a match in a British citizen comes over here as a tourist he has to comply with our traffic laws you have to drive on the right side of the road not the left but he doesn't owe allegiance to the country he's just here as a visitor at a guest or we don't we don't draft him into our army and we don't prosecute them for trees and if he takes up arms against that so we can I'm sure there are other\nLaws that he will be violating we could charge him with a but\nThat that's the understanding at the time and we don't have to speculate\nAbout that the author of the language was asked point blank are that are Native Americans the Indian ... the word they use it a time or the Indian going to be automatic citizens and he said no just means complete jurisdiction\nThey owe allegiance to their tribe and so even though they are subject to our laws are territorial jurisdiction there not automatic citizens\nThat was true for the Native Americans at the time we were you know domestic sovereign it's clearly true for for foreign nationals who continue to lead into their home country a while they're temporarily visiting here and that's even more true for people who are not legally authorized to beat her in the first place so\nWhen you have a welfare state do people get across the border you to be born and we have chain migration in and use it for that so how do we stop that\nWell I think President Trump's executive order is designed to stop that it was designed to enforce the law as written in originally understood not how many people over the last couple of decades have erroneous Lee thought it meant and Congress\nCould do this as well I you know it could it could say you know we've been acting like folks for citizens for a long time All right we're going to come first citizenship on them but by virtue of our power over naturalization an article one not because\nThey already have it under the fourteenth amendment and then we're going to correct that going forward so we get the right understanding and we can therefore adjust our immigration policy appropriately\nWell I agree with you completely but something tells me there's a there's case law that says otherwise\nThere's not there's not a single Supreme Court case and you know lower court case it says otherwise you're carrying the only\nActual holding on that is a case in Eighteen eighty four called el ... versus Wilkins it was a a a Native American who had been born on us soil and he claimed US citizenship and the Supreme Court held that because he continued to owe allegiance to his tribe\nEven though the ... was a domestic dependent solver and he was not subject to the complete jurisdiction and therefore was not a citizen what gets confusing is ... and the late Eighteen nineties a case called\n... a child of Chinese immigrants I'm left the United states and then upon his return claimed he was a citizen and he was legally entitled to return and the Supreme Court agreed but they went out of their way in that case to note that his parents were lawfully Dahmer\nFiled here they weren't just here temporarily it's temporary visitors they were ... they made this or their home\nAnd as as and and the United states had accepted them as lawfully Donald filed here we didn't let them become citizens because of a bad a treaty that we had entered into what the emperor of China but they did it's much to become part of our community are political community as they were allowed to do and the Supreme Court held that\nChild was a automatic citizen\nSo heavily in the world did we get to the state of affairs where a Chinese national can landed LAX birth of child and fly back the next day and have an American citizen and the natural follow up question and the bad can the president actually do anything about that with an executive war\nWell he can uh you know it's it's very hard to pinpoint where this change understanding occurred in the Nineteen twenties Congress passed a law giving Indian citizenship that wouldn't have been necessary if they were already citizens there were\nThere were get workers here who left after the great depression with their kids nobody claim they were citizens not tell the late Nineteen sixties steps that somehow this idea starts getting a taking root but it wasn't by any court decision it wasn't by any act of Congress it just kinda happened I think it may\nHave been something as simple and crazy as a change in a foreign down in the passport office um you know they used to require\nA knowledge about what your parents status where in order for you to claim citizenship even if you were born here and then all of a sudden they dropped that set of questions on the passport for them as you know it's it's hard to pinpoint where the error began but it's clearly an error\nInteresting well I certainly think that if the president were to sign such an executive order and I hope it will be carefully prepared um this would be in the Supreme Court pretty quickly\nI I I Would think and you know if you've got you've got um a sympathetic plan of issues are people that our own government has been telling them we're going to treat you as citizens we ought not to pull the rug out from under those folks but it's extremely important going forward\nBases that we'd get corrected and in the constitution properly interpret it\nSo that we can restore the power to Congress to this to decide as a matter of policy how much above the constitutional floor we\nWant a grant citizenship and you know and and how much not but that's a policy judgment that our constitution leaves to Congress and we ought not to let this mistaken interpretation of the fourteenth amendment does it take that power away from Congress\nSo you clerked for Clarence Thomas who famously almost never talks some behind closed doors this or is he just sit there and also\nOh no he's a he's he's one of the most gregarious people I've ever met in my life\nOh interesting why his style there at the court\nWell you know it's a it it's oftentimes difficult to actually\nHave a question that compels out an outcome determinative answers when when there is such a class in Alaska but he he can not to be one that just plays the game to be talking we're talking\nSay interesting Dr John Eastman professor at Chapman University ... school of law or doctors would really enjoyed the chat very stimulating and Well Don thank you thank you very much wider man put him in our road next ... joined go start you know what's funny is if I'm at a seminar a meeting or whatever I almost never ask questions\nI found that if I'm thinking of questions I'm not taking in the information I'm too distracted by my own\nQuestion and how to phrase it and how it might go over and stuff like that I think way too much and so I've just decided nine times out of ten I'll just sit there and listen\nSo I get why Clarence Thomas does that I Would try to portray him as stupid or uninformed or something like that on a\n\nThat point but also I Want to spread the word you said about Toyota spread the word of it right now I'll get off and say

said\nAnything that would hint at being anti Semitic so back to the sort of thing the idea that it just the idea that to oppose George Soros has to be anti Semitic would be to be like saying to oppose

an executive order I certainly\nThink that if the president were assigned such an executive order and I hope it will be carefully fared this would be in the Supreme Court pretty quickly talk and breaking news [noise]\nWe are starting to show welcome to as Michael I've got to have you to a trio of songs from\nThree consecutive albums they did a trilogy of songs about\nFear who the enemy within ... and what was the other one I Can't remember the third and it doesn't matter a civil will play those four years later\nSo uh for residents of a lot of the west coast this is I'm a jolly reminder of of Halloween fun\nHalf moon bay pumpkin capital of the world\nFarmer John's famous pumpkin patch where he grows the gigantic go words that many people enjoy and normal size the pumpkins as well farmer Jon is um is saying he needs to throw at different crop in at least part of his ground to survive economically\nAnd a lot of people around half moon bay are unhappy about uh Damon Politico writes about the economic policy for the Washington Post and has a cast his eye toward the west coast Damien welcome our user um great thanks so much for having me oh it's our pleasure so tell us about power from John in half moon bay in the pumpkins what's the former proposing\nSure so I'm former John's family bought this property bought this farm land back in the Nineteen fifties so used to grow flowers and then eventually around Twenty years ago he shifted over the pumpkins\nAnd you know hit the pumpkin business does really well he does grow sixty different varieties of pumpkins including like you mentioned the Atlantic giants they can grow you know Fifteen hundred pounds to two thousand pounds\nWow headline there are sixty different kinds of pumpkin who knew\nExactly um and um so anyway he he he does really well but the pumpkins only sell for as you can imagine six weeks a year\nAnd he's having a hard time paying the bills you know to to cover the rest of his costs so what he's telling the town is if I you know I Need to be able to grow marijuana and ... you know dilapidated greenhouses to help cover my costs and if I Can't you know it's ... it's likely that I'm going to have to sell the pumpkin farm\nAnd so the towns up in arms they they don't want to lose their beloved pumpkin farmer because as you mentioned they are they consider themselves the world's pumpkin capital but they worry about what this will\nUsher in if they allow you know marijuana to be grown in there\nThey consider themselves the world's pumpkin capital\nBut they worry about what this will usher in if they allow you know marijuana to be grown in their community could have changed the whole fabric could change the you know normalization of of marijuana for the used in that sort of thing so they're really told what to do and they're going to vote on it in November six up or down to decide whether to let him do it\nWhile multifaceted a discussion air multifaceted topic\nBecause as a property rights guys a libertarian leaning fellow I Would suggest that with marijuana legalized by the good people of California\nI'm In and buy a ample a numbers the idea that you can't draw a lawful ... crop on land you own seems ridiculous to me if it's zoned agricultural\nA you know I get there and get their sympathies I find myself wondering how many people in the half moon bay area voted thumbs up for the legalization of marijuana\nIt's a great question actually in front of the big areas of the story is sixty nine percent of the residents have half moon bay voted to legalize\nMarijuana you know fabulous yeah Kenny I had finished the article good good men can\nGuess who is in thirty one percent who voted against it [noise]\nOur man former John farmer John and so you know everyone's kind of a lot of side to this there is concern especially among the Hispanic\nCommunity that if there is you know marijuana grown and the ... in the area because it's still illegal at the federal level it could lead to you know federal raids that could lead to the deportation of you know farm workers so\nLots of different you know pressure's here and it's all coming to a head next week\n... yeah yeah and the the difficulty of dealing with money I Know is still an issue with the the pop to industry\nA talking pop and politics and money and pumpkins with Damian pull out of the Washington Post you know Damien just as an aside I received a troubling troubling report from a college student recently will not be name\nWho reported that a fellow student was indeed smoking marijuana ... with a pumpkin ... through a pumpkin\nPositive shown how would you first by way of pump by way of pumpkin yes yeah\nWell and well I can can be creative\nWhile I salute their creativity in their Halloween spirit I Do not approve of drug abuse\nHas there been any Assad Damien as\nTo the defense ability of the ... if they say no you can't grow pot we just voted on it that will surely getting the courts were those who defend property rights will fight against that decision right\nThat's true I think and this isn't being fought you know on different levels all over the state and in fact there was one area that approved the commercial growing of cannabis and then later went back and banned it and now the pot growers are suing I think it's ... county\nFor all these taxes they paid you know ... if the California has had you know the state voted to legalize recreational marijuana but now there's all these\nYou know personal fights and you know it's really um intense because people really don't know how it can change the fabric of the community they've seen what's happened and parts of Colorado where in some areas it hasn't had much of an impact in other areas there are reports of higher homelessness and\nLay currency and stuff and and so you know it's ... I think that people believe you can't put the genie back in the bottle and you haven't committed to this\nAnd you know the proposal and a half moon bay would just be for nursery plants that would not be the full you know marijuana plant that could be used but it would be the ... the plant that gets a process started and so you know there's this big fight over is that enough you know ... well that limit the damage potentially and help this farmer\nWhat will follow this one and see how it plays out it's really an interesting question about constitutional rights in spite of all the jokes about pumpkins and pot and the rest of it Damien pull out of the Washington Post covers economic policy he Damien really enjoyed it very much well done great being with if you you know I was going to bring
