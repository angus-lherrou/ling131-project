very troubled horrifying upbringing yeah yeah yeah yeah and and there but for the grace of God go a lot of oh sure sure\nThe smartest stuff are here today all comes from me [laughter] 'cause I don't know everybody else was engaged nonsense against them but so Amazon had this a part of the computer system for hiring had artificial intelligence in it\nAnd they had for years a team of Amazon reporter who has worked on software that but at the resumes job applicants in an effort to service the most likely hires\nIt gradually became hours are kind of a A R sorting down you know the few the

we had a number of alert listeners or email us a mailbag it Armstrong and getting dot com to hit close to the fact that the wonky donkey became popular after a video popped up of a Scottish grandma trying to read it to her grandson but she can't stop laughing ...\nUm it's sold out everywhere people are offering over nine hundred dollars for a ... a blah blah blah or maybe we can find that video somewhere that would be delightful wouldn't it in the midst of all this anger and\nHorror and the modern world et cetera\nSpeaking of the modern world earlier in the show we talked to Dan Balz of the Washington Post this I've been reading more of this kind of how long is this article he wrote it's like a book it's thick as a brick titled being will the Democrats wake up before twenty twenty why they have no you know firing leader and no clear message\nUm it's really interesting it's a pretty damned interesting stuff we're we're in a very fascinating\nPoint in in this democracy\nI just point out if I had to nail down dance politics I Would say is probably center leaning a little Democrat but he's ... he's he's a great journalist and the old school\nYeah yeah he's he's he's definitely from the from the old school of trying to just read what is going on right as opposed to trying to push people at a certain direction and he's got a lot in there about the Democrats have no clear message their message of or that they came up with a better deal\nI'm captured the imagination of very few voters he says they've\nGot no clear leader nobody has any idea if they're the party of Alexandria Ocasio Cortez or\nThat guy that went up in Pennsylvania when a Republican district who's about as far from hers you can get ... nobody knows which rising stars you know the future of the party they're really in disarray yet in a position likely to take our at least in the house coming up so\nEven as the Republicans rest the wrestle with a very uneasy we're the party of Trump now I\nGuess identity and he also says that a democratic strategist telling me the economy is still good Trump is going to be very difficult to beat ... which I can I can see that\nOh we're way if you're a Democrat I'll tell you this we're way overdue for a downturn\nOh cycle it's almost impossible but the the the economy continue doing this clear through the twenty twenty election\nYeah it's funny when I was in college studying economics the um\nThe business cycles were pretty uh pretty predictable I mean there are variations obviously in the historical oh my God moments um the change things but\nIf we're we're like a a a you know of a woman taking powerful hormones in disrupting her cycle um business cycles not last way way longer than they used to up up up up up up up up up up up up year after year and then ridiculous horrific crashes and\nThe rest of it so when it happens nobody knows\nUm but I could see the Dow dropping twenty percent sure and Trump will get blamed for the presidents always do get blamed for that yeah I'm sure productivity will um and the Dow\nIs not the economy never well the stock market or shouldn't even say the Dow but that was an idiotic measure the stock market the stock market is not the economy but [noise] God it's anybody's guess now anything anything anybody learned it in the twentieth century is\nA merely mildly interesting not terribly useful anymore yup oh well for all kinds of reason I'm Glad I spent that eras college money and not this year is college money I'm learning that stuff\nIt's just now amusing to me and not a higher so ah speaking of hires were discussing this off the air with Marshall I in fact we invite marshalling for this this chat um I'm getting all sorts of robo calls and letters and and hearing all sorts of ads about the various crops or propositions on the California ballot\nAnd it is my considered position that it is time to end the proposition system as it exists in California right now\nToo much democracy I Believe Dan Balz said that one time on our show\nTalking about that yeah awhile ago yeah it's ... if you have enough money and if you are a money special interests corporation near union or whatever you have plenty of money\nYou can get virtually anything on the ballot you can carefully crafted political ads some of the best smartest ads shops in California more than willing to take your money and you can convince the people of California at age twelve hundred pounds filthy hogging right is a Siamese cat\nYou don't have to convince the people California you have to convince the Eighteen percent that are going to turn up to vote yeah Wilson\nJust far to the whole deal where we're talking about that proposition ten I've been doing a lot of reading on it because in California that's proposition that would impose a more rent control across the state right it makes it permissible to really really go down the road or rent control right and most of the articles I read so far including a writer a conservative and liberal have come to the conclusion\nThat proposition ten really wouldn't make any difference at all except or it might make it worse for except except to raise housing costs for everyone\nSo again and we were talking about you know the voters the thing about it is a democracy is fine but you need intelligent voters to pull it off well good luck with that I mean the best way the\nCountry's not really a democracy it's a republic we ... we don't have straight democracy went nuts and fortunately that's what a proposition is straight demonic right put it to the masses and that's\nWhat gives you a hundred billion dollar bullshit train 'em and\nPersonally that's what a proposition is straight demonic right put it to the masses and that's what gives you a hundred billion dollar bull ship train 'em and that's the probably the most expensive example you can come up with a hundred billion dollars is conservative but I have in front of me yet another article by\nA left leaning newspaper explaining that wow\nTurns out that our previous example of the horrific cost of acquiring the real estate and the environmental law suits and the rest of it those previous horrific estimates were probably too low and meanwhile the people of Oregon Washington are considering our own bull shipped train 'em because it won't be bullet train it can't be it would be too expensive\nUm you know when I was going to warn them more than a don't\nDo it do they believe that they would have bullet train to run or a so called blue trained to run from Portland through well Washington state up to Vancouver I Believe yeah\nOh yeah you know if it is ever built and it won't be hum I Would love to take it because I Love trains I absolutely love trends but\nThat's the second chapter the darker second chapter that for after you put the kids to bed but yeah the ... the phone the ...\nVersion of won't get right yeah exactly a darker version you know it's probably worth pointing out re our previous discussion about the proposition system in California which is clearly too much democracy in it it's so easy to hoodwinked voters and the one thing or the other 'cause they're hardly attention and the turnout so low but\nI'm sure there are a lot of like right leaning California's screaming at the radio right now that's the only way we can ever get anything done yeah\nBecause the legislature share sale isn't going to do anything to the liking of even moderate ... theory anyway yeah I Know it's just a I'm a nurse would round up of crap will get past this time back to the\nFederal election and all this talk from ... in this long article about the Democrats this and that and pick in the house but you know Reagan and Bush and Obama and Clinton they all lost a house and I came back and won um turnout what's it going to be like\nNew Year's there was some gap the most in recent or maybe a gap for everybody most recent one we had twenty fourteen was the lowest since World War two was less than Seventy years turnout wow and young people get all excited all the time and tell pollsters posters are fired up and show up to big arenas but they don't vote\nYour ... your fear and loathing on the campaign trail Hunter Thompson about the Nineteen Seventy to vote in which the McGovern people were absolutely certain harness the youth vote\nAnd the young people would show up and vote him in any last forty nine states are all fifty did he win his own state and he won his own yeah so I'm ... and it's been virtually same every election cycle sense um fire up the kids are right for a few minutes but\nThen they get back to class or smoking pot or making out\nIs that the same election where Thompson created and then continue to report on some sort of drug use by one of the candidates was that the one where he fabricated something up and just kept up on every corner of and\nAll of this mix was taking a extract of the any older and they don't matter what's been going on [laughter]\nAnd it wasn't it's no no that's a great book though about politics so much of it is still relevant and it's hilarious to book raises my fingernails are growing in standing right I Can't remember [laughter]\nI don't remember them\nOh yeah yeah definitely not and then the greatest thing you've read my God so tired of his old lady which met him on the phone just shot himself on the while he was on the phone with\nHer it's dark dark voting for not all I Want to wait for a guy like him to go out yeah oh yeah [laughter] All right Michael I was over the long you're going to bring that up again oh boy that's when he got\nA ...\nWe talked about this just a week ago but the latest numbers around and it went up quite a bit in the last year so it's it is a growing problem I was mocking it last week\n...

I agree I think most of America as horrified by the now ... who's a very intelligent man has a a decided that it's\nThat banned the electorate that he must get\n'em to to launch his presidential bid and twenty twenty what she's clearly thinking about um if so that that's an interesting calculation and I think in a moral one but I I think if he thinks that sort of thing is the way to go and that will vaulted him to a popularity I think he's wrong\nSo there I'm not ready to go on this yet it's it's complicated worked for Trump in a way\nOr if it's you know this is talk of the topic and I'm not quite completely ready to go on this I was reading about this at two o'clock in the morning last night because my son said up only one who boy well my mom you never see 'em but I'm a George Will wrote an article about it and then there was yet another article and another newspaper about ... this\nUm\nAcademic story and it's getting so much attention you may have heard about on the Armstrong and get a show about those fake papers that were submitted in the grieving studies departments of a a various colleges around the country\nAbout how that that story is uh what's going on in academia Mears what's going on in our politics and it's all horrifying\nAnd I'm ... and in our society and George Will wrote about it and and there's a longer a piece about it that I wanted to bring to you that goes back to the ... the so called hoax of Nineteen Ninety six which I'd never heard about at the time\nBut it's another example of of introducing a paper to the world of academia and I'm just taking it oh yeah that makes perfectly good sense even though it was crap yeah and how it fits in with our politics but one of the things that are wondering what's the Taliban\nOr I mean how does it fit I'm the main point is that we've just abandon the idea of fact\nI Would just just a fact\nAnd reason or out the window and if it sounds good in fits the theme of our side we run with it right and some people have figured out that you can run with it\nOr because enough people will will back you up and I'm at George Will who hates Donald Trump points out some things that Donald Trump has said that uh there's there's little evidence to back up sure oh yeah all sorts of stuff\nUm uh\nBut George Will said this didn't start with Donald Trump and and uses the example of Harry Reid when Mitt Romney was running for president against Brock Obama and Harry Reid at that\nTime the leader of the Senate or the United states which has a pretty big position stated that Mitt Romney had not pay taxes in ten years right\nWith no evidence whatsoever no he just made that up and that was a huge news story in talking point for weeks\nAnd then after the election Harry Reid was asked about that you know you said that with no evidence ... what do you have to say about that he said Mitt Romney lost to me that was his only response to that he just made something up that sounded good for a giant chunk of the country and ran with it\nStrong and getting show [noise]\nRead that here is about to file for bankruptcy\nToys are there was a chance this could happen when every Sears closed five years ago [laughter]\nThat's a good joke and say that's a find understatement that's what made that funny by the way speaking of ah I can I say the joke [laughter] which killed the dream [laughter]\nWe got this tax it's a mistake to assume that the collapsing stock markets irrelevant to most of your listeners most global Bob mended retirement four one K. but I don't know we didn't from minute assume it was or suggest was relevant I don't remember suggesting that that that there are collapsing stock markets\nCollapsing absolutely the wrong word right I think that's an overstatement of all let's yeah in fact your stock market collapse as we will covered here on the Armstrong and get the show and it did not fake when my friend it is not so no yeah\n\nIt has declined somewhat in an overdue correction\nIt so that was quite a hurricane that hit the or the coasts the other day strongest in fifty years or something like a yeah yeah the Gulf of Mexico is a she isn't just a moment here I have to do just one thing that is swoops or not so fast\nSneeze no apparently not it's receded I thought it was going to sneeze with the category free for hurricane wants to pass a yeah in the Gulf of Mexico is really really warm right now and so it's a in empowering hurricanes I'm I Believe in empowering hurricane\n[laughter] um and I called them him again that's good for so for um\nEvery uh every year for the past six decades is from the good folks at National Geographic government agencies have served have received ... from concerned citizens urging preemptive attacks against hurricanes using nuclear weapons ... this is a constant\nIn America that Noah\nGets people demanding that the hurricanes be nuke and funny to me that it's such an in during idea\nUm needless to say this is not a good idea says to Noah I actually met somebody whose son works for an hour or what is NOAA the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration made it through the government whether people\nA letter you oh you have called for the preemptive jailing of meteorologist right because there are ... you know [laughter]\nI'm Sorry I liked the sentence\nA needless to say this is not a good idea says Noah in what is arguably one of the most succinct under statements on record [laughter] because the new car hurricane myth won't die Noah maintains a Web page exclusively devoted to debunk in this proposal no kidding yes\nYeah similarly the U.S Geological Survey has an online report debunking dividing rods and watered down thing\nWhich is kind of the one I don't know a water dosing is I Know dividing Rogers you have a stick and it points to where water is right it's a weed your board of of like trying to get a drink [laughter]\nPer week the board of being Thursday I don't remember what watered down thing is I've read about it but it's it's similar it's trying to find water magically positive John yet I don't think\nThe type of ... poor employed and attempts to locate groundwater military medals or or\nSo they have a five page you know dealing with\nThose stinks a that said uh the U.S Geological Survey but yeah [laughter] saying they don't work in a speech delivered at the national press club on October eleventh Nineteen sixty one\nFrancis W right goal ...\nHead of the u._s. weather bureau said he could quote\nImagined the possibility someday of exploding a nuclear bomb on a hurricane far it see now he was a government scientist um he added that the weather bureau would not be can acquiring its own nuclear arsenal quote until we know what we're doing [laughter] which is reassuring so you know sixty going on sixty years ago\n... the head of the weather bureau actually did float that idea it was really popular\nUm in in Texas uh in Nineteen sixty one after that state was struck by a category five hurricane the costs more than two billion dollars in damage I don't know if that's a I suspect in two thousand Eighteen dollars it will be many many many billions of dollars\nFor some reason when I was in grade school I think when the teachers were hung over didn't have a plan together we would watch these documentaries about major hurricanes and I just loved them I mean I just loved them yeah yeah I Know and birth a bore down on Alabama\nWho thought about what\nEditorial in the long view daily news and sixty one said could hurricane Carla have been broken up\nOr it's a bore down on Alabama who thought about what\nAn editorial in the long view daily news in sixty one said could hurricane Karl I have been broken up or greatly modified or its course turn back to see by nuclear bombs the suggestion that manmade explosions may affect hurricanes cannot be dismissed a cetera et cetera is their level of\nWeather that we uh we modern humans have never experienced it could be coming our way to maybe existed during the dinosaurs and like\nWe don't know about wow is that possible or I might\nYou know completely unknown weather phenomenon\nI suppose physics is the thing so there there are limits\nI suppose what do you have in mind I don't know like five hundred mile an hour winds I mean to me was that common ...\nTwenty five thousand years ago when temperatures would a certain level and the ... foot storm surge is something that modern man just isn't equipped for ... I don't know ...\nSo this scientist if you do know for one five to nine five gay FTC is the ... for one five to nine five K. F. T. V.\nIn Nineteen fifty nine there was something called the plow share program it was a government initiative to develop peaceful uses for nuclear weapons\nIn science and industry what other uses did they have that we are as good as turning back hurricanes some of the most infamous plow share proposals and I am going to research this uh included plans to use new to create an instant harbor on the coast of Alaska\nWow to excavate anew Panama Canal wow just nuke Panama Wow Did they not understand radiation at the time I don't think they appreciated it fully well obviously they didn't\nUm if you read that there was the name of that book I read about the guy was in the military\nOn the uh the little islands out in the ocean when they were testing the H bombs had them stand there and put under sunglasses and put on sunglasses and then explodes a slow day and age\nBomb right in front of them they didn't even put on my dad let vest thing you're not a dentist would not when you get out and they just put on the glasses 'cause I knew it was really bright\nThat what was the name of that book I remember what I Try to freaking fantastic so in the in his papers is a scientist speculators submarine\nCould travel underwater to penetrate the eye of hurricane very clever where it would launch and detonate one or more nuclear missiles the ensuing explosion would loft most of the relatively warm air and the hurricanes high above the storm into the stratosphere\nThey push up by the blast of the mushroom cloud the warm air would then be replaced by colder denser reducing the wind speed and weakening the storm\nI'll never hear the word mushroom without thinking of Donald Trump for the rest of my life for God's sake you will you stop bringing out here right\nThanks for that Sean or gets things for that Stormy Daniels\nAre just a ... for the purposes of enlightenment are the reason\nThis wouldn't work is there is not nearly enough energy in a nuclear explosion the heath release from a hurricane is equivalent to attend ... nuclear bomb exploding every twenty minutes\nTo shrink a cat five do attack to Kirk hurricane you would have to add about a half ton of air for each square yard inside the eye or a total of a bit more than half a billion tons for twenty five miles in diameter or ... you would have to carpet bomb it with nuclear weapons\n[noise] Mm that's actually we got him\nIn that that's not acceptable according to those who lack the courage to confront the hurricane men is\nJust so that was a obviously a powerful hurricane but ever since that video came out a couple of weeks ago that last hurricane where you had the reporter leaning into the wind and then people just walk behind him in flip flop he was on I think any footage series\nYeah I Know I Know and that's a shame and doesn't that relate to so many stories the A's were false reports\nRaised cynicism air for reports are no longer believe if it did make me cynical about other people's suffering terribly\nWhat's coming up your news Marshall really close call for us and Russia astronauts this morning there's a game called deportation at the heart of a controversy the California middle school\nAnd the case against Harvey Weinstein may be unravel I read that I was ...
