are you doing my stretching for the sweet spot so they all the rest of the guy fifty six years old names out\nCaesar say ... junior fifty six\nOf a venture Florida\nUh Ventura okay I'm up and throw\nOff and so here's the show he was arrested this morning at an auto zone white van the parking lot has political stickers all over somebody got a photo of the van because of the modern world is amazing got a photo of the van sometime weeks ago and it and posted the photo\nRecognized it on the news coverage since holy crap does the ... and I saw\nAnd there's like eight hundred messages and photos on the vans we'd been breaking down Sean just discovered one now that could change the story and I don't know if it fits in with the guy's name that Native Americans\nFor Trump sticker up there what is that these are say oc\nWhat if it turns out to be some sort of seminal Indian guy where does that leave us with the story where does any of those really matters because you know the assumption diseases angry white male right and that will fit in with all kinds of well the news media is praying for that that will fit in with all ... beliefs\nNative Americans for Trump would you have a Native Americans for Trump if you want a Native American I suppose you're might it's possible okay got the picture that is that that is a Native American\nOr Hispanic but if he's got Native Americans for Trump or yeah he is yeah he he has some not Caucasian answer ... district will follow like Elizabeth Warren's many all American leader he is he's a man of color legitimately yeah and we are angry men of color\nChanges the story very interesting way for your CNNs and you're in a Muslim BCS I don't know how they're\nGonna handle this American Idol is you know as long as short of what I've been trying to convey perhaps not as eloquently as I'd like is this guy and the guy who shot up the baseball practice almost killed ... changed his life forever\nYou know and and I could name a number of other people who have done things either great violence or tempting to spread fear\nThey represent only themselves oh yeah oh in it oh yeah Horton that we remember that I Wish we would otherwise otherwise ...\nA little slower to jump on stories for whatever reason uh I'd say to their credit but I'd say it's because they're going to be OK from the president first [laughter]\nCNN is saying federal authorities arrested a man in connection with packages containing suspected explosive so they're going with the rest MSNBC is going with man in his fifties detain of course they're building their whole in his fifties possibly\nA weather forty eight year old Jack or a very youthful sixty two year old back to you but they are\nBuilding their whole older white\nMale narratives sale you want to make sure they get the age in their right Fox ... discussing something on\nA kid a kid I Perry don't look so they're still going with the two suspicious packages found earlier address to Cory Booker and and James Clapper they're not at least with their\nTheir headline saying they got somebody but they do have somebody the FBI has somebody and or any details we come up with will pass you along I wanted to mention is\nA guy who's an expert in this sort of thing\nWriting for the Washington Post on why the bombs that didn't go off on a train to post blast investigator who's worked many bombing cases all the way back to the Ninety three World Trade center he says the bombs were most likely based on what he's seen not\nDesigned to go off they were designed terrifying not to kill not not to explode based on what he knows as an expert in this sort of like okay\nI think that's kind of interesting yeah I think that's pretty likely the case that many bombs not one of them went off\nRight right no ... and ... good good so\nUnlike the Unabomber packages which were cleverly disguised so the recipients would actually open them and many people got injured as we all remember these current devices were mailed are delivered in padded manila envelopes with very little effort to disguise their contents\nI'm a key I think it also can be a complete nut job right so it really is you know based on what we know so far which will change it really is just an incredibly ill conceived prank\nGo to Twitter shown on when I went unsubstantiated details from Twitter people who have no idea what they're talking about that's what I'm looking for [laughter]\nI'm In New York times had an article today this person is likely facing a hundred years in prison or our mom based on all the charges against them obviously there'd be a lot of germs are first of all just sitting in a bomb to anyone is going to get you in jail for a long time how about you and you start sending bombs to of\nFormer presidents and current senators yeah so then that added level in probably across state lines and all kinds of different ... where are we on the question of\nSome current senators yeah so then that added level in probably across state lines and all kinds of different ... where are we on the question of was the contents of the bombs actually\nAn explosive powder or or a material or former NYPD guest earlier said they're not sure yet is that what he says\nStill being tested I Believe is what he's a ... statement about if it was just cat litter it wouldn't be in the news okay gotcha thought okay is that like a hints or do I misunderstand you\nShow us Justice Department spokesperson there'll be a press conference at two thirty eastern time to discuss that's not\nEarly enough can you call them and ask them to have their earlier I was like a\nThing go early voters I say I so I just if you sent\nAuto zone at the heart the auto parts store where the man has been arrested Brownlee is an auto zone\nNot a Napa\nOr or what are the what are the other guy's whole Riley's\nPet ... pep boys not a pep boys keeping in mind is your selecting your windshield wipers who now even in my uh so anyway I just it is interesting that it is a serious serious crime to send somebody what looks like a bomb but could no more explode than you know my coffee mug but that's still a crime\nWell Hundred Years' long time in jail and since he's the guy likely in his fifties according MSNBC or there will be the rest of his life in jail can't wait to hear more about this\nTo him boy you know it's going to be the ensuing discussion that's truly annoying something\nOh yeah oh yeah oh God if there is there is any Trump paraphernalia in\nThis man's mobile home I'm ... I'm a forget\nIt and just forget it don't turn on cable [laughter] what if he turns out to be a big Bernie guy sailing sending bombs to Obama and Cory Booker I doubted\nFalse flag operation is the double reverse they're going to get your man on the street or the employee I always knew he was weird overall yeah we got to jump in here and I would like to say to the guys and it's always guys or appears to be guys who\nSend us email ... he actually walked free and this is a conspiracy against the blah blah blah or I Do is go ahead send your is a Bernie fan emails that's fine with your links to whack do Web sites that I can easily ascertain are fake\nGo ahead and send them which still could be I don't think that's why this it's it's a long shot but it's possible\nTwitter's being rate which are responsible right now I'm not seeing any sort of wild speculation\nMarjah social media check yourself yeah well I'm looking at this auto zone completely empty parking lot I'm a ...\nYou know if the guy was taken out of his house or something like that you'd have neighbors talking already and all that sort of stuff but I I think they found a way to apprehend this guy\nNobody around quickly like you were talking about earlier and um so I don't know how many\nPeople saw it are aware of it the FBI announced yesterday this was their number one priority I think when you become the FBI's number one priority get\nCaught in most cases yes if you're in the United states well it seems the FBI got in this zone jak but auto zone that's right All right so that's it the velvet it would only now like cable news we can keep saying the same thing over and over again and go to experts who might explain to sort of person who might do this we got somebody on only\nKnown who was there at the auto zone yeah Howard Stern's ... [laughter] ... [laughter]\n\nThat's of no help [noise] uh I heard I think it was Fox News yesterday they said we're now going to talk to Jim Henderson who was across the street from the post office when the packages to vice president Biden were discovered\nTell us about a gym well it was there there are a lot of police there and fire trucks and they had their lights on and uh they went into the building thank you Jim honest to goodness that was that wow\nYeah how ... cable news sonic I'm not listening to the cable news I'm watching it but I'm thinking that van that they keep showing in the parking lot of the auto zone in the van of the guy yes clearly an older van like your old style van like your good times and with the\nBig windows on the science some sort of posters are pictures or something on the windows are obscured by like a mosaic or or various posters have signs and placards he appears to have some sort of bumper stickers or something we need to zoom in on that one of those bumper stickers

particularly holy or on the whole year\nIf anything about the way it's a stupid holiday now that it's been brought up it's so obviously the smart thing to do so we moved to Washington's Birthday which was his birthday we want it to the closest Monday to be convenient to everyone but Halloween which is rooted in freaking nothing\nSometimes you have it on a Wednesday night when it's really

does if it's in every diocese jak sure seems\nLike at this woman who worked there who worked for the bishop and knew what was going on and came across some files and went to the media with them\nAnd then finally was uh was willing become even more forward and be on sixty minutes last night and talking about the bishop there\nAt the same as everywhere else I mean it's the same it's the same playbook everywhere um they they move around these priests they cover it up they never take blame if they get caught they claim they've been dealing with this for years even though I mean they've been handling the situation best they could for years even though they clearly aren't they recommend these perverse for new jobs routinely\n[noise] um but here's a little clip from sixty minutes from last night it starts with a guy who's a deacon in the church Gemini were just saying that's the job I Want to find in the Catholic Church is you can be a you can get married\nMall kids aren't Lee you can use salty language 'cause that guy Oh yes an ass and whatnot and hell and hill of course you're going to say hell as a Catholic but you have some power Indiana and that's part of that your little of the info\nI don't have faith right now that any particular bishops have the courage to do the right thing\nI mean we all praise our martyrs on Sunday then we praise and we sang\nBut boy I sure as hell is hard being a say what is your ass on the line and I want these cardinals in these bishops to start putting their ass on ally and start protecting their people\nShips holds Supreme Power in their diocese and answer only to the pope next month us bishops will gather to consider a proposal for a bishop code of conduct bishop Malone plans to\nBe there and he's refused to resign\nThe shepherd does not desert the flock at a difficult time may God who founded the church\nAnd the sherpas mates free public apology and offered to sell his eleven thousand square foot official residents to help

shouldn't take somebody I Know who's raping children\nAnd secretly move them to a different church so they can read more children and keep me on trouble I didn't know that I don't see any rules again once we have a code of conduct I'll understand what I'm supposed to do and then that Franken bishop saying now is not the time to abandon a flock\nOr you don't want to you don't want to move out of the coolest job in the world\nFor you and I'm not ... square foot house start there who decides that's a good idea\nEver to do with with the money people given the plate to the church to help the

even though there they they didn't have anything to do that because they realize that is the right thing to do you care more about your position than you do about God and helping people all that that's absolutely one hundred percent obvious clearly\nA human being so we should expect that human beings I loved\nWith a deacon was saying I Love that he was talking about it we we we worship the martyrs but to paraphrase what he was saying nobody seems among the bishops willing to take a risk to get out ahead of you know nobody and say All right here's what's been going on I ... I figured it out I found it\nHere's what it is a pope is not moving fast enough nobody sticking their neck\nOne in the whole world with this going on now since well the the the the big Boston story

that big minimum wage increases are harmful\nBecause some aspiring workers won't get jobs in will miss that first opportunity to enter the job market is unquestionably truth is one hundred percent true\nThe other type of people stuck in a trap of low wage work for these workers the system is stacked against them and they will never earned more than the minimum wage there for some policymakers believe we should increase wages because it will reduce their proper poverty\nThat is one hundred percent true there are people like that and that's sad and pathetic and the true sense of the war and it causes me sadness\nUm although we cannot design and economic system no\nAnd the jobs that they get to work could go away and then there won't be very many of them around\n... exactly yeah indeed you jumped ahead a little bit there but that's absolutely true the employers will decide well then we're not going to have anybody do it we're going to get a machine they're expensive but they are less expensive than paying\nA person and I'm going to be kind to you're a person who has no skills and shows no signs of digging ever develop any skills and this particular person you're talking about has no skills and it's not going to get any right to the point\nThe uh Seattle's city council voted twenty fourteen to increase the minimum wage Fifteen bucks over three year period researchers at the University of Washington New York University in the Amazon studied the effects on twenty five thousand low wage workers summarize 'cause we don't have a lot of time but\nThey are released to pay for a year ago and they just updated it they estimated the wage increase nine for does it harmed low skilled workers most\nUm yeah I Know that the uh they some low wage workers didn't benefit but the researchers estimate the low wages went up more in Seattle and the counties that didn't increase wages\nUm but they also noticed a drop in hours worked some workers still came out ahead working fewer hours but at a slightly higher hourly wage to make up for it those tended to be more experienced workers with more time on the job less experienced workers were more likely to end up with lower earnings overall or with no games\nThe economists also looked at rates of entry or how many people who did not work before and have no skills entered the labor market following the wage increase\nThe estimates are right after the minimum wage went up injury rates flattened and eventually fell as the minimum wage went up further suggesting less experienced workers were offered fewer opportunities for work but mine if you start at minimum\nWage job in a year or two later you're still making minimum wage you either are terrible employee of no skills\nMeanwhile in neighboring counties and free rates continued to increase before leveling off slightly in twenty Seventeen this leads him to conclude so Seattle's minimum wage ordinance appeared to have delivered higher paid to experience workers at the cost of reduced opportunity for the year inexperience\nWhat's coming on your news Marshall to caravans now the weight of the southern border as the military ramps up security we've got a moral

about um screen time for kids now banned it is or isn't a lot of people in your tech areas think it's horrible\nA lot of the people who invented this stuff Ryan worked for the companies that make their living off this stuff will model out around the kids oh yeah it's pretty interesting yeah\nAnd there was a big giant story involving Google but happened on friday but he got covered up by the pipe bomber thing oh maybe we'll get to that at some point as they paid off a whole bunch of people who had\nUm you know sexual charges against them ... ... dollars paid them off to keep it quiet and send them out the door and it just came out in the New York times article last week and a lot of Google employees are really mad about\nThat [noise] so speaking of tech the best places for tech workers live coming up yeah\nI wanted to pay this off because I'm important to know she'll pipe bomb guy he gets caught headline in the Washington Post the next day is bomb suspect outspoken supporter of Trump so the headline is that he's a supporter of Trump\nAs a mentally ill guy who lives in his van\nYou go back to a year or so ago when a guy who was a Bernie supporters shot a bunch of Republicans on a baseball field and the headline is congressman shot in Virginia they left out the whole Bernie Sanders singing the headline I don't know about the the meat of the story\nBut there you go yeah\nIt's going to be tough to bring people together and disarmed themselves when you're always attacking them right or you know counterattack so speaking of tech\nTemp to control the amount of screen time oh\nDang it was just reading some good ideas for this from that article and I was talking about I 'cause I my kids are just coming up on the\nYou know\nI Can't trust him alone with the stuff the British press picked up on an apple read it discussion which\nFeatures bemused parents sharing stories about how their kids are gaming the settings on their apple devices apple introduced a screen time feature on the new I O s um\nIt allows users to set restrictions on how much time they spent on apps scheduled downtime cetera parents can use the feature to impose restrictions on their shoulders device used or so they thought one read it share the story of how they're seven year old the game the feature sparked new chat that has nearly five hundred comments\n\nWhat I always twelve came out are limited my seven year old son screen time through the family share for a few days I felt like he was playing a bit more than he sure I can figure out why finally today my son revealed his hack when he runs out of screen time in his games get locked ... downloads a previously installed but later removed game through the cloud I\nCounted it works without limitations what can I say I'm not even madam impress Howe who's like you\nKnow yeah you got to be kind of happy about that yeah I Would be awesome yeah I live in a world we're doing that sort of thing is how you make your living\nAnother parent asks the apple support for him how to get a step ahead of their teenage son who'd reset is phones time and date trick screen time good one yeah that's amazing\nHad died in the New York times or the rhythm of Silicon Valley nannies are phone police for kids childcare contracts in Silicon valley now regularly include\nI'm a ... the nannies have to hide phones tablets computers and TV's from her kids they don't want their kids even see let alone touch or use the ... business I think that's a little over the top\nBut [noise] yeah yeah the output of their business\nIt's like the pornographer taking children the church the drug dealing and system these kids do no drugs\nHere's a guy research screen time for one of the companies when you're a big tech companies and now their daughters ages five and three have no screen time budgeted all they don't allow it at all based on this study's he's\nDone and what does the kids know regular hours that they are allowed um [noise]\nAnd so I thought it was interesting he says only during the long car ride like if we're going to talk for hours and I thought you know even that\nAnd I would let my kids doing on I'm no saint when it comes to screen time either but she's we regularly went on long drives and you know what you do you find a way to occupy your ... your mind staying out the window why so it's less hellish [laughter] which I got to believe it was really really good for you\nAnd breaking news\n[noise]\nManaged to live in New York man\n\nCountry coming up more are we about to go into some\nHellish we don't even recognize ourselves\nAnymore period we do we need some might say we're already there I mean it was quite a weekend yeah I Know\nI Know the normal people the masses as usual due out or two to three percent are controlling the conversation\nAnd manning the newsrooms of America in some cases I think most of us are are fine we're okay maybe a little whipped up maybe a little forgetful it we're all Americans in we're in this together and we have different points of view but each other's points of views are actually kind of interesting and worth listening to there's a lot of us have drifted away from that but a lot of us who\nHaven't I've considered weren't my Trump pan out and about just to see what reactions I Would be interesting yeah\nProbably unpleasant ... yeah yeah best places to live and work for tech professionals not San Francisco not even the west coast according to the computer technology industry association put out a big study\nStudy ranked locations based on job openings projected job growth and cost of living now ... all economic stuff which is fine and good especially when you're young I mean you've got to make your way\nUm but they're you know their quality of life questions Charlotte North Carolina or in the number one slot what a great place if you've never been to Charlotte it's an exceedingly pleasant city everything was\nAll of your life questions Charlotte North Carolina or in the number one slot what a great place if you've never been to Charlotte it's an exceedingly pleasant city everything was new Charlotte exceedingly pleasant that's the worst slogan ever\n[laughter] I've been there there was hardly any like fecal matter on the streets at all [laughter] I Know they're working on what it takes to be a tech hub\nThere they're trying to import who Charlotte was number one followed by Raleigh North Carolina which is another exceedingly pleasant place Raleigh Durham Chapel Hill they call it the research triangle\nUm and uh Austin chaos number three Dallas Atlanta hunters are pretty new cities\nAround for a long time but the the\nGrowth wise yeah yeah yeah a Dallas and Atlanta and Huntsville, Alabama also made the top ten what this study described as a geographically diverse list\nWhich I think anybody in tech is caught on to mean pet Pittsburgh's working like crazy on their tech sector to ah the usual suspects San jose in San Francisco number four number five\nNot surprisingly offered tech workers a higher median salary than virtually anywhere but\nWith the cost of living that in San jose is forty four percent higher\nAnd San Francisco sixty four percent higher than the national average sixty seven percent higher than the national average yeah I'm surprised it's not higher than that like a hundred percent higher I mean it's twice as expensive to live in San Francisco is virtually anywhere but you know housing is not everything\nUm that's not the only costs that people have lost a big part of it\nSo a top ranked Charlotte median tech industry salary of about eighty eight grand and the cost of living there is one percent lower than the national average huh well call it average\nUh eighty eight grand average cost of living the median IT salary in San jose is a hundred and twenty two gr\nUm\nBut again forty four percent higher than the national average cost of living boy\nSo if you're a young person you think hey I they they offered me a job out in California I think I'll take and it's forty grand morning I'm making now they're smart enough right to look into what it's going to cost to\n... I'm going to be living in somebody's garage and not the whole garage the part that's left over with the car in there [laughter] ah let's see according to study more people moved away from San Francisco than any other city in the final month last year\nGoing to it's mysterious Lee high housing prices but what was that ... that we saw that was one of the most amazing steps I've ever seen on line out of ten [laughter] yeah that yeah which\nIs Ninety percent [laughter] roughly no it was like half\nOf people were planning to move within the next year [laughter] half of the people under thirty were planning to leave the bay area within the next two years now I was wondering is that ever happened outside of being in Dresden, Germany or something has that ever happened in history or in the shadow of a ... exploding volcano [laughter] dressed in half\nHalf the people ever thought you know what I'm looking [laughter] than ever happened before\nYeah yeah Charlotte's seemed double digit population growth in the last decade uh partly due to the booming tech industry they're one of the countries keep banking centers\nYou get your Wells Fargo and bank of America ally in financial\nAs like grumble from Joe oh let's see a similar in Raleigh but a lower cost of living they have a mix of start up companies in tech giants like IBM and for rising studying projects both Raul in Charlotte to have eleven percent growth in tech sector jobs over the next five years\nYou know it's interesting is that Amazon is going to one day just announced the city and all of a sudden that'll be one of the major tech hubs in America\n[noise] oh right for their their second headquarters yeah and and my favorite aspect to that just as a a fan of politics and political science is that\nIf they pick somewhere in a purple state\nCould change the politics of that state froze they may import fifty thousand young tech workers who generally almost exclusively swing left yep I'm so that could be you know up huge in fact I Would hate that has got his wings more to the right but\nYou know what are you going to do speaking of jobs I don't know what this number means but uh the share of workers quitting their jobs in August never thought about what percentage of people quit their job and you're given month\nTate this jab shifted\nThe share walk workers quitting their jobs in August held at the highest number since two thousand one so the highest number and almost two decades two point four percent job mobility so that say because the uh unemployment\nSo low yeah exactly it's uh people are secure that if they leave their job they can find another one that will make them happy so yeah that's a sign of a high consumer confidence and job confidence which is you know which is good I have no confidence even those stock by you know I brought my own cardboard box ready\nDo we know what the stock market's doing today Sean do you have a one word stock market up there\nThe stock market is trying trying trying to trying to ... the other day we go to you for this and I keep thinking it's going to be weak meals like every day [laughter] trying pretty Brian [laughter]\n\nThe market doesn't try there's no trying and stock markets\nMarshall Philips\nHas walked in the room he vowed he's not going to buy any more lottery tickets\nUntil next year indeed you're off the launch refrain Neal here\nYes so you're I've seen them I've done that myself with the with the booze I Know plenty of friends that I'm just going to I'm going to month it's healthy I think it's a reset button a one
