history\nAre simple [noise] wow I I don't know what are uh what our national strategy is on this I don't think I don't know if anybody does um we've been friends with Saudi Arabia for ever are aware\nOf their sins pressuring them to clean up their act we have overlooked there since forever because it was on our best interest we agreed through Democrats and Republicans\nAnd now they've uh they've done this which is obviously awful um\nBut so I don't know what what are we doing we could come to the curb or what are we doing here and Blake is a senior political writer writing for the six in the Washington Post and joins us now Aaron how are you\nA very good it's going to be with us\nThank you so let's begin with the president's statement which was extraordinary in terms of diplomatic speak I mean it was a blast\nYeah I think we've seen an emerging sense from him and the White House at least say some things that are a little bit tougher uh as far as saying you know the worst cover up ever a saying that there's that lies and deception which was that the live this weekend\nA none of it of course is is aimed at particular people which I think is a key distinction here\nIf you're talking about the worst cover up ever that could be basically what those Fifteen people allegedly Fifteen people who are in the consulate\nDid to cover up what they had done to develop a Sochi allies and deception again it's not clear who he's talking about with that um so the real question here is does this get blamed on the Saudi Government the royal family and we just don't really have\nAny real answer to that question right now and I think that the fight live at the White House was walk at this point\nYeah I don't even know what the you know Republican or Democrat or conservative or liberal position is even is on this any more I mean you've got Lindsey Graham saying you know we shouldn't do business with\nMS me anymore\nThe you know Republican or Democrat or conservative or liberal position is even ... on this any more money got Lindsey Graham saying you know we shouldn't do business with them as me anymore\nAnd I'm a I don't even know I don't even know where we're headed do you have any idea\nThere's there have been a very say a select few senators who have been vocal on this generally the ones who we hear about when it comes to foreign policy people who are are certainly on the Foreign Relations committee for instance grand being one of them Bob Corker from Tennessee has also been somewhat local\nOn this uh I think that there is a real a\nStand up all sense of cautious here by a lot of American politicians are caution that I Would say is called for a we have been presented with some allegedly compelling evidence from the Turkish government but a lot of it leaked into the Turkish media are the Turkish government certainly\nHas an agenda here a year or Saudi Arabia as a as a regional rival and so you know we we don't have\nAnything from to latch onto at this point in and making it hard and fast decision about separating relations are scaling back at arm's dealer sanctioning\nSaudi Arabia in the absence of that it is very difficult thing to do so I think it's wait and see for a whole lot of people who are involved in this\nRide your colleagues turned a young and salad ... a a writing this morning a story about the Arab states are fearing instability regional instability because of this thing with all due respect to the the horror and the the personal pain that\nSome of you all at the Washington Post are feeling about Mr ... disappearance and murder 'em\nTo send the region into turmoil over it given the Saudis history seems odd to us\n[noise] yeah I I sympathize with that there are obviously competing interests here uh we made a obviously a very significant decision\nAfter nine eleven in which many of the hijackers came from Saudi Arabia to kind of not necessarily hold them directly accountable for that\nUm there are always competing interests that needs to be factored into this and I don't think that the um it kind of the critical coverage of how the Trump Administration has handled this is necessarily because you know newspapers like mine are are saying\nYou guys need to do sanctions right now uh I think the the critical coverage is in large part because\nI'm the president has as at least before this weekend in before the comments yesterday\nReally signaled a reluctance to do that under any circumstances\nYou seem to be kind of talking talking\nHis way out of eventually doing that no matter what the findings of the investigation the war and and uh you know certainly there is a clear American interest in holding out other country accountable for something like this uh and that's something that that needs to be factored into this which is I think where that that disconnect is with the administration right now\nTomorrow at that time\nComing up I Want to talk a little bit about the whole Catholic Church saying well we think behind this because I just I just got the reason I Wonder yeah yeah and I've received some pretty solid inside information oh an airline and well that\nWas that we need to talk about 'em so we'll get to that\nI you know this earlier this morning in case you're a for our listeners number one thank you Oh thank you [laughter] I'm mentioned this earlier I Do get a well known dangerous right winger\nI mean here by pledging for the rest of my natural life to follow the teachings on the topic of illegal immigration to follow the teachings of one Brock Hussein Obama you heard me Morocco by the\nStates but those who enter the country illegally and those who employ them disrespect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law\nWe simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected undocumented unchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently and lawful life or the become immigrants in this country\nI feel I'm away from\nMe didn't say that was not helpful she stabbed his other neutral Michael quite a bit of\nDrinking on the job or that is something that rock Obama said that in two thousand five now have have the politics of the Democratic party changed that much yeah five yeah absolutely look at look at the roster of people who are Democratic senators who voted for a a border wall\nWas virtually all of them\nKnow one thing because as your it's universally recognized that if we're going to control who comes in we need physical barriers in some places here's a tip for you younger people when you get a little bit older you'll be amazed at how\nWe need physical barriers in some places here's a tip for you younger people\nWhen you get a little bit older you'll be amazed at how fast time flies I Know you already since that but you have no idea [laughter] because I was in five that occurs to me is Thirteen freaking years ago things change I mean a political party changes things move different directions and then amount of time but that's quite a\nChange [noise] [noise]\nOh yes that guy couldn't get the nomination oh no he wouldn't be portrayed as a conservative Republican well if he ...\nNo doubt in you know this change I don't have a problem with it but if if Rocco bomber ran on marriages between men and a woman and which he did find the vat immigration policy no way he gets the nomination\nAs a Democrat that oh it's unbelievable which is crazy how can they change that fast\nBut it did and he would be a little rights of the center of the Republican Party who can you hear the next of our favorite clips from Obama\nSecuring the borders alone does not so immigration management\nWe're going to have to better manage legal immigration in order to and illegal immigration or senators McCain and Kennedy point us in the right direction on that point right now we've got millions of illegal immigrants live and work here without knowing\nTheir identity or background or that's part of the reason that we need a guest worker program to replace the\nFlood of illegals where they regulate of strays of illegals who enter the United states after checks\nAnd where access to labor rights part of the reason that illegal immigration a is so damaging as a vet it ends up creating a pool of workers with the press wages and no rights and that's something that we find acceptable\nSimple undeniable commonsense not only would I vote for that guy I'd raise money for him\nHe also says the illegal the same way I Do think it's because we're from the same part of the country what do you mean illegal illegal yeah oh it's funny I didn't even notice on Internet commerce site like\nHe truly legal or illegal and get your driver's license or the people said so fast sometimes you can't tell if they're saying legal or illegal so I started saying lawful or illegal it's like some people say we absolutely have to do that and he can't tell the said\nCan or [laughter] happens all the time [laughter]\nWe cannot do that I knew me clip number three high demand\nAmerican employers also need to take responsibility too often illegal immigrants or war here on the promise of a job only to receive unconscionable unconscionable your wages uh area for the cheap labor unscrupulous employers look the other way when employees present for audio after US citizenship\nDocumentation are these acts hurt both American workers and immigrants whose sole aim is to work hard and get ahead and that's why we need a simple foolproof and mandatory mechanism for all employers to check the legal status\nOf new hires and let me repeat we need strong border security at the borders but we also need a virtual border that is created by employers having to check to see if they will genuinely are legally and a\nWhile back when the Democratic party actually was standing up for what would benefit or working America as opposed to pretending to in my opinion yeah in\nSome of that was a senator Brock Obama\nBeing overly optimistic unfortunately about ah the reality of the political power to keep the legal immigration going door direction was gone right I mean 'cause that's completely reasonable what he just said almost everybody agrees with that right I mean it's just it's not even close but it can beat him so he joined them\nI guess the open borders crowd or the do nothing about it crowd a Mike Pence just made a strong statement in a tweet about this is a not not cool whoever sending around these um these packages the suspicious packages to the Clintons the Obamas\nUm and uh\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz down in Florida and CNN I mean it's really a who's who of\nA certain kind of liberal Boogie Man\nThe exactly liberal Boogie Man but we got this text it's a lefty extremist trying to sway the vote to the left by leading bombs making it looked like a right wing or craziness out there it certainly could be it's a crazy person either way I'm not gonna\n[laughter] thriller feature on the shows me trying to decide whether something is real racism or social justice warrior faking some because they're so troubled by racism they want people to be in trouble\nBecause they are so they create them and this is a very similar case has an effect as an expert in this I Will tell you it's awfully\nPerfect\nBut there are plenty of crazy people you're on all sides though he's a coin flip oh yeah I don't have enough ... I'm not going to deny there are plenty of crazy people out there\nThat by the whole world but those are both men\nAnd other than what we're playing relent and trying to figure out if it's going to land on red or black let us not forget the the two green squares that are involved China and Russia\nHave kind of all all all wear an\nExcellent point when you saw as a positive manner paranoid Sean no that's not paranoid\nThat just be that would that would be brilliant poop maneuvering it\nAnd having read was Bob biography about him he's done that very sort of thing he's actually blowing things up we have the answer\nIs actually blowing things up to make it look like the ... so he can do various thing called the FBI yeah ... ... oh move if Russia did that horrifying but really smart yeah ... I really get him in each other's throats\nRight start sending each other bombs not not real bombs non ... bombs the fact that none of them went off\nMakes it because there are four at this point three or four\nOf the three four five so there's ... there's going to Soros the and then uh the Debbie Wasserman Schultz went\nIn and then it can make a bomb spend five minutes on the Internet they didn't do very good job but they actually wanted to blow so the fact that nothing blew up tells me this is a gesture\n[noise]\nIt would be a completely over the top insanely committed and insane activists who would send actual bombs to make the other side look bad that would be way way way out there I could see an activist sending in ... bombs you know quote unquote bombs\nTo make the other side look bad so that's almost a point in that favor I model of course you know I don't know I was boy these are weird\nTo about ... how about we get in front of this before we find out whether the person's wearing a Bernie hat or a magazine that we don't paint the other side with this person I Know like a\nGood does agree complete vow to do you judge show your side by the back of your intention us and the other side by the worst of their freaks\nYeah exactly they're they're completely insane freak ... represents the other side correct in our fondest wishes represent ours right yeah so we'll go without them super 'em out and tell you about Jamie Lee Curtis or ten year addiction\nTo opioids which is kinda interesting she was a very very famous actress back in the day [noise] now she's mostly known for probiotics commercials but Saturday irregular which is no joke [noise] he's issued a new a Halloween movie it was like the largest open for a female lead in October and other small sample size to make it seem like a bigger opening\nThere's no joke is usually the new a Halloween movie\nIt was like the largest open for a female lead in October and other small sample size to make it seem like you're opening\nThank you for pointing that out Sean she's once again relative she was all the way movie while while she was a pretty face it bouncy Muslims and blood curling scream of the first one the shuttle launch the careers right but she still running away from the bad guy in this one oh yeah [noise]\nJust running away and more slowly [noise]\nWith the aid of a great deal of ibuprofen\nPut my out an before nine o'clock at night because she has to get the best\nI was thinking that coming up on the Armstrong and get a show\nOf the nation I Am Seventy six K.

export model and over three hundred horse power on the gas engine\nThere's a huge gay problem in the Catholic Church\nYou scream oh no let's pick an arms drawing and got to you know here's the problem and and Matthias gaff needs a bay area news group pointed this out I'm In part earlier this morning when we chatted with them [laughter]\nYou were supposed to be celibate if you are not sell a bit you're breaking the rules\nAre in trouble hurts your career you'll be watching more carefully and I don't know about all I really like a sex I really enjoy it\nAnd I would hate to give it up I knew that the moment I discovered it is one of the most powerful natural urges that we'd be have bright to deny it is is\nJust beyond and so here's a yeah I'm against celibacy in general but I'm not really the mole here's what I'm Talking about what the gay problem so you've got a hell of a lot of Catholic priests who are having sex\nWith sellers sometimes teenage boys sometimes pleasure sometimes just other do just sometimes ... their priests whatever but they're in a position now where they can't blow the whistle on say you know you got a Seventeen year old boy friend\nYou're not going to blow the whistle on the guy with a twelve year old boy friend if you got a twenty eight year old boyfriend you're probably not going to blow the whistle on anybody for anything because they know about your boyfriend\nAnd so there's like this gigantic mutual blackmail ring that flows down from the simply breaking the rules to ethically highly questionable to orderly unforgivable and all those three layers are protecting each other\nAnd to a large extent if that is true and I have sources close to the church who say it's a huge problem right now I'm it all really flows from celibacy I mean 'cause if all of a sudden you know you issued a blanket amnesty\nKnow what the pope I was just talking to a pope the other day you know and he said to me he said to me listen to the power to make love to their partner your choice most powerful or we shouldn't be preventing it\nYou have a boyfriend girlfriend whatever as long as they're of age you're a hundred percent in the clear no problem ... we were wrong sorry [laughter] now do you know of anybody who's doing it with kids I think he would have a huge rush to wow two out people who are doing the the the truly a holy\nAnd I've always wondered how much of the keeping this quiet covering it up has to do with the not want now to the whole gay thing whether it's media or the powerful or whatever you want to get into that difficult politically territory\nOh I Know I Know the the mainstream media are horrified to even under the words that we just hang up because\nWith all the advancements that ... you know the gay community is making society and God I mean it's unbelievable I don't think any issues ever changed as fast in human history in terms of acceptance and I'm fine with all of it I'm a\nIt was it just I think it probably just seems like what we're really taking a step backwards if we start blaming gay people for things are acting like they're doing something wrong\n[noise] [noise] yeah I Know what you're saying although the the teachings of the Catholic Church or fairly unmistakable oh yeah oh yeah their views on being ... each other you can be gay you can't you just can't gay anyone\nAnd and listen I I Know what you meant by ... with all of it all to change but you got to school here about a story here about a drag queen who came to an elementary school I think it was an ...\nI I don't think I don't I don't I don't need it being taught at the very young ages or any of that stuff now I'm not cool is that so that was a overstatement yeah yeah well but you're gay marriage in the in all no discrimination and\nIt'd being taught to the very young ages or any of that stuff no I'm not all that so that was an overstatement yeah yeah well but you're gay marriage in the you know we all know discrimination and that's all\nFantastic I Can't believe that sure and understanding a lot of people that we know we love ... that like bronco momma said what changed his mind you get to know some gay people that's what changed your mind right [laughter]\nAh but yeah what role does that play in this whole Catholic Church thing I don't know if again and then how about the people that maybe they aren't gay they're not even into the less station but they're covering up for the people that are they are what is the\nRams but that's the iron law bureaucracy what's coming abuse Marshall that we got more reports of

talking breaking news now it's Armstrong and getting [noise]\nKavanaugh fact\nKavanaugh story seems like it was a year ago you know I thought the same thing we got an email on that topic today it is still omnipresent on college campuses\nI remember I remember the time it was a how's it going to affect the midterms were there was a poll out on how it will affect the voters and I'll let you know which side is going to energize more cars energizing both sides Brad\nGarrett is ABC News news in terrorism analysts and joins us now good morning Brett how are you sir\nExcellent thank you\nSo let's start with the investigation of the mysterious devices the evidence that might be available to the investigators is quite a bit isn't there\nYou think or maybe up to nine devices at this moment then exploded so they all off or potential of DNA fingerprints other at dinner find information gives you the bombs\nHow good he is or not good at building bombs are they ... still don't really know the answer to that [noise] um and so that's a lot of potential each the other obvious thing would be how he got the packages to the locations today delivered them did he use courier service city use the postal service [laughter]\nBecause each one of those were the lend itself to to cameras in or around the facilities are at it and somebody had to interact with a human being that they were actually place perhaps we'll let him in a male stream\nOne would think if it was a legitimate courier service so they would be screaming right now what what what somebody hired us to bring something to Joe Biden's officer\n... that sounds than they'd call the FBI and I wouldn't think this would take terribly long to unravel\n[noise] you know if in fact that's actually occurred or did he use some sort of private service that surely not a mainstream or did he actually do it himself [laughter] it it it it remains to be saying actually actually how the ... got\nThere he said himself sue you assume it's a male sexism\nWell it's it's pretty much across the board males so I could be fooled\nBy nine from a white man that's what I'm\nAs it was probably in it's probably not a group\nOr different kinds of crimes and all this was an old white male crime and it just the interest of the masses ranks speculation hum rat and I are going to deal with back\nA little confused by so if if I get some PVC pipe and a clock and tape 'em together and mail them to somebody kind of looks like a bomb but it's not really technically a bomb how does that fit as a crime or whatever I mean it's supposed to go to temple\nBelieve it's a bomb right it's kinda like walking into Rob a bank with a gun and it doesn't fire either still the teller thanks it's real right so the ... still violated all sorts of potential domestic\nTerrorism laws uh transportation of explosive devices she let a gas that it may have explosive material in it perhaps but really not to either totally built or not designed to go about all\nI haven't done this but it's my understanding that with like five minutes of Google research you could come up with how to build a bomb fairly effectively he didn't try very\nHard that he ... it\nIs really bad editor is really bad at tires a in debt Nader's so we'll have to see that she is a tricky part of ... actually how you set it off\nI heard from one analyst brat who seem to have a pretty good source or do you have to take everything with a grain of salt early on especially but uh the the the timers were very much of the promos movie\nA department and then they were just tape to the middle to make it look extra balmy but that if oh that's right it was a bomb tech talking about this\nBut he said if if you're going to actually make a bomb to go off that'd be a silly way to\nDo your heard anything about the you know I have\nHeard that you know so that that that makes sense and uh so that would fit if that's true then that would fit that this was done to to terrorize people but not to arm them\nYeah exactly and if your intent was to scare people versus actually are trying to blow people up ... uh well I I Know you don't have a lot of time 'cause you're talking to everybody in America today about this but you know you have any guesses or do you have to sort of guy who guesses\nWell I make informed guesses but I don't know you know is this a guy that angry probably disenfranchised should be interpreted as a secretive place she could actually build these bombs uh and he just basically is is totally intolerant\nHow 'bout to people at random\nI hate to jump in here but we've been speculating chance of Russians do this seems like a great way for them\nI Know only the fringes to fringe e right effect\nNow this is not political I don't think but it's certainly societal the Catholic Church sex scandal or touching every neighborhood where were privileged to broadcast diocese after diocese a fasting up\nIs showing their records and letting people know the true horrors that took place we have some really interesting reaction perspective from y'all are which will do right after the top of the hour news next hour um some good perspective some interesting thoughts about the history of sexual abuse in the way it was viewed\nUm the the factors that have led to this and the Catholic Church we have some insiders saying listen I've seen some of this stuff unfold and here's the way it works\nUh it's it's really good and again we'll have that right after the top of the hour news and then I Believe during the fourth hour talked in the lead attorney who's suing the Vatican on behalf of victims in the bay area of California\nAwesome ... might be the one that changes things I Hope\nWe'll we'll say we haven't talked about the college sports scandal maybe we should get somebody on about that at some point this this might be the reckoning that has been coming for decades in college sports particularly college basketball\nI'm not I'm dimly aware of this so yeah it's it's it's taken off at a level that it never has before and this might up and everything and it should\nBe up and the fact that college basketball players are employee exploration and not just know pretending otherwise the\nWhole college sports thing is so off the rails and has been for so long you know a professional minor leagues is comedy is like the absolutely and this time it's mostly around\nThe shoe and your factors the big shoe and your factors Nike and Adidas and how much money they spend to get certain players to certain schools schools do deals with issues of course they do because where you send little Jenny or a little more to College of course they do it the giant ... billion dollar deal with a shoe manufacturer\nBecause of their sports team and that is a lot of money for the revenue whatever um\nUh but that might be coming to an end to the whole and and I read an article the other day that said this might finally be the end of the myths of the student athlete once and for all it's it's been a joke for so long right and ... and who's really getting screwed I never minded players getting money\nFrom uh from some sponsor bottom ... car it's never bothered me in the least I used\nTo get money for walking up and down store aisles to see whether we're out of a certain game and the toy department and if we were I go back into the warehouse and put that game on the show [laughter] money for is that\nWhat about the sanctity of putting tolls on the show it's just really these guys do a job that makes a lot of money for somebody\nThey deserve a cut of the student athlete thing and it does exist in some forms of course it does and it's great if there were still falling down if not character and that's interesting obviously\nNot what we're talking about right they're talking about the really big time college basketball programs particularly do Kentucky in Kansas are the ones that really under a lot of scrutiny but\nI tell you what though it is on the solvable in the era of a title nine because you're going to have the uh do basketball players in the Alabama football players getting paid and the girls lacrosse team\nOr a guy's golf team but mostly it's going to be a title nine thing with the women are going to say yeah what about us\nAnd then we're going to have to deal with it well you generate no revenue\nSo you get no revenue which is actually a perfectly reasonable way to approach it my world but there will be so many law suits the environmentalist with their phone the lawsuits are going to have to get in line weight behind the aggrieved college girls so [laughter] it would look judges\nSomebody I Know and really like a was upset that the highest paid person on a particular campus was the\nCollege basketball coach and I thought I I Hope that some economics class makes it clear why that is\nYou know how much money that history professor brings into the university\nPractically zero maybe if there are a big name a little bit but certainly not tens of millions of dollars\nLike the big time coached I don't want to be disrespectful because a lot of people's minds seem to work this way and we all have different brains and they work different ways but where did the notion come from that pay\nFinancial renew moderation piles of dollars\nReflect or should reflect your particular version of moral worse or like quote unquote importance\n... ... where did you get the idea that it's about what you think let me ... let me make a strong statement on that will hurt people's fear oh no I Hope it won't lead to a fake bombing\nAnybody whoever says you have football players will get thirty million dollars a year and a teacher and get sixty thousand dollars a year anybody who says that with a tone of voice or doesn't understand the way that is you are an idiot oh\nThat's not fair because your your brain power might be of of of normal ability right but you are ... uninformed only sadly lacking in sight see Julie settled on that how can you possibly run I bring people together possibly not noodles that true yeah\nMe a big brain of course I knew that removing removing a ration moderation yes sliver money paid for workers\nTrue yeah now me a big brain of course I knew that remind removing a ration moderation yes sliver money paid for workers service I did not have to Google that the figure that out but I just wanted to let listeners know there may be driving not able to Google what that meant right I'm Sorry I didn't have to go and I'm very smart at some of the gate a dictionary [laughter] one\nOf them are one of the problems obviously is if you got a a a a basketball team\nThat is regularly you know well number one in the country and you generate tens of millions of dollars and and they're really ends of dollars worth of people were in that guy's Jersey with his freaking name on it when he gets zero kind of it yeah that's a weird to\nNot only zero cuts but they also forbidden to go get an actual job so you're you're generating all this money it's not even that just a hand up but you can't even go get a ... for reasons that exist by that you can't get a job because I it is I daresay\nOn American for so when they finally might be coming to an end speaking a college is that what do you have some of the year ... jumping into a one entertainment note I wanted to make ... leave the Caprio is joining up with Martin Scorsese again I Love it when they team up\nThey've made some really fantastic movies to make a great book into a
