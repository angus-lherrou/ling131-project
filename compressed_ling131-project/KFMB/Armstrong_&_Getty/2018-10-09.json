now just an oversight okay [noise]\nYou know and I'm supposed to believe that will be going into greater depth on that story a little bit later on it is being called the Taylor Swift effect according to vote dot org there was a significant increase in voter registration after Taylor Swift waded into politics endorsing Tennessee Democrats running for the Senate and\nThe house so in a twenty four hour tell us that came out and talked about voting and encouraged people to go and said she plans to vote for\nA there has been sixty five thousand more voter registration national okay for August never fifty six out entire month of all they have a lot in the twenty four hours and she talked about five thousand\nYou know maybe I just hate living in a World War Taylor Swift could have that sort of effect but it would like to point out that she made that announcement at the same time that we just went through the most polarizing story in America since Watergate which motivated a hell of a lot of people\nAnd people's interest went from like fifty percent of people are interested at motivated her to talk of riot police out at first but maybe they were motivated by the same thing that motivated and that's that's what I'm saying the extreme interest went from about fifty percent to eighty seven percent on both sides\nAnd I don't think that was all Taylor Swift I think it was most polarizing story in in ... and a half century like that's it [noise]\n... what is Katy Perry saying she's on the left side she has actually said that she was actually come out and supportive sailors

so we all want to be happy right yes place you're happy and you know there is what I suggest you [laughter] clap your hands [noise] um and I said is Everytime happiness comes up read the art of happiness by the Dalai Lama one of the best things I've ever read my life\nSo oh I've got a couple of books on happiness in fact I think one of them is called on happiness or just happiness we interviewed the book and then I met him this would be better if I had the ... name in a twist through\nThe ... being happy is actually being selfish if you look at it that way you just you just have to be smart enough to understand what stuff's gonna make you happy right right yeah and not being selfish is the most ... thing you can do\nIs don't be selfish [laughter] that's what will make you happy I'm but I'm really confused focusing on ah pleasures and stuff like that will make you happy it just doesn't never has throughout history right\nAccording to one several a couple of all all of the great philosophies\nRight right so do the selfish thing that's going to make you happy which is to be unselfish ... yeah exactly\nThat too much of a twist through that's the way I look at it it's crazy um but here they've got the uh people that study this in a more of er um I don't analytical sort of way over the years happiness researchers have consistently found that happiness usually follows a U shaped curve throughout the course of a person's life\nPeople are happy and satisfied with their lives when they're young that drops off considerably in middle age when you're doing the whole job child rearing thing\nThen makes a U turn and head back up and you're late fifties if you had kids earlier than I did I'm sure a and beyond when the kids move out and work starts to wind down that's when the happiness trend starts to get back up to where or when you were young Mm\nThat tends to be the case for most people I think I'm In the weirdly dislocated kids just left period so uh my you should be heading north words so exactly oh this kind of\nGone willing this kinda fits in with this study that parents have a on average thirty two minutes to themselves per day\nUm\n[noise] do you have kids and feel like you never have any time to yourself and you know losing you really don't and there's new survey or which some are calling depressing I don't know I find that the average parent has thirty two minutes to him or herself each day\nDid account driving [noise] probably okay that's the the only time I have to myself is one of them in my car getting to work and back like move further away [laughter] you know some\nPeople get myself more time I mean my mother radio ranch uh-huh\nUm how would Nebraska suit you the survey found that ... of about a third of parents don't get it won't be have an Eighteen hundred Michael commute [laughter]\nAnyway I'm Sorry you were saying they found that one out of three parents doesn't get done working using my finger quotes until eight pm each day I'm usually going past that you know when those issued a lean in that cetera et cetera usually until I go to bed I'm\n\nAnd a [laughter] a a quarter of respondents said they hid from their kids an average of four times per week actually hide [laughter]\nWhat I've I haven't done that with some of them were playing hide and seek but it's right there in the name well and you got a bigger place than I ever did you can do that successfully [laughter]\nMe try swaying\nSo that fits in with this whole U shaped thing though right [noise] um\nThat would be the part of life where you're on the people say they're less satisfied with their lives and they have less time to ... I guess yeah I could see\nThat I ... I Would hate to portray those years of my life is like not\nIt's time once again for another am seven fifty\nGoing over\nOf the San Diego for for resorts to grab a taco with your favorite post at five

Nikki Haley ambassador to the un has resigned leaving the administration with one less moderate Republican boys\nYou don't know who can replace or with how do you know that Ryan\n... the un yeah exactly meaningless debating society exactly so a lot of good stuff to squeeze in the show and we will bring you the president's words\nUh when they occur or right after so you won't miss them Doris Day to\nUh right now though a couple of highlights from our conversation with Ken Starr who many you remember is the special counsel which was a little different than it is these days like ah the Mueller probe\nJust in terms of the specifics of law but anyway he ... he had a similar role in investigating the Clintons originally the whitewater scandal which was a completely mobbed up real estate deal in Arkansas\nMindy investigation mutate in a couple of different ways and ended up with sexual harassment Paula Jones lying under oath and the impeachment\nOf the boat is the president was actually impeached and uh we we opened up poop not surprising to me with a discussion of the book number one place the use of the term contempt and the title is not like technical contempt of court you're talking about being couldn't time she was tell us about Hillary as a witness\nHillary as a witness as Iraq how in the book was in my judgment my opinion Jewish making a mockery of the rule of law in contrast to bill who at least President Clinton at least seemed to be making any effort to be responsive to our questions during\nThe trailer wind ski course investigation there's ...\nShe was just a A R demeanor or her answers that constant I don't recall that I recall but she said that we all\nDo recall everything that happened to us that goes without saying we're just human ... but the way she praised her doctor I recall was robotic\nMechanical at on\nBelievable she became a non credible witness and that was part of our reason really carefully evaluating do we want to go forward with an indictment now in fairness dumb is close to Hillary we decided we did not have sufficient evidence\nTo me Justice Department ... ethically present that\nThat in ... but the point is we felt that she had committed offenses crimes in Arkansas and we felt that her faint memory loss was so colossal\nThat was simply beyond belief no one can forget if especially some of the things that a shape purported not remember we're just not credible\nA job or you're not going to now\nIt's just interesting that that was her brand for so long\nYeah yeah well she hard half\nA no doubt about that even the president was forced to concede on the debate stage she's tough you know uh so we also talked about and this is such an interesting part of the law in and we'll be flushed out in the days to come I'm sure I can the president be sued privately while he's in office skinny being guided arrested\nUm would that lead the chaos in paralysis we talked to the concern about that to clip number four\nI Do believe that the president of United States says is at eight percent\nIs subject to a diet but ah we don't want to see that obviously we oughta\nI'll I'll say as someone who loves his country I Want to present to succeed and they're able to do his or her job is the case may be the same time I was a system in which the press is subject to a ball and the rule of law so\nI've always thought of that view I continue to be at that you about what judge Kavanaugh\nNow justice kept a very happy about that very thing that it's had a happy ... of this this horrible process just horrible over the past several weeks budgets chat with out by virtue of their service\nUh and executive branches other 'cause Bush a forty ...\nUh and then reflected on all this as a judge has written that Congress should take a look at these issues of the\nPresident's being subjected to civil law says ... to ... so forth and so all of that issue is laws says faded into the history of this story cut the ... process all chit chat with I was saying I read\nIs that a soda larvae article as these are important issues Congress should take a look at them and perhaps give the press United States a timeout he

like I was kicked in the head by a meal although I'm fine I'm there wasn't too terrible but it's weird I feel like I'm hung over although I hadn't marry a drop last night\nI feel like I've had a concussion really just don't want to move very fast course when do I I'm just comes out of nowhere yeah boy as mysterious one last night too I worked out I was digging some TV and all of a sudden things started disappearing in front of my eyes scary anyway\nBut I'm finally read this editorial this warning which to my surprise appeared in the u._s._a. today\nUm at least on line it's written by a a\nA woman by the name of Kelsey ... who's an opinion contributor and I'm going to read most of it for you [noise] um for a couple of reasons number one I thought it took tremendous courage to write it\n\nAnd I don't want anybody to think I'm just sharing it with you because if it happens to fit my world view 'cause it's a it's just it's a very good\nShe writes a belief or based on feeling the doctor Christine Blasey Ford's testimony would have won me over I was unable to stop the tears as for described the days following the alleged assault by stating she'd convinced herself that because she wasn't rape she should just move on and just pretend it didn't happen that's quote\nWhether or not she's telling the truth about these allegations the feelings that she identified are very real for survivors of sexual assault I noticed because I Am one\nUm and then she describes at length that she was at a party as a sixteen year old and there was an adult male who used to hang around the party supplying alcohol\nAnd that she woke up to being raped or sexually molested in some way and then he continued even as she was awake\nUm\nUnfortunately I just uh she did not report it\nI'm a ultimately a justified it the way for describe just move on and just pretend it didn't happen and now look back at this time in my life with such empathy for that teenage girl I used to be\nAnd if I'm honest with regret I Wish I had come forward to seek justice I Wish that this man who assaulted me while I slept and continue to salt me long after I had awakened would've faced consequences of some kind of often shoulder guilt for my silence wondering how many other girls he might have abused after me\n\nAnd she describes the reasons people have for not reporting sexual assault fear of a broken system social stigma not wanting to relive the trauma of painfully public way\nI'm In my mind that balance these fears with the knowledge that each passing day my story became less credible is any evidence would have that would have existed would soon disappear [noise] it is also difficult to make these judgments when you're in shock and your mind is still reeling I get it\nBut even though I regret not coming forward I Am thankful that I cannot today walk into a courtroom named my attacker and condemn a man for life because of what happened fourteen years ago\nI said this not because it wouldn't be justified and not because he didn't deserve it but because I Would not have a single shred of hard evidence to support my story I'm a sexual assault survivor and I don't want you to just take my word for it\nAnd there is nothing more terrifying than living in a world where unsubstantiated allegations are accepted as truth just ask someone in North Korea\nThere must be a standard otherwise known as safe from having the life destroyed by wayward accusation due process is not an obstruction of justice it is a foundation of the American rule of law was meant to be a barrier to hasty judgment and conviction by public opinion\nUh she goes on than in that mode and in some detail you know I can hit you with more of it but I thought that was gutsy thing to say and it also it represents the point of view that many many women who listen to the show have sent us but guys are\nReally afraid to say it out loud yeah I I don't think we would end up like North Korea the old Soviet Union I think it would go back to people don't believe women again I think that's where we'd end up\nBusiness needs fast secure networks to be efficient and profitable detail can help you

short too long been raped a and a bunch of pictures to a vote slumped over drug addicts among other things yeah\nUm but they uh mentioned back to some of these statistics which will shock you the city's replaced more than three hundred lamp posts corroded by human and dog year and over the last three years\nAnd say if it's more than two feet up it's human according to San Francisco public utilities commission\nMen how much do you have to urinate on a lamppost before to\nDegrades quite a bit I'm guessing\nCurrently conducting a non official or sanction study at a lamppost by one of my uh favorite spots I'll let you know no progress yeah\nKeep us an eight year old and strong flushing the polls became more urgent after one collapsed crushing car and I remember that team member that how about the thousands of heroin needles discarded by users and we're talking this thousands the public works department in a non profit organization and the tenderloin\nPicked up a hundred thousand needles from the streets over the last year\nThat's just them the public health department which has its own needle recovery program\nOr retrieve one hundred and sixty four thousand needles in August alone that's incredible hosts through disposal program and through St clean up's that's incredible\nHundred and sixty four thousand in a month that's one organization\nNumber of people they met on hide street distinguish between the residents of the tender line many of them immigrant families and those they called strict people on shelter drug users of congregate in camp along the sidewalks and the dealers who pedaled crack cocaine heroin or variety of amphetamines\nDisputes among street people a street population of common sometimes result violence at night bodies lined the sidewalks I don't think they mean bodies bodies but\nA flight the land of the living dead set a resident who they talked to for a while and thinks that the city is just allowing it to go crazy and the tender line so it doesn't go elsewhere\nYeah that's the that's the Vancouver model I remember when I went to Vancouver years ago and I read about\nTheir area of town where they I think they they hand out needles there and all that sort of stuff and they tried to keep it contained and I went over to that area of town because there was actually a\nCool music club over there but it was just disgusting the rest of and Hoover was just glittering beautiful ... now one neighborhood was disgusting I'd never seen anything like that Twenty years ago now you can see it in San Francisco right I've never seen anything like that in the United states and interesting strategy yeah it is\nWhat will make one area is just ... just you wouldn't want to do their right to make the other part of the city cleaner dung bird\nIn San Francisco you as yet hasn't figured out the and the rest of the city's cleaner parts\nSo they uh they're they're halfway there are so many many thousands of arrest Gavin Newsom former a mayor of San Francisco and leading candidate for governor next month's election God help us that's an editorial opinion I'd like to apologize for injecting it\nHe told the San Francisco ... uh the editorial board last week that the city had reached a point of enough is enough and I'm quoting you can be to permissive and I happen to think we've crossed that threshold in this state and not just in this city you see it as just disgraceful them\nBut I'm Glad to hear him say that it's a fault for one thing it's a true and I think politically expedient because as I talked about many times even left leaning cities have said All right that's it\nYeah oh yeah you know I Wish\nList and leaning what what do I mean dominated by the most utopian of people have said that's enough right\nGavin would run his Gavin on what he actually believes of course that would be a hell of a thing for a politician to do and I realize this is the new young and naive and utopian than gas but\nBecause he's ... we know in a little bit and he's he's a practical guy but he understands politics and understands how to get the union money and the rest of it so he's you know advocating some things that are just on completely out of work\nWell when he runs for president which I think he's going to do and he's trying to appeal for a broader swath of America it'll be interesting\nTo see a moderate\nWe need to talk to me or London Breed who has done some really interesting things that you know when there's plenty will disagree about which is she's a a an energetic and um and and I think she's a serious woman about a gig\nOn she has some announced plans to provide initial thousand beds for homeless over the next two years which will probably just draw another thousand homeless people from elsewhere absolutely I'm a including you know elsewhere in northern California but I'm she's also this is a really oh go ahead I wouldn't\nBe in favor of spending this kind of money on the problem even if you had borders for cities um but if you don't have borders\nForget ... what's what are you what are you trying to do right right [noise]\nIt's like your town passing a green emissions laws you know it's a waste of time just you know richer signaling but she's targeting a relatively small group of people living on the streets who she says her beyond the point of assisting themselves\nThis concept the concept of this involuntary removal was known as conservators ship law recently passed in Sacramento strengthens the city's powers of conservative ship with a judge's permission\nShe says the mayor
