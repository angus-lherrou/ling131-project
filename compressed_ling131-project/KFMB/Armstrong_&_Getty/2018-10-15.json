actually a reference to Larry Hoover I Do believe yes to things on the clips of the week a senator Collins that little speech we played that a Monday that seems like that had to have been a couple of months ago right not earlier this week that we were talking about the Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd the thing in there about the national debt that might have been the most important things that all week long that I didn't hear any more but the show no nobody cares about anywhere we spend more money on our military than every other country in the world added up\nTogether except for a couple and we're about to surpass that was paying interest on our debt\nYeah oh that's incredible or a crack head\nAs a nation we are a crack head will remain split early ... you know irresponsible\nSpending more

seem possible you would never let it get that far right right\nYeah I mean yeah it's just astonishing but nobody wants to hear it so moving along a so this Larry Hoover character that Tonya a mention specifically in in ...\nI'm In city ought to be freed if you were following really closely to his long rent it it really needed to be ... counties whole rant you know with footnotes and stuff that you could click on and go to an explanation of a timeline\nOf like a turn to you know movies you would jump forward then circled back to points that he made three minutes or do we like time altogether and\nYeah it was like reading great literature that from the past where you have to look up constantly look up references to have any idea what they're talking about night\nRyan says he mentioned this person I just some wherever that is yeah well this guy was the leader of the gangster disciples\nIn Chicago with gigantic street gang\nUm many many people killed huge drug rang\nIn this guy a Hoover went to prison I'm\nSaid the guy prosecuting them Larry Hoover and the largest monolithic gangs ever existed in our country was again that was responsible for over a hundred million dollars in drugs as sales in Illinois alone offering the twenty eight states it was singlehandedly responsible for hundreds of murders and the city of Chicago\nAnd this guy was in state prison on a murder conviction in the nineties when he got community awards for re branding the gangster disciples the GEDs as an organization committed to growth and development and they even supporting candidates for the government and that\nSort of thing he was saying I can reach your kids let me out of jail ever formed\nA ... at that time he was secretly over in prison plotting violence to support his continuing drug sales ... yeah and in Ninety Seventy is convicted in federal court or running a drug enterprise from state prison he's being held in the federal supermax in Colorado which also houses the Unabomber ten because Ted Kaczynski\nHence the reference to a trap door\nThat leads to ending up next to the Unabomber I guess for a guy in Chicago didn't have a dad or something but\nI'm not here to refute ... philosophies I don't think you know I just think it's thought provoking the reason I bring it up one of the reasons is that\nWas the chairman of the gangster disciples had thirty thousand members in it's heyday thirty thousand he ran wind like a corporation that had a board of directors thirty thousand well you'd have to have a structure right with the board of directors that controlled thousands of soldiers\nAnd in parts of Philly we're a it was good it was a good ride it reminded me that those places exist and it was I don't do to them in my car lord knows on foot so\nI was like okay I got down to ... you could fill a giant football stadium with the junkies from ... county yeah I'd like to have somebody take me through there just to see it but it's got to be mind blowing\nBoy and the idea of you get hooked on the ... for whatever reason bad judgment you thought you were taking something else that you thought you were just doing heroin just doing heroin and now you know way to stop your dad that's how you stop that's a rough situation 'cause you'd think it could put people in like a medically induced coma\nOf course that would probably be monumental expansive two hundred thousand dollars per person yeah and a half\nOf them when they come out of the great you wake up in a month and a half of them come out of it and go back to it anyway yeah yeah right it's the nature of addiction right ... uh the we we we gotta make selling ... know like a death penalty primarily that was the idea was crack cocaine\nBut then they said well it's mostly black people who buy and sell crack is posed a powder cocaine so that's racist\nThe idea was that this stuff kills so quickly and it's so terrible sentinels killing everybody how about we uh\nWe all come

because we're all ... and our sons and more by ourselves and then suddenly the sun's gone down in the days over that's a huge part of it it turns out if you go from two hundred five hundred social

soccer burns of the world the Twitter people maple exploited this need we have for new information or\nOr or or belonging news or whatever it is always yeah now similar to the food we're getting a whole bunch of empty calories with a little bit of what seems like immediate satisfaction\nBut no nutrition ended is pushed aside in the same way that an entire bag of potato chips will push aside the desire for a lean meat vegetables and and and the rest of it that fake connectedness pushes aside\nAs the interviewer pointed out and just you lose the hours of the day it's pushed aside real interaction and I I'm telling you when you get down to the real biological bases that some of the things that make us happy some of them are a little animal ... as you were saying before\nBut I I've developed this theory that a lot of our satisfaction enjoying life\nIs is a deeply biological and if I talk to you on the phone\nFor a good long time that's a pretty good substitute for being with you

why the economy strong and going to be great I Hope he's right but he's gassing ... and and so are people who said the downturn is going to be horrible or people will say there's going to be a downturn but not as bad as they're all guessing and it's it's really the classic a stop the clock is right twice a day principle chore that\nAfter every economic boom or bust the person that\nPredicted it is hailed as a genius fright and listen to until they're completely wrong in the next time\nMhm mhm but ah\nI'm not happy with I heard I saw on the other day the housing market is going to collapse right and but they said it won't be as bad as two thousand seven well I Would freak can hope not since I was one of the worst things that's happened in our nation's history yeah I Hope it's not as bad but anyway what are you going to do well whatever's going to happen it's gonna happen\n[noise] um or is it but they ask people to pick up the ... gene that best describes their

[laughter]\nAnd a gory [laughter]\nYour favorite thing ever anything yeah talking about anything a cubs when the series birds of my children no second rely on whatever this is the best thing ever all yet clearly so I'm [laughter]\nI'm reading the New York times over the weekend night came across this from an old guys guys almost nine years old and he um a\nHe's a gym rat he he really works hard to stay in shape physically ... try and beat the clock it for him and he decided he's been doing it wrong focusing way too much on the physical body and not um his mental health in terms of uh dealing with getting older\nWhich were all doing every single day interesting is that\nWhat is it a friend of mine said the other day I already freaked me out with the economic stuff now you're going to worry me about growing old\nFriend of mine said yesterday said I invented the time machine that only goes forward do what normal speed\n[laughter] rate\nBut we are all getting older every single day I'll read a little is from him some of my healthiest friends and I'm I'm On the wrong side of this I'm with him and congratulations to him for admitting\nThat he's doing it wrong and that he doesn't have the attitude some of his friends have I'm In the in the wrong category also some of my healthiest friends carry themselves as victims abused by time\nThey see life is a parade of disappointments aches and ailments confusing technology children who don't visit and her doctors I'm more in that camp unfortunately I think that's the way maybe I can turn it around\nI'm not that old but uh I I I Do spend too much time thinking about how things are just getting worse all the time my body's breaking down it just never ends\nOther friends many who's aching knees and hips are the least of their physical problems find comfort in their ability to accept old age is just another stage of life to deal with\nI Would use the word harrowing to describe the way they cope with aging as a drain strength from their minds and bodies so they would quickly dismissed such a tournament is an overstatement\nOne such friend recently called from a hospital and tell me of a sudden brain seizure that had rendered him legally blind interrupted me as I began telling him how terribly sorry was he said Bob it could've been a lot worse I could have been deaf instead of blind\nDespite all the time I spent lifting weights and exercising I realized I lacked the strength to said those words it's suddenly struck me that I paid a price for being a gym rat\nBut there's one characteristic common to friends who are aging with a graceful acceptance of life so salt it is contentment\nSome with life altering disability my blind friend another with two percent of legs are more serene and complain less than those with minor ailments they accept the uncertainties of old age without surrendering to them if you told me that the wisdom they've acquired over the years has made\nA aging easier to navigate the chaos of adolescence that's interesting people will say I'm actually happier now Mm [noise] yeah I understand that\nIt was clear that I laughed and had to find contentment those friends that attained the hours I spent exercising had given me competence but not\nContent\nBut that was really interesting the the title of it is the secret to aging will contentment despite having many friends in their seventies eighties and nineties I've been far too slow to realize that how we respond aging is a choice made the mind not in the gym\n[noise] yes yeah yeah well that's that's clearly true some of us have an easier time achieving certain mindset than others of us and I know you know what I'm Talking about in terms of ... we're born\nTo a certain emotional set of characteristics\nYou cannot if you're a hyper competitive hot head be as serene as a summer breeze like somebody who was born that way you can work your way more toward that but whether you can get ten percent closer eighty percent closer I don't know if you know it depends on the question\nIf you've ever looking for in different senator guy can get through any difference in a hurry I got you know it was interesting has got to work really hard to hold off the physical part of old age and I was looking around him and his other old friends and they were they were happier than him yeah and their bodies were falling apart right means thinking why aren't you unhappy\nYou can't even ... voice better attitude sure huh different priorities but I don't\nI don't know it it's hard it's hard it's hard so hard to argue [laughter] you're bringing me down ... down you know this was that there's something happening this is a this was supposed to bring you are the ones that tend like it's not about aging yes yeah right here and and potential housing catastrophe [laughter]\nComic downturns oh yeah this thick may on the ... you know what I'm reading I'm dreading the economic downturn that is going to happen you know why\nBecause they always happen that's just the way it works or read a book if you don't look I mean but when it happens wing it all on Trump no\nI suppose you could say well he's taking all the credit for the term that started one bronco bomber was depressed\nSo maybe that would be an argument for blaming it on your item\nBut they they go up to go down presidents tend to get to stay in office or get booted out of office depending on the timing of when the election happens with the ... and now they're not saying they have no control over the obviously they do\nIt too much of a lame though yeah government policy does having an influence on the economy but it's gonna it's gonna go up and down no matter what justice shore\nYeah yeah yeah that that conversation is a little tiring honestly a whole president responsible for the economy thing I'm getting ... he said what how much time do we have Michael okay maybe the\nThing to think about the old stuff is if you got a friend who can still run a marathon or do fifty push ups or whatever assuming it's miserable\nLike this old yes or go behind his back in and make him miserable\nEngaging subterfuge sabotage while I was there and misery is your joy in about ... zero sum game not physically happiness that's exactly [laughter] but as my on happiness [laughter] message I yes okay yes [laughter]\nSo there's just no time to do this ah this was sent\nAlong by Katie I'm who who points out that in the California Constitution which has written in Eighteen eighty that the the main part of a Jerry Brown out of hand and then uh this right he was there um it says that\nEvery native male citizen of the United states every male person who show acquire the right decision ship goes on and on and it makes clear no native of China\nNo idiot\nNo one ... Harrison convicted of any infamous crime can vote\nAmong other things how do they define it is a well defined it for you because I looked it up the lock your keys and your car more than twice\nActually is from I ... [noise]\nNo I have all of the old time he definitions of\nIdiots more on him it was so\nI'm a dollar is that on there\nIf you have to ask your dollars [laughter] that's coming up your news Marshall Hillary on the hot seat for comments about the Lewinsky scandal near miss in San Francisco was almost the worst air accidents in the history\nWhy are you turn to Trump we're asking you this is your husband [laughter] the sort of thing a lot of times so that that's a tough one I I honestly have gone back and forth over this over the years 'cause the guy and you take the Clintons out of it so you don't have the political starts a guy a really powerful guy who is what almost fifty at that\nTime about John Kennedy for I'm I'm a ... I don't know politics is a guy you know okay he's a powerful CEOs ... mother got a lot of money and power All right I got a guy I'm picturing them right now he fixes up to twenty two year old at work she wouldn't have him what am I\nWhat we've seen that guy is he doing something different guy go ahead fuzzy doing something well she doesn't even work they're just in general yeah is he doing something wrong I mean it's a little predatory he doesn't have\nHer best interest in mind no no it's a little predatory and it's as old as time I rarely have my best interest than mine were right so yeah I was going to get the flip side of that because\nYou know you don't know what her intentions are\nYou know I I Know women who've had the variety of things that they don't regret think were perfectly fine or even if they do regret a million dollars what was I thinking is the extent of it yeah it's not her right right [noise]\nWhich ... you know brings us back to the modern trend toward catastrophe rising everything she can claim to be a victim of something horrific even if it was just you know the kind of knocks we all take in life\nI think you're that guy you're that fifty year old guy and she is well she's she's drunk at a bar and you take advantage you're I think that's incredibly on cool you know exactly what you're doing the right and she doesn't if she's like in a in a place in her life where she's not\nHealthy that's not that's definitely a lot of cool but I got the flu or what well just like I don't know her dad just died or whatever or Cranston sandwich I think that's really really unquote but in general Monica Lewinsky seem to be fine\nShe's often D.C starting her life she's twenty two she made a conscious decision on why isn't the way the twenty two year olds are unwise right I don't\nThink I may already on him I don't think that's will be an abuse of power I think it's\nBorderline I think it's a terrible lack of self control on the part of a Billy Jeff I'm\nLike no and I find the idea that he should have resigned at the time absolutely ridiculous\nWe can't have the executive branch of the government torn apart because two consenting adults were having sex particularly given the history of the thing that doesn't mean I like it doesn't mean I'm ... I approve of it doesn't mean I Would do it but I find that question would be ridiculous\nNow according to the world's preeminent superpower and we're going to just tear up the government because like I had an affair no no I don't care what party not according\nTo the official report just released it turns out a near miss involving an Air Canada plane that almost landed on a crowded runway last year in San Francisco international would have been the worst aviation accident in the history\nThe hair Canada Airbus was a hundred and forty people on board it was clear to land just before midnight and July of last year but the pilots mistakenly lined up for the wrong a taxi way where for planes were waiting to take off\nYour plane descended to an altitude of a hundred feet above the ground level clothes and over flew the first airplane and the taxi way then the crew initiated a go around the plane reached a minimum altitude of about sixty feet in over flew a second airplane on the taxiway\nPrinted and why did they not land who who who said holy crap air traffic control got word of the ... except for one of the pilots on the ground war the tower that Air Canada played blue directly over us that immediately tower told the Air Canada pilot not the land not bland close close close call [noise]\nAh because I studied at the school of George Carlin semantics I must say that a near miss is that his parents had with a near hips [laughter]\nThat ... and and they ... they stated that if he had gone ahead Landa as he was intending to go to the worst disasters ...\nThe ... but so the guy didn't see all those airplanes and think ... right there is getting\nIt's all it's only about ... not a typical Canadian\nI'm confused by the story is getting his cabin on like pilots or want to do I stop it you know the near disaster they're saying is blamed on the Canadian crude not being familiar with the layout of the airport the failure to turn on the background guides the system and they don't know what the layout of the airport at if they're saying that long\nStraight place that's where he put laying down the difficulty for moose to land the plane to I'm only assuming Air Canada has the most for around ... got angry that the thank God it did\nYou know [noise] I don't know I don't know about reporting things that almost happened but didn't as news I don't know but thank
