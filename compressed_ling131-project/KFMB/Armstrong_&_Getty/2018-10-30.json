will it will get you flagged I I did looking into this with a couple people people I Know in this industry\nOr can you drive around and around like that the short answer is yes I was told by somebody who knows\nThere are people daily the posts on social media I'm going to or someone to kill blank begin interviewed by someone in the government Secret Service or somebody\n... try to assess if they're on a path of dangerousness if so we're on the path a part of the equation is getting a U.S attorney's office to prosecute those people ... rarely is ever going to happen for someone who just says we're intimate the blank ought to be killed like the guy in the vein mhm\nYou could recommend that as you know a police or whoever but very few people are ever going to prosecute that this person

of great articles over the weekend about um screen time for kids\nAnd how bad it is or isn't a lot of people in your ... areas think it's horrible a lot of people who invented this stuff Ryan work for the companies that make their living off this stuff will model out around the kids oh yeah it's pretty interesting yeah\nAnd uh there was a big giant story of bobbing Google that happened on friday but he got covered up by the pipe bomber thing oh maybe we'll get to that at some point as they paid off a whole bunch of people who had\nUm you know sexual charges against him ... billions of dollars paid them off to keep it quiet and send them out the door and it just came out in the New York times article last week and a lot of Google employees are really mad about that\nSo speaking of tech the best wishes for tech workers live coming up yes\nI wanted to pay this off because um it's important to know so pipe bomb guy he gets caught headline in the Washington Post the next day as bombs suspect outspoken supporter of Trump so the headline is that\nHe's a supporter of Trump as a mentally ill guy who lives in his van\nYou go back to a year or so ago when a guy who was a Bernie supporters shot a bunch of Republicans on a baseball field and the headline is congressman shot in Virginia\nThey left out the whole Bernie Sanders singing the headline I don't know about the the meat of the story but there you go yeah\nYeah it's going to be tough to bring people together and disarmed themselves when you're always attacking them right or you know counter attack so speaking of tech\nChildren\nAre finding ingenious ways around any attempt to control the amount of screen time\nOh dang it was just reading some good ideas for this from that article and I was talking about I 'cause I my kids are just coming up on the\nYou know I Can't trust him alone with this stuff\nThe British press picked up on an apple read it discussion which features bemused parents sharing stories about how the kids are gaming the settings on their apple devices apple introduced a screen time feature on the new I O s um\nAllows users to set restrictions on how much time they spend on apps scheduled downtime Sarah parents can use the future to impose restrictions on their children's device you said you're so they thought one reading share the story of how they're seven year old to game the feature sparking a chat that has nearly five hundred comments\n\nWhat I always twelve came out of limited my seven year old son screen time through the family share for a few days I felt like he was playing a bit more than he sure I can figure out why finally today my son revealed his hack when he runs out of screen time this games get locked ...\nDownloads a previously installed but later removed game through the cloud I counted it works without limitations what can I say I'm not even mad I'm impressed how old was I said I haven't\nWell yeah you got to be kind of happy about that yeah I Would be awesome yeah and I live in a world we're doing that sort of thing is how you make your living\nAnother parent asked apple support for him how to get a step ahead of their teenage son who would reset his phone's time and date trick screen time\nGood one yeah that's amazing had died in the New York times or the rhythm of Silicon Valley nannies are phone police for kids childcare contracts in Silicon valley Nell regularly include I'm a ... the nannies have to hide phones tablets computers and TV's from her kids they don't want their kids even see\nLet alone touch or use the ... business I think that's a little over the top\nBut [noise] yeah yeah the output of their business\nIt's like the pornographer taking children the church the drug dealer and system these kids do no drugs\nHere's a guy research screen time for one of the companies when you're a big tech companies and now their daughters ages five and three have no screen time budget that all they don't allow it at all based on the studies he's\nDone and what does the kids know regular hours that they are allowed um [noise]\nAnd so I thought it was interesting he says only during the long car ride like we're going to talk for hours and I thought you know even that\nAnd I would let my kids do and I'm I'm no saint when it comes to screen time either but she's we regularly went on long drives and you know what you do you find a way to occupy your ... your mind staying out the window why so it's less hellish [laughter] which I gotta believe is really really good for you\nAnd him and you and I most people don't expect kids to do that at all now you know driving across town and my kids want something\nOn my own kids got a variety of mental problems that we're trying to figure out so I don't know how to handle him torturing an already tortured mind seems unfair but for his brother I don't allow it look out the window right find something to think about right that it's\nI used to go on these long motorcycle rights before I had kids really long like where you're writing all day long I might spend ten hours in the saddle as we call\nAnd the first and this was Jesus was before I was a smartphone addict even then the first like our would be torturers yeah I'm just alone with my own thoughts but once she got past that hump\nIt would just be this level of bliss all day long and ours would just go by and it was just like you're floating through time it was awesome yeah but that first hour was just I Can't say this I got no music I've got no TV I got no nothing it's just my head but once you got past\nThat it was just blast and I'll bet that's the way every human being was\nFor the entirety of our existence speeds up until like Seventy years ago right\nYeah yeah and that's the way our brains are designed telling now a kid a kid could could easily you\nCan easily get to adulthood without ever having spent thirty minutes of your life trying to just like a dream ... get that way in fact most kids are probably doing that\nBoy and when we finally quote unquote figure out what's causing everybody to be so crazy it's going to be as obvious as coming in from a heavy rain and announcing you've you've figured out why you're closer ... uh-huh\nGosh it's just self evident missing\nThe fact that all these people in a in Silicon valley who designed these one of these guys said look I understand the way we designed these things to manipulate the brain and the needs of the brain I don't want to do that to my own kids right\nWow wow evildoers I Know\nAnd I it's it's like a people who go too far with the TV thing in my mind we don't allow TV in our home ... lots of really great stuff on TV depends on what you watch ... and I kind of at the same way the screen time I don't know I haven't looked at the studies those I don't see why reading on a screen\nIsn't necessarily bad or an educational show on the screen as bad stuff that has ruined my brain\nIs the the the text and stuff like that coming in speeding up the response all that stuff the smartphone stuff that's all true in my brain I Know I can feel it intuitively but if I had a forty some your head start on my brain was wired and now find it very difficult to read a book\nHow would I expect my kids who've never had a chance to wear their brain correctly to sit and read a book\nI don't know I fear I fear for the future yeah what do we brought I guess\nFor a chance to wear their brain correctly to sit and read a book I don't know I fear I fear for the future what did we rock I guess we'll find out now these people these are the\nBay area Silicon Valley they've grown up around it they know more about it than we do they designed it people is that a lot of them are saying there's their kids aren't going to get a small smartphone in high school\nAt all [laughter] wow\nNo and and one of them said my friends always say how do you know where they are the same way my parents knew how I was a or where I was ... we're going to be able to it so I don't know\nWow wow they're like a bunch of Walter White's you know from Breaking Bad fame you know in a way you're going to lead his kids do drugs are really absolutely not\nThe manufacturers the best method around so speaking of Silicon Valley San Francisco San jose were the best places to live and work for tech workers\nWhich I think anybody in tech is caught on to me pet bits for working like crazy on their tech sector to ah the usual suspects San jose in San Francisco number four number five\nNot surprisingly offered tech workers a higher median salary than virtually anywhere but\nWith the cost of living that in San jose is forty four percent higher\nIn San Francisco sixty four percent higher than the national average sixty seven percent higher than the national average yeah I'm surprised it's not higher than that like a hundred percent higher I mean it's twice as expensive to live in San Francisco is virtually anywhere but you know housing is not everything\nUm that's not the only costs that people have\nLost a big part of it so a top ranked Charlotte median tech industry salary of about eighty eight grand and the cost of living there is one percent lower than the national average huh will call it average\nUh eighty eight grand average cost of living the median IT salary and San jose is a hundred and twenty two gr um but again forty four percent higher than the national average cost of living\nBoy so if you're a young person you think hey I they they offered me a job out in California I think I'll take it it's forty grand morning I'm making now they're smart enough\nRight to look at what it's going to cost to live going to be living in somebody's garage and not the whole garage the part that leftover with the car in there [laughter] uh let's see according to study more people moved away from San Francisco than any other city in the final months last year\nOwing to its matory is Lee high housing prices but was such that we saw that was one of the most amazing sets I've ever seen on nine out of town that yeah which is Ninety\nPercent [laughter] roughly no it was like half\nOf people were planning to move within the next year half of the people under thirty were planning to leave the bay area within the next two years when I was wondering is that ever happened outside of being in Dresden, Germany or something as it ever happened in history or in the shadow of a ... painting [laughter] dressed in half\nHave half the people ever thought you normally [laughter] that ever happened before yeah\nYeah Charlotte's seemed double digit population growth in the last decade uh partly due to the booming tech industry they're one of the country ski banking centers\nYou get your Wells Fargo and bank of America ally in financial\nAs like grumble from Joe oh let's see a similar in Raleigh but a lower cost of living they have a mix of start up companies in tech giants like IBM and varieties and study predicts both Raul in Charlotte to have eleven percent growth in tech sector jobs over the next five years\nYou know it's interesting is that Amazon is going to one day just announced the city and all of a sudden that'll be one of the major tech hubs in America\n[noise] oh right for their their second headquarters yeah and and my favorite aspect of that just as a a fan of politics and political science is that if they pick somewhere in a purple state\nThey could change the politics of that state froze they may import fifty thousand young tech workers who generally almost exclusively swing left you know I'm so that could be you know a huge effect I Would hate that has got his wings more to the right but you know what are you going to do speaking of jobs I don't know if this number means but uh\nThe share of workers quitting their jobs in August\nNever thought about what percentage of people quit their job any given month take this job shifted\nThe share walk workers quitting their jobs in August held at the highest number since two thousand one so the highest number and almost two decades of two points\nIt's the share walk workers quitting their jobs in August held at the highest number since two thousand one so the highest number in almost two decades a to point four percent job mobility so that say because the are unemployment\nSlow yeah exactly it's uh people are secure that if they leave their job they can find another one that will make them happy so yeah that's a sign of a high consumer confidence and job confidence which is you know which is good I have no confidence given those stockpile I brought my own cardboard box ready\nDo we know what the stock market's doing today Sean do you have a one word stock market up there\nThe stock market is trying trying they're trying to during the day we go to you for this and I keep thinking it's going to be a week from using everyday trying new pretty wiring [laughter] the market

words of soundbites the complex nature of the hate we see today and I think that's a really good opening line everybody's trying to characterize all the ugliness they say to suit their own purposes and an in an oversimplified away\nSo unique and crazy Bowers and say that's the synagogue shooter and the the wacky stripper fake Indian bomb chucking being returned [laughter] tuna can wielding a naked fighter\nOr they cannot be classified other than the mutual hate they have for themselves and the people a target at some point when does the news media take responsibility for the misrepresentation of the real news so the nuts feel the need to take action I think you can attribute Trump's political rag your rhetoric has been partly responsible there's always been political rhetoric though what's changed\nOver reporting in misrepresentation of the facts by the media the divisiveness comes from the people wanting themselves with news organizations being able to make their own decisions sad state of affairs will change the ... news organizations take ethical responsibility and reporting the line is blurred between reporting analysis and that's part of it\nSo Hillary

now it's Armstrong and daddy [noise]\nOf an interesting topic [noise] my goodness yes it's um [noise] a lot of books\nHave been written about it and seminars given in classes taught and stuff like that I don't know how well anybody's ever done it really nailing it down\nGeneral Stanley McChrystal was described by Robert Gates a fella from we have a lot of respect around here is perhaps finest warrior leader of men in combat I have ever met\nA his credentials in the United states military are impeccable or he is lead a quite an interesting life of leadership and his new book is leaders myth in reality General McChrystal joins us now how are you sir\nI'm gory thanks for having me oh it's our pleasure you don't just another book on leadership didn't really hold any interest for me um but then I started flipping through yours I looked at the table of contents looked at all the different styles of leadership and the leaders throughout history you took a look at now I Can't wait\nWhile you're kind we really didn't want to write another book on leadership until we realized we don't think we understood leadership and so we took this one on\nWell listen let's talk a little bit about your your day job or at least you're old day job a commanding troops me in a general\nA ... you know both jacking are for military families we do a lot of work for military charities and so were you know fairly familiar with the culture um as much as civilians can be ... it's been sending me many times that the higher you rise in the military the higher ranked the less you're a soldier and the more you're a politician um it was that a challenge for you\nIt it's a challenge for everybody I think because you you're a socialist out of a soldier that's what you want to be that's where you identify and then when you find yourselves in the halls of politics it's complicated sometimes it's a little bit distasteful I guess it's necessary business but it's not something that fits comfortably\nWell and you still have responsibility for the the lives of well being of a hell of a lot of soldiers who are looking to you and I think it would be an awful thing to forget you're a soldier\nWell that's the thing and you know they require you to represent them and sometimes\nYou're trying to translate a pretty complicated situation in a war and something that many of the politicians have not experienced personally are trying to put that into terms they can understand that drive decisions and you feel the responsibility of that because it's hard to get it right\nWhen you're not in command in Afghanistan what was the the biggest number of uh people yet underneath you at one point\nWhere we got to a hundred and fifty thousand a NATO troops us and NATO troops and then we had about three hundred thousand to Afghan forces which essentially not under my direct command but worked with that show it was a pretty significant number of people\nSo you're trying to I'm a you know you you've got ideas of what you need to do who needs to go where and do what to accomplish the goals you want to accomplish you have to run them through the politicians and then you have to have the support of the people back home that's got to really add to the difficulty\nWell that's right and you learn over time that does become utterly critical if you can't keep the support of the people back home if you can explain to political and policy leaders well enough they have their support\nThan anything else you do won't work because it just won't be built on a solid foundation and we found that in wars Korea Vietnam and whatnot that regardless of how clever your military actions maybe if you haven't got the other parts right you really can't succeed in the altar\nYou go through a whole bunch of different uh famous names in your book and I talk about their leadership ability who's the greatest leader of all time\nOh boy it's an impossible question of course\nThe leader of the leader in this book that I admire the most interesting laid off as Dr Martin Luther king junior and it's not because of his cause that the civil rights causes righteous it was because his skill at taking all the disparate groups that actually made up the civil rights movement\nManaging and leading that effort against pretty stiff resistance and some temp at political support was an extraordinary and yet we tend to think of him is given the I have a dream speech\nAnd yet it was really this matched up because he was never elected are appointed to anything he had to do it by ...

thousand dollars from the Japanese government for a living expenses\nWhat could be stupid her than royals [laughter] [noise] so according to a book in which\nFour thousand some adult Americans from all fifty states were surveyed at length\nOn a is sexual issues\nTurns out there are significant differences in these sexual fantasies of self identified Republicans and self identified Democrats\nMost reported fantasizing about the same average frequency several times per week\nI find that Republicans were more likely than Democrats says the author to fantasize about a range of activities that involve sex outside of marriage thinking things like infidelity or again these are swapping dang it from the seventies style key parties to modern day forms of swing\nRepublicans also reported more fantasies with voyeuristic themes including visiting strip clubs and practicing something known as ... holding which involves watching one's partner have sex with someone else your fantasy is visiting a strip club you need better fantasies yeah we'll go once or twice that will cure that uh by contrast\nSelf identified Democrats were more likely than Republicans to fantasize about almost the entire spectrum of bondage discipline and state of masochistic activities from bondage to spanking the dominance submission play\nThe largest Democrat Republican divide on the bt SM spectrum wasn't mess it gives them which involves driving pleasure from the experience of pain I have no interest in being tied up or time anyone ... no but you are free\nNot supposed to mention that on the air [laughter] so uh the question asked is wide Republicans seem to be drawn to non monogamy and Democrats to power play and their sexual fantasies huh oh better a bunch here are way ahead of us already um\nYou know it might be tempting writes the author to see this is a revealing fundamental difference in their sexual psychology but if you dig leave a little deeper and and you don't have to take very deep to make you find that some of the activities the turn Republicans and Democrats honor vastly different um but it said\nBoy then it gets really really ... but the long short of it is\nTurn Republicans and Democrats honor vastly different um but it said boy then it gets really really ... but the long short of it is ... non monogamous and voyeuristic acts\nFor Republicans probably stemmed from the fact that sex outside of marriage and multi partner sex or big no no it was among people who tend to hold those political beliefs\nOh I see if you're a Democrat you're already doing it probably already had an orgy\nBy now writer you know ... right um the the breakfast or\nDo you have every day to visit our hands they exactly oh so this is that\nWhat you are and members as opposed to it and the\nOh that's a worst advertisement for an orgy I've ever heard of that half with the governor of California was at a bad dream [laughter]\nAnyway Republicans make traditional marriage one of the cornerstones of its official platform and I just think it's you know the way a lot of Republicans swing nothing makes us want to try something like being told you can't do it oh\nThat's why taboos do matter what they are often become turn on and that same instinct may also help to explain coming to you by this a logic or this argument\nOn is ridiculous and it has to end but you can and that so that's the end of the story\nWell perhaps not the president talking about birthright citizenship what it means what it doesn't mean when it on I mean in a pick further to the discussion we've invited Dr John Eastman to join us ... a professor at Chapman University Fowler school of law\nA a lecturer thinker writer he also clerked for Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court which is quite non or a doctor east when how are you sir I'm well how are you doing today excellent thank you a first for folks who are not steeped in constitutional history can you talk a little bit about how the fourteenth amendment came to be white came to be\nAbout fourteenth amendment is one of the so called\nCivil war amendments ah and and this one in particular with designed to overturn the a big moment if Supreme Court decision in Dred Scott\nThat fed African Americans cat be citizens [noise] and it says a path and Eighteen sixty eight and it says all persons born or naturalized in the United states that's the part I'm and subject to the jurisdiction\nThereof are citizens of the United states [noise] um and and it created automatic citizenship for the African American former slave of it also anybody who was born here and subject to our jurisdiction\nOkay well let's just go ahead and stipulate as they said in the courts um that everybody understands the importance and the value of the fourteenth amendment for the freed slaves and and and God Bless Abraham Lincoln in the Congress\nI'm On the other hand how it applies in the modern day is is very different when we go there next\nWell sure that the the big fight it or what that phrase subject to the jurisdiction names and quite frankly it means something different in common parlance today than it mad at the time so subject to the jurisdiction today\nImmediately things are subject to our laws and therefore everybody that's born here maybe maybe not diplomats and foreign armies who've invaded but anybody else are subject to our laws therefore they're subject to our jurisdiction and therefore their kids are automatic citizen but that's\nNot the understanding of the phrase and Eighteen sixty eight um ... the phrase that\nHad to maintain a word you subject to a complete jurisdiction such as you owe allegiance to the country over your subject what to what they call\nIt the mere partial or territorial jurisdiction that meant you had to comply with the laws all within our boundaries but but didn't know any allegiance to the country the best way I can explain that says imagine a British citizen comes over here as a tourist he has\nTo comply with our traffic laws do you have to drive on the right side of the road not the left but he doesn't owe allegiance to the country's his hair as a visitor as a guest or we don't we don't draft him into our army and we don't prosecute them for treason if he takes up arms against us so we can I'm sure there are other laws that he would be violating we could charge him with a but that\nThat the understanding at the time and\nIf we don't have to speculate about that the author of the language was asked point blank are that are are Native Americans the Indian was the word they use at a time or the Indians going to be automatic citizens\nAnd he said no just means complete jurisdiction they owe allegiance to their tribe and so even though they are subject to our laws are territorial jurisdiction there not\nAutomatic citizens\nThat was true for the Native Americans at a time of the work you know domestic sovereign it's clearly true for for foreign nationals who continue to lead as to their home country a while they're temporarily visiting here and that's even more true for people who are not legally author\nScott how many people over the last couple of decades has erroneous lease audit met 'em and Congress could do this as well I you know it could it could say you know we've been acting like folks for citizens for a long time All right we're going to come first citizenship on them but by virtue of our power over naturalization an article one not because they already\nHave it under the fourteenth amendment and then we're going to correct that going forward so we get the right understanding and we can therefore adjust our immigration policy appropriately\nWell I agree with you completely but something tells me there's a there's case law that says otherwise\nThere's not there's not a single Supreme Court case and you know lower court case that says otherwise you're getting the only actual holding\nOn that is a case in Eighteen eighty four called el ... versus Wilkins it was a a Native American who had been born on us soil and he claims US citizenship and the Supreme Court held that because he continued to ... to his tribe\nEven though the tribal is a domestic dependent solver and he was not subject to the complete jurisdiction and therefore was not a citizen what gets confusing is it and the late Eighteen nineties\nA case called ... a child of Chinese immigrants I'm left the United states and then upon his return claimed he was a citizen and\nHe was legally entitled to return and the Supreme Court agreed but they went out of their way in that case to note that his parents were lawfully Dahmer filed here they weren't just here temporarily it's temporary visitors they were lawfully Donald filed here they made this or their home\nAnd as as and and the United states had accepted them as lawfully ... here we didn't\nLet them become citizens because of a bad a treaty that we had entered into with the emperor of China but they did is much to become part of our community are political community as they were allowed to do and the Supreme Court held that child was a automatic citizen\nShow how in the world did we get to the state of affairs where a Chinese national can landed LAX birth of child and fly back the next day and I have an American citizen and the natural follow up question that that can the president actually do anything about that with an executive or\nWell he can uh you know it's it's very hard to pinpoint where this change understanding occurred in the Nineteen twenties Congress passed a law giving Indian citizenship that wouldn't have been necessary if they were already citizens\nThere were there were get workers here who left after the great depression with their kids nobody claim they were citizens it's not\nUntil the late Nineteen sixties that somehow this idea start getting a taking root but it wasn't by any court decision it wasn't by any act of Congress it just kind of happened I think it may have been something as simple and crazy is a change in a farm down in the passport office um you know they used to require\nA knowledge about what your parents status were in order for you to claim citizenship even if you were born here and then all of a sudden they dropped that set of questions on the passport for them you know it's it's hard to pinpoint where the error began but it's clearly an error\nInteresting well I certainly think that if the president were to sign such an executive order and I hope it will be carefully prepared um this would be in the Supreme Court pretty quickly\nI I I Would think and you know if you've got you've got um a sympathetic plaintiff issues of people that our own government has been a telling them we're going to treat you as citizens we ought not to pull the rug out from under those folks but it's extremely important going forward\nBasis that we get this corrected and and and the constitution properly interpret it\nSo that we can restore the power to Congress to this to decide as a matter of policy how much above the constitutional\nFloor we want to grant citizenship or as you know and and how much not but that's a policy judgment that our constitution leads to Congress and we ought not to let this mistake and interpretation of the fourteenth amendment to take that power away from Congress\nSo you clerked for Clarence Thomas who famously almost never talks some behind closed doors does he talk more is he just sit there and also\nOh no he's a he's he's one of the most gregarious\nPeople I've ever met in my life so\nInteresting why his style there at the court well you know it's uh it it it's oftentimes\nDifficult to actually have a question that compels I'm Out of ... outcome determinative answers when when there is such a clash and he'll ask but he he tends not to be one that just plays the game to be talking for talking fake\nInteresting Dr John ... professor at Chapman University ... school of law or doctors would really enjoy the chat very stimulating and Well Don thank you thank you very much wider man put him in our road next yeah no kidding\nJoining go start you know what's funny is if I'm at a seminar a meeting or whatever I almost never ask questions\nI found that if I'm thinking of questions I'm not taking in the information\nI'm too distracted by my own\nQuestion and how to phrase it and how it might go over and stuff like that I think way too much and so I've just decided nine times out of ten I'll just sit there and listen\nSo I get why Clarence Thomas does that I Would try to portray him his due bitter\nUninformed or something like that on a\nCase at all I don't ask questions in meetings cause I'm not paying any attention to what anybody saying and I have no idea what's going on that's another way to approach and so there's no way I could ask you a question that would be about the subject matter because I don't even know what the subject matter is more likely to expose your own guy mentioned paying\nThe discussion at any one on\nOne time lunch I might ask them\nWhat's coming up new news Marshall found Bernie

has been has over many many are simply trying to be a genuine nonpartisan truth teller you know that\nThat's what we we respect you for that\nI got to start with the gas one how they get away with writing and writing the gas prop in such a way that nobody knows that it's about repealing the gas tax\nWell you know that's all you guys do that in California how you actually title and ballot summary these things really can be huge and early ... major court battles over just that over on many of these propositions\nAnd so here's another example you know it's written by the attorney general's office and so many people believe that when that when that office is inhabited by somebody who is party is not in favor of your particular proposition you get the short end of the stick\nWow so there is no is there a measure to appeal the wording of your proposition or an independent\nBoard or anything like that or is it just\nCan't go back and attempt to do that Joe sometimes is except for most it's I'm not a first you know they're sort of a process you go to the attorney general say this really sucks I don't like the way you guys have character I just you know most of the time you don't get big changes that's just the way the games like\nRight but it's clear to everyone right that they wrote that in such a way that people who are paying attention don't know that's about repealing the gas tax\nYeah there are several I think I I've noticed this guy's on this particular election cycle for some reason more than others where I I think that ballot measure salaries are more confusing than they often on a at other times but this was going to be the big ... I mean you know taught sixth was supposed to be the massive turnout machine for\nRepublicans because it was going to repeal five billion dollars annually in taxes that the water that's a lot of it now\nBut the thing about it is honestly you know I think the air one out of that balloon when national politics\nTrump Kavanaugh et cetera really became that the driver I think in in even even out California elections\nSo prop six is described as eliminate certain road repair and transportation funding require certain fuel taxes and vehicle fees be approved by the electorate initiative constitutional amendment um that is the repeal of the gas tax do we know how it's polling\nYeah well actually it started out doing just barely over dead even Joe but the the no side has been so I mean certainly the yes side had been so outspent by the no side I mean the construction trade unions you know naturally part of that the\nAnd become an exclusive some power master dealer their highest level dealer last month some power panels were exempted from the ... based on their superior so technology in fact there was only solar company it'd be exempted this is huge news it will keep us competitive against inferior products for a long time\nSince ... technology is fundamentally different and you can experience that by by the one of our energy consultants or your home to demonstrated so break it\nProvides a great visual and you'll immediately understand how some power panels produce more power for ... years and how some power is able to stand behind them with the best warranty in the industry plus they're just great like a battle\nTo celebrate this massive event where I'm from five hundred dollars off your home solar system do Thanksgiving that's five hundred dollars off through Thanksgiving I'm can't hardly CEOs ... are solar button you to take advantage of this offer as stellar solar dot net that's dollars solar dot now\nHere's an interest in a dummy package von ...

LA is that so that's why I was pulled off\nA was the court right ah well you know what you gotta you gotta ask somebody is a bit more of a constitutional scholar than I Am but but there is I think widespread agreement Joe that's much more complex issue at maybe even requiring federal approval and it was California might not have the authority to do that on sale\nYou hot issues where you don't have any prompts on immigration or guns neither one of those right\nThat's a good point now no immigration that that issue but wasn't the issue of guys really one of those legislation on gun control that went to California legislature recently I think both of those issues have become seriously nationalize and that's why you're not really seeing that the actions of the state level right now\nOn the other hand the confinement of chickens is on the ballot will get to that eventually prompts him or expands local governments authority to enact rent control on residential properties I'm ... and ... yeah the ... and last time I heard one of your your\nYeah well that was that one important because it would completely throw the gates wide open a yes vote means that localities around California could do anything they want to rent control right now there's caps on what they can do so this has been a big if they\nActually even people who are both on both sides in favor of low income housing say people to see anything is going to help poor people other people think it's going to hurt him\nWell I Would tell you that it's pretty sound you sound lead to substantiate it economic to information that rent control helps a few people but the expenses of many of the do you reduce the supplies of\nOf rental properties of drives landlords out of the business is one of the great example of a progressive ideas that sounds good but when you implemented it has much different you know unintended consequences\nYeah those are exactly the arguments of the opponent Joe\nRight but those who are in favor of it saying well it holds down rent super folks can live somewhere to rent is too damn high right\nAnd places like San Francisco you guys will know in particular this kind of Barry communities or rent skyrocketing people have been really clamoring for some kind of solutions\nSo ah eleven what the heck requires private sector emergency ambulance employees to remain on Paul during work breaks want who is why ... why is this on the ballots\nAll right well it's on the ballot because you know there's very I mean California is one of the very strongest labor [noise] um let's just say they would catch his progressive labor state so you know you have to give people breaks and they paid ... I mean everybody certain those every part of most every job\nThe thing about it is the people that drive ambulances particularly in this case it applies only to private sector Amos is in our public sector employees companies to [noise]\nThey ... they have not been not been able to get paid breaks I mean you're on call right I mean you're out there in the end if some if you get a card carrying a sandwich you've got to go\nThis would enshrine the fact that they would not have to be paid and they would have to remain on call even during their break so basically what it's doing guy just setting aside California labor law for this particular class of employees\nIs there a rash of on answered ambulance calls are people dying because guys are having a sandwich or what I'm just a well they're hanging out on her down the issue in my life and I'd yeah there I mean I read the newspaper\nYeah the thing about it now Joe is most of these guys are already doing this this basically codified that\nUm and and the concern families companies you know some people say yes and people saying look we pull out say a third of our or a quarter of our ambulance companies 'cause these guys and gals Ron break\nThen we're not going to have the equipment and the people power or when we need it so that's really what it boils down to and um you know if it'd be interesting to see again another sort of elephant knows that the cat to see what they're changing some of these California labor laws is going to be successful or not\nGary ... citizen voice non partisan political analyst go to citizen voiced on our great website informed\nAnd we all agree that if turnout is low we got all shut up about\nPolitics right wrong talking about politics all the time we don't turn of civil we got to show
