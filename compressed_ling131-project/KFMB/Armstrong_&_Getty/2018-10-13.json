I've been deeply involved with tumor researchers in India and seeing all of that and with raspberry trial I worked with scientists in Europe\nAnd also in California and she'll lay in South Africa all of which are major red wine producing areas I've had the opportunity to investigate these things in the field meet with the top\nHe'll meet with the top scientist than my conclusion is that green tea Kirk human from to recruit and ... from red wine are remarkable health and Hansing agents that everybody can benefit from in the very very substantial way\nChristmas to talk about these big three and it's interesting that they're found in our diet and all are considered super food the green tea human different spiritual why did you want to combine just read there's always a message to your\nYour madness if I can see it that way because you combine these things together because they have a synergistic effect you meet each other more spending you know on a real game changer well you\nKnow when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason path to put them all in separate product they do go very well together as you said they're all food derived so it's kind of like\nYou can make a salad if you choose out of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and while that's a little bit simplistic the fact is that all of these are very very rich in groups of protective compounds that are both\nAntioxidant so they actually retired the aging process of the cells in our bodies and protect our organ systems so they maintain a healthy inflammatory status in the body and this is really a big breakthrough I also like the idea that people can get a concentrated\nSupplement of green tea extract curriculum and extracting resume or a trial\nIn one product with truly meaningful amounts of each one and not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nLet's dive into the headlines in the research especially on the green tea because it's absolutely amazing\nI knew what he shouldn't have been using it for thousands of years for healthy aging but what you've seen recently in the press you know you told me the nutrition research journal in July twenty twelve issue revealed the green tea significantly increased\nPlasma anti ... activity and have blood unify on you recap\nSome of these headlines of tell me why you're such a green tea advocates\nOkay what you just said about increasing plasma antioxidant activity is really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume\nBut don't actually wind up in the body or they don't wind up in the body in any significant amount the green tea antioxidants which we know are among the most highly beneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed\nThis free bottle offer is not available in stores and you won't find it on line either\nOnly through today's ... limit one free bottle for households call now one eight hundred for nine nine seven five zero five one lesson for those ready to down\nHere we go one eight hundred for nine nine seven five\nZero five okay Chris talked about some of the headlines\nJust on the green tea did we didn't get to you and I understand the dieters just loved green tea because of support ... metabolism is that right and what does the research say about green tea when it comes to weight management\nWell this is one of the especially wonderful things about green tea pat we know the green tea has thermo Jenike properties that is it has heat generating properties in the body so it actually causes your body\nBurn more calories so when you eat a meal you're going to burn more calories from that meal as a result of taking a good well made concentrated green tea extract\nIn addition it has a specific fat oxidation properties that actually burns that I'm not suggesting that you're going to lose twenty pounds in a week but I Am saying that this is going to help your body to metabolize fat more efficiently\nOver time taking a green tea extract can help you to have a better fat to lean muscle ratio so from a weight control standpoint this is very good news additionally green tea\nHelps to stabilize blood glucose or blood sugar and unstable blood sugar is one of the contributing factors to increased wait\nSo by stabilizing blood sugar you have an effect on weight control in weight management so it's really quite remarkable stuff you need enough of it we've got enough of it in green T. C. R. it has to be the right extract we've got the right extract but the sciences there for healthy weight management\nNow Chris you see that with charities formula it provides you with about three cups worth of green tea in each to capsule serving\nTo Capitol serving of these cutting edge liquid soft Joe so you know the green tea is concentrated benefits\nFor energy for hard for me in just too soft gel caps plus you have to cook human in the ... spiritual too so it's easy you call your daily short cut to better health explain this idea of a healthy shortcuts and explains some of the top benefits as well\nWell I mean you could for example drink three cops are good concentrated green tea each day\nEat at least one really rich curry made with a lot of tumor accrued\nAnd drink a couple of glasses or red wine you could do that every day most people will not do that every day but they still might want the benefits of three of the biggest superstar protective health and Hansing nutrients on the entire planet\nSo when I call this a daily short cut I'm simply saying that you can get in a capsule and a good liquid soft gelatin capsule what you'd otherwise have to get by drinking a few cups of tea eating at least one large you know tumor Laden curry every day and drinking a couple of glasses of concentrated red wine\nAgain we're talking with Chris killing the managed in under now in this new green T. C. R. formulas and purity it's really about the research share with them some of your favorite studies in the headlines on the human that we didn't get to yeah I Know this is one of your favorite ingredients for joint comfort and even for brain yeah\nWell I especially like the liver protective heart protective and joint modifying properties of this stuff the liver is our greatest detoxify Oregon and we know that we're constantly bombarded by toxins in the environment in fact\nBlood studies show the newborn babies contain two hundred industrial pollutants in their blood at the time of birth so we need a functioning super healthy very strong liver we might not think about our livers that much but we need that and we know that Kirk human\nProtects the liver at detoxify deliver it keeps it strong from a cardiac standpoint it's highly beneficial for the heart\nIt's very good for maintaining healthy cholesterol and healthy platelet levels\nAnd from a joint standpoint\nWe have in numerous ... studies showing overall improvement in joined health\nAnd relief and stable inflammatory activity better joint mobility as a result of taking Kirk him and I like the brain protective studies as well you know I think everybody wants a sharper clearer mind and Kirk human delivers all this so\nI regard it as one of the single most important things that you can put in your body and I'm very well aware pat but most people are not going to eat\nEnough rock tumor Rick route to get the benefits that they should and that they can get from a concentrated ...\nI don't want to remind people didn't call now to get started with a free bottle of green tea see our dirty products this is their unique green tea formula with sea Kirk human and there was very much for all your free bottle today just before Ninety five for shipping coal now operators are standing by one eight hundred\nFor nine nine seven five zero five again one eight hundred\nFor nine nine seven five zero five\nRight back to the show 'cause I don't want to get to technical here but these anti oxygen green tea or classified as police females and there really aren't super powerful and well respected by scientists but in his green T. C. R. formula there's more green tea ... human the risk variables we talked about\nClass grape seed extract behind bars bio ... vitamin C can you talk to me about this is a re a really super anti accidents and Polly feels that you put in the form you\nWell yeah I won't say that we kind of went overkill but I Will say that we really really developed in the fish and comprehensive program here\nGrape seed extract and pine bark extract both contain a group of highly specialized antioxidant compounds that not only do much of what I've already described but also enhance the physical integrity of tissue\nIn the blood vessels and the skin so we put those in there for\nExtra boost in antioxidant activity but also for a specific type of activity that isn't as much addressed by the green tea the court came in and the ... all the bio flab annoyed and hence\nThe overall activity of vitamin C. and vitamin C itself is one of the most important nutrients that we can possibly take in so I Would say that we were very very thorough you know when we went through what could be in this product we said you know what would happen\nWe put in grape seed extract pine bark extract ... noise and vitamin C. we realized that we would have an orderly superior formula and just to reiterate pat\nI Want people to experience dynamic health I Want people to feel great this formula the green tea CPR will make you feel great and that's the purpose of it\nNot Christian I Love this green T.

Shaw ethics packs but ... pardon me what's a ... you're using all these big worries what's a brass got\nBrass stick to our members of the mustard family which are our favorites uh broccoli cauliflower cabbage kale collards rutabagas tournaments coal Robbie\nBrussel sprouts and then we'll talk about a few other things to um stuff I don't grow like celery and and I live in ... but a\nA lots of good stuff I mean I used to I work for Twenty years is a commercial grower ... growing the springs stuff and the winner to try to make a buck but ah\n[laughter] this is this is a perfect time in the air I mean there's nothing like fresh broccoli and cauliflower Rose Garden\nI might is Yes sir I enjoy my winter garden far more than my summer garden as far as ah going out there and harvest and all the broccoli cauliflower cabbage isn't such\nWell it stays green so it looks like you know what you're doing is that you know they just keep the jacked up with some fish fertilizer and ... and you're doing good but ... hopefully harbor some broccoli actually planted mid August so I might have a couple of heads to bring him and show off so\nI mean I ah that'd be very hard on your done\nKilling all the snails so\nAre you going to speak about a pass such as snails aphids things like that\nYeah we'll talk about soil prep and and uh the infamous pass there aren't many but of course aphids are at the head of the\nThe brass okay this is my nightmare uh whenever I see us or\nIs that because you don't like them on your plants or because you're the gun and you don't want to win [laughter] what's the well a\nLittle extra protein doesn't hurt but they suck the hell out of those plants so it's not much of a problem on the broccoli and cauliflower but if you or anything else the\nLonger than eighty days in the garden or like brussel sprouts and kale looked out so they'll know eventually ... heads summer early spring but uh\nWhen it comes to Brussels sprouts right the the aphids might arch enemy I have very poor growing success with brussel sprouts due to the aphids trying to do it or ...\nYou you aren't alone and the sad thing is take they take like a hundred and twenty does so I mean it's a hundred and twenty days the aphids are looking out I'm In my living room and jumping all over I when I was\nGrown in Mexico if you didn't grow tomatoes your group Brussels sprouts in my area there and and every day we hear the crop dusters up there with the sweet smell of ...\nAs we now have you been successful with brussel sprouts up but uh sunshine care\n[noise] actually I don't grow them because I go for pounded and but occasionally I grow this one called ... which is a cross between kale in Brussels sprouts\nIt's a really beautiful and the ... you get the best of both worlds are so instead of getting\nYou know long stocks were bald bulbs all over it you'll you'll get a big tall plant with these little ... of Taylor looking ah brussel sprouts and uh the purple it's it's a beautiful plant it's a beautiful edible ... and a ... or\nDid you get need to plant this year\nI have some of the green house right now it's going to bring some but they're a little small I'm afraid are our friends would have a hard time whole non to them but I Will bring some in in three weeks for you how 'bout\nThat that'd be voyeuristic yeah that sounds interesting I'd like to look into those\nYeah or if you come to our class and I know David is going to be blessed us with us presidents next Saturday on bulbs but the following month of November on the seventeenth I'll be talking about Ken healthy profit goes will be given those away\nOkay just make sure you remember to save a few for my friends at Walter Anderson nursery okay always in cherry tomatoes snow I what I'm supposed to be there at ten and then the the performer that again that thirty how do we\n... we started at ten thirty but we like you're there earlier and um because people come with lots of questions and since you're the foremost garden expert\nIn our area [laughter] I Love hell do I do come prepared huh I said I Love you Roy he's such a nice guy don't go there [laughter] All right\nI Am looking forward to it and I'm looking forward to seeing you just did a little while and not looking forward to seeing just a little while\nI Am I'm looking forward to seeing okay ours\nGeorgia's or like you guys you you made my day thanks thanks for calling in Roy and I'll see in a little bit\nOf nothing else to do so it hasn't come up\nYet [laughter] so I think everybody's take here\nThis is always a good time when he comes in he's a wealth of information he really is it a ... it's because he's done it you know for so long exactly that is\nNot theoretical for him correct he ... he applied you know one of the things that he he says in some of his classes that I've uh ups countered with an have been using in some of my classes and when I talked with customers about organic growing one of the lines he he opens his classes with is that you know why do you want to be organic or everybody wants to be organic\nOr at least tell their neighbors that the organic and and I I Love that line\nYes nobody wants to say I do it all this way I Want to be working at one of the organic I Want to be a dentist [laughter] um I Want to be organic is the way to go but that brings you back to my little saying it's just because it's organic doesn't make it good and just because it's not doesn't make it bad\nCorrect but if if somebody is looking for the class schedules forests George how do they find them\nYou know a good point that we have people asking regularly you know how do I find about how do I find out about classes when we reference that there's a class coming up on that very topic that they asked about um obviously our website is a great resource there is a calendar on there that goes out a couple of weeks and usually into the next month that you can find the classes for both locations\nIf you sign up for our newsletter you can also do that on our Web page or you will have access to the monthly newsletter which has\nA lot of good information and it's a history of the of the nursery as well as a class schedule in the back if you like us on Facebook we often have the classes identified a woman advance on Facebook and of course right here on the radio\nOh you know one more spot in the stores we have signs posted throughout the stores by the cash registers which uh afford you the opportunity to take a gander and see what's coming up\nAnd if you go to our website and sign up for the newsletter you will be a sent an email to which you must respond and then we will add you just to make\nAnd then we will add you just to make sure that you wanted to be added we will just add any buddy and\nWe don't send out those that many emails we send out usually the one newsletter per month than sometimes one or two\nOthers supplemental ads or info a marsh not infomercials but information about something that's coming up or how you need to do that and write a unique event thank you um\n[noise] so we don't swamp you we don't sell you we just inform you about right that sounds perfect we have a couple of unique events coming up don't we we do we have ah\nThe wine and whiskers function coming up the next one week from today right this today when ... correct so that'll be the fundraiser to benefit how to care for\nCritters right and the queen ... college or\nWhat does it have been two years or no there's a there's another word there but yes I forgot the man like that all it is a\nGreat program green and [laughter] they have a great program down there and we're going to help support it that's coming up this next Saturday it's a paid adventure us much to buy tickets and be over Twenty one there's going to be I think we're up to almost a half a dozen wineries that are going to be represented\nAnd when you when you do your classes live they they'd take certainly more than three to six minutes or ... it it goes the whole whole hour hour plus with all the questions and the and the detailed a\nHands on especially if I haven't had the coffee takes a little bit longer but we get to to grow\nEnjoy divide ... stack ones all the time in Southern California and people often ask when is the best time to ... and the answer is when it's when you're ready to do it well when it falls off usually it's after a storm when they fall off the the boards then that's the best time to do it you know what I um\nFall is clearly here we're having fall weather for a normal fall weather for what people consider not\nSouthern California fall weather which is Ninety degrees and fires and I took advantage of it this week and went out and started planting what and what did you plant I planted to specialty avocados and a banana\nNow go back to your specialty avocados because they are they use those that you've purchased about two years ago\nI think it was on the only one year ago approximately and you and you got 'em in the ground and I finally got them in the ground and you know why\nNot in the ground there is still alive because you left him at the nursery and we took care of them\n[laughter] that trust athlete Iraq and every week barb would come to me and say hey those plants are still back to you know that your trees are still there but any way they are now at home and in the ground and they're going to get a nice good routine and foot hold\nBefore the sheet of next spring and summer come and we'll give them a nice headstart what specialty what are they [noise] um I have a Cornish our will and queen ...\nAnd the reason I ask is I also purchase a ... when I get it but I think the same day you purchase George in Utah and I take my foot in the ground and it looks great um but that said yours because it was in a pot is significantly larger than mine that is in the ground\nWhich we talked about regularly how things thrive in pots\nAs long as you can keep them alive and water them properly water that that does work out really well somewhere or mind to take off I had to get a queen of the Cato 'cause where I grew up I'm Out in the east county near the intersections of forte an avocado which were obvious off Cato words\nQueen avenues right there as well and I didn't know that was at the Cato until we got one and it's an enormous a dark skinned I think a smooth skinned ... similar to that feeling that somebody brought in so just a couple of the other day and we'll have to see\nAnd Pueblo and other street right near there and uh all of a cottage which I guess I should have known but I didn't 'cause I didn't know there were that many different off caught us hundreds hundreds um I think\nWe have somebody on the phone no we do not okay um [noise] have you taken advantage of the fall for planting George\nHave a not avocado trees a minor in the ground and I'm not I don't have any room for any more in my little half acre lot but I did do a lot of fall vegetables as former Roy was talking about earlier some brass it goes I started a bunch of seeds in early September\nAnd I'd been slowly um migrating them from my seat starter containers are into the ground where they're going to be growing\nOut cauliflower broccoli cabbage is a also put a lot of carrots and indeed well speaking of beats\nTwo days ago I went outside to harvest for some breakfast and I I'll go out and harvest peppers tomatoes some of the green says such as kale and a Swiss chard and I take some beet greens and this particular morning I grabbed a beak to grab the greens off the top and the entire ...\nCame out of the ground and the bottom of it happened to be missing and I followed\nThe whole downward another go for had decided that my my beats were more important to him than they would be on my table\nNow I Know Ken is happy with that because there is no good to eat but uh the cranes\nAre still there but the bottom is gone you know and he says he'll eat the greens which I was great with 'cause then I can have the the roots themselves but he saved those for Melanie so I knew when he likes to eat so that's a good thing in well no enemy is not the plant beats how 'bout that\nI Do okay but I'm usually a little behind in my practice and planting so I haven't done anything yet I still have a huge chunk of tomatoes that\nAre producing for me so I haven't taken those out and this rain that we just had plus the reign of two weeks ago is probably going to start encouraging all of the fall grassy weeds to germinate\nSo if you have left an area fallow make sure you let those seeds those weed seeds come up and get rid of them before planting other seats or ... your vegetable seeds will get lost in the in the weeds\nWon't let me ask you this do you have a spot right now where you could put some beets I Do I bring your hands full of little seed starts today\n... ... [noise] no not yet not yet right as I Know 'cause I have not German aided my weeds it'll get destroyed I doubt it two years ago I alright fool me once or something like that\nI guess we can wait a minute what time is it I guess we shouldn't go to the phones yet so okay let's let's take the first one to talk to David 'cause\nI don't want to listen to David so let's talk to David\nWhat do I have some hello every morning David what's your guy\nYeah get talked about earlier about uh the right\n[noise] and um [noise] let me turn my radio down yeah you were talking earlier about Iraq had watermelons earlier and uh the righteous they don't they ended up vine they go right to their darn based shove 'em and uh\nSo I had to pull my watermelons prematurely so uh what can I use for the problem\nWe have a raft control expert right here to answer that for you don't we George Will\nExpert might be a little over the top but that David I've had a significant rent issue in my neighborhood recently in July I I've been fortunate enough to knowingly eradicate Nineteen a foot rat traps if if you don't want to use poisons the rent traps or the or the way to go\nAnd eat you set them up where ever you are having the issue I I Would encourage you to leave the rat traps out regularly in those areas so that they're not a surprise to the rats that the smell remains are just like\nGet the the garden that they're laying in debt and I often very seemed fate that they ate the night the so for example the fate of tomato or Guatemala and I have a condo I Would set up and put it into traps and I've had a great success with that\n[laughter] okay well you know I had rabbits to not with my corn when the corn started coming up but it was real tiny ... their rabbits in the neighborhood day would eat it uh but uh they got earlier back real quick I put some little metal cages on\nTop of the the the rabbit pieces a lot easier because they can't climb over things and and so you can set up a miniature chicken wire fence or something for the short term to rent them from getting in but the rats climb over everything so it's a little bit more problematic\nYeah that's what I did I put a little cages on top of the uh the corn and there are hardy so they grew a secondary leaves real quick and um\nYeah yeah my uh Robert danger growing right now and are there are some flour that pretty black and white flour and I put from oil burgundy's and uh just put 'em in the ground reporter rain I got out of the greenhouse and put them in the ground\nI got some key piece they're growing up the key piece I'm looking for runner being shut runner bands with Iraq a blast zone I Wonder if you guys got him\nWe generally do that the scarlet runner beans I ... that we usually have them on a seed packet at both locations\nOkay good okay thank you very much\nAre already David thanks very much for calling we're going to take a quick break Jerry hang on we'll get to you next if\nYou want to give us a call the number's eight hundred seven six zero KF MB that's one eight hundred seven six zero five three six do we'll be back just after this [noise] am seven sixty KF envy\nWalter Anderson nursery and than helping San Diego gardeners did he says and their garden looked inside it now since Nineteen twenty eight and being the leading nursery in San Diego they've seen it all when it comes to gardening\nTheir professional staff can find it easier and said the solution to your problem jumping to either they're convenient location vinegar were telling him he was Walter ... in the garden service\nOfficer enters the nursery has been helping San Diego gardeners and he says in their guide and then finding out since Nineteen twenty eight being the leading nursery in San Diego they've seen it all when it comes to gardening their\nProfessional staff in finding easy and and the dissolution your problem jumping to either they're convenient location ... or a talent agency was Walter ... is the third or\nFor you tired of exposing your retirement of stock market risk how'd you like to participate in stock market gains but never stock market losses joins stew Weissman for the state money and then some radio show on Saturday and two pm on AM seven sixty talking breaking news you can also call stew Weissman now for your free customize safe information money kid\nAnd one hundred and Fifteen page save money both at eight four four three five three save that for for three five three Seventy two thirty three eight four four three five three seats for for three five three Seventy two thirty three [noise]\nWhile you're shaking your flip flops I Need to buy a used car but I'm kind of scary oh I see but look\n...

D skate mall that's dance to Saudi AAA approving the star certify taking care of folks are over there in the golden triangle for over twenty five years\nDamn myself and all of our employees come together to bring you ought to talk radio for one simple reason and that is we all believe in St philosophy we never ever put money I had to people\nVery important to us always taking care of folks like family stop and have your vehicle service repaired and find out what quality automotive service repairs all about\nYou can take advantage of our no charge sort of care transmission diagnosis actually have a story about that from this week along with our free shuttle rights to or from work or home low cost rental vehicles\nBecause false on Facebook or Twitter but you can get there to go on to by going to the west automotive group\nAnd he said well the cat later coming up out of the needs to be warm or should I commend it driving around for much you know forty five minutes and then come back and have it we checked\nA file okay what year is a BMW Ninety four and why did they put a catalytic converter on it\nIt's not it's somebody what did it fail smart for\nOr did they catalytic converter totally was eaten up scale it went on it [noise]\nOkay um but when it failed smog initially was it for higher missions or or what what\nHigh emissions yeah all the rest we did to tune up anything out so it must it catalytic converter that when they took it out I mean if nothing left on the catalytic converter so when they put it in my question is do I need to warm up more should be working right off the bat\nShould be working right off the bat so here in what I'm digging out here is catalytic converters like the one on my truck is one got three hundred and six thousand miles on it in the car I keep the admissions and everything and proper water if there's a problem I get it fixed right away cetera so that ...\nHas show zeroes\nOkay so ... you know it should be ... right away if it wants to catalytic ...\n... ... well let me get to I'm a I'm going to get to a point here real quick and the point that I'm trying to get here to here is that there's probably something else wrong that caused the catalyst to fail on that vehicle whatever it is wrong has not been corrected most likely we see that a lot somebody just arbitrarily says\nWell the fix that will put a catalyst on it and not at work and not all uh make the car pass smog when in essence you're not really you're putting a band aid on it sometimes it will but you're not fixing natural problem they call them the failures of ... to look into that closer to\nThe end you your question about should you have to warm up the catalyst absolutely not not I don't bring the car up the operating temperature\nDrive a few miles everything should be warm and operating the way it's supposed to\nOkay I think that was my question I appreciate you have no problem they named list light Bye bye so\nWe the way too much of that for sure um folks just a um\nPeople not diagnosing failed smallest properly uh technicians\nCatalyst get thrown into a vehicle you see a lot more than what we don't see it near as much [noise] but uh unfortunately it's an expensive repair for some and in her car may indeed a catalyst\nIt may have been damaged by someone else but sounds like something else going on there's somebody else diagnosed vehicle properly\nFor why it's failing small and so they need to get a good look at how to diagnose properly without question otherwise that catalyst within a few months won't be any good anymore either\nEspecially for running high CEO a or have any oil consumption problem or anything like that going on um it will destroy the catalyst Hi folks give me a call your one eight hundred seven six okay if it'd be that's one eight hundred seven six zero five three six to one eight hundred seven six zero five three six to anything automotive related\nUm I have to talk about so my topic for this morning though was a top ten most common transmission\nProblems ah and I I kind of came up with this after a helping the folks and and the folks I was helping I was talking about we're in ... I've been working in the current events location uh I'm actually a coral is a trained him there are in bend\nA working with Ron nail who's been with me quite a while there and and the tax actually been having a great time with these guys I'm\nPreviously or when we open the store and my general manager worked with him\nAnd uh uh I didn't actually get to spend much time in the ... and so I've spent quite a few a few weeks here down there with them in a uh uh get the dome and all that all some guys I mean I knew they were great tennis and then I Know they all seem to diagnose I can tell that by the way things run without even being there but uh getting to spend some time with them and their personalities been really great so uh\nUh Joel McHale a Rick\nI'm three great technicians also down there all along with all the guys at all all the stores that I have I have some awesome employees and their what helped make things great for sure so I Do do appreciate all they do for me um all the guys up enough can beat ... Dennis\nI'm Scott Chris all the tax\nUh Leo shuttle driver couldn't do it without him these awesome Sandy my outside fleet sales a person she takes care of the helping all the fleet people make sure they get their vehicles are arranged in it handled and delivered and picked up and service properly and know what all these guys are what make the team or target to save\nTheir how the west automotive Cooper goes above and beyond taking care of folks so I appreciate working with all the\nUm [noise] so anyway because ... is a complex mechanical system that controls application of power from the engine to the drive up no lie about that it experiences more ... overtime to most of the parts of the vehicle do the heat friction produced by their many moving interacting components\nMajor issues may arise if they thought service than well maintained a symptoms or a problem that are not checked by professional sumo will develop into something more expensive without question and that can happen a lot a\nTransmission repairs are replacements are inconvenient stressful and typically can be quite expensive if er or number one not diagnose properly number two left to their ah ah have a problem they started having an issue with the transmission continue to operate it you can damage other things on it\nYou may not need a complete transfer his replacement or or a complete ... rebuild or re manufacture a like we do but you are I'm might end up with one if you continue to operate the transmission of have an electronic issue or something like that and you end up burning up the transmission\nOf some of the things that happen or lack of response whining clocking homing leaking leaking of transmission is a big deal the reason it's a big deal is are\nYou running low in fluid enough times and you're going to have a serious problem that we will need a transmission for sure so we're talking about transition problems but anything ah\nAutomotive related give me a call one eight hundred seven six okay up to be the one eight hundred seven six zero five three six to ... how are we doing sir\nOkay I'm I'm afraid of as a uh she says that to all swag in China and they had like ... when al ... and uh I don't know if you've ever worked with them but they're real there to repair\nAnd especially of the driver's side because the battery is fun yep and um [noise] um\nI I guess conducted the battery and a lot it was like my hand in there and and change that that that old but like I was afraid it does affect the badly and I just want to point out\nUm is there a safe way to disconnect that or I mean just just connect it in a a work\nGreat question great questions so um\nWhen dealing with the battery first off a we always wanted to disconnect the negative terminal first\nOkay and then you can just proceed forward do keep in mind late model cars all the adaptive in the computer and everything are going to be a race all the monitors get a raise if you'd disconnect of battery on a car I have a battery run that dies and you have to replace the battery\nA it's not a great idea to go out and get a car smart right afterwards but you need to be very careful\nWhen you do so pay attention to your negative ... terminals disconnected negative disconnect the positive and you can\nOr that have been you can remove the battery when you put the battery back in a positive goes on first\nTightened down ISIS dug the negative last nothing on the key shouldn't be in the ignition et cetera um and and you'll be just fine as far as that goes uh\nWe do see cars that come in with reversed polarity just had a a a a late model Camry actually of two thousand eleven or the gentleman had gone to buy a battery himself in a battery store a instead of it there battery required or twenty six are which\nIs relative to where the terminals are they gave him a group twenty six it's opposite he did not know the difference he put it in and he actually connected negative to positive positive than negative\nBlues a master fuse out of the ah a bottom of the fuse box they're kind of an expensive repair I mean by the time diagnose it figured out\nAnd you know two three hundred bucks for for rowing battery answers salacious so my point to that is just be careful what you do there but negative offers than positive and then reverse going back in positive back onto the positive terminal and negative on last and tightened down\nOkay so let me a sandwich saying so the only\nReal problem than is and they show your priorities are correct uh so so the first thing you do your check all the negative and then when you put it back on it you you put the positive on first is that the only criteria as far as the batteries are\nPretty much pretty much and don't don't accidentally reversed polarity but they don't actually do they put the positive cable and the negative in the negative on the positive 'cause you\nThis guy was lucky three hundred dollars easy you could blow all kinds of ... some of these cars ... bay off during the expensive\nRight I and I understand that but I I just thought that uh there was more to it I Know there was a device\nThat a a protected so to protect the situation by connecting this device or and then we move the battery of advice would would\n[noise] yeah I mean it seems like when I'm coming to stop you know if that's the kind of going out low will know speed maybe twenty Fifteen to twenty miles per hour out of this and I can hear and I'm not sure if it's a valid but it sounds like a squeaky\nOkay well it sounds like to me only get this week when you're applying the brakes does that make sense\nYeah but it doesn't sound like it's the brain and I know that sounds like a grand in any kind of a place that had my husband usually do that but it's actually sounds like you know like\nWhen Los ... when you were stopped does that make the noise yeah okay I doubt it's a belt okay to be honest with\nYou um there's something going to could be something this is Benjamin something like that um you know\nIt's best to get obviously get diagnosed properly because just just to kind of throw things at the car is not something we want to do that that gets expensive but I'm sure it's probably something not that major to be honest with you OK I'm about to be a ... yeah the yeah\nThe other question because we're really hard on our cars we get oil and live day you know change tired and break when we need it at our show I've\nNever brought it in front [laughter] we hadn't really get like like Toyotas so I've never really brought an end but I hear a lot of people calling in when you're talking about like a transmission getting clean and I've never done that is that they have like a man\nWell they have to translate to service the only thing that could definitely extend the life of the transmission without question because it would uh carries there's wearable components in their little metal part men don't metal particles are made little touch\nMature particles et cetera so the change of the flu to filter on those regularly and we usually recommend Eighteen to twenty thousand miles are not\nGoing to I'm way overdue definitely how early can help prevent\nA major transmission failure without question so a very cost effective it's not that expensive to get done and uh it definitely helps sure\nLook great I'll definitely did that I think like I I have to drop off the car I can wait with the car\nYou could wait if you made an appointment for it usually it's a word two hour and a half me max process\nOkay sounds good well thanks for having a lot of good information I I appreciate your time\nNo problem thanks for being a lizard and have a wonderful weekend out there ... okay you too Bye bye Bye bye\nGreat questions for sure um you know as far as that goes with the transmission service uh as as you know we talk about this a lot translations of hydraulic unit the only way to keep it in working order is keep the flu would do for clean on it or if you do so you can get multiple miles out of the transmission\nMultiple miles out of transmission it will work hard for you ah but ah the flu gets too dirty and we get a soul annoyed that uh\nSticks or something like that or a doll that a ... sticks them to slide in and we have a shift in a loss of pressure and about five or six miles of driving like that you can have a a trance but may transmission problem starting so keep a food clean and everything keeps working properly uh\nTo uh prevent that as best be you know that doesn't guarantee you ... you won't have a transmission failure but it sure goes a long way and tried to help prevent one so that's that's why I keep my vehicle service that way or let's grab a Roger and saying to you that Roger\nUm they're good morning morning how are you I'm doing great how about yourself sir\nI'm fine thank you for taking my call Rochelle my wife's cars to two thousand three BMW\nThree twenty okay and I'm a transmission fluid it taught me how that works on that car how do you teach me how do you top it all changed it or whatever\nThat was two thousand and three yeah yeah um does it probably doesn't have a dipstick right I Know I ...\nI I have to ask because there's so many different cars and bottles and\nThat that from one year to another they okay so there's actually a fill a it the one or two things on on on an automatic transmission do dipstick there's either a field that goes straight up to the bottom of the pan\nOr there's a a Phil on the side of it in a place where you remove a plug in one flew it starts to run out that it's full and you have to do this or you\nFill it up and then you have to do it when run into you got to bring back we check it it's very important to get the level just right and uh so it requires kind of and there's a special Phil tool for some of these foreign service they remove the path place to filter all that ... diet it till like back to that process to get the flu level just right\nRight they do that type of work oh yeah absolutely absolutely all the time\nOkay and then something like that as cautious either no\nUh no not really a couple of hundred dollars around that area somewhere depends on the transmission there are some of the busiest transmission is out there that ah the\nFilter is actually corporate it into a plastic panting you replace the whole filtered paying altogether those are like more expensive service I remember three twenty five hour three twenty I doubt when usually I didn't take them those are more up around the seven forty five\nUh thirties uh five thirty five so those cars had a those are replaced by paying to filter simply so um but ah all that can be locked up if you are give a I don't if you're on the anti if you give our alcohol location or call they'd be happy to look it up put at that summit together for you for transmission service on that and then you'll know\nVery good thank you so much\nNo problem Roger thanks for being a list there and have yourself a wonderful safe weekend\nI take care of a pack\nSo kids are great questions this morning here give us a call folks one eight hundred and Seventy six okay if it'd be that one eight hundred seven six zero five three six too happy to talk about anything on motor related with you any questions concerns et cetera uh\nOr the transmission questions are are also like I said the only thing you can do to help a transmission is served as a properly or if you think you rapid transmission problem man you you know what getting diagnosed by somebody who's qualified to do so not throwing parts of the vehicle is the most in Port and\nPart of any repair quality diagnosis by qualified technicians reason why that is is\nYou just don't end up throwing things at a car that you don't need you know we just don't need to put money into something that is not a problem [laughter]\nSo it I I think most folks agree about that you know and also often with some things let's take the chance there's part out of ... and this road trip through the checkout diagnosed so that we do our sort of care do charge\nBut if we have to go into electronic diagnosis or something like that folks often asked why do you charge for that will never want to charge for it because er technicians are well trained and they spent a lot of time and money to get that way so that they can diagnose vehicle properly so we do charts for the time\nI'm number two that is the best money you spend\nOn any repair is ... a qualified diagnosis by qualify technician at a quality facility that money right there that's the best money of any repair you'll ever spent and you hear me say it over and over again a because that is truly a fact if I'd be a quote diagnose properly\nRecommended repairs fall through the best money you'll ever spent because you're not waste of money um as far as that goes you you know we see cars all the time that people throw four five six seven hundred dollars at\nProblems not fixed or thousands like a transmission problems optics we stopped coming we got ... ... square one way and it's sometimes ends up being like a three or four hundred dollar repair with the diagnosis and that would have been the best place to start initially for sure [noise] from my thoughts that money that way\nFor sure get it diagnose properly\nBy hang tight Derek\nWill be with you right after this one eight hundred seven six okay if it'd be ... says there are five or six to click on TALK radio seven fifty [noise]\nMiramar

I Know there was some downgrades that get on the news of the rising cost of that comes\nOn the lake also all those all those came out with all the calls\nYeah yeah and I I Love when those big firms sometimes and come in and downgrade good quality companies because they're looking more on the short term I think and I think it really Christmas by opportunity\nYeah I mean you can do more research to understand the business and so forth and I think it's definitely worth it I I like what we see here are just make sure and as long as there's a little\n... to ... below holding so\nOkay [laughter] as on channel ...\nI just do all of this one is\nMore than ... ... certain political but even while I Love\nThat Greg great company but I I think that's worth going forward again the company's Huntsman Corporation symbol H un worth research to do is a good long term hold All right wing\nOf thinking about going out with the law of all I'd like\nTo thank you Bye bye I'm All right I I was going to go the next call and I see it's like a twenty four I I I guess we got time yeah let's go do still go to a Greg in San Diego great Eunice ... going up you\nCared about word our own some of it is true for chirping and they're going look or whatever\nOkay and the great how long ago did you buy it\nBothered I'm I'm In it at about nine eighty as we're a little over a year ago um thought go up obviously come back down a little bit more of a long term old burger served on your viewpoint\nOkay motives of Ford Motor company the symbols F as in Ford or\nNot I start the racial five point five industry not material prices sales are very good point to to the point forward to price to book value point nine six versus one point nine you're paying less than a dollar share for the book value of this company created a phenomenal there and parts of casual to point to receive a four point for\nAwhile six point eight percent dividend and the only use forty five percent of the rings of pay that out\nA sales rep three point three percent year over year industry up point for\nMe to share for for climb by sixty seven percent year over year when the enthused down twenty to present we do so current racial one point to pursue one point one dance good debt every foreigner Nineteen but she too twenty six but you have to understand how much that debt is coming from the financing of cars that they are selling\nReturn on equity very good Eighteen point six words\nIt's worse than negative one for the industry net profit margin is for the negative point to for we see what Congress to point six versus a three point five and immature I drove a twelve point one which BC industry\nAt ten points rates chased by the end is going forward\nAs a current price or for forty eight dollar sixty four cents between ... Thirteen dollars and thirty three cents and fifty two week low right near that eight dollars and fifty five cents\nBut we have to December two thousand Nineteen estimated earnings for ... basis one dollar forty one sense or give us a lovely target cell price of twenty three dollars and twenty seven cents I mean it looks very very attractive here\nI Know the company's been pressured with a tariffs and so forth that came out and said\nThat the terrorists had a big impact on their the rising costs and so forth so I definitely understand that problem but you know I think a lot of that baked into the stock price I\nLiked what I see what the numbers for the most part\nAnother area one day a close look at here Greg and what are they doing in ... Thomas driving I I Know they have some works in that but I Know General Motors has some great things going I Know it has some stiff competition there so I Want to make sure they're keeping up with that because I Do personally believe that as the future for these ah oh yeah I'm sure the original equipment manufacturers here\nAnd when they go to as a A R and D how much input into that because I Would assume that aren't day will be going into have got to catch up without the autonomous driving and so forth but I mean I I like the company I'm you're also facing the head of a rising interest rates here\nBut um I I like what I see in the company I I think it could be another long term hold but you also collect it what it was a ... percent David and while you're waiting so I can be worthwhile looking into\nExactly and the other concern here Greg is that we're peak auto sales um but you know I I I Do believe why we hit the peak I don't think we're gonna have a drastic fall off here so yeah I I think these companies seem to make good money over the next several years yeah so am I right\nOut than anything guys for it are great I have a good one to Iraq\nAre right that close out all the phone lines for the second half of the show you went to Columbia first up one eight hundred seven six zero\nK.

I'm going to work on our right to end up on the phone line one eight hundred seven six zero K. F. and be that one eight hundred seven six zero\nFive three six to let it out to Julian and speak with Dee Dee you on this morning bishop Brent chase how can we help you\n[noise] can I we can have a yes\nAnd have a yes [noise] I own a gun and then when it ...\n[noise] so [noise]\nOkay you I I think on a car for I'm probably going somewhere between the mountains and And Julian there it sounds like you're kinda fading in and out um but I think what you said you as you bought a Amazon's told about half of two thousand dollars now thinking about buying back into it is that is that correct they\nGot their own\nYeah yeah yeah we can have just bringing up a little bit there so I ... and congratulations on to the movement Amazon ... he did well in that I mean as it were not big fans of Amazon because very prices are going to go to the numbers here for a up\nAgain it can be as Amazon civil eight and the end a PE racial and here's why we get concerned the hundred and fifty six versus forty eight for the industry\nPrices sales for versus at one point eight price to book value forty versus twenty point seven and price a casual forty four versus twenty three so all of a wish wish it was very high now they had been a good job growing their sales and earning sales rep thirty eight point six percent by double digits Seventeen\nEarnings per share a hundred and Seventy seven percent\nVersus forty six for the industry or the balance sheets not as good as it used to be I'm surprised on this but they have a current racial one point one person one point to that's okay but debt equities now a hundred and thirty one percent\nVersus Ninety percent for the industry so their debt has risen quite a bit over the past couple of years here a return on equity is Eighteen point nine not as good as the industry at twenty five point for net profit margin is only two points sex versus three point seven we see what your number is twenty points to another surprise here\nIndustries that thirty one and image or ... nine point seven versus six point five got some other comments well let's find out first the earnings from Jason yeah of\nCourse I I noticed we did lose ... of going through these numbers here she still listening yes [laughter] price is one thousand seven hundred and eighty eight dollars and sixty one sense particularly type two thousand\nFifty dollars and fifty cents fifty two week low nine hundred and fifty two hundred and fifty cents or something very very well this year of course we'll get to a December two thousand Nineteen though estimated only ... basis\nTwenty four dollars and Ninety seven cents for use of sixteen point by multiple that we didn't target ... four hundred and twelve dollars and one cent so again well below that current price in this company is the the exact example of a growth company I mean no value to it\nAnd now when I was a ... some value to it but I yeah yeah somebody to it but not a value company I guess how short phrased it and when I was at an investment conference there's a a a manager there fund manager talking like no it's not personal just priced me I'd love Amazon I I use them quite frequently for for products and so forth but\nYou know it's not personal price the price just way too expensive for this company\nIn the ... once I was gonna bring up too is that is not just the retail side which should be done a phenomenal job but actually competitions coming in I mean we've got other retailers that are starting to compete with them we see a Amazon's trying to open stores like whole foods started about other things\nBut also to their aid ws which is there a ... a which actually has been the big earning earnings driver for them not the retail side and I think people buy for the retail side that runs into going all the money from the car business\nBut one thing we've talked about is that they have some retailers that have the club is through Amazon which I think they're saying hey let's switch over to you know a Cisco or somebody else that has a cloud business because we want to give our competitors money so I I Believe they have topped out\nUm I think the momentum could be over for them or something we would never buy de because the fact is just way too high not saying it's a bad company ... it's just our growth stocked as well well above a comfort level for me\nExactly and I mean I did look after September two thousand twenty two that's as far as the numbers go when there is an estimated orange the sheriff's anyone dollars and forty eight cents I don't see how they get there to be quite Frank with you I mean that has some serious earnings growth and as companies grow it gets harder and grow those earnings when you are larger and larger\nBut even as Seventy one dollars at forty cents for earnings roots are going to target the price of one thousand one hundred Seventy nine so you're looking\nAbout for four years out I mean that's even more difficult to forecast that and I want to I referenced Benjamin Graham he's a father die investment I call them and I was reading a book and he said\nYou know these these people they justify the future earnings and they say you know at some point this comes to me very very profitable mhm but the farther out you go the harder is the forecast you can't forecast income and competition you can't forecast competitors perhaps had already been out there yet right\nRight so ... and that's what we don't like what we like to have some kind of hold onto an Amazon could go to twenty five hundred a that's a possibility\nBut the thing I've said oh by years of doing this that you get these high fires a bit there hot for your for maybe three four five six years and all of a sudden something else happens and then all of a hobby I go back to trading on the fundamentals and their stock either stays at that level or worse falls which we've seen many many times I look at history\nYou don't want to

technology to do it\nAnd it's really dangerous 'cause when any government tries to control anything like ... their businesses back in the nineties they micromanage\nAll business and it almost led to their you know\nYou know met collapse so you want to have diversity you want to have um you know people doing different things and the and the thing not all the same thing because you know\nTo have diversity you want to have um you know people doing different things and the and the thing not all the same thing because you know yeah you know they're not and that way they'll be like immunized against some one thing that could happen that sure you know a monolithic society it could be destroyed\nWell you know the thing it's it's like anything else in society guns you name it you can use this tech for good or bad but [noise]\nI'm just saying that I think we need more even people in government who understand tech\nBetter because tech is getting so far ahead of what we regulate that weird stuff is happening and the funny thing is when they have the Senate hearings and their stuff\nAbout tech that the level of ignorance oh well that's the probably question yeah just amazing I ah well even just on any any subject you will go out of this guy yet to be a ... but you know it's a they went into politics they only have to do\nYou know what you don't have to put in any of that you don't want to put it in your gender you don't have to put it in relationships that you don't have to put any of that on Facebook\nYou know you can even use a phony names or make a ... ... email it doesn't matter because\nIf you're at so does your on Facebook if your friend says I'm so happy that so and so got together with someone so Facebook know it was like it isn't up to you anymore and that's a problem if you look at the DNA databases right they said that enough people now\nHave registered their DNA that there's a sixty percent chance of figuring out who you are just from the existing data base without you ever putting any of your DNA in the database because then after your third cousins already have [laughter]\nFacebook is the same thing but that was said we need somebody trying to protect privacy or at least provide guidelines we need some somebody would be you know government ... uh you know and Matt do you really think the government cares [laughter]\nI don't know that they are but they are they will if we raise ... they'll do something a ... something is usually misguided and let people understand tech and it's generally don't drive and this one guy ... right he's a computer scientist I think he's the only one in Congress\nAnd the problem is once you get in there it's the good old boys club and you're going to be a pushed aside or smashed unless you go along with the program the whole thing needs to be done in my opinion because you know what we have is a bunch of an effective politicians who just want to get reelected and gather power although we do it digitally\n[laughter] like that yeah it's tough man it's tough pretty soon\nAll your representatives will be Alexa [laughter]\nUh my digital representatives right who has more brains than you could do that um [noise] Apple's sales to make a list of America's most admired employer\nOh yeah that's interesting because all the stuff they do over a major you know it's uh that's how you have to remain competitive these days\nApple pushing back against the hack the chips are from China they're saying that didn't happen to them um and at a Bloomberg got it wrong ... his Amazon and so does the government and so we'll see Bloomberg sticking by their guns yeah we'll see who turns out to be right\nSo yeah on that list I was trying to figure out more about this list mhm Amazon Google Microsoft and even this really shocked me so I'm I I give no credence to the list anymore even the U.S postal service appear and they're taught Fifteen come on come on [noise]\nWell let's see um Bloomberg is saying that the attack by Chinese spies ... almost thirty U.S companies ... and what they were doing so because all this stuff's made in Asia and stored in Asia they were just adding a chip on one little chip and and\nI'll be honest if I'm looking at a mother board or pieces circuitry I mean the chip they added is size of a ... smaller than a grain\nRice and its masquerading it looks just like another you know other legit chip ... supposed to be on there\nAnd so um you know visually you look at it and say now I I got nothing I don't see anything and half the time or if you look at it electronically you wouldn't see that house are more than ... you wouldn't see it uh somebody usually during some weird testing at a university or we'll stumble across it it's like how ... got busted\nThere was some you know the ... the suffers broken or doing some testing you know wait a minute look what happens when you do this and [noise]\nWell I don't know I mean apple Amazon deny it um but that's the business one of one Russian I everything yeah uh even if a customer\nI mean apple Amazon deny it um but that's the business went a long ride sharing I everything yeah uh even if a customer calls with a problem\n[laughter] I've never heard of that if a if you're a hunter company that's a software problem if you offer company all that's definitely a hardware problem [laughter] update ah that's pretty common so a lot of tech support you need to hit is creepy\nThough um because we don't make all that stuff here we just don't we don't have a we don't have the infrastructure for it um or the low wages for frankly\nI'm ... ... ... it is made in countries that are increasingly beholden to China China is really really powerful in that region I go to Asia Pacific all the time and they are expanding and building things in countries\nThat looked like what we built back in the thirties like massive projects and if that's what's put highways all three of the country right like even if there's no cars on them yeah and it's All right so they have a lot of influence and uh\nI I think these things will accelerate\nYeah it it's interesting how the customer who is a highly regulated by the federal government and so we're supposed to put in some wireless and some cameras [noise]\nThey select a particular brand new camera 'cause it was made in usa well that company filed bankruptcy so we said okay we pick another ... cameras unless you want to buy it from a company is in bankruptcy who may not be able to support you a good luck trying to find IP video cameras\nThat are made in the United states oh yeah I mean a lot of stuff I use try to find a TV [noise] yeah uh it's we\nDon't really make that stuff anymore and it's really sad ...\nNo well there's a number of reasons one is a lotta times manufacturing those products produce lots of bad chemical thing dirty Harry expensive to deal with in this country but over there you just dumping the river yeah that's a lot of times this type of work to make this stuff requires\nUm a lot of highly technical skills that we just don't have the workforce for a really long hours that are very expensive to pay here so if you don't want a five thousand dollar iPhone if you want a thousand dollar iPhones you have to make it overseas yeah\nYou could make it here it would just be five times more expense\nIt could be there's some products that are made here and they they are competitive it kinda depends on how they go about it\nUh but if if anybody's the sign of the time and it was really difficult for the customer to say well we want to you know we have by America radio ... sure but there's there's nothing made like that electronics right\nIt's difficult it is a one eight hundred seven six zero calf and be one of these hundred seven six zero five three six to\n'em and give us a call do it because uh I think you know we can talk about other stuff sure we got off on this ... because these are age to be it's it's in the news right are you at all day long it seems like another hack another oh you better change your passwords so hilariously\nUm we had a famous rapper meet with a president this week and on camera said famous rapper unlocked his phone\nAnd everyone saw that his password is five zero [laughter]\nSo I'd recommend Kanye West changed his password on his phone because we all saw that it's just all zeroes everybody saw that he had locked it to show the president a picture or something and uh\nOn camera so um if you use a pass to it on your phone and it's all zeroes\nYour um that that's not wise and if you decide to unlock it right on camera ... far less than wise\nYes so just remember that celebrities when you unlock your phone either use touch id ah or hide the number it's just like when you're at the ATM what do they tell you what the ATM rife like guard you know don't make an obvious what\nNumbers your head and said out loud when you type found out that right well on two or three [laughter] so all over the Internet now there's these little videos and Kanye hitting all zeroes and unlocking his phone and then there's all sorts of jokes for that you know what do you think the code is to get into his house and everything else\nSo yeah I pretty much ignore all that 'cause I don't I don't care what celebrities do or say no it was just like meaningless the gates that watched it solve it oh hey I Know his unlock code number [laughter]\nUh my yard at anything you do say whatever's gonna picked up on and then so that's the ... just back to surveillance even if you're trying to hide your\nYour pen [laughter] their cameras overhead that can still see what you're telling me oh God here we go back to the watchers well [laughter] I mean\nIf if I really want to scare everybody I'm One of the watchers okay so that's true so we just want a freak everybody out completely we're doomed that's where we're at right now\nAh I don't know I ... I mean you know you try to be ethical and do a good job in and certainly I'm Serious about my work but you are your ideas as I go to industry events in as I get deeper into the security industry cameras and locks indoors and all of that stuff um it\nIt's a very interesting dynamic were rushing towards having everything connected were rush right for the digital homework or ours are locked even being controlled through your phone which opens up all kinds\nThat's the problem is like liability if I make a really insecure device but it sells and it's very popular and bad guys take that really insecure device and use it to attack infrastructure\nWho's faulted that Matt [noise] it's okay I Know you're insecure would have to be it'll get to see my vote\nWill be back\nHave you been shocked by your recent electric bills are you tired of renting electricity from the utility that's\nPretty much what you're doing call tell them our solar today to find out if an investment in solar makes sense for you and your family pal in our solar their goal from the beginning and still to this day is just to help you make the right decision I'll never forget when they came to my house and we did our first reinvestment\nAnd they completely walked me through the decision of the process gave me a couple of different options", "show_name": "Armstrong & Getty", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "13"}
