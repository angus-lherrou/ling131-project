talking about how much tunnel what's happening\n[noise] so it's a it's about two miles of tunnels so it's relatively short but the the big news is that on December attend that test title will be open to the public for the very first time\nOkay tell us what this thing is what what does it do\nShow that the test tunnel is designed to just demonstrate the feasibility of this underground tunnel network that that mosque envisions for this high speed alternative um to help us a deal with with the\nThe nightmare that is LA traffic and traffic elsewhere across the United states how high speed so he says this test tube will go as fast as a hundred and fifty five miles per hour for passengers\nAnd as I mentioned yesterday when we were discussing this if you can average thirty five miles per

it\n[noise] so so what are the key differences that mosque says between this system in the subway is that they'll just be a lot more stations and it won't be these\nKind of congested central terminals but this kind of a decentralized a number of hubs that don't have this kind of giant footprint on the street level and that it's kind of seamless for you to enter and exit and that all routes will be

there are two scenario so the one is actually you're just in your car and the car kind of latches onto this this this what's called a skate\nAnd then you you are shuttled to your destination and then another scenario Europe a death gene or a cyclist so I can imagine they're being seats and seatbelts but um it's it's like I said there's also another scenario where there's a there's a car and there's no protests strip\nQuoting you're fine piece of journalism for longer routes this vacuum based system could move people in cars without wind resistance with palms traveling faster than six

European\nLeaders defending the continents Christian Identity against the Muslim influx so that may have something to do with a hungry says it offers sufficient space in emergency shelters to accommodate all individuals without a home and would provide additional support starting this week\nThe law will actually save ... lives the only way to get back on your feet after becoming homeless starts from getting temporary combination because from there they can get social support closed jobs community work and training\nSays the state's secretary of human resources a unpronounceable\nNow from\nLast year quarters it's being criticized as inhumane and cruel\nBut assuming for the moment that that's true that they have enough space for people and if you want to go in you can\nI don't understand how that's in humane and cruel unless you believe that the taxpaying citizens of a town any down have to put up with people living in the streets and parks and the rest of it\nThat wasn't the case for most of human history\nI mean at least western civilization you get your beggars in the streets in India and whatnot\nBut\nSo what was that legislation was in California where are they talking about hospitals are not allowed to kick a homeless person not unless they got some place to go\nUntil they've arranged food and clothing and uh and housing fourth\nAnd is that still making its way through the process are not sure that ... that would be on doable obviously or as hospitals would immediately become just homeless shelter ... you would never go to any are 'cause it would be completely out of control right\nRight yeah the hospitals are terrified of that I don't know the status of that honestly and that's one of the frustrations of you know big giant government in general but a corrupt the foreign yet in particular as you hear about these outrageous laws and you think that can't possibly pass but then he does with virtually no attention paid to it partly because we're all obsessed with Trump\nAnd it's all about federal politics and politics so Ninety percent of the population pays zero interest to their state and\nLocal government I don't know anybody who's not a pretty focused on this almost issue\nOr ... I I'm a\n... there is at least acutely aware of it I mean people in small towns I Know\nAre aware of have you ever talked to anybody who says\nOh I haven't really noticed it gotten any worst my map salute Li Na na na everybody says the Thomas their time has changed completely from what it was ten years ago\nIn twenty Thirteen hungry prohibited begging in many public spaces threatening fines and prison sentences they don't have the first amendment over liar which the judge has ruled that you know begging is first men right\nWhat the hell it give me some money and that's free speech movement I agree actually but um\nHomeless shelter operator Gabor Yvonne ... warned that the law serves the aim of scaring the homeless to prompt them to flee the streets yes\nThey are scared and don't know what to do now so go somewhere else right I think that's exactly my policy yeah yeah some of those people refuse to move into shelter citing unsafe conditions in the presence of drug dealers or the threat of illnesses\nPsychologist also save some individuals for sleeping outside of out of fear of accumulation of people which can be associated with a number of mental illnesses\nBy Monday many homeless people disappeared from the central streets of the country's capital of Budapest according to Hungarian media outlets\nYeah I I yeah I don't know what you do with all the mentally ill people have no idea I don't know how you handle that\nMy youngest with his various problems and all the time and money we're spending on doctors ... and it looks like we may have gotten appointment I think we've got an appointment with supposedly the person\nThat's the best in the world at what we think he's got the best and the whole world wow so that's kind of help your thing but anyway a friend of mine said what happens to someone like your son if they don't know if they can't afford to buy everything you do and I said well they get kicked out of school at some point and then they end up homeless that's what happens to him you know\nOr the family and many talk bringing cases tries desperately to take care of them as long as they can but once they become an adult right and they do whatever they want to do well right and and it could be physically difficult or unsafe to try to compel them to stay at home and\nThen you're on the road yeah we we do a terrible job with mental illness in this country as you know my ongoing that you'll get a theory of civilization that society's veer from guardrail to guard rail\nWay to one thing in a way to another and they hit a sweet spot briefly but they pass it so quickly heading to the guard rail on the other side that you never know you are in the sweet spot and\nWe should not be a country where I can whisper hey he's a mentally ill you probably ought to jail him and the authorities rush in and grab you I mean that's been used by dictators in jail or sort of the hospitals same thing you're not allowed to leave right yeah yeah you're denied your liberty um 'cause that's that's an old time he technique a dictators the Soviet Union did that all the time\nI'm at the same time to have you know incredibly insufficient and unhelpful programs available for mentally ill adults\nAnd tons of them living on the streets that ain't right either what to do about it I don't know I you know I'd like to quit the ... our job and spend the next two years studying it and try to come up with an idea but\nIt's not easy there is a lot is I don't go out to be on ...\nI think it's impossible I think it's actually impossible\nWhat do you mean\nIn less you're gonna unless you're gonna make people go I don't see how it can possibly be dealt with you get a a panel of professionals who certified as you\nFifty one fifty and\nOnce they certify that and there's a review process\nAs you fifty one fifty\nAnd once they certify that and there's there's review process is specifically you're a danger to your self or others I think okay fifty one fifty one

honestly believe you know exactly unless you're gonna make people go to something like a mental hospital in which case you are basically putting him in jail mhm 'cause they're not allowed to leave yeah they did it you can't be no\nClear to me we have to have one of our panel shows and talked to experts on this because it occurs to me that dragging them into a program they have no desire to to be at and denying them their liberty is one cruelty not doing that and having them end up on the streets with the you know the fear of the crime the\nIn a nightmare that lingers on Judy's dealing with

about healthcare abused doctor reviews in particular um if they are worth a damn 'cause I I read some of the surprise me\nAnd he said they're difficult to read because due to hit by the providers unable to respond to any reviews oh wow so if a crazy patient came in and posted a bad review the provider cannot respond to dispute to tell his or her a side of the story he says females can be doctors to Joe\nThank you for that [laughter] I've never been a few hefty fines handed down to doctors who've responded to online reviews\nI think we've talked about this a lot of times do we think the reviews thing will just go away eventually when everybody just figures out that you know what are you going to do I think it will evolve I think how of all if you always have whack jobs who said this place sucks\n[noise] well I Know like a ... and I'm I'm not super into this but Yelp was the first right wasn't that really the first people posting reviews of stuff and\nIt was the first gigantic one for a writer and and people became aware of all the fake reviews and the trolling and the rest of it and and I think trip advisor has\nA defenses against\nThat I just I think they will figure out how to weed out the weirdo\nSalt buddy of mine who's in business where they actually have to pay attention to their yo previews and that sort of stuff said\nThere's a lot of incentive out there too\nYou know make a bad review of your competitor just so they don't have five stars are all four stars whatever the maximum is and what I review system you're talking about because as they get one bad review they'll never get back up\nThe perfect again right always for point something right um it just shows that feed them down yeah exactly it's not it doesn't look the same as a five star review wow that's all you gotta do is get one person says you know our competitor over there\nAnd like they they should implement some thought something similar to like the gymnastics sure where you you just throw out the top and the lowest score of a certain you know a certain percentage you just eliminate\nThe insurance on the way that it kind of get more of an aggregate\nYou know if I'm running Joe's house of pancakes and jak Sammy breakfasts opens up I'm going to give them an ass reviews often as I Need to shout so over and over again [noise] ah this is Mike in Arizona\nSeason

Can't stand Joe Buck's climax with every ... foul tip and silence when the Dodgers\nHave won [laughter] wow [laughter] why\nMany sports fans don't believe this but Joe Buck does not\nCare who your favorite [laughter]\nDoes not seem\nIt is funny how if you're really into a team you become convinced that the announcers are rooting against your team\nBall right 'cause their enthusiasm for your team is perfectly appropriate and their enthusiasm for the other team is utterly 'N Sync it's offensive [laughter]\nSo yeah it's funny how human ...\nFor your team is perfectly appropriate and their enthusiasm for the other team is utterly 'N Sync it's offensive [laughter]\nSo yeah it's funny how human beings are if the announcers sound excited when the other team hits a home run clearly there in favor of that\nTeam winning right [laughter] you'd have to go along with Red Sox taco [laughter]\nClimactic with every Red Sox filed [laughter] that's so funny line well blade my friends and\nSo the other night Trump's impacts us up in front of thousands and thousands of people and he says in the next\nWeek he got a ten percent tax got gunned them for the middle class on everybody cheered like why do you rate\nAnd a myself because I was watching at the time and the and a lot of people in the business in the news is said\nI'd heard about that well yeah and I actually had this flash of feeling bad 'cause it's kind of my job to know what's going on and I thought wow I don't know anything about that to talk about it tomorrow morning but I don't feel so bad now and there's a lot of reporting\nAnd um you know the New York times Washington Post a non Trump crowded I have to take everything with a grain of salt because they made everything he said that they couldn't come up with anybody you knew what the president was talking about leaving the Washington Examiner which is much more favorable toward Trump um hasn't\nTalked to any Republicans that uh had a heads up on that or say that they're you know working on that behind the scenes or anything like that it's certainly can't happen before the election because Congress hasn't even in session and and uh it there's no indication that there were any talks before they went on vacation so\nHere this is from the Washington Examiner this morning the latest sign Trump's middle class tax cut commitment was off the cuff\nCame Tuesday Morning as the administration's own top economists turned down a chance to talk about it\nQuote so right now the person who's discussing the ten percent tax cut for the White House is the president so you should go to the press office and to the president if you want more information on that said the council of economic advisors chairman Kevin Hassett during a press call on Tuesday\nMorning that's not even a no comment that they go after him\n[laughter] yeah [laughter] ... obviously the next morning the whole ten percent tax cut for the middle class came up with\nThe uh the his economic advisor and he said he asked the president I don't know [laughter]\nYeah well what are you going to do\nIs listen if you hate Trump I get that you think that's absurd and\nCrumbling on one level but I Would point this out yeah these are just these are different times this is certainly a different guy and the way he approaches the job is just crazy compared to you know virtually every other presidents we've had a you know certainly for the ... century on\nAt the same time the same time\nAnd this gets back to my ... bombing stuff could punch in people could hounding them out of restaurants you know screeching them in in elevators coach slash and stuff\nYou know it's going to happen now with this ten percent tax cuts\nHis they'll work on it and then it will go before Congress and people will talk about it for a long time and it will either pass or it will not and everybody will be fine the negative effects of this will be none there will be non\nIf you're actually you're not putting it on because you all your friends act like this if you're actually like terrified and freaked out that the president unleashed a non existing tax cut a lot of people are calling you to lie a campaign lie I I I just think he was brownies that that we're nowhere near baked\nThat he took out of the oven and said here how and it's still mostly liquid\n... well ... nobody even knows about the shopping list [laughter] I\nAgain I a reference George Stephanopoulos his book about when he was running the Clinton campaign\nThey set up all kinds of stuff on the campaign trail about we're going to do this kind of tax cutting this kind of health care and this and saying NO PLAN for making that happen until after they want and they thought okay how are we going to do any of this size ... game works I don't like it I don't like it at all but\n[noise] um [noise]\nWhat time is it time to tell what's coming up news Marshfield well we got suspicious packages possibly bombs

hard work in an explanation of why we were successful at a job interview you talk about a successful project that you led to completion including details about the challenges along the way and how you overcame them\nThey said this is a really good way to approach a job interview\nBoy that's interesting it's it's just it's a similar attempt when it comes off in a completely different way of leaves a

a township ordinance that prohibits landowners from cutting down trees without the government's permission your own land\nYou can't cut down any trees unless you would ask the government if it's okay I've never thought about it before I got a lot of trees can I cut them down I think I can cut them down I Would check man although maybe I can [noise] you're probably not going to get busted although I don't know so busy body will come by and see the ... you know the\nPilots have to remove them or or what have you or do you what you up or something they'll freak out and listen I get the intent of

priests\nMcGee is Daphne the bay area news group joined us he's covering the stories and investigative reporter materials how are you good thanks so do we have any conception of how many victims we might be talking about this story\n[noise] yeah I mean the ... you know it's it's not entirely clear um we're getting kind of a rough picture just three lawsuits and other kind of open source um ah but the the attorneys who spoke yesterday they estimate that thousands\nYeah I was going to say it almost has to be in the thousands which is just freaking horrifying so how far they die I don't quite understand what happened here and read the article um it is is opening up the books and finding out that this you know over many decades this has happened is this recently what's the story\nYeah this is over many decades and it's it's a private law firms that you know has had\nRepresented a lot of victims there there are definitely advocating for victims and they basically have taken you know newspaper articles there's a website bishop accountability ... at the database I'm logging all the different priests across the country and their behavior\nThey have um what the dioceses themselves have reported it and they take all of that and looked\nAt these three dioceses in the bay area and determine here is what we have\nSome documented proof of of the uh offenders here in the bay area and it's it's not the same as what we saw in Pennsylvania that's you know when you're a law enforcement body like an attorney general's office you up subpoena power and so they could get internal documentation so you're not\nJust learning you're probably learning about more you know predator priests but you're also learning um how they handle at what happened by the\nRight and as you point out to the uh the attorneys pointed out that because the vast majority of the claims had not been\nRight right so two hundred and twelve priest in San jose Oakland San Francisco um\nGive me some contacts on that how many priests are there in the diocese that big\nYeah I mean currently um there's approximately each of those three dioceses more than three hundred priest at this time and so\nYou know we're talking about over decades so generally speaking um those numbers\nWould have been somewhat static throughout the years um and you know your priest part of the issue in the past has been the dioceses themselves having been counting like the different orders of um Catholics lesions or Jesuits and so\nThat that caused a lot of the counts that they provided to the lower I mean you look at San jose for instance or just in the news last week they released their own\nSelf report of their um a problem priest and they listed Fifteen and then if you look in the report today they found a thirty three and San jose and so they're calling it a deficient you know count and they want a more thorough look from the uh the state AG here in California\nWell I Would say any argument that the Catholic Church might make as to Willa in effect saying we're not going to open our books or do you know we don't deserve this is just gone I mean at this point bare yourself no pun intended um and and you've got to come clean completely\nAnd ironically said this Twenty years ago yeah being who yeah who drew one of the most egregious abusers on a list a is Stephen ... is it is that correct it doesn't matter\nRight up a priest was placed on three years' probation Nineteen Seventy eight from less than two boys in Union City later arrested charged with molesting three girls at Santa pollen Fremont and late sixties early seventies [noise]\nHe was allowed to continue serving in a number of bay area parishes in spite of those multiple offenses until the mid eighties before being ... in Nineteen eighty seven\nAnd he's an eventually you know forced sentenced to six years in prison for abusing a Fifteen year old girl wow so serious the serial child molester allowed to continue on and on for years and and commit more fences is really it's it's going to\nDisgusting so you can go with me okay ah in the sixties and maybe even in the seventies we just didn't understand how damaging child molestation was\nI guess you can go with that argument but we have known how damaging these for quite a while and it would seem that the sort of cover up is been continuing recently\n[noise] yeah I mean I've been reporting on\nYou know the local diocese I've just reported a a over the weekend how you know and one thing that should be noted\nThere's no work continually talking about the children who have been abused when there's this whole other facet and and these dioceses have offices for the protection of children and vulnerable adults and they consider a vulnerable adults someone who can't\nYou know care for themselves um\nFor maybe a mental illness or someone\nLike God and you know I reported over the weekend how a woman they they deemed a vulnerable adult came in the confessional for um a asking for forgiveness for a sex addiction\nAnd the priest off as his personal spiritual guidance which turns into you know her alleging that he asked her to send him nude photos and videos\nThat using inappropriate crucifix on her\nHands bench eventually they send her to have an extra system to remove for quote justice spirits\nHave this many perverse didn't want to organizations are terms attracted to the Catholic Church is the word on the street and ... that if you want to vote on people you do become a member of the Catholic Church or become a priest become a higher up a pile of so many powerful I mean it goes it's way out ways normal society I\nThink we would all agree on that when we as a percentage of people or am I wrong\nWell I mean you talk to the experts and one thing they point to as you as you bring up the average population average population is an ask to be settled it like they are in the Catholic Church and\nSo you know there's reports that you know a certain percentage of priests are sexually active and you know not all of them are you know doing inappropriate stuff with kids you know maybe they have a consensual\nRelationship with another adult but there's this this um organization of secrecy so you know they're going to get in trouble for having this relationship and so they have the secret and they have this secret to hold and they know that\nThere are other brothers and maybe doing something with a child um you know if they come forward than there are a veil of secrecy is over and it's just it it creates this a domino effect and and you know that's what a lot of the experts point to\nTry it scared me from the bay area news group is on the line have ties last question we barely have a minute do we know what's next\n[noise] yeah so um today actually that same law firm is announcing a lawsuit against the Vatican um for some shuffling of priests um for some of their clients um and they also there's also a push in California\nUh uh you know there's more than a dozen states now that are launching their own Pennsylvania grand jury report um type of a investigation\nAnd in California\nThe AG hasn't they they declined to comment on whether they open one or not but when you talk to I'm a survivor advocates who have said that they've met\nWith higher ups in the eighties office and they're kind of talking about what it would look like and how could they organize it and get help from county da's do such a thing here\nBut it's a it's a mosque an absolute must ... bay area news group investigative

to talk about 'em so we'll get to that\nI announced this earlier this morning in case cheery for our listeners number one thank you\nOh thank you [laughter] I'm mentioned this earlier I Do get a well known that dangerous right winger him here by pledging for the rest of my natural life to follow the teachings\nOn the topic of uh illegal immigration to follow the teaching stillborn Brock Hussein Obama as you heard me Morocco by the\nStates but those who enter the country illegally and those who employ them just respect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law we simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected undocumented\nUnchecked of circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully or does become immigrants in this country\nSo I'm a life of me didn't say that was not helpful Gees stabbed us out of control Michael quite a bit of drinking on the job or that is something that rock Obama said that in two thousand five now have have the politics of the Democratic party changed\nMuch yet five yeah absolutely look at look at the roster of people who are Democratic senators who votes\nOh it was virtually all of them you\nKnow one thing because it's ... it's universally recognized that if we're going to control who comes in we need physical barriers in some places here's a tip\nFor you younger people when you get a little bit older you'll be amazed\nAt how fast time flies and I know you already sense that you have no idea [laughter] because I was in five in occurs to me is Thirteen freaking years ago then change I mean a political party changes things move different directions and then about a time but that's quite a change\n[noise] Oh yes that guy couldn't get the nomination oh no he would be portrayed as a conservative Republican\nOr if he ... with no doubt in you know this change I don't have a problem with it but if if Rocco Obama ran on marriage is between men and a woman and which he did right hand the vat immigration policy no way he gets the nomination as a Democrat yeah oh it's unbelievable\nWhich is crazy how can you change that fast but they did\nAnd he would be a little right of the center of the Republican Party who can we hear the next of our favorite clips from Obama\nSecuring the borders alone does not solve immigration management\nWe're gonna have to better manage legal immigration in order to and illegal immigration or senators McCain and Kennedy point us in the right direction on that point right now we've got millions of illegal immigrants who live and work here without knowing\nTheir identity or background or that's part of the reason that we need a guest worker program to replace the flood of illegals where they regulated strain of illegals who enter the United states after checks\nAnd where access to labor rights part of the reason the illegal immigration a is so damaging as a vet it ends up creating a pool of workers with the press wages and no rights and that's something that we find acceptable\nSimple undeniable commonsense not only would I vote for that guy I'd raise money for him\nHe also says illegal the same way I Do maybe it's because we're from the same part of the country what do you mean the legal illegal yeah oh it's funny I didn't even notice the ...\nInternet commerce like legal or illegal\nAnd get

Williams of NBC News is really good on this sort of stuff but that's the first time we've heard anybody actually said they were\nPipe bombs I Know enough about law enforcement techniques to tell you yes they're assuming there functional devices till the moment there one hundred percent ... percent certain that they ate for obvious reasons\nLet's just assume that they're safe every body they could be you can kick that box because the CBC type stuff with Plato or PVC pipe stuffed with gunpowder\nYou got to pick you figure that out there I understand that but the whether or not they were that

you don't tell the new uh and and you know\nArea that they are going to say that the reason we're moving this guy over here is because he was a molesting children the other place thrive so leave your child was this guy I have a good day they don't tell you that when I was just unconscionable\nAny unholy variety pack of child molesters\nTeen lovers and uh incapacitated to or or otherwise um you know irresponsible adult sex or uppers and one thing that I've learned recently and it just because I haven't paid that much attention to it but\nUh and and all America's guilty of this but there's a huge gay problem in the Catholic Church\nYou scream oh let's pick it Armstrong and get a you know here's the problem the end and Matthias gaff needs a bay area news group pointed this out I'm In part earlier this morning when we\nChatted with them [laughter] you are supposed to be celibate if you are not sell a bit you're breaking the rules are in\nTrouble hurts your career you'll be watching more carefully and I don't know about all\nI really like a sex\nI really enjoy it and I would hate to give it up I knew that the moment I discovered it is one of the most powerful natural urges that we'd be have bright to deny it is is is the odd and so here's a yeah I'm against celibacy in general but I'm not really well here's what I'm Talking about what the\nGay problem so you got a hell of a lot of Catholic priests who are having sex\nWith fellers sometimes teenage boys sometimes Persian or sometimes just all their due to sometimes the their priests whatever [noise]\nBut they're in a position now where they can't blow the whistle on say you know you've got a Seventeen year old boy friend you're not going to blow the whistle on the guy with a twelve year old boy friend if you got a twenty eight year old boyfriend you're probably not going to blow the whistle on anybody for anything 'cause they know about your boyfriend\nAnd so there's like this gigantic mutual blackmail rang that flows down from the simply breaking the rules to ethically highly questionable too early unforgivable and all those three layers are protecting each other\nAnd it to a large extent if that is true and I have sources close to the church who say it's a huge problem right now I'm ... it all really flows from celibacy\nI mean 'cause if all of a sudden you know you issued a blanket amnesty you know what the pope I was just talking to a pope the other day you know what I said to me he said to me listen the power to make love to their partner your choice most powerful or we shouldn't be preventing it\nYou have a boyfriend girlfriend whatever as long as they're of age you're\nA hundred percent in the clear no problem ... we were wrong sorry [laughter] now do you know of anybody who's doing it with kids I think he would have a huge rush to wow to out to people who are doing the uh the the truly unholy\nAnd I've always wondered how much of the keeping this quiet covering it up has to do with the you not want now to the whole gay thing\nWhether it's\nMedia or the powerful or whatever you want to get into that difficult politically territory\nOh I Know I Know the the mainstream media are horrified to even under the words that we just because\nWith all the advancements that ... you know the gay community is made in society and God I mean it's unbelievable I don't think any issues ever change this fast in human history in terms of acceptance and I'm fine with all of it\nI'm a\nIt was it just I think it probably just seems like what we're really taking a step backwards if we start blaming people for things are acting like they're doing something wrong\n[noise] yeah I Know what you're saying a little bit the teachings of the Catholic Church or fairly unmistakable oh yeah oh yeah their views on ... ... each other you can be gay you can't you just can't engage anyone and\nAnd listen I I Know what you meant by I'm okay with all of it all to change but you got to school here about a or a store here about a drag queen who came to an elementary school and things and not so fast\nThat I I don't think I don't I don't I don't need it being taught at the very young ages or any of that stuff now and ... so that was an overstatement yeah yeah well but\nGay marriage in the you know all no discrimination and that's all fantastic I Can't believe that share and understanding a lot of people would we know and we love your cliff we live by their uh their game says I'm a lot like bronco momma said what changed his mind\nCriminal that's all fantastic I Can't believe that sure and understanding a lot of people that we know and we love to work with we live by their uh their game says I'm a lot that like bronco homicide what changed his mind do you get to know some gay people that's what changed your mind right [laughter]\nUm but yeah what role does that play in this whole Catholic Church thing I don't know if again and then how about the people that maybe they aren't gay they're not even into the station but they're covering up for the people that they are what is\nThat the iron law bureaucracy what's coming up your news Marshall that we got our reports of suspicious
