which school and we love doing them and we've got some really good gift that he's coming up with the one we did the other day is pretty serious it is about and and I don't like the term human trafficking\nBecause it sounds like civil engineering or you know a question of traffic management\nIt's extortion its report slavery it's the rape of\nChildren in many cases it's terrible and it is way more common than you might um than you might think and ah I'm Sorry you don't have the last name or gifts I memorized\nOkay open singleton who is a well known activist on this topic is worked within and with law enforcement on these issues and we want to play you a couple of quick some and this certainly can see the whole thing if you want to number one please\nOur kids will be the first generation of young people\nThat will be able to reach the entire world and the entire world can reach them almost six billion people and if you think of this eighty seven percent of kids sleep with their phone\nThat's why I said it's a home without walls because at three in the morning in their underwear and their most vulnerable place a total stranger can come in\nAnd access groomer courting exploit your child and so it is all about to change because this is the generation that while they're exciting things for them to do no one is talking to them about how\nLiterally it's a world Without Borders for cartels and pedophiles and organized crime and how they use that to make that happen\nAnd it's much more than snatching up your child or inducing to run away or they don't have to leave your home get sucked into this stuff that they're all sorts of different um extortion schemes\nWhere they get to do your kids get your kids to do things that they normally wouldn't and then then they got 'em 'cause then you could feel really guilty and isolated than they really exploit him terrible and what's your number to\nBasically is live streaming or about him he's ones that I ask what is vapor where which is something she makes reference to go ahead sorry\nSay because unless they're in the room and seeing what you're doing then they can't stop you in the paper where it's basically like live streaming it takes us as law enforcement twelve hours to get a search warrant\nPaper where it's gone and ten Fifteen twenty seconds\nAnd to give you an eye understanding of how this looks there's a new technology which is great technology by the way it's not that the technology is called life dot knee and in that you would\nLive stream and you can gather a large crowd and they can talk to you and they can reward Jewish virtual coins it won't be long 'til there'll be giving you real money and a recent case this little girl's nine years old she's ... thank you ... and ... pretty soon and she has ... says they're rewarding her\nAnd she's stripping mom and dad are nowhere around by the time mom and dad walked in she's tricking naked and had over ten thousand is\nAnd that's what you'd call it vapor where unless your there when that happened unless somebody freeze frame that it's over and it's gone but that is how ah pedophiles get those photographs and sell them in child pornography rings\nAnd she goes into a little more detail about how your kids or kids in general can gift maneuvered into a unsavory activities whether just images of themselves or eventually actual activities in the one thing that really impresses about oh boy is that\nShe and the people she works with she's the president and CEO of ... million kids it's a nonprofit designed to keep kids safe from predators they really really understand kids and teenagers and their psychology in their needs and the way evildoers exploit that psychology as I was taught my kids\nAre bad people are really good at their job and their job is seeming like good people so learn to understand the signs of somebody's trying to do something that's not right you can't rely on oh they're being nice to me because that is the number one skill of of people who do terrible things\nUm and and she talks a little bit about child psychology and and getting roped in in a code number three\nDon't port here is that this happens even in the best of families to parent households even your higher end families will often have better equipment and their kids are playing in the dark Web and you won't know about it and so what\nYou're seeing is any kid that has access time on the social media without supervision is the first child that's gonna be easily sucked in and so it is it is just absolutely critical that we educate parents and we educate kids\nAnd I can tell you if you talk to kids they listen I just ... fourteen hundred of them in an assembly recently and we talked about this low low game that where kids are killing themselves all over the world and it was\nAmazing none of the teachers and none of the principals knew about it but at least a third of the kids in the audience knew about it that is interesting\nAnd and you know global is exactly the same kind of thing it's basically you know they suck you in with a virus say this half women have chicken pops up on your phone all over the world this is happening\nAnd they tell the kids you want to play a game a dare and ah and so the kids can't resist because all of a sudden like a calculator comes on the phone they say just pick a number any number\nThe minute they pick a number they have a virus that goes into the kids um photo album and also there are address book\nAnd so as long as they played the game and they're the kid thinks they're okay the minute they tried to quit playing they go wait a minute isn't the issue and your naked girl friend and isn't this your address book because this photos going on this address book to everyone you know if you stop playing and literally kids all over the world\nWhat happens is in twelve hours or less someone they never met has come in and put them in such a shame state that some of the kids are actually jumping off buildings\nYikes so anyway you if you're interested concerned about that topic it's really interesting and revealing I Would definitely listen as a parent or you know if you're a young person who just just digs the heck out of talk radio\nI'm listening to it it's really revealing in and it's you know one of the things we get into as there is a tremendous\nAmount of slavery going on right now\nAnd it's you know one of the things we get into as there is a tremendous amount of slavery going on right now\nIn your town in your state in the United states and all over the world if you are like troubled by slavery or with all due respect to American history and the terrible damage et cetera and I don't deny that for a second there is slavery going on right now that you can fight if you're into that sort of thing [noise]\nAnyway that's available wherever podcasts are given away for free 'cause we're stupid [noise]\nDonald Trump is the most honest president\nIn the modern era\nSomeone killer asleep wants his point we'll get to that\nBecause\nOf the nation am seven sixty talk and breaking news\nTrump pledged to nominate Supreme Court justices in the mold of Antonin Scalia now Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh sit on the high court Trump pledged to fill the federal appellate courts with young conservative judges so for the Senate has confirmed twenty nine more than any recent president at this point in his administration\nHe found the patches for tax reform signed the first major overhaul of the ... tax code in in three decades\nHe vowed and unprecedented regulatory roll back the strict policy to eliminate to existing rags for every new ragged and his first year he achieved eight point one billion dollars in lifetime regulatory savings that sort of numbers really difficult to settle on but it's billions of dollars' worth um\nDuring the campaign he told African American voters who I Believe some day we'll understand the fraud that the Democratic party has perpetrated on black America and personal note anyway during the campaign he told African American voters and I quote what do you have to lose I Will straighten it out I'll bring jobs back we'll bring spirit back\nThen on his watch African American unemployment reached lowest level ever recorded and his tax reform included a little notice provision creating opportunity zones to try to write revitalize struggling towns in inner city communities\nI'm now ... somebody all might be saying he's inherited the momentum of the Obama years we'd be going this well um even if he hadn't changed much policy I think you're wrong\nBut there's enough truth to it I might as well tip my cap to it every president gets more credit more blame than they deserve a on the economy and in this this is really quite amazing and I apologize for reading a list to you but after a while the bulk of the list is the point\nHe promised to cancel the clean Power Plan to withdraw from the

I'm Sorry exploration he fulfilled\nAll those Bush's da da da da di di di ... cent George that's Trump right okay he promised to withdraw from the Trans Pacific partnership which I think it was a mistake\nBut he promised it and they did it and impose tariffs on steel and aluminum\nWhich I think is a little silly he committed arena renegotiating NAFTA on the trail and he's done it that was good\nAnd the U.S Korea free trade agreement recently signed new deals with Mexico Canada South Korea committed to imposing tariffs on China to force it to open its marketing stoppage theft of intellectual property and his following through on that pledge whether you like it or not and I like it I think it's great our trade relationship with Chinese completely screwed up\nIt's all based on a decades old notion that China is a poor struggling emerging economy and there are still some truth to that but um and they're also an economic colossus and they don't need crutches anymore\n'cause they they keep whacking us in the head with their crutches China\nIt's right Mr President\nHe pushed historic increases in defense spending and delivered pledge to bring back manufacturing jobs and manufacturing jobs are growing at the fast paced more than two decades\nHe pledged to sign the right to try legislation that we've gotten behind to give dying Americans access to experimental treatments he did it\nHe pledged to take on the opioid that could happen to the epidemic and will soon signed a sweeping bipartisan opioids packaging the law I Believe that package will do very little good I Hope I'm wrong because it's a scourge it's a it's a nightmare it's a disaster but he said he do it\nAnd he has done it\n... promises not kept yet like building the wall or repealing Obamacare hasn't been for lack of trying\nDone it promises not kept yet like building the wall or repealing Obamacare hasn't been for lack of trying\nIn a few rare instances he has backtracked on a campaign pledge like complete withdrawal of U.S forces from Afghanistan he's reversed course which I think he kind of had to um\nPut crazily enough for a guy who says all sorts of wild crap that's not true and and behaves like in New York\nReal estate promoter when he's the president which bothers the hell out of me I was just he he makes me crazy but if he says he'll do something he's probably going to do it\nWhich I think is remarkable a remarkable record of presidential promise keeping [noise]\nFor better or worse depending on who you are and how you view the world [noise]\nCheese that she's been to the gym he's coming in the room where he comes to the ...
