that tire so interesting stuff for sure uh All right let's grab a Tony real quick and springs out the good morning Tony\nHi how are you this morning I'm doing awesome so how about yourself\nOh good yeah I have a two thousand Toyota Corolla with on a level of uh finally change the your William place one was filed with no engine light on running for it was filed for Eighteen years\nTo be concerned about that or truck driver and take that plug she still filed\nWhen you say filed um there was no miss fire so low it it what it why why are you saying that the play was filed by the book I was\nThree that I took a were clean as well so that one was residue on a\nFlight dark residue or yeah like gas or oil or something could be burn\nIt a little bit of oil over a hundred thousand miles um but obviously not enough to actually when you say it's not if it was filed there'll be there'll be a myth fire oh yeah yeah so I mean it can be your basically what you're saying the plug is contaminated a little bit yeah and in that but uh I\nI mean as far as you know you can re check it it never hurts but uh you probably won't find anything in a couple of thousand miles I Would just presume over a hundred thousand miles that that that someone who may have burned a little oil and the other ones aren't but uh his ... does the miss fire counters are very sensitive on those so\nIf you were getting any kind of miss sorry it would definitely pick it up for sure\nOkay so I just checked it may be another five thousand dollars\nYeah that would be a bad idea I'd like to hear what it looks like but uh sounds to me like she's running like a champ\nYeah okay thank you very much no problem Tony hey how great we can be safe out there thanks for calling [noise] great\nGreat great questions when you look at it plugs and usually we see quite a bit of where it a hundred thousand miles on the radio and plugs\nBut that's what they're made for his hundred thousand Ninety to a hundred and recommend to replace them\nBut if you are and and sometimes we'll get it depends on the fuel you run to as far as what uh\nUh you know the plugs look like you know if you're running a really good quality or not you can get built fuel buildup on them you can get all kinds of things\nAre we seeing but all this ways we don't want to see a small choked up black with carbon all over him or or oil burns heavy you know but usually by that point then you have a missed fires you got like that's going on with the vehicle so\nUsually shows up one way or another anyway let's grab branded vista good\nMorning Ryan good morning ... how are you today\nFine and I I told you the last time I let him go make this a weekly happen but it looks like it's going on I guess a Dan didn't take into my scolding about leaving you in the lurch\n[laughter] kind of have to come back\nLater on when he's back on the show and tell him he can't do that\nI I think it will be back next week I'm pretty sure oh good then I'll be calling you do if not he fired back you up on that why I called\nThe problem that I had a ... pack my dad gets when we had the big win that were blowing back and forth and they were saying and I was on the highway going down to come home and all the time the card just lurched into the next plane with\nWith what I thought was the winner and that was catching\nMhm I I was very careful I got there and and that then two days later I noticed that it was hitting these little uh where are the road march the land and so forth and when I crossed over a hit hit really hard and I thought of something that's wrong so\nWhen I got home I checked the tire pressure because unlike the previous caller mind tell me what the inflation rate for each tired correct and I look at it and they had forty six forty three forty four on to the fact tired which I'm supposed to have thirty six at the most\nAnd so I thought oh my gosh and I thought well you guys had done a forty point checking everything to make sure that that make us that was kept up to the hundred thousand which by the way I crossed a hundred thousand miles so don't have to deal with the dealership anymore\nUm and so I called him up and ... said bring it in or bring it to the alcohol door\nThat looked going in that direction but I thought when I got up in the morning I thought I'd better bring it into you guys 'cause I go by the Fifteen anyway\nOr is it going in that direction but I thought when I got up in the morning I thought I'd better bring it into you guys that go by the Fifteen anyway then took the car and he had them check the pressure and the patient came out fine and can we say check it again and they did and then they got a different\nUh I guess the gauges digital or whatever or electronic whenever\nAnd where it was coming up completely wrong so I had a defective\nDigital reader\nSo the combination of being tired really inflated ended a windswept sweat with car saying oh you can go and so I was so grateful because and then ten after ... when he told me about it he says\nIt's very unusual for a lot of people who drive cars to pay it took ... they're not in tune with their cars but I Am so it was a it was uh when when they get that way you got that a reader um machine whatever\nA out at that picture because you know being that highly inflated I guess that wasn't a good thing either so\nI'm really tickled with Canada got it down and within Fifteen minutes I look back on the road and and on on my way to where I was going at a coffee shop so I think you guys for being so uh so fast and finding out exactly what happened\nWell I'm well thank you for a given a selfish unity day to get it all squared away there and and now Tim did tell me that he said that and does that tire pressure or things that we use actually uh came out in in our or a a certified for\n... the tires because we started using them when when we came into this new law that we had to check on tier pressure and all that and it's supposed to be within so many PSI him\nAnyway but they still do go bad things do go bad how's that yeah that one tech that had the ones that we got rid of that and got another new one and a um they're all they're all working properly now but you can end up with that issue so I and I couldn't understand\nHow how my tires inflated on their own on themselves either because I and I knew that they hadn't worked on the tires I mean I had put on your tires and you got to be in line and then um there was a rod that goes in the front before you can be able to pull whatever that\nUh that Robert de escalate place it but I haven't been replaced a whole lot but I found that when inflate any tire\nNo definitely not [laughter] so I'm Glad\nThat I I could bring it in in ... great ... of the guy ferret you're asking veto a it is still in fact it's really great so I really appreciate it and then I'll call in next week if they can come in and I'll let him have a peace of mind\nI got it for him thanks so much in that he had to get you to take care now Bye bye Bye bye\nSo a great a great comments by friend there for sure and and uh that that's a good point though um although we strive to a um [noise] make sure that everything is done properly and and handled in and we get the uh um\nThings just right now you can have a piece of equipment fail you can have all kinds of things happen for sure uh which obviously create issues uh and uh like this and then they have to be corrected so um but uh my guys are really good about jumping right in there figuring out what's going on to make sure everybody is\nTaking care of properly and that's what it's all about so today\nI was actually going to uh you can give us a call here one eight hundred seven six okay if it'd be twenty eight hundred seven six zero five three six to I'm going to grab Bobby real quick here you they're Bobby\nBobby their\nWay out on the morning you're out on a day or so then what are you doing\nA lie which man I'm sport in a couple of broken ribs and let go much for awhile sell it\nSelling it ends and hold ... on a\nLimb orange it holds its just fortunately there's just suggest stupidity or we'll leave it at that okay and\nThis morning the reason I was calling us so we can touch on something that is what the cars that were using today at all the electronics sensors that they have on them and stuff like that I recently had a friend who had a problem with with um it's popping the budget codes and um it had to deal with battery represents\nOh yeah ... uh five votes rest\nRead [noise] and um I just thought it might be not a bad idea to explain to people how important it is that you have a quality interstate badly in your car and it should a gig condition or you will have problems across the board game may seem like a stretch or something when in reality it's a battery\nQuickly in last year started replacing phone shows that are not needed yeah when in fact it is it that way\nUm it's even meet the battery for anything automotive related a hop on to the west automotive ... dot com and make yourself an appointment to get on and we'll get to take care of or otherwise if you need any other battery related items you can always check out the interstate store front it Ninety three forty five Cabot driving Miramar\nOver in la Mesa a Seventy if the university\nOf either one of those stores are there to help you out for sure without question\nAnyway a folk so we're to give us a call here one eight hundred and Seventy six okay if it'd be one eight hundred seven six zero five three six to ... helped me through the show when Mr Dan is not around for sure let's go to Dave and this can beat a real quick money they've\nThe morning Dave\nOh is this Steve are you there sir hello\nThey not only I was calling regarding you might argue about\nOkay do you have your radio on behind you there Dave\nCalling my two thousand two Thirteen or ... what to do in the back on as\nBy Dave I'm losing you you're coming and going so either you have a bad cell signal or if you have your radio on turn it off behind you\n[noise]\nOkay let's go to Greg real quick Greg here so I ... I lost Dave I don't know what happened to him but uh um what what do you have going on grades\nI have a Nineteen Ninety nine jaguar or exchange eight and a lot of mileage on it it's been pretty reliable but ah lately I've been getting a ... a century a signal on my dashboard they've said that it's a ADS system is suspect\nTraction control okay failure stability control failure okay forget I was wondering if\nUm if that's something I Need to you know take care of right away or is it a maybe a battery problem or for what\nUm so it's well I mean anything's possible you heard is talking about a ... a boy he's your shoes yes could cause an issue like that um but I wouldn't necessarily say that per se what it is but I'm\nThe mayor says some traction control stability control all that works together it's all the same system [laughter] and uh you may have if you get all this like you may have a SPEED Center that's failed on one of the wheels if\nSo it'll put that's his middle in Pomona goes in limbo so when you ask is it something imperative to deal with right now I'm the regular breaks at work just fine\nBut those systems do go into limp hoping they don't actually work whenever there's a fault picked up so I'm ... trucks control that kind of stuff will not be working as long as the lights are on on the dash\nOkay um so that's just something to keep and good mind is the car drive ... can you drive it over time it looked at her ... absolutely typically without question so um\nI Would get in get addressed I mean you don't you don't want it to a uh stay stay that way for too long and and there could be a\nA um an issue there you want to get taken care of because if the abs his work and that means all the when it goes into limp homeless Illinois aren't activating things like that and you leave a system stagnant long enough you can end up with other issues of Norway [noise] okay All right I Hope that answers your question and if you need somebody to help you with that to\nA more than capable of their own location to do so\nThank you very much Thanks Greg have a wonderful weekend thanks for Conan thanks for being with us or take care\nBye bye [laughter]\nGreat question let's grab us Stephen ... are you there Steve\nYeah good morning\nHow awesome I can hear you know my friend [laughter] what's ... what's going on science out other teen are accurate what\n[laughter] well I think we gotta wires dropped actually I've got to know them caught about\nOkay different guy okay sorry yeah go ahead I uh\nI recently did a break up [laughter] I don't know you heard about it but he was sick of herb and swap for the old seven up caliber is on the front brake correct the little bit bigger caliber\nGets it gets a brake pads it also laugh eighty thousand miles so bad they rated the system you're right yes\nSo I did that and our improve but after so I put a slot at age ... okay\nI'm not ... bought it on purpose or something like that but I Am a whack at it and it was real or first week or so and I came back a wife and Dr ... and it got really really\nFat vibration of the federal one breaking art almost like a slight or in it but it's it's I mean it's so bad it's almost some kind of other feedback feeling I'm Wondering if you experienced anything like that have any advice on how to look into it I did all the work out\nUm let me ask you a question so in in this is ... probably at higher speeds like editing the freeway on an off ramp or something\nLike that yeah OK yet but yeah I got you got one of the ... does have a high spot in it that there's a CEO and unfortunately what those rotors\nYou can't cut him yeah no kidding yeah there's no you can't have your right to bear on a that's why because of the flow and um so they're not made to uh be cut yeah unfortunately\nHere I thought I was a it myself and I said I just had a shot it though but\nI Will not necessarily um how old are the rotors\nFollow I mean like ... ... a month\nI didn't ... they shouldn't have war so I I might pick up the phone in in a make a call to whoever you got 'em from or where we got him from and you don't have to tell me but um I Would probably just call and say hey look I have this problem you know I did all this upgrade seven and they'll probably replace employee under warranty beyond these\nRotifers can warp and if one of them was in shipping dropped and it was fine and then you know you heat it up and I mean there's all kinds of things that can happen with them for sure\nSo that's on a war and you think that\nI find that an error type of deal that God I mean that brand new threat that you are now then you ... you don't have in Ohio as\nWell but you know I mean what do you have a couple of thousand miles on a maybe\nNot eat it\nYou could put same paths back on or something like that you know you get you get further down the road we get ... that's what we worry about but I guarantee at the surface of that road are pretty much a is probably smoothly just ended up with a ... high spot so there's not there's not much record groups that's what we worry about without pads\nThat road are pretty much a is probably smoothly just ended up with a ... high spot so there's not there's not much record group that's what we worry about without pads they wear into those and then you try to put them on\nTo a a a another road or something like that may have all this is an even ... than um whereas I don't think you're going to have that in in the short amount of mileage you have\nOkay well hey I appreciate the oh I'll get to work on it\nNo problem let me know how it turns out for you okay All right ...\nThanks deep by well good good question and why we're talking breaks in rotors let me tell you about a company that uh um and I've talked about before pure forge um\nYou want breaks the last two hundred thousand miles\nDeep and we're ... we we actually install them and we've been doing them on a lot of fleet and testing and it's some amazing stuff there's all kinds of large fleets now that are switching to the brake pads and brokers made by pure forge\nAnd they give up by your two hundred thousand mile a guarantee a bet their brake pads and rovers were last that long\n[noise] and ah the rovers do not work I run them on my truck I run name on each one of the key is that we own a further west automotive group because those cars do a hundred thousand miles in three years uh we we put that we get 'em brand as soon as the what I've done is the first time that car needs breaks pure for John\nAnd I'm done with it so if you want to know about these breaks give us a call we're happy to talk to you about um uh there there are a different paths um\nYou know the only other thing I Would recommend to the gentleman there enough can do is uh if it's not that should be for will disconnect if it does not make sure that you are ah ah the rivers are clean and adjusted properly to not be over work in the front breaks that's ... that's the only other thing I Would add to that uh let's grab a layer III a tour and pay Larry how's it going\nI'm good thank you for taking my call I just want to say I love your show well\nThanks for listening to appreciate it\nI've called before and you have helped me do some things but I have a question about my own accord with a C. V. T. transmission sure\nI was kind of following your guidelines to have the the fluid changed every twenty thousand miles I took it into the dealer they changed it and I immediately after I got it back it just seemed like the transmission was shifting as as smoothly as it did before for some reason when I go up a hill it seemed like it guided appeal\nAnd I found out that it seems like the motor was working harder okay [noise]\nLong story short I decided after talking to you to try to do it myself mhm twenty thousand miles gone by again so when I trained it out only three courts came out\nAnd it's supposed to take for almost four court well I went through the procedure and [noise] a little ... basically what happened is I edited or court so and then now that I'm driving it again it feels like it did before\n[laughter] so ... after twenty thousand miles with one court low do you think I damaged the transmission [noise]\nWest tata motors group at San Diego's highest quality independent automotive and transition service and repair facility\nOur facility maintain the industry highest service Sanders enjoy use of our free shuttle service to and from work or low cost rental vehicle while you're vehicles being service or repaired by our professional AFC certified technician\nWest automotive group service repairs your vehicle to manufacture specifications you can enjoy peace of mind knowing that we also back every repair with some of the longest nationwide warranties\nTake advantage of our no charge sort of care transmission diagnosis\nAt one of our three San Diego facilities\nLocated in African ... el ... or ... or your ultimate automotive service experience book an appointment now at West automotive group dot com experience the true meaning of satisfaction guarantee\nWeiner Seventy five years as am Devon than be San Diego's talk radio\nNews\nUsing the news on the hour sponsored by their works relief\nAnd Lenny Gillette a Taliban and ISIS had both threatened violence during today's election in Afghanistan violence came in the form of a suicide bomber who blew himself up in front of a polling station in northern ...

F. M. B. that's one eight hundred\nSeven six zero five three six to chase we've got uh some of the things have been coming out the next weeks of big week for earnings are what we've seen so far and things that they've been actually pretty darn good\nAt it they have been a looking pretty strong in the in the financial came out they looked fantastic um you know that ... interest margin has been expanding um the loans are still maintaining themselves and that's probably one of the concerns about banks that you rise interest rates to quickly while I was kind of a catch twenty two because the banks are making more money on an interest spread\nLess people are barring because interest rates are going up\nSo that's kind of that fine line between you want and frustrating to be high for banks but not too high right so we're kind of ... I still think in a in a very clean area for those banks where they can still make money and grow for the next few years because I think a loan demand will still be strong throughout a strong economy so you know financial reporter quite well\nAnd some other companies are done law airlines are another one that I have to be doing also part of this quarter yeah ... and\nA lot of companies doing very well and one thing we encourage people to look at is that they may miss the estimate by penny or to a pony you look at how the ... year over year I'm just kind of going to\nYou know some coming earnings coming out and just on Tuesday a light like Chubb mc Donald's of three and\nVarieties and caterpillar all these companies are well above what they are in last year and as your business goes that's what you want to have the you may miss the estimate for whatever reason by a penny or to uh the guidance is one thing we've talked about as well because they're not kind of ... you know what's gonna happen would be interest rates\nOr what's going to happen would be trade a talks that we ... we always mention here um so they might be a little bit conservative on their guidance\nBut still look at how that businesses doing and again always come back to what are you paying for those earnings\nI was gonna say agree that it's good to see earnings up you want to make sure not over paying for those earnings has Netflix you know they they were put in a great quarter right you know they had a I think the earnings are up you know I Want to say something like a hundred percent but the ... or in eighty nine cents for the court I mean I still not that much money\nAnd the thing we looked at with Netflix and uh it's pretty crazy I mean they had subscriber\nI mean I still not that much money\nAnd the thing we looked at with Netflix and uh it's pretty crazy I mean they had subscriber growth which is what that stock seems to trade on his just subscriber growth it doesn't matter what the earnings are doesn't matter what the sales are doesn't our cash flow as it's just how how this ... right and that's the sole thing that company's trading on\nBased off of what I see because I mean if you look at their cash flow I mean we we we took a look this the other day I mean it's just ridiculous\nThey're free cash vote for the last quarter\nNegative ... negative not positive native eight hundred and fifty nine million dollars it sound funny we put a chart out on our social I mean if you want to see that again I go to our Facebook page\nTheir cash flow is going down and their stock prices going up to their cash was getting more and more negative and their stock prices going higher and higher ... it just doesn't make any sense when just pulled up their castle for a year to date\nSo we get free ... cat from operations and capital expenditures that's about a negative one point five eight billion dollars that they burned so far this year in cash I sound like a very good business in my opinion\nYeah and what they have done because I talk about the earnings and what they have done is they've actually change the way they advertise for the earnings as opposed to a ... and the shows they do it really stretching over ten years so the earnings that they're expensive too much lower so therefore their earnings are higher but to really understand that you look at the cash when I just had the cast was negative\nAnd I'm just looking at their their debt to actually right now it's a hundred and sixty six\nVersus one twenty four for the industry so again we keep talking about the debt\nAnd they keep borrowing money to make more money ... and I also wanted to and I think we've looked at this before that is I talk about worldwide\nYou know getting more people overseas and so forth [noise] they're not getting the same price that they get here in the U.S I mean people in India are not paying twelve dollars a month for Netflix but they just they don't talk about that they just talk about all we got six million more subscribers you're not looking what you're getting folks subscribers\nAnd the concern I have as well as I don't understand and you know we don't know on Netflix we don't know the ins and outs of the ... the numbers don't look good so it's not worth our time is I don't understand how they convert the language barrier and the cultural burial\nBarrier because I mean shows here in the United states are different from shows and you know India I mean you're not going to have the same type of a lower to the same type of content so I don't know how they adjust for that if they have to pay more for content in other areas of the world to kind of fit into that that culture\nAnd if that's the case I mean that's again going to burn cash flow and the thing that I was concerned about with Netflix and their cash cash burn is it's not like a airline when their capital expenditure is a big plane you buy that plane that's a big burden for you know one year right\nContent you have to keep relevant all the time and since they don't get big box office hit they're going to have to continue to burn cash on content\nForever mhm so I think they'd have to have every person in the world subscribe to Netflix before their cash for positive I mean that's of course a hypothetical but it it's you know kind of a just a thought that I mean how many subscribers or they have to get to match that cash flow that they're burning on content it just doesn't add up and mathematically\nYeah and and again I talk about raising the prices and so forth [noise] I I I just don't think they're getting that and also we we've talked about sharing or do we do that post that we were we talked about it to where how many people are actually sharing the Amazon primes the Netflix's and so forth so that when they talk about all these people doing it\nWell a lot of them a kind of sharing with two or three other people so they're not getting as many subscribers\nSo I think the amount subscribers that they show is the amount of paid subscribers but I mean that limits the pool of how many more people are going to buy it yeah because they know my mom and dad have it or or my brother has it\nSo you just share it as a family or even friends are funny\nAnd the article it talks about even there's a one night stand that happened a guy came over and uh put his Netflix password and the the the woman kept it on their ever saw Shaq at his best work [laughter] so you know you never know where the uh the Netflix passwords are going to come from their shared out there like like crazy\nAnd he's got to be careful as high wires and stuff and uh\nUh that's what people get burns I get to a motion too excited about things and again I I think Netflix a lot of people like I mean you can see a lot of things that streaming how great that is\nWhat you gotta look at what you're paying for that business and also to the debt of the business which keeps rising and rising\nAnd eventually I talked about this many times before I called the house of cards we keep building building everything's okay but it gets weaker and weaker as they build it and eventually at the whole thing caves and and and and Netflix will be around for for many many years to come but the stock price is not justified for its paying\nAll that and I'm curious when the debt

think they'd be at risk of falling bankruptcy for about\nTen years so I mean they they could have you know this debt go on for many years but ten years down the road they could hit the big problem

first generation of super geeks kind of going on Mr Gates is getting older or jobs has already gone a power has done so these are the folks that founded\nThe mega tech companies are soft the apples yeah he uh it was sixty five new young well he had a non Hodgkin's lymphoma since the eighties yeah and I went into remission and then came back was really a drag and so he can't he cofounded it with Microsoft he let Microsoft\nUh through their big growth days ah and then he um was kind of you know really well known in Seattle because he uh\nOwns the NFL ... owns the Portland trail worry others and the hawks\nHe uh on them at one point yeah he's done a lot a lot of things and it just kind of sound like you said it's some of the early pioneers who he scored a perfect sixteen hundred on his SAT test to Bernie Mac then it goes to college he drops out to work for as a programmer for Honeywell\nThat's like a gate suit on or after out of Harvard for ah these college drop outs and never going to say never amount to anything except you know there really is yeah one of the world like so there'd be a very exactly it 'cause it's really not an end to find a lot about that in the tech sector\nOr when it comes to education and this is good for kids who have to make choices these days right takes too long to go through college and learn tech because tech changes faster than they can develop college courses for jihad typically tech\nIs old tech right if you're learning it in college\nUm and that's kind of a drag so it depends on what you want to do in the tech space yeah if you want to manage teams of people who do tech go to college and you get your management stuff go managed geeks yeah I was told if you are gay\nToo yeah and I want to talk more about this maybe after the the bottom half an hour because this is really important choices for what John Will there be in the future just things are changing let's go to Paul real quick inside Paul what's going on\nPaul I ... yeah right okay I'm I'm having a problem or trying to ... uh when I was ten defender and now we're vice as far as real\nScanning mhm ... which is the best ... awesome using defense or you know for for a while and and now\nHot ... ... which one would you recommend a road ...\nArgues windows to send her on my windows box malware bikes is really good\nFor very specific types of sort of browser hijacked type things\nOr payloads that come along with a program that you might like like sometimes you get a program and it comes with weather bug and you're like oh what is this weather bug from our bikes is great for getting that stuff out but I Would think of our rights as an active cleaner and with us defender as your first line of defense you run into this\nOne is running all the time and the other day said up\nOn the active clear I mean it just is that they're very very scanning sure\nYes let let windows defender do its thing and if you notice something weird or a problem then run malware bikes are so mean to you but she's so\nYour act to scan or whether it be defender or each set a vast or you know there's a number of them right uh and they're all pretty good and not wear my shoes and said the two most one you can just run or you want it or you can have it actively sit there it doesn't seem to be\nToo much overhead um and I have it and I run it all the time and I have a catch things you go to our website and oh tracking cookies that sort of sat there and rap stuff alert you and it's pretty good so you have both a anti virus anti malware andme our bikes\nTracking cookies that sort of rap stuff alert you and it's pretty good so you have both a anti virus anti malware andme our bikes is really good\nGuy okay what about uh you know a branch from our stuff like that like right now I have it set on for during the Iraq War with our by Shia\nThat's fine just always pay with someone else's credit card\nFor pay the ransom and what about registry pair and remarry jak file\nI don't do those I uh I generally don't to hear\nYou here's here's my philosophy the stuff that Microsoft makes to defend windows is for what you ought to use because it's integrated the best if that doesn't completely suit your needs then it another program like um our bikes is great to\nCatch all the stuff that the built in stuff doesn't get does that make sense\nThere's a lot of junk even even for Apple now that can\nInfect your phone there's the ones that ... somebody types a certain number would crash or apple phone or if somebody to certain number they could take over the phone and and of course an Android there's a bunch of stuff as well\nWell you have to be careful of malware in the Android app store\nApple is can have it but it's far more ... ... so there so it's less likely I I don't run any anti malware on my phone most people don't have an iPhone and it's very very controlled thing if I had an Android phone where I had the option of side loading unloading really anything I wanted to\nGo along with that freedom comes the danger that you can load things that are what they appear\nIt's rare but it can't happen yeah and so I'm looking at a list of what somebody deems the top ten ... total Avi um PC protect I haven't heard of either one of those Norton we've all heard of Norton scanned guard\n... McAfee okay bull guard a bee gene we've all heard of it yeah you are because you can get free versions of that a bit defender malware bites and a vast\nOkay my time with some extra sketching although it's a little slow on the Internet I don't have to use ...\nSo I was ... the TV turn on this morning and they were talking about the etch a sketch and they did a little quiz who invented the etch a sketch they had a choice it was like an electrician a scientist day whatever Elvis to for things and lo and behold it was an electrician what who invented the ... and they showed the early drawings of it and the\nApple Capito shake to race I Love it\nSo when it comes to mobile security is not a big deal most people don't run anything I've played with them because I wanted to know about them to see if they were a lot of overhead and did it and make my phone's you'll slow or the answer that was it didn't but bottom phones don't have a ton of room on them so you do have to kinda watch out for how much memory or taking\nOne hundred twenty gig on this thing and all I don't run out of room\nAnd so [noise] you know it is a major brands malware bites a vast Avi gee Norton\nSo smarter on is a laptop let's just call it a palm top right that's what they aren't phone is so\nWhen you buy one get as much memory on it as you can feel it was worth the extra hundred dollars when you buy it not to have to shovel stuff often back all the time right it's like buying a car that's too small for your family you're constantly like taken a backseat south to put stuff in and put the seat back\nDon't mess with that just by something with enough memory on it that you don't have to keep messing with that well yeah because\nIf you run out of room\n[laughter] well so on and on apple stuff it'll start cloud updating which is great and so you get the bill for your you know your wireless usage or or you want to show someone one of those pictures that's already been caught updated in your somewhere where you're not connected to the clock right and speaking of the clouds\nSo some people ask about cloud storage yeah because there's a ton of choices out oh yeah and in thinking about\nCloud storage especially some events that happened over the past couple of months to a report in like a photo bucket uh them trying to hold everybody's pictures on average so you know photo bucket was a pretty good place to dump photos on for free you get a free account\nAnd you put a ton of photos up there and if you wanted to share photos like you went to some festival or something and you wanted to share them and I want to say Hey Matt check out all these picture I could dump 'em up on photo\nShare photos like you went to some festival or something and you wanted to share them and I want to say Hey Matt check out all these picture I could dump 'em up on photo bucket give him a link to the bucket it very well if you look at all the pictures so they decided to tell everybody who um\nHad a free accounted they're going to hold all your pictures hostage if you didn't either convert to a paid version or get 'em all off their well they may just hard to get all the photos offshore\nAnd so then they were going to charge the report is really rotten so you got to be careful who you are doing business with when it comes to cloud storage now Amazon if you have prime basically unlimited stores for photos\nSo my theory on that stuff is the bigger players the Amazon Microsoft or Google isn't apples will not screw you like some of the smaller players will cause they don't have to they have other revenue strains there just using the play of clouds free cloud storage is the way to get you to buy more of their stuff right that's not their whole business model so if you want\nTo avoid ... issues in the future stick with the big the big companies\nBecause they're far less likely to mess around like that\nRight and they don't need to hang on to keep you as a customer for other purposes and some of these are so concerned about their reputation like Amazon yeah concerned about their reputation and so if you have Amazon and you have primed to get the free shipping and free movies and stuff like that\nTake advantage of the free unlimited stories for your photos or I'm moving everything off of\nA photo bucket and a few other yeah I have over to Amazon because they're not going away their world class maybe one of the biggest data centers ever totally redone it backed up you don't have to worry about it you\nKnow the thing I don't like is whenever I upload my pictures to the cloud makes me look really old and ugly like I look so much better than that in real life but whenever I cloud upload photos and I just looked really old and recently I don't well Mac it's because what is uploading under the cloud how does that\nHappen in real life that you don't have the smoothing [laughter]\n... filter saw so many pictures you see crack me up and legal during the looting and your face and it's like not mark on your legs I hear\nSome work done or it's not real you know it's easy it's really it's just me we used to have to know how to do voters shop to do that now any phone has a little app\nWill ask that you can make your guinea or make your eyes bigger take out the red eyes smooth the steering committee so crazy it's really funny and there's a lot of 'em and I'm not picking on the latest yeah there's a lot of cell the queens out there did you see how many have you gotten like injures trying to take selfish yes\nSorry funding goes let's shift gears a back to the phone yeah that because some people would call okay uh go to Scott me up to San Diego Scott what's up\nBefore I get to my question Matt just mentioned something about you know the phones in the memory yeah and now with the microwave ... you can get in there and I noticed something weird\nThe latest versions of Android allow a thing it's the way it used to be that when you put a micro Estee card and it could only be data it could be your songs your movies everything like that you couldn't put applications on it\nBut in the new Android versions duo allowed out they basically when you put it in it becomes part of the memory that's in your phone and just basically is shameless\nTo them by load applications onto your memory onto your memory card correct\nBut um I ... you know ... wasn't taking advantage of it at least on some of the tablets that they had a you know and I I I was thinking what happens\nIf you take that ship out can you really totally screw your system up because if it was used a shared memory now you've got pieces in March on both of those on the internal chip no on your ship\nIt segregate and keeps a record of what's where what you can't do if you take that out is run the apps that are loaded on it won't work\nYou have if they they kind of protect you from doing yourself in yeah in that regard\nRemember the old days where you could accidently store stuff in the windows folders and then that would just jak your whole computer so they've gotten smarter they've learned from years of people breaking their desktops on how to how to design a robot numbering system and ... was actually developed\nShortly after the ... you know as the iPhone was being developed because one of the one of the leaders of Google was on the board of apple when they were developing their iPhone so they all kind of came from the same place that was a mobile a west similar to what you'd see on a laptop that was the one\nUh twenty eight get get ships I mean it'd be hard around a memory I'm I'm just I'm struggling with sixteen uh gigs on\nMars depends on how nurses cystic you are I mean you know you turn it on memory in a week if you're taking selfies\n[laughter] the the question I really I was in the last three weeks I'm running a system seven on an old pentium dual and that for about three weeks I've been having a problem where once you're a little gray window appears in the middle of my strength says server is busy yeah\nAnd I look at that on Google I Googled it but there was something on windows tan and there was some and it didn't seem like an Atta a straight answer this\nLitter the most likely culprit\nOf the server is a process in windows is what is referring to it is or where the hell no it's just something so you're running window seven with a with a processor that's pretty old like an window seven was designed expecting certain architecture to run at certain speeds\nAnd so while I'm impressed that you got it to load and run some of the young that it would be normally be processing very quickly it's waiting for\nWell sometimes too it's because the program\nLike they'll have something in saw like maybe an anti virus I tunes are ... a bigger or something and it's trying to access the Internet for like check for an update or some before the connection is right or wrong boot up before so\nI looked at him and some Microsoft forums I have a lot of people talking about this and that was their take on it\nOr that it's not just these damn some problem or not just to know what brand problem or or in your case you know older computer problem but some proper products to are more prone to it like to deaf gp or do we are a scanner for it if the system of their sisters trying to do something before it can so bright comes back and says
