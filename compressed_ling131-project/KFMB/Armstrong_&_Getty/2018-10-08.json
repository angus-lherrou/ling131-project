in a lot of people sent along stuff hey did you guys see this and and you all are great it is keeping an eye out for a really good stuff to one talking about and we really need to give you credit more but uh we got a note from somebody I Can't find it I'm\nAsking the question quoting Mark Twain if you uh don't read the newspaper you're uninformed if you do your misinform and they said they increasingly believed that which do you think is better\nUninformed or misinform yeah our our answer remains I think I Would have always been thinking a lot of cases you'd be better off a uninformed and just follow your gut and take in a variety of sources and you'll get somewhere close to inform you have to either\nBut work into it or stay out of it\nIn between you're better off you're absolutely better off on an forum yeah maybe unless you're going to check a variety of sources and do do a little work you're better off not looking at it at all and\nOn breaking news you're absolutely better off being uninformed breaking news on a big story now you're going to be had you're going to be taking down the wrong road\nFor instance did you hear that\nAmazon is raising their minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour of course I didn't of course you've been huge story the media love it they reported it like crazy\nWell it turns out in a blog post explaining the changes\nThe delivery giant revealed this would come at the expense of various bonus schemes I'm\nAt the moment workers are given a single Amazon share worth almost two thousand dollars on the joined additional share for every year they work they hold on to this years for two years they can catch them in tax free a scheme would be phased out in favor of a share saves scheme which will allow workers to buy shares at a discounted rate\nUm bay and Amazon either thinks\nThat's a better motivation or it's saving them money\nMeanwhile bonuses which allows staff turned back eight percent of their salary per month than sixteen percent and busy periods are on Christmas for hitting performance markets are also being trapped okay according to one British workers union this will wipe out half of the value of the pay increase for the average Amazon warehouse work\nWell then I Would say in this particular case you were much better off being uninformed than than hearing the original story\nPractically a done deal and did a [noise] Murkowski\nFrom Alaska said no she won't I don't think she said I could be wrong but she doesn't\nKnow for cloture Alaskan vote count the same as everybody shouldn't it really surely not\n[noise]\nUm so we're talking about virtual reality and we got somebody a who's had an experience it sounds really\nAwesome oh yeah oh hey before we get to that the movie I was talking about the world war two movies twelve o'clock high ... instant amazing movie just amazing uh in fact I just was listening to a video the trailer for the movie was Gregory Peck\nTalking he said after I saw the screening of it I asked Darryl ... studio if I could just talk to you about this movie huh he said I think it's the most honest movie about what actually happens in war that we've made and I don't think that's a real breakthrough it is\nI Know that is why we were talking about this the other day I don't know why we have this period of history where we wanted to\nPretend that things weren't bad I think trying to keep everybody's morale up even after after the war's over yeah yeah yeah\nIt is curious kind of a real sociological it's a study and sociological norms in what society the way society is approaches life that changed a lot\nIn this movie was a breakthrough in that and it's an amazing but anyway it affected me deeply um let's see oh anyway back to be our stories we've you're wildly from topic to topic and yes we will have clips of the week and just a couple of minutes\nWe got on this topic because there is a virtual reality game that to this guy said with the most immersive like a time machine thing you've done yet brought him to tears\nThat's right boss ... World War two right then and bombers a bill Hi welcome how are you sir\nJoe ... tell us about your view already Leo\nTwo weeks ago I take my seven year old she a local VR arcade to ah to to to get them in there and they have a virtual reality a simulation all look like the play is where you get into an elevator you stand out in front of this virtual or Sin City but it looks really up then\nYou get into an elevator you push the button you go to the top floor elevator opened all there is a wouldn't like that\nIt wouldn't think that your typical walkout do in front of the entire city\nI I yeah I'm Down to a hundred stories my hands are getting ... [laughter]\n... let me tell you it opened up I started to sweat I started to shake I had to back up and and I can hear the people's background laughing because they can see on the TV what you're looking at\nBut then I Would not do that yeah I I mean I understand the laughing the market but that's what your brain supposed to do with supposed to take in misinformation and tell you what's going on and that's what it's doing yeah and and ah yeah is it still isn't that it had to\nBe a really interesting ... a wrestling match between your rational brain and your animal brain\nIt's unexplainable so I took it off because I just didn't do so I took it off and then I said to myself wait a minute I'm standing on the ground I'm here in a building or I don't hear people not real so I did it again\nThe second time was even worse I couldn't do it I couldn't even take a step forward the second time so bad but but they have the option to really to make it like a forty if if you really want the full experience they will take eight to bite wells\nAre in sticking in front of you so that you can actually feel like you're stepping on the plane that you're virtually\nStepping doing actually feel my [laughter] and not just come close to it real poop not hurt you write\nA play by my heart rate on my iPhone what off the chart Gandhi and believe do\nThey how assigning to disclaimer because a person could have a heart attack or something\nI I thought I did and yes they do know how\nI'll be damned bill that's a really good yeah I'm In a good to talk to you thanks\nRight All right hey no no no I won't you can't make me that's our first caller twenty teens was pretty good hey let's let's make her laugh [laughter] we might want to hear that I Know I tell you what we take a call like that and I think we ought to take calls yeah that's the trap\nAnd more [laughter]\nNo need to finish the sentence Tom wow that's really interesting so I don't need to feel terror I Know a big nose hair all the time I have no interest at\nThis point in my life having virtual ... no I'm ... ... kids obviously do your built different when you're a kid especially boys is that gonna uh well that rewire your brain to where you're starting\nTo do Crazy Stupid things because your brain starts to think okay this is unreal no man about having a ... lack of reality to youth period oh sure you don't understand death in once which is why soldiers are young men um a lot harder to get forty year old has to do this\nYou know I'm thinking about that WWE to bomber simulation deal yo there'll be plenty of terror in that too\nAlthough it's not quite the same immediate you can easily make\nAn argument why there's value and understanding\nThat tell you oh I'm not too I'm just thinking about\nYour reaction or what my reaction would be because there were also be the if we're hit and it's significant enough damage and the pilot can't land the plane I Will puncture my dad as opposed to I'm about to a bunch of my death in the you know the previous example built example\nAnd I I've spent a lot of time in in VR and I still have those\nLike ... is an example so there's games where I'm kind of like swinging around from tree to tree like I like big Spider Man right and if my character gets off balance or if I land ... even though my feet physically have never left the ground I still put my arms out the kind of study my some we're it's it's very surreal so I wouldn't\nUh I don't go out and buy the latest coolest TV I don't mean for K. as opposed to U.

career I don't think they don't believe or from the standpoint that Kavanaugh was clearly the guy so yeah yeah yeah\nSo one thing I Want to talk about just briefly ... and this is a case study and how political activism works and you see some similar things on the right wing about they're coming to take our guns for instance um [noise]\nUh uh it it it works both ways this happens to be an example of targeting left these because it was in Susan Collins speech but she's talking about Brett Kavanaugh and abortion rights and if you swing a pro choice\nPro abortion rights of the term I uh prefer um you should be interested in this because all of the talk in the left wing circles and all of the media is that this cataclysmic for abortion rights and Susan Collins in her speech that virtually nobody heard who's not a news junkie\nGoes on at length about her hours long discussions with Brett Kavanaugh abrupt about Griswold versus Connecticut case it struck down laws banning the use of cell contraceptives\nA which is ... legal foundation that led roe versus Wade eight years later and was later supported than by Planned Parenthood versus Casey and all of that was based on a couple of famous cases from the twenties and they talked for hours about this stuff\nAnd Kavanaugh expressed great respect\nFor all of those cases and is more into the idea of uh what is it ... faces or whatever the idea that precedent matters snoring decides to say exactly that's it which was my a safe thing when I was a a male dancer huh\nI'm us we it's funny I should forget it but you know I drank in those days you're making a lot of money oh my God my tips were well that could do things most men can't do anyway so uh\nThey talked about this for hours and hours and by the specifics of what the guy believes she is free conservative very very respectful of roe versus Wade now folks\nYou did not hear this you're being ill served by your media and she goes into the Republican platform for all presidential campaigns has included nominating judges who would overturn roe Republicans campaign on that I\nWill nominate judges that will overturn roe versus Wade that's a crock crap by the way Republicans year being played by your candidates because they know it's not going to happen listen to this\nDuring that time since Nineteen eighty that has always been part of the platform Republican presidents have pointed justices O'Connor suitor and Kennedy to the Supreme Court\nThose three justices Republican appointed justices author decay seat decision which reaffirmed row those three Republicans wrote the decision\nFurther more pro choice groups vigorously opposed each of these justices nominations they even circulated buttons with the slogan stopped shooter or women will die\nTwo months later sooner coauthored the Casey opinion reaffirming a woman's right to an abortion\nI don't know how everybody hasn't picked up on this or maybe they don't want to I I figured out the whole roe versus Wade is a a\nRed herring that the right term or whatever it is yeah of false flag or whatever you want to I figured that have decades ago yeah no I don't\nKnow it ain't going nowhere even if it did the states would take back over ... it just it ain't going to it's a it's a it's a false narrative on both sides correct that that's what's at stake correct the Supreme Court so I always just ignore it when people start talking I\nMean it's a great which is to say mediocre because nothing gets people to the polls but it's a great motivator to get to the polls per hour period you're all being played Susan called the amount of\nFear and anger and grief right now 'cause I was going to overturn roe within a week it's fake\nUh she also said on I'm On the ... on the face the nation interview yesterday because John Dickerson brought up the idea of how we do we believe he can be fair to Democrats with the the the tirade that he went on right and a\nFirst of all she has a mistake in my mind he went too far but go I'm Sorry yeah yeah um\nYeah according to this New York times article that I Want to during the the the break after he said to the one senator lady I don't know do you ever blackout came out which area that was not good that was dumb during the ah the halftime Trump's lawyer McGahn pulled them aside and said yeah you got to dial back just a little bit just a little little picket took her down a notch [laughter]\nShe's like the nicest Democrat [laughter] and I probably ought to apologize\nAnd that's when he came back and apologize and everything anyway what was I saying oh a\n... you got to be careful when every the longer you live the more you learn is sometimes when you got ahead full of steam you've got to say to yourself I Need to be careful I have a handful of states right\nExactly yeah I'm so Dickerson brought up the idea can he be fair to Democrats and Susan Collins said there are five hundred interviews he's been a judge for a very very long time at the federal level and there were five hundred interviews\nThat I read of people saying he has been fair and all these different cases there was not an example anywhere of him being unfair right written by people on the right and the left in terms of looking at cases so he's got a history of of this he's not all of a sudden going to become a ... job\n... job you could say he's newly embittered by this process his own life changing experience I don't think he is I don't think he should get to decide Cory bookers fight for instance I Can't walk and waiting for that moment if an individual person came before him I Would agree with that but just in general\nUm well I I Would say if it happened in the next two weeks how many years down the line I have no doubt a rule fairly I haven't watched all the videos I've seen some of my how 'bout\nThat UFC fight that happened over the weekend McGregor got beat up by so what's the due to name a Habib is the is his first name he's been rush on Jeopardy ... occurs expanding an or someone defeated the mostly a wrestler beat the hell out of everybody including ... and then I find it all just went a pass and nobody's actually sure who started it all yeah people are\nGoing into the crowd of people were trying to get a ring of fire McGregor that seems to those\nQuote unquote people from the crowd were training partners of the other fighter Dodgers weren't millions yeah yeah they were they were teammates of it be the the Victor of the fight kind of started by jumping over the cave do cage going at Conor McGregor is jujitsu coach a and that kind of started the dominos falling\nFrom there so the the Russian dude or whatever is man he got over the fence ... got into the crowd you know fancy\nWent over that same now all of that video it was unbelievable slammed leak out show you how Angela guy like that is\nTough talk more about that later what's coming up in your news march of ... got set of leaders on what's next now cabinet nominations been secured and China's grabbed the presidents of inter fold the European crime fighting organization ups getting into those were for you to get\nThe Saudis snatching up

were conservatives who are anti Trump in twenty sixteen conservatives like the folks at the national review the daily standard and other conservative\nOutlets of news in fact they made fun of Trump people by saying well yeah there may be a lot of things you don't like about Donald Trump but quote he fights\nIs going to the strain at the ballot box [laughter] so I'm gonna I'm never campaigned against her colleague [noise]\nThat's about to change while that's something from the genial man from South Carolina I'm [noise]\n... you know it's probably worth pointing out that the technique of slandering\nSomebody and slandering them until they crack is time honored you try to make them crack and loses their temper and then you say look if the guy's temperament\nAnd they almost got cabin off on that basis it was a it was a pretty good try to come back to the cynicism and the the false accusations and the rest of it and and this I'm I'm asking mostly my my left the French [noise] everybody agrees the ... thing was a was a joke\nAnd a lot of anti Kevin all people think it was on productive citizen that pretty much the conventional wisdom is this whole yeah\nDemocrats and Republicans think that that that really really ... cabinet and may have turned the tide according to the New York times\nWrites the YPG a W I a gal ms Sanchez is that correct Romero Romero sorry I Do remember she's Hispanic but that's off the currently summer's the infamous ... apparently you remember the peanuts also 'cause he was mentally I Can't forget\nThat has not gotten any [noise]\nGr operation at all and she has not been found to be terribly credible herself has just she will you know well we've we've ... litigated this to death so you're down to a doctor bossy forward really\nRight and as Susan Collins\nSaid they interviewed ... people that was in that report twelve interview she read them all nobody can say yeah this happens so what do you what do you do with that\nIn fact nobody even have had a with that it happened so what do we do at that point and if you are shouting at the radio believe the victim will then and I say this with affection and respect you lack the critical thinking skills to be in charge of stuff\nYou absolutely have to listen and you have to investigate [noise] but\nYou don't have to convict you mentioned\nAs Susan Collins the senator on sixty minutes last night going over once again her reasons for deciding to back Kavanaugh Scott Kelly asking Collins Dr Ford famously said she was one hundred\nA hundred percent sure that it was judge Kavanaugh who assaulted her or you one hundred percent sure of this vote\nI feel very comfortable that I made the right to that so I could not come\nTo an neither the fish and based on the testimony and the evidence that I read it\nIf you vote against cabin on because you don't think he has the right temperament because of the way he acted that's a perfectly reasonable I mean it's got you've got a reason behind it so people voted against him because they think he's a sexual predator based on the information your scary to me right you are scary so little there\nOne last quick

gymnastics to make it sound just the way they phrased it makes it sound one way and some conservative outlets are doing the same thing on the other side\nBut it seems it's absolutely clear that that two percent figure that only two percent of accusations of sexual assault turned out to be fake I mean that's just not true it's not even close to true on what the actual number is a very difficult difficult to ascertain but\nUm we'll hear that for the rest of our lives like the wage gap for women are saying just I've just gotten used to it all here for the rest of my life doesn't matter how
