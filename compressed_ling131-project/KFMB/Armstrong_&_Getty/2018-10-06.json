Jesus let's give to ingredient number two because there's so many just three super bill does something that no other visual upon it can do it actually lowers cholesterol\nTalking about these plants generals explain how this works and why it's so important [noise]\nRight well I don't know anyone who isn't concerned about their cholesterol if you have high cholesterol obviously you want to lower it if you have normal or healthy cholesterol obviously you want to maintain it sure well in the world of dietary supplements there is one compound one ingredient\nThat stand head and shoulders above anything else they're called plants they're all they have over a hundred and forty human clinical study shown to lower significantly lower LDL cholesterol and again LDL as the bad cholesterol\nHDL the

see anywhere from five to Fifteen Percent reduction in your LDL level\nSafely and naturally absolutely no side effects very effective they've known about plants they're all in the Nineteen fifties and they work to be a very different mechanism than Staten drugs so I wouldn't tell people to stop taking that and drugs we're not trying to position this as an alternative to Staten\nStaten work by preventing the production of cholesterol in the liver plants that rolls work differently\nThey block the absorption of cholesterol in the intestine plants their roles are similar structurally to the cholesterol molecules and they basically confuse little cells in your intestine called my feels into thinking that the plants their roles\nAre actually the cholesterol particles so that might feels\nPick up the plan sterile instead of\nThe cholesterol particles and the cholesterol particles in that sort of just get pass through your intestines then you ultimately excrete them instead of absorbing them the point is if you're on that and\nYou can take slants they're off as an addendum therapy to help control your cholesterol studies actually have been done to show that they can amplify the benefits\nAnd of course this particular product you get obviously first off the full clinically tested amount of the plants their roles to deliver the benefits as shown in the study

one three for nine zero zero to make reservations don't miss out a few\nWanna give us a call one eight hundred seven six zero cave and be AS number one eight hundred seven six zero fifty three sixty two we're going to go out to Oklahoma were dean is winning good morning Dina how are you\nI'm I'm I have a question about oh ... years ago I read an article that said that if we if we're in the southern climate here and buy a northern boats like kill it and\nThat we should put them in the freezer or in the refrigerator for a week or so to make them comfortable because they're from the north and then we can go outside and plant them and everything's fine so I tried that I put a package of both my faith or for about a week\nWhen I take 'em out a lot of stuff they all self cliched yeah which I didn't know that I put him in that and put them in pots I put them in there anyway so tell me with that some fake news outlets running around\nThe news will know you don't you don't put them in the freezer you\nPut 'em to resolve raider\nEither treasury or yeah yeah\nThe ... lived over there to see the longer the better but a minimum of ... four to six yeah usually\nWhere you calling in six weeks yeah you can leave them a little longer um but yeah you know the it's the refrigerator is the key point there is you you don't I don't want to freeze 'em you just want a chilling oh\nOkay well could be that those are just not going to make it\nAnd that was likely not to if they're squishy ... where you know like I said most likely not but that being said you you you got nothing to lose by putting them in in into a container and the ground and the ... and seeing what happens but um yeah they they they ... they prefer to go they prefer to go into the refrigerator and\nSome bulbs of some bulbs suppliers will\nThey will they will sell pre chilled balls where they put them in the refrigerator for you um but for but more often than not it's you're you're better off just sticking them and put them putting them in a paper bag down a plastic bag a so that it can breathe a little bit\nAnd then put them in the refrigerator for about four million ran\nContrary point of view on the ... that she already has yeah if they were frozen and their squishy there there she's ... or ... if you want to kind of want to see flowers come in and get some more Bolivia and refrigerate them none because we do that well yes well she or nothing yeah\nYeah well now with Michael ATMs and every year I have attacked I'm not because they're really kind of Florida uh foliage [noise] so I think that they have a bag and then I put them under the sink skinny [noise] and I\nThink I get the garage and the kitchen lasts are enough it gets into the bathroom or going to cause I had read that the garage at the chill in the garage but it's not good for them\nAnd I don't imagine that would be a problem but I I mean have you been successful let's just keep doing it\nYeah that's a that's what it was and that what was the name did you say that the twitters for whiskers illicit is that am what does that again\nOh why age for cats well white wine and wine and whiskers is a fundraising event that were holding up the power away store for how air for critters\nAnd how to care for it or is is the cat rescue that helped us out when we had the Bengals ... left at the store just about a year ago oh I see yeah ... if you want to check out how to care for critters it's spelled\nH O W E the number to see a A R e the number four C. R. I. T. T. E. R. S. and they're up there for you know their base up and it's going to do\nWhile I'm allergic to cats\nBut at least get the ... thing [laughter] you know the other they're wonderful they're wonderful people and they\nDo I think they've been I think they've been in operation for about well now it's about five years they been when we started working with them and they had placed about two hundred and fifty cats um\nOvertime game yeah they'd been wonderful yeah okay\nAre you allergic to them wind up because we can keep you away from the fastest one you can still come and enjoy the [laughter]\nThat's a good idea okay well I'll see you there\nOkay I have a good habit Dina thank you for the call okay to have that I knew my if you want to give\nUs a call one eight hundred seven six are okay if anybody is the number that's one eight hundred seven six zero fifty three sixty two\nAnd I also wanted the oil forgot to mention is part of um one one of the other beneficiaries of wine and whiskers is the ... culture is the ... the culture technician program at an apprenticeship program at um\n... college and they're involved in all aspects\nOf the\nTo wind process yet Rick yeah program I Believe so and and weren't you there for a kickoff earlier this year the ... when they open the vineyard that they plan it yeah and that's one and that's one of the things that you have to do to get your certificate\nYou have to do to get your certificate as you're going to have you actually have to work in the vineyard pruning and and maintaining the vineyard as as well so it's a pretty ... it's a pretty comprehensive program\nI was talking to the gentle and one of the owners of Dearborn valley winery yesterday and he was pretty excited about the culture program there as he wants to get involved with them and\nHe's going to be involved with the with our function so we'll see how it all plays out but it's great for the local winery switched their ... or ... years and for the students to\nYeah no no I ... I think it's a fantastic program the ethics and sets two minutes from my house I should probably go by and check it out one of these days you might want to do\nThat maybe you could expensive\nThat's all he needed [laughter] I'm there tomorrow but yet go with a with a number of wineries that are ... bottle absolutely are around San Diego county there there's going to be a there's going to be a need for their elders Trevor training people I'm In that industry\nAnd just just in the Ramona valley vineyard associate and when we were looking at is what is it twenty three ... twenty three wineries\nI think something like that and there's a there's ... there was all but there's a lot of people that there's a lot of people in the remote valley vineyard association\nOkay great All right well thank you so much\nOkay any of the other the other thing that I Would suggest is ... ... you're probably closer to our power away store\nI'm either either bring you to bring one of the orchids that you have or take a couple of pictures on your phone to bring it into the store let us take a look at it then we can identify what kind of work at it is\nAnd then we can give you specific instructions for those but the majority of the ... that are sold are are failing offices but there are there some idioms and an city ... and and they all should we will all of them should re bloom anything that any or any or good that you buy\nHere like I Can't think of any of that would\nThat you shouldn't bird you that you couldn't get to re bloom again\nAll cake Ray Takeyh helpful thank you so much anytime thanks for calling and it's actually like to All right take care of okay yeah\nThat would make Nineteen right what listeners oh what's her now and count at her before [laughter]\nIf you want to give us a call one eight hundred seven six zero care from ... and that's when a hundred and seven six zero fifty three sixty two we are in we mentioned it before but we are in the middle of fall vegetable season and the election right now is actually\nI was out wandering through the young vegetable section yesterday the selection right now is actually really good um and you can get just\nWell you can't get just about everything that you want but there's a lot of stuff that you can get an a B including winter winter tomatoes are still available as well\nThat just brought me to\nElse's restaurant [laughter] you know you\nGot to get into anything you want a U.S senator right except except analysis except announced a but just a few of the things that way or that I happened to catch when I was wondering through yesterday a piece of sugar snap peas man throughout\nThe day never make 'em in the house\nNo I I just sat us down a million dollars oh stand out there in the garden and and eat them right off the writer right off the vine they're they're absolutely wonderful and very easy to grow the only thing you need to do is you need to give them something to climb on yeah\nI'm I've grown up and tomato cages or but on trial is just anything anything they'll they'll they'll do online\nAnd here's a here's a same thing with the if you're growing sweet peas which you don't eat sweet peas 'cause there's nothing on this week David edible right whether it's the whether it's the seeds are the odds are the flowers are the plans you can't eat any of it it's not don't don't do that\nBut if you're going to grow if you're going to grow peas and you need\nSomething for him to climb up use a ... ... um goes at at the end of the season they just said ... role the whole thing up and get our ground and throw it away really that then you don't you don't have to worry about it um but ... these are available and winner tomatoes are available\nThere's tons of lettuce out there right now of the leaf crops a lettuce tail cabbage spinach spinach\nUm that's all available broccoli cauliflower um those are those are available\nAnd I don't know when they I don't know when they started making broccoli and different color or cauliflower and he had like ... but I Know that the the other view there's they're in a purple one too yeah true I think it was a British yet group was it was better\nPurple one that she had that was the size of her head yeah so there there are those are those are those would be your crucial formed vegetables Bowser\nThose those are those are available right now and root crops are great this time of the terrorists radishes turn of uh things like that\nHere's another another great tip for a growing root crops plan I'm from see they they grow so easy from seed and seed is so much cheaper than buying them and six and six packs are just grow do yourself ...\nLast year for him from six\n... and ... and yet within a week they had their you'll wake yeah\nAnd and and kids love ... if if he got ... if you got little kids and he went to get them into gardening get him to plant get them to plant a Rick ... suddenly they rose quite yeah something that grows quick because they can go out and they can put the seeds in the ground and ... ...\nAnd they'll they'll grow and they can harvest them pretty quickly the other thing that you can do with radishes soon as as the greens ... well if you want to Rome for grains I'm rash grains are actually pretty tasty they're very they can be very ... very spicy\nAnd I happen to like rashes even though it's a rude crop I got nothing against Red Cross and it's just being sales just exactly like who\nCares last year for six pack with throwing away as I got to take the good looks at it I'd put a planet of the plan I didn't space them out a plan to close together will I mean it was just clusters of\nNaked and they were sort of like vegetable guy but you know that's where I grew them and they were very flavorful\nThey were they are yeah it was wild I did I was wondering I remember when we used to ... we we used to my dad used to plant a garden when I was a kid we grow vegetable and we're going out and pulling them out on the ground when once you get the dirt off of um right right and you just eat them re outright our garden or they're really really tasty Muslim over\nPlanted carrots last year in it I think it was a terror caught a pot or a black plastic pot is what I wait and many seats and she harvested as she was thinning for months you know there was just always a few more you could take out because there were so many of them are so great\nYeah they they were like you said that they were all missed the shape and and I mean they were but but it was kinda cool\nOne thing you gotta watch out for when you're growing churches you don't want to if you don't want to overfeed them with um if you give 'em too much nitrogen the carrots branch so you get so instead\nOf where you get those funny looking one yes I had plenty of good ones but I didn't even feed him either that or maybe it was just from the soil that I that had for ...\nThat could be at a fertilizer pocket of gas hideous [laughter] um\nBut I I over fed the guard and one time and I came up with some really bizarre like free legged carrots yeah so that's what I had yeah so you look at the ... of your book like ruins Gilligan's Island eggs but I got there are radiated regulated vegetable seeds [laughter]\nSo so so that's that's the tip there or if you're going to plant crops plant plant them from seeds and and chart charge viable right now to\nYou can take your chart greens your radish screens and beet greens and you can stir fry them altogether\nYeah I guess you could do that and you know what that's a great thing to do with that is a great thing to do with beaches just cut the full adjustable minute the fullest leave a beating the ground\nOr give it to me yeah if I grew in Mike I could well why don't you do that and take the tasty green\nWell actually ... you know Melanie she she loves beat so she she could eat the beach and then I'll just eats possible and then once again I'm left out yeah bank once again once again and you know as far as ... as far as vegetable gardens are concerned you can grow them in containers or you can grow them in the ground either way a\nWindow boxes don't let space limit you on growing winter vegetables\nExactly yeah they're ... they're very easy to grow\nOr did 'em all and continues last year I mean that's why my audience my ... my care it's like I said I'd never gone cares but do they were very very easy\nYeah that's what my dad does he he he pickers everything containers Ben and does does pretty well with it as well [noise] uh see we if you want to

I'm going somewhere that's what the point I was who is\nSometimes things just break all of a sudden they usually does what it is in the gears of mesh in the cage can only hold so much pressure you got it you know what I'm going to give a scare them I'm sure some got stuck in one of the gears how little they broke up with something Janet something you know\nAnd couldn't have been a a poor cast a spider given a to Z broke off sure yeah I don't know what started the catastrophe\nBut it ... snowball for sure no light of that yeah no absolutely All right let's grab Mike and alcohol in the morning my\nThanks for taking my call guys there another some smog tests question okay I'll I'll busted this really fast I got two thousand two nice on a frontier um\nI had to get a small test for uh for car registration air and when it ... it did not pass uh the smog tests flight is not on but it says the sensor\nIs not ready the oxygen sensors not ready to the smog tests guy says yeah just go drive the cargo drive like fifty Seventy miles so I took a day off work there and then went driving the car driving on the freeway driving around the roads here cooking back there back for ... and I had to pay ten dollars for another ... tests and Israel not ready\nOkay how are you okay so what you're talking about is the monitors on the vehicle and ... and the readiness monitor for either the oxygen censor or the oath to censor Peter probably the heater has not run on the vehicle now here's here's the key and as we do a lot of this stuff up um\nAnd and if there's something preventing it from running the criteria that it won't run the monitors how many miles do you have on it\nI got a hundred and sixty eight and just and ask for that or the ... and censor heater is working right now I have a a screen shot and says it's completed right now but just the ... center is not\nComposed to itself is not widely heater rent okay so some things can cause and I'm not I'm not saying to go replacing anything 'cause you have to figure it out but if you if you followed the exit well two things I'm a backup your number one\nSometimes that monitor dry cycle on these needs to be followed to the tea that the manufacturing the engineers wrote it to to get certain things to pass or it will take a long time and lots of driving for to meet the criteria the second thing that can be a problem is\nWe have another sensor that's not acting a hundred percent although it's not all that out and it's preventing that PC him from running the monitor for the oh to censor because it's waiting to see\nDo we have a problem do we not have a problem what are we doing here are we sure that we got everything together before I run this monitor 'em so in that can happen to to be honest with you so sometimes you could drive in a thousand miles and it may not run the monitor\nYou know you could have the light off but we can have a pending coach stored pending coach store is not going to run the monitors like Brian was saying metal to what we need to dig a little deeper into that yeah okay\nYeah 'cause I mean the I called to be a yard and they said oh well you got to go straight to the manufacturer for staring and nice all wants two hundred thirty dollars just for a diagnosis air and I'm Renee easier way out\nOn our number one you they those guys want yeah I'm going to be all okay you're going to say is I'm In a minute I'm\nBad idea as far as B. A. R. I'm a ... as far as their their suggestion to you ah where where you need to go is find a really good a station that deals with smog that are that technician is well versed in running monitors what what area do you live in\nMind like on two miles away from the west auto Groupon off in\nA way that's not yeah no no problem there so typically I'm you know I get it in on something like that we were Ninety nine Ninety five and usually we can get everything to run the monitors all that if not then we have a direction and to tell you right hey this is a problem we need to go down this road and do some testing here or whatever\nBut I don't ah um it's I mean\nWhen we can follow the criterion run all that and usually we get them to run as a matter of fact just just a um\nA to let you know there's a couple of dealers especially high on the others that send us all their cars that they're tough to get the monitors that run on and they send them all over to us and in my small guys run the monitors all the time 'cause we've gotten really good at it as if they think\nWas the one thing was about to be a A R and go into Nissan winters they said well have these for items checked off documented and brought back to us in one of them was flashed the ... the power train control module and I know about flash on a computer virus but you know ... ... a module and a car there that's a whole new light and for me there\n... out if there's enough faith for the power thing but but that shouldn't be there and the ah a requirement to get get a a a a monitor to complete\nThat's not you know there can be updated software but that they said the thing completed monitors at one time it small before right\nA yet to well here's the thing uh from what I was told was replaced the battery five hundred miles to go to I guess I was at ... rode out the computer\nAnd I that's what happens I was going to ask you how we wind up you know back in all the way how we get to where the monitors rink complete you just because you did about a replacement so exactly yeah\nYeah and when you get advice like you'd call the bureau of automotive repair just so you know most most of the folks are talking to on the phone or not they're not technicians nor have they ever band so they're suggest\nHer band so their suggestions that they come up with aren't always the greatest one dealing with stuff like that\nAnd Nissan quite honestly probably wouldn't even taking an older frontier with a hundred and sixty five for diagnosing the kind of draw a line sometimes they're okay Josh why can go visit do west automotive group on Monday morning you\nDo see Chris Bell or Frank over there and they will get to taking care of for sure\nAll right thanks like I really made my day no problem I thanks for being a lesser I have a wonderful say good Bye bye [noise]\nThat was the story of my life this week probably going to get your ... things about the bureau of automotive repair now you're always in trouble [laughter]\nDon't sweat it out here yeah that was story of my life\nThis week a catalyst monitors on Toyotas for runners tundra is so I just had to deal with them all of this week so\nYeah yeah and I'm going to put up throw copy out out there before I knew when I'm Talking about this I said a lot of the people I Know several folks that worked for the view of automotive repair that our prior technician therapy ... very adverse that automobiles so\nYeah that too but when you call on the phone I'm pretty sure you're probably not talking to them because they're out in the field usually you know and things so anyway but ah I I don't want to everybody I Know I don't want my friend John networks they're calming scream at me when he was saying about me [laughter]\nIt's all good no um [noise]\nThere's no reason to do with you as you know there's a reasonable for him to be at the Nissan agency no\nDefinitely not no that's not going to help in in actually so uh it down and Tom networks in Al Capone a is a nice on factory trained to work on these on for years yeah are you and\nI you know what a nother guy that are used to build rebuild a bunch of the CBD for Nissan before he came to work for me and stuff right so he he uh yeah so he's awesome guy I talked to all those master guys out there to our so you get that thing and they get the monitors run on it um\n[noise] good stuff for sure let's uh let's see let's grab Brian real quick you know what I don't know if we're going to have time you're ... you're going to take our bottom of the hour break real quick and then we'll be right back Ryan hang hang tight I just don't want to uh [noise]\nGreat and thank you very much no problem Ryan thank you for lifted and have a wonderful safe weekend\nThe only other you got on there and we can't look some scanned too old adage there it's primitive but we can look at some ... oh you can sure you don't have a lack of leaning condition we're getting all complicated narrative fuel match center or something ... you know there's going\nTo be in it and that's why I said why if the ignition system at every Julia Merle operating at the way they're supposed to do what's most technicians were look out which is just guy probably did you know the only other thing I could think of is if we ever convert or it's not going to lock up at highway speeds you're going to drop off on your mind with yeah sure\nOther than that though you're right about all that guy's going to get out of them and it's about it\nYeah so not only only just another have offered to give me a

I went to that is running a battery low so like leaving a a dome light on our leaders heated lead lead things like that the you know you run into battery down ... it didn't it short in life or the battery for sure the only other thing is\nQuoted terminals corrosion on them\nShort life a battery they don't charge is well cetera so at that starts to happen they need to be cleaned other than that there's not a whole lot you can do with it\nOK okay but I mean that kind of makes sense it's just you know it's kind of frustrating that when it dies it dies and it's usually in the worst of circumstance\nOur facility maintain the industry tie up service Sanders enjoy use of our free shuttle service to and from work or low cost rental vehicle while you're vehicles being service or repaired\nBy our professional AFC certified technician west automotive group services repairs your vehicle to manufacture specifications you can enjoy peace of mind knowing that we also back every repair with some of the longest nationwide warranty\nTake advantage of our no charge sort of care transmission diagnosis\nAt one of our three San Diego facilities\nLocated in ... al ... or ... or your ultimate automotive service experience book an appointment now\nFind Seventy five years the U.S.'s am seven Seventy San Diego's talk radio\n\nHe's CBS News on the hour presented by God friended me\nI'm Wendy July to vote is expected within hours in the Senate which will likely end what has been a divisive and bitter nomination fight\nWith only one Republican breaking from the party Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski\nJudge Brett Kavanaugh has all but it sure to be confirmed as the next justice of the Supreme Court West Virginia democratic Senator Joe Manchin will also though yes yesterday Republican Susan Collins revealed her yes vote during the more than forty minutes speech CBS in Palo read on the White House reaction\nBut one official reaction from the White House came from Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted thanking senator calling for standing by your conviction and doing the right thing to confirm judge Kavanaugh\nA vice president Mike Pence also tweeted his support for Kavanaugh yesterday calling him one of the most qualified that did ever to be nominated to the highest court in the lab\nFirst lady Melania Trump also weighed in while in Egypt\n\nWhite police officer Jason Van Dyke has been found guilty of second degree murder and aggravated battery for killing a black teenager in Chicago CBS is dean rentals [noise]\nScattered demonstrations materialized around town but the guilty verdict against a white officer appear to cool passions and acquittal\nWould've stoked his bail revoked his life in ruins then die was led away by deputies a mug shot his personal ticket to the county jail\nThe head of the international police agency Interpol is missing Larry Miller has more\nInterpol president ... way it was taken away by Chinese discipline authorities on arrival in Beijing from France two weeks ago and it hasn't been seen since reports Hong Kong South China Morning Post\nIt's believed man either offended the Chinese government in some way or he suspected of corruption from when he was a senior Chinese official China's said nothing about banks disappearance the French are investigating Larry Miller CBS News\nNew apple is shining in America's eyes CBS is Don bailer report\nThat Fishkill Farms in upstate New York Yankees\nTheir annual fall heartless of apples is in full swing but this year there's a new king of the orchard being cram [laughter]\n\nThe gala apple is projected to come in at number one by the end of twenty Eighteen surpassing the reigning champion red delicious\nThat CBS News Sunday on CBS after a new sixty minutes don't miss the new drama God friended me followed by a new MCI SLA then it's the season premiere Madam Secretary Sunday on CBS\nEach time ... time to join the millions of people that need happy with the old video conferencing who gives you ... video crystal clear audio and instant sharing across any mobile tablet or desktop device but the best thing about\nDo it just works to ditch the distraction joined a movement and need happy when a new video conferencing Lizzie zoomed on us to set up your free account today that little dot US ... view video conferencing\nI'm Joe Joe with today's chill on money CBS News radio also offers original ... with analysis on the week in politics I major Garrett this is the takeout and national security is it intelligence matters and I might come around the or even ... cats have your favorite TV shows like CBS this morning sixty minutes of the nation\nI market right in the name of the\nNation in twenty eight teams CBS News radio he's your source for a regional reporting on the radio and online CBS News radio dot com\nAnd she is born at the movie CBS News ...\nThe movie CBS correspondent ...

hear the ... meter part of the chip that's why and so they are ... and go faster\nBut you wouldn't be able to run it more than an inch or six inches or something so yeah\nKnow about the on board a color on that um you know I remember talking to and\nYou know I remember talking to Andrew like maybe three years ago when he was saying you know the at that time the intel trips head on board\nSupport that you probably didn't even need to get like went in those days I didn't get to fifty six K or five twelve color cards\nYou said you really didn't get much any boost at all and performance but I'm Wondering on these new ... what then with the ... if you had to get a caller hard would it be a graphics card would it be like have to be really huge ... in order to get any boost in performance at all\nA a guy with the entire law library that knows more loopholes than any human\nCan have in their head [noise] right but you'll still need someone to litigate in like convince a jury\nBut all those junior lawyers that just look stuff up in libraries and oh what about\nAh this precedent in this statute they can all get replaced with AI and we're talking to the next five years what's\nGoing to have like this can be really big changes\nThere will be big changes I don't think they'll be as radical as quick as we\nGuess always guessing I mean if it was we believed all the the gases or you know decades in years we all being flying cars now like the Jetsons and but things take a little bit longer because of unanticipated problems are challenges but make no mistake it is coming\nRight is coming well yeah and when you combined day I with robots dots where ... ... jobs get replaced because I'm just I'm looking right now at a robotic Japan that can hang dry wall walk around pick up the pick up the drywall hanging the drywall mail it to the wall like\nThat'll be a while too because there's so many things that can go wrong and so many different shapes\nBut you're right um I think we're going to see it first and we have in retail kiosks are going to take out\nWell actually the first place we see it as an adult entertainment just like video or anything else or they're trying to open a robot um [laughter] entertainment palace in Houston\nAnd there's a big fight going on because it's not ... and so the people that normally regulate those kinds of activities\nThat entity isn't empowered to regulate it because it's not humid or one did open and then it got shut down yeah they're trying to I Want to Houston, Texas is crazy that's an interesting\nTake on the law but ... like you said I Can't like they don't have laws about it because it's robots and so they're like ... ... how do you know what I miss treating these robots this is what they're made to do you know like that but but but like the zoning laws and all that can't they can't feed it like it's a very strange thing\nBut that's what drives a lot of the tech look at all the video streaming technology we have now\nWas initially developed to look at a less than savory things over the Internet\nWell yes and we have a two big drivers three big drivers for technology one space\nThe government right now and they invest a lot of stuff military or military stuff and entertainment\nUh and then that all trickles down sideways up to business shares all but it usually starts with\nSpace military entertainment then finally business purposes uh and you're right a lot of innovation or came from the need to have higher resolution graphics faster right not to display a pie chart on your screen work\nNo it was to see some entertainment that you would know about these things happen and so what's funny is that technology yeah same Skype tell me more became your business meeting software it became Web ...\nSo did you have to do some research into the adult entertainment just check out the technology to [laughter]\nBack when they were motives perhaps but not in the last many many years back when you are with print out a racy picture on a yacht matrix\nGarbage or sprint or even a daisy will print or you know we just\nCarry a that's making your calculator said bad we're yes yeah it's kind of that level\nBut no it's pretty amazing that now we expect tape you're going to have a meeting it well OK I'm just gonna sit in front of my laptop all the meat or I don't even look to see where the meeting is because I don't go I'm there virtually you know it's I'm\nNot a bad thing you know a lot of meetings or just a big deal on fast and a waste of time and there's five minutes of it that you need so if you can do it via\nA much to see a sky fracture a you can do some other things a while you're waiting for the part that's interesting are needed for you and you don't have to drive you know three hours to get to a ...\nIt's not hard technology Amazon has a has an ad where they like give one of these little Alexa video things to grandma\nThe video of things to grandma you know and uh and they just say just plug it in and as soon as she puts it in in um boom there they are on the screen you know yeah a cool\nYes a lot of that stuff is happening one eight hundred seven six zero K. F. M. B. one eight hundred\nSeven six zero five three six to\nUh I Do want to self driving car near a and you know this car subscription services now that eventually will be for self driving cars so the script scripture services\nFor X amount of months let's say four hundred and fifty bucks a month you have a menu of cars and the more you pay a month the bigger the menu of fancy cars and\nYou pick the car you want me to go pick it up or they bring it to you and you can drive that car like it was yours but they say you know what I Want this month I Want a truck oh you can just turn it in and you get a job and so you're basically renting slash buying\nThe use of whatever\nVehicles you want for a given length of time you just trade it for whatever you want right off the list interesting so it's like have us or hurts but it's sort of a yeah huh and um it's one monthly fee and eventually that will be that you just pick which one you want and it will self drive\nTo your house and just be out there by the curb waiting for you know and I think that's real and then some people want to own a car right there will be current demand and I think that will happen that let's say you don't own a car you only need a car sometimes [laughter] push a button that drives over there and drive to where\nIt could drive or it can be used by somebody else do we need to get home from work and other car coming you know drives you home\nWell and you know like with kids I I Want something we talked about a services like Hoover for kids and all people I'm self driving would would eliminate one of the ... one of the uh risks you know of a driver and the car with my kids but I'd love to be able to say oh sure you know a we'll have so and so back at midnight\nAnd then just have a car automatically take up you know or pick them up from school occasionally\nYeah that'd be awesome yeah and I think it'll it'll happen but the laws will have to catch up and figure out how to deal with like you said when you\nHear about that guy that controls over in a Tesla model three because the cop thought he was playing with his computer on the dash [noise] and and the guys I Know it's a Tesla the computer is the car just as part of the dash and the cops I go to write him a ticket for like messing with his laptop and the guy had to explain to the ...\nPart of the car [noise] I'm not this is like the cars driving and I'm interacting with it through a screen\n[noise] there's a lot of crossover technology that does cause a law enforcement and our safety to pause like whoa\nWhoa how Dr are and who's just letting their car drive for them yeah\nAnd and we have to work in some environments where safety is number one because you could die well sure and part of the safety thing to be in a particular area along say for instance the railroad track 'em you can't touch your cell phone\nCan't use it you can't use it as a camera you can't put it into airplane mode and use it as a camera you cannot because we used to take pictures all the time of the stuff we are working on or whatever or or take veterans send it back to one of the Texans hey what do you do this we can't do that anymore ... what about like uh we have a regular camera\nSo like a half mile to go pro you could wear that the whole day while you did your word yeah that that would be OK yeah what about uh\nCan't touch your cell phone because they think you're going to be too distracted a and get hit by train like the engineers right and so um that came along because of what happened with engineers\nFor you know and we safety in you know we want to be safe we build a lot of news sites around the world the company I work for and one of the things we've\nLearned is that we used to build and then we put in a security system later but\nWe put security system in first because we can watch the progress of the bill through the cameras yeah and so when the facilities guys and the you know safety people want to see\nIf everything was done right according effect and you just scrub the video back I just run the thing backwards and they can see everything how are the ... there you go yeah so that's pretty cool\nThe ability to see things that are going on far away\n[laughter] but then comes the tinfoil hat of their spying on me brochure Europe to spy on you or England has cameras millions every\n... London is led the way and a Tokyo's kind of getting that way I mean a lot of the Arabs anyway\nRight so the cops are basically sitting behind screens directing the other cops of where there's\nJust not even that AI is showing the cops and what we're seeing on the greens it isn't there there are too many so\nThe humans can only really pay attention to four or five screens at a time really yeah and we're talking literally tens of thousands of cameras so you can't have humans watching all that it is it it doesn't scale up that way so what you do is you have\nAI watching it and then highlighting things in boxes or popping up sub screens for the humans to examine suspicious activity\nYeah and there's a there's a great series on Netflix that's based in London yeah and it's just it's follows the cops and the screen the people that watch the screens show all is pretty interesting I'm a little strange to know that pretty much everywhere you step\nA there is going to be video yeah uh", "show_name": "Armstrong & Getty", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "06"}
