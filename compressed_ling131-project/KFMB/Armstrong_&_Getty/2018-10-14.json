they just may unlocked the key to helping you get stronger\nAnd healthier at any age now Dr ... eleven is a chiropractor a nutritionist spokesperson and a longtime advisor for purity products that eleven welcome back to the show\nOh it's great to be here with us today pat and we have a very exciting topic to cover today packed today we're talking about strength and power how to get it back even if you're in your fifties sixties seventies eighties so if you want to feel better if you want to feel stronger this is some very important information we're going to cover today\nThis is an exciting topic talk to me about this important message today what molecule are we talking about how it's impacting the lives of people who follow the science\nRight right right well we're talking about her new supplement it's cold every strong and it features and exciting molecule old Korea Team now had a lot of our listeners may have heard of creepy and I know you've used Korea teen right but for those that don't know about Korea teenage mainly use\nIn the Olympics circles professional athletes body builders college high school athletes because it does something extraordinary and when I'm about to tell you is proven by hundreds and hundreds of human studies so here's where Korea Team does rush\nIt helps us to get stronger more powerful helps put muscle mass on the body and it helped protect us from losing muscle tissue\nAs we get older we know that's a big part of aging not only that at great for the brain great for memory and it helps promote bone strength as well so an amazing molecule that everybody needs to know about\nAmazing stories get your share some of the ...\nAnd it helps promote bone strength as well so an amazing molecule that everybody needs to know about\nSome amazing stories can you share some of the science and tell us why you're calling creating one of the best kept secrets to healthy aging\nA short pat what we need to understand with Korea Team is that it's a natural molecule to the body it's in every single celled tissue Oregon in your system\nAnd its job in the body is to generate and maintain strength and power that's the reason for being\nTo maintain strength and power it's an every single so on the body Ninety five percent of it however is in your muscle tissue\nBecause that's where we tend to use it the most the powers of the muscles it's good for strong muscle contraction and it's important to help maintain strength and muscle contractions when you're using them over and over again for instance if you're\nWorking out at the gym if you're playing sports golf tennis anything like that it keeps your muscles powered up in their higher energy state so they're strong and ready for action packed here's the key is is so important for those of us say in our fifties sixties seventies\nYou see we had lots and lots of Korea Team when we were young we had one of the stuff that was coming out of areas we had lots of creating our bodies made a lot of it but as we get older like everything else we don't do that is well we have less Korea Team in our muscles you know the good news is that hundreds and hundreds of human studies show that when you supplement with Korea Team\nAid goes to work or go straight to your muscles it's absorbed easily it pumps up at the Korea thing in your muscle tissue and you get stronger you get more powerful not only that it helps support memory and brain health and it helps support the strength of your bones\nYou know we were talking before the show and you were talking about how it looks like athletes have been using Korea Team for years to win hands strengthen performance and tell me more\nWell this ... is the premier sports nutrition supplement there's no question about that pat you've used at body builders know about it athletes know about Korea Team is the premier\nSports nutrient so you know back twenty twenty five years ago the Olympic athletes in our coach is of course they knew about it they knew what made you bigger and stronger and faster they knew was natural to the body it was supposed to be there\nBut there were a little bit afraid to supplement with it because they were afraid it might be considered cheating that it might be considered too much of an edge but back in Nineteen eighty eight the international Olympic Committee they came out the officially confirmed that I'm quoting here\nKorea Team can be used by athletes to enhance their performance and now ... it's not just for athletes anymore because the studies are clearly showing\nThat for adults for people in their fifties sixties seventies this stuff is amazing and purity has this incredible new formulation\nIt utilizes twenty\nPercent of your body is energy this is a very thirsty Oregon for\nEnergy and just like your muscles soak up decree it seemed like a sponge\nBecause this is a naturally occurring molecule in the body it passes right through the blood brain barrier your brain or an soak it up like a sponge and it increases your Korea teen phosphate reserves in your brain so now in your brain you have more readily available resources\nTo do was to recharge those neuronal batteries to make more energy inside the brain so basically what do you notice what your memory is supported and pat scientists have done some amazing research here they found the people that take Korea Team it supports their memory it actually helps the brain to utilize\nOxygen better it supports memory and people that are sleep deprived it's been shown to help people add numbers quicker and for longer periods of time without mental fatigue get this study pat\nJust five days five days of eight grams of creativity and supported mental tasks in subjects that we're getting rapid fire question scientists were asking him\nMath questions in science questions over and over and over and they found the folks aren't creating didn't fatigues quickly mentally so this is amazing stuff it's like a turbo booster for your brain it's\nLike a super charger for your muscles every chargers all your cellular battery so all of your cells tissues and organs have more readily available energy\nOr dark I loved that ever strong appeals to athletes and people want to get more reps in the gym maybe get some extra power and their workouts but you're also saying there's a big push a nutritional community to encourage people in their forties fifties sixties seventies and even eighties to leverage the power of Korea Team to stay fit strong and healthy but you say\nKorea Tina's going mainstream you know I share the story with you before my mom who's in her late seventies now she's taking creating she works out a couple of days a week three days a week she goes to novelist does the free weights because she's got osteoporosis she wants to\nMom who's in her late seventies now she's taking creating she works out a couple of days a week three days a week she goes to novelist does the free weights because she's got osteoporosis she wants to maintain her muscle mass and she wants to make her bones stronger and as you pointed out creating helps to do that\nAnd then the other three days during the week she'll go and she'll swim now she's not trying to get bigger stronger or anything like that\nBut even at her age Korea teen has benefits\nOh yeah and what blows me away about that story 'cause you told me before\nIs that her medical doctor recommended ... for and that just goes to show\nHow much more mainstream this is it's called every strong and it supports the muscles that supports your power your strengths your speed if you're an athlete you're certainly going to love it\nBut even if you're not an athlete you notice the difference let's go to another study one more review study this out of the journal current aging science December two thousand thirty and I thought this was very cool\nCause the researchers looked at the body of research out there on creating and seniors without exercise they want to see what happens when seniors take Korea teen and they don't\nExercise so I'm quoting here creating supplementation without associated resistance training seems to enhance muscular string\nPower and insurance increase lean body mass for those that\nDon't know what that is they're talking about muscle and improve the functional capacity of the elderly they go on to talk about how it supports bone health as well and then they finished with this creating supplementation without training and the elderly potentially delay atrophy of muscle and proven difference and strength so here again we see bottom line\n... is very very effective it's gonna help you\nTo feel stronger whether you exercise or not it supports your strength and power your brain health\nAnd on top of that it supports your bono pat when you think about it this almost sounds too good to be true right right yeah you're a person it never heard about this and you're listening to us you would think this sounds too good to be true\nBut it is true hundreds and hundreds of human studies back up what we're talking about you're going to love the benefits you get with this every strong formula\nThat's incredible let me remind everybody they can get a free bottom of the ... strong formula today plus the bonus bottle of twelve energy melts\nJustify calling us if one eight hundred by eight zero ... Seventy five you just pay for shipping that's one eight hundred five eight zero eleven Seventy five will give that number out again later in the first judge eleven now listeners can only get every strong this clinically tested Korea teen blend from surety products right\nAbsolutely I Know it combines the Korea teen with vitamin D the coffee buried the fruit XP bore on and for those who don't know talked about how these works so well together there's a a synergy and it's also a great value to I Know we have a free bottle today but if you wanted to buy all of these things separately it would cost a small fortune wouldn't it\nOh absolutely I mean if you went out and bought the Korea pure creed and that's a curious to find as pre teen from Europe if you're both that and then you went out and bought a separate antioxidant formula and separate joined formula and the vitamin D and it's going to cost you eighty Ninety a hundred bucks a month\nBut you're not going to spend that today and that was purely products and your name going to spend half that you're not spending forty five fifty because today it's free\nYour job is to be one of the first thousand callers\nAnd take it seriously this the flies out the door and the big radio stations the one of the first thousand calls you could you be twelve and ... and your ... strong you just pay six Ninety five for shipping we want to get it right out you know\nWe want you to try this out we want you to be the judge for yourself don't take my word for it try it look in the ... go to the gym lift some weights play do whatever you do see if you don't feel better\nAll right let's talk about how you take this you have these easy to swallow tablets which are super easy to swallow it also comes in a very refreshing cherry Barry powder so how do you like to take you to give people just choose the tablets are the powder when they're calling for the free bottle today\nYeah yeah you can choose tablets are powder I personally use both you know I'm I work at these days are making a a protein shake on days I'm juicing let's face it juicing is becoming very big these days so if you're doing something like that to a jury very powders fantastic could just take a scoop\nDumping right into your juice dumping pure protein shake and that's a great way to take it but if you don't do that stuff I mean the tablets are super convenient they're small they're coated they're easy to swallow\nIt's wonderful stuff\nNow I Know you're shopping at the bit to tell us a little more about this study the purity did on the ever strong powder they tested golfers and purity found out that not only were these golfers getting stronger and more explosive but they were driving the golf ball get this\nFourteen yards further that's amazing\nI have such a big smile on my faith right now I'm remembering when the researchers came back and gave us information I mean we were bouncing off the walls this is so exciting the researchers called this\nA seminal study in sports nutrition and this is on our every strong formula the products we're talking about right now the average strong power\nSo double blind placebo control study thirty golfers took the ever strong powder for one month no exercise nothing different just took our every strong power for one month in one month they were banging the golf ball\nFor teen yards further pat not only that six percent more power on the bench press more explosive they could lift the weights faster\nThey get older guys spend hundreds of dollars on new clubs to drive the offer other\nChurch but you can read five hundred dollars on a driver and out five yards right this is for team\nYards had people shouldn't just how how about this are you on about this this is amazing because let's face it this was a golf study but more explosive than is more speed more power this should help all sports so if you're a tennis player if you're a jogger if you're any kind of an athlete this has ramifications across the board but again these golfers\nOne month on this ever strong powder we're talking about today banging the golf ball fourteen yards further can you imagine ... you get your bottle of every strong you don't tell your buddies take it for a month and you go out and you're bang unable fourteen yards past them they don't know what hit him\nWhile I Would just had a few minutes left here I Want you to recap this amazing story today about Korea Team would you like to call the molecule of site who needs it and what about the double free bottle offer today with the ever strong plus the B. twelve energy males\nYou know what at my one concern with this show\nIs it literally it sounds too good to be true right like when I tell folks about every strong right I'm afraid they're going to think I'm making this up not possible right you know I Know how you feel because six seven eight years ago when I started to read about Korea teen I almost couldn't believe it I said to myself\nIf it's really this good with an excellent safety profile how come everybody's not using it but I started to use it and I noticed some incredible benefits it's just phenomenal and it's as simple as this you're going to get on the strong you're going to try it you're going to get stronger you're going to get more powerful you can look in the mirror\nAnd see the difference there's hundreds and hundreds of human studies backing us up these aren't studies with a hamster in a lab somewhere where it's a human studies I called stuffed muscle\nFertilizer exact right and of course we didn't just there to create pure Korea Team we've discussed that we are that the fruit XP remember that joined health weight of the coffee Barry extract that nominal antioxidant that's more potent than blueberries and strawberries for powerful in the opposite of protection I added the vitamin D because it's so important across the\nMore potent than blueberries and strawberries for powerful in the opposite of protection\nI added the vitamin D because it's so important across the board free for bone health but also for seniors\nVitamin D so important for muscles especially\nAs we get older for strength and coordination so this is a very comprehensive formula again this would easily cost you eighty Ninety a hundred bucks to replicate on your own but today it's free and not only that let's not forget about the beat twelve energy males 'cause we're talking about energy here today and when you think energy you think be twelve ... twelve is critical\nFor making red blood cells to carry oxygen to the two shoes the by attending there is great for the ... and then also just make sure\nYou're one of the first sales records that's the only catch on this whole show don't be calling them to Fifteen hundred you're not going to get it be one of the first thousand called your free bottle of every strong your freebie swelled energy ... six Ninety five ... just paying for the shipping\nWe're talking with Jesus in camp resident and a lot of development purity talks about I'm exciting new products to build all exclusively through purity monitor sold the omega three superbowls\nWe've got a special offered free bottle offers the tune we're gonna be given up that phone number ... Jesus let's get to ingredient number two because there's so many got three super pill does something that no other visual product can do it actually lowers cholesterol\nTalk about these plants generals explain how this works and why it's so important [noise] right\nWell I don't know anyone who isn't concerned about their cholesterol if you have high cholesterol obviously you want to lower it if you have normal or healthy cholesterol obviously you want to maintain it sure well in the world of dietary supplements there is one compound one ingredient\nThat stand head and shoulders above anything else they're called plants they're all they have over a hundred and forty human clinical study shown to lower significantly lower LDL cholesterol and again LDL as the bad cholesterol\nHDL the good cholesterol though obviously you don't want to lower HDL plants they're all only target LDL and the studies are pretty dramatic they show that in his little as a few weeks four weeks you can see anywhere from five to Fifteen Percent reduction in your LDL level\nSafely and naturally absolutely no side effects very effective they've known about plants they're all in the Nineteen fifties and they work to be a very different mechanism than stat and drugs so I wouldn't tell people to stop taking fat and drugs we're not trying to position this as an alternative to Staten\nStaten work by preventing the production of cholesterol in the liver plant sterile work differently\nThey block the absorption of cholesterol in the intestine plants their roles are similar structurally to the cholesterol molecules and they basically confuse little cells in your intestine called my feels into thinking that the plants their roles\nAre actually the cholesterol particles so that my feels\nPick up the plant sterile instead of\nThe cholesterol particles and the cholesterol particles instead sort of just get passed through urine test and then you ultimately excrete them instead of absorbing them the point is if you're on that and\nYou can take plants they're off as an addendum therapy to help control your cholesterol studies actually had been done to show that they can amplify the benefits\nAnd of course this particular product you get obviously first off the full clinically tested amount of the plants they're all to deliver the benefits as shown in the study\nThat's something that's very important because a lot of products out there that you'll see that have plants that laws on the label may only deliver a tiny fraction of what any study is ever showed any benefit for purity delivers the full amount that you need to get these benefits\nNow let's talk about the surgeon greedy and the formula co Q. ten which is also becoming one of the more popular nutritional ingredients all of the world's tell us about who you Jim and why it's valuable for our health what does what does it do\nWell co Q. ten is found in every single cell in your body if they're from the moment you're conceived until the moment you lead the earth\nUnfortunately as you age you lose co enzyme Q. ten so by the time you're in your senior years you've only got about half as much co Q. ten as you did when you were about twenty now when you think co enzyme Q. ten\nOne word should come to mind packed\nEnergy you cannot make energy without co enzyme Q. ten is the critical pivotal energy

function\nIt supports brain health and cognitive function it's a very powerful anti accident in fact one of the most powerful anti accident ever discovered\nThey're actually taking a look now at Clinton's on Q. ten in its role in exercise and muscle performance one other interesting note coins on Q. ten really has become popular in the United states as a topical beauty products you're seeing a pop up and beauty products where\nOne study recently showed up to a forty percent reduction in wrinkled at them as little as ten weeks or so\nWhen you talk like a very potent ingredient very safe and greedy and\nSo the three and a product we're talking about these three amazing ingredient extremely safe for a long term used for short term youth and any dosage and I don't know if you saw that report the other day but basically half of Americans are taking\nOne or more pharmaceutical drugs so I Know a lot of people out there listening already taking something they're thinking is this they

R. E. E. offer I said\nFree offer today from purity products no strings attached this is a free offers from a reputable company that's been in business for years just you need the phone number as soon as we tell you more about ha\nNow you see there's a youth molecule in the human body and then it holds the key the visible signs of age you know you've written about this you've traveled to Japan to do the research so tell me about what is what exactly is this molecule you're talking about\nHad it's amazing that most people don't know this word ... acid and of course it's made it's all over our body it's in our skin it's an all natural molecule we can get it orally replace it in our body\nBut more so we've learned that the little bit that we can get as a dietary supplement can trigger your body to make more\nAnd of course why do we need more well when we're young we're loaded with this stuff when we're babies we have what we call baby fat it's really baby ha it it makes a well as babies fall down and get cuts and scrapes you notice they never really get\nAny lifelong scars from that because they have lots of H. A. on board highly Ron aghast that\nAnd to make this easy to understand for the audience I think we can all appreciate\nThat women have smooth their skin and thicker hair and so on all of that is because estrogen sends a signal to make more ha and that's why the girls\nHave more limber flexible joins they can get in a kind of a load of posture kind of the men can't get into they\nThey certainly have all of those advantages and it's because the estrogen sends a signal to make more ha now women have more ha to lose than men do\nAnd you see this skin traveling up the joints and so on as women age but there's a way to get it back and of course parity products for years now has been talking about ha and they have a new formula just for the joints\nH A joint formula and it's so important today because\nI think everyone's confused an article in the New York times says consumers are confused what to do to support their joints took people are looking for alternative we need cushioning in between the joints the bones in our joints when a doctor looks at an X ray\nAll he's doing is measuring the space between the two bones there in the knees so it's about a quarter of an inch space without that cushioning you've got bone rubbing on bone\nThat's what age a is it the jello or the cushioning agent in between our bones\nWe lose it either due to wear and tear or age and so we start getting problems the more that we find pain relate\nThe more pain relievers we use the more we're going to use these joints and then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed this people who chronically use pain relievers\nSo we were there taking pictures and interviewing people win eighty three year old Mr ... she came driving and on his motorcycle to deliver his vegetables to the fruit market pat where do we have in the United states eighty three year old\nDriving their motorcycle down to the vegetable market we don't have it we followed him\nTo his home Oreos up on a thirty foot ladder\nTrimming a tree he works in the fields about four to six hours a day and he introduced us to his neighbor who was nine years old without a wrinkle on his face neither of them use reading glasses\nAnd of course ah he works about six to eight hours out in the fields every day this was remarkable I almost felt had I was in some sort of a place where the dinosaurs are still living or something that was so remarkable\nThese people just exhibit a youthful this a a flexibility in their joints certainly helpful mess that we just don't see everywhere else in fact it was so remarkable that the emperor of Japan actually has visited this village pictures were taken there you could see them all over the village there as they had posted him so\nThis had stood out and of course Connie Chung or ABC News twenty twenty had gone to visit there in the year two thousand this was originally on television you could see the actual pictures for yourself but\nThe ha revolution has come here pat and of course we've had three years of use of ha but we could lose people in the science so they want to know what's real is this for real\nWell it's real for Tom who writes to us a pharmacist now from Santa Cruz California Seventy years of age participating in the whole lie Iron Man contest in Kona, Hawaii this past year\nSeventy years old he said this new ha formula for the joints did a great job not certainly a pharmacist with no here's John writing to me and saying you know at age fifty five boy when I tried ha I'm now back to playing full court basketball with a twenty year old\nAnd I've even begun to jog again these are the kinds of reports that we here\nLet me ask you a question here you mentioned the glucose I mean and there's another one that is pretty popular MSN how does this agency stack up against those other ones the other ones you have to take them for a while before you even see any results do\nAnd most of these are very positive dietary supplements they certainly have\nLots of benefits glued costs may take quite a while to kick in MSN is a wonderful sulfur compounds and again it's an anti inflammatory as are many things like fish oil ... these are all wonderful\nBut they're not dealing with the origin of the problem the origin of the problem is the loss of cushioning and the joy and if we can just replaced it if we can find a way to get that cushioning back\nThat's what we call usefulness that's what we had when we were young here's David right into me from New York twenty five years looking for something that would help

thanks for taking around today did retire rightfully that scene in white I'm generally jak on your host pleased to be here today alongside Dave Epstein and Brad white gave and Brad are with Epstein in white retirement income solutions\nAnd we're talking today brag about how you can answer the question when I retire how how can I be competent to when I retire so let me ask you as we started this next part of the show Brad why are some ways\nWe can feel more confident that are intending retirement\nOr Gen I Want you to imagine you've\nGot this big pot of money mhm that you've worked hard for you said for now you've got your big pot of money yeah and you spent\nAll of this your first month of retirement okay feeling a little less\n... I I Am I don't like that\n[laughter] that I worry now story Gen 'cause what if every single month that pot of money just completely replenish itself and the next month or you get to spend it\nAgain with no worries whatsoever because now you know it will always just keep replenishing itself every month\nOh that's like the the magic pot I like that it would you feel that it's pretty darn confidence I I like where that one's going\nAll right you spend extra money at the golf course you'd go on vacation it's Christmas Time and you ... a little bit you spend it all down\nNot to worry and strenuous January one at refills again oh I like it yeah I don't know how you could gain much more confidence than that right right you can do what you want you know it's just going to show up next month so what's the the same here\nSame here is the ... are consistent one day which is it's all about income ... fireman income income income you know I was ...\nSame here same here is the ... are consistent one day which is it's all about income right firemen income income income\nYou know I was thinking about this before the show\nAnd we'll we'll talk about this from time to time but I Want to talk about and a little bit of a different way\nYou know the goals for one k.'s when they were created this was in the early eighties was supposed to be a supplemental way mhm that an individual could add money right pre tax and pull it out later retirement but our country had been built on what's called defined benefit plans or pensions\nWhich means you knew what your benefit was going to be there was a defined monthly check\nAnd editor at the end of the rainbow at the end of the ... Street Journal's a few years ago famously published the study of how much happier and more confident retirees are when they have a check coming in for the rest of their lives and it makes perfect sense ready to go out a lot of money just replenish itself every month\nNow this is almost forty years ago going on hard to believe but since the inception of for one k.'s and somewhere along the line slowly we've come lately forgotten exactly the original intent to them 'cause now most people don't have a pension or if they do it's not enough to to certainly\nFor one case or do longer a supplement Bradley there there is a core of what\nThey're supposed to be is basically you've been building that pot of money but now your the pension manager the whole point now is your four one K. the whole time is just supposed to be a way to now turn it in to your pension and retirement because that's what's going to give you the confidence right\nI've seen white can help you after we learn all the you know makes you you've financially and all that you care about that how can we build this for you to meet your goals okay uh we don't have some plan and waiting on a shelf\nIt's what makes you you how do we maximize Social Security how do we max all that you save how do we minimize risk how do we ensure that we don't run out of money and and it goes on and on from there\nAnd it's real simple you pick up the phone and call and and and get into our calendar and the number is eight eight eight five six four seven eight Seventy once again that number eight eighty five six four seven ... seven eight\nYou're listening to retire rights with that scene in white generally jak here alongside ... and Brad white and ... and white retirement income\nSolutions guys we started off the show today talking about that magic eight ball as kind of a silly way to get a question answered especially for something so important as it\nWhen you will retire and what will your income be like in retirement\nGave so few of us have pensions today but I got to say I liked the sound of this pot of money that will refill itself every month how do we do that\nWell you know there's there's multiple ways to approach this very few that will do this fully guaranteed okay and we have to have guarantees into our in our retirement\nBut we just can't have all of our money sitting in the market with all the risk that comes with being in the market whether it's a conservative portfolio aggressive portfolio markets go up markets go down\nWe have to build in some guarantees into our retirement most people ... vast majority of people will get a Social Security benefit right and we certainly want to make sure that we choose that correctly a lot of people make mistakes on that\nRattling I give monthly workshops at our conference center to packed houses and we've been doing that for about three years now\nThan people leave here knowing you know how to how to really now to Social Security correctly but more importantly how it integrates with everything else that makes them you know them and so a another way and to make sure you have to think of that Social Security is that pot\nYou know to Jay and that it fills up each month and you you spend it and emptive it automatically it fills up again\nWell if we wanna we wanna layer another or set another pot right next to it\nA case of you visualize that you've got your Social Security pot\nDot of athletes fills up each month and you spend every dime of well we also like to build another pot right next to it\nThat does the exact same thing and and you can do that uh with with money inside an IRA\nMoney that was inside a four O. one K. or money that you you saved after tax you could do this and what institution does that for you is an insurance company and it and think of it like longevity insurance\nBut longevity insurance for income okay and what I've just described\nIs a guaranteed annuity okay and insurance companies have been doing that Gen for a few hundred years yeah I mean it\nReally does go back a annuity does go all the way back to Benjamin Franklin that's how old is he going to give you that way that's going back and there was some guarantee that those coming back from the revolutionary war got a you know got those military men\nGot a fixed amount so that's that's really where an annuity began for all of us who when we walk off and to retirement\nPay checks stop okay so how can we create a consistent paycheck well part of that might be coming from Social Security you know and if you're so fortunate to already have a pension there's that reoccurring bucket of money pot of money Bradley was talking about but for those of you and most of you out there don't have that\nThat kind of pot of money you don't get that automatic check for the rest of your life\nBut you need to know you can create that for yourself and working with a fiduciary I Will say to you we actually hold events than we've got one coming up in August uh called the good bad and ugly on on events or I'm On annuities I mean to say that's a big event ah and so\nYou know most ... we don't like but I Will tell you there's a couple of handfuls out there that that we love because it gets the job done in what in what clients are looking for often and for the right fit\nFinding the right annuity to deliver you a monthly income and for if you're married for not only you but for your spouse\nFor as long as you left just like a bench and you can control that\nSo you could build multiple pots of money that you know that you could spin down each and every month that automatically those pots refill each and every month and that allows when you start to construct a retirement plan Jen where your layering these sources of income on top of each other\nBoy I mean there's a there is could be a nice pot that fills up each and every month\nFor as long as not only one spouse was but both spouses live that you can just put that pot right next to your existing Social Security pot\nAnd if you're so fortunate to already have a pension you could stick that pot right next to that are already coming in pension and Social Security\nWhen you start to add these pots together or stack these sources of income on top of one another before you know it a large part or maybe all of your fixed expenses are met\nAnd that really allows a retiree to relax Mm okay makes sense and so we want to teach people how to do this right\nAnd there's a lot of people out there talking about annuities it is a tool used for retirees

and we're talking measure e measured gee you know hey don't tune out right just because we're ducking measures that sounds boring I get it\nNormally measures and all these things that are on the ballot I mean people can get bored and go like I don't care or I don't trust anybody and I I I understand that but this has to do their community and this has to do with you know what are we going to do with that a huge piece of\nLand or in the center of our ... our community which has a mission valley so I have with us or a friend bears who is past president that's the issue alone a spokesperson friends are best issue or a ... who is also a spokesperson also someone who is a\nAn advocate of no on e which is the the other side we had nic stone on let's do this um we had an ex stone who was a principal on measure e last week and we\nGave him full time and ah this is a little bit of of what he said and then like a response from our guess\nThe thing to remember about misery it that it's a hundred percent privately finance private capital paying fair market value for the land asking for not a single petty taxpayer dollars\nWere significantly better than measure de from attacks generation standpoint for both the city schools and we're also like a decade faster to take what is today a crumbling stadium\nThere down replace it with the state of the art stadium sports entertainment district in housing and office or the tax base for the city of San Diego but do all that with private capital and therefore the incentive to come with private capital to think well it quickly\nUm and that I mean if you're kind of cut through it creating something that fast or a decade faster at least then then the measure gee proposal\nAnd we're not asking for it to a party for the taxpayer liturgy cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars\nOkay so it would like to respond first 'cause you're Mica okay I mean it's a craft and started with Nick here they they the reality is\nThat virtually none of what he said it is true and I'll start with the taxpayer dollars thing right now they say they they they negotiate the deal behind closed doors with the ... public not involved which means we don't know what price for going to get for that land number two they buried a lot of hidden costs third deductions we know that that they can only pay a bare minimum of ten thousand dollars because after\nThey sent the price and they say we're paying millions of dollars they can go behind closed doors and start conducting so that's one number two the traffic\nHundred thousand trip that day extra that's gridlock three times the chargers game day every day in mission valley and they've written loopholes into the initiatives and they don't pay for that and you know what that means that means either you sit in traffic forever or the taxpayers are going to pay for that and that's the only the beginning environmental review a ton of other deduction so so he can try to stay with a straight face\nThat the taxpayers aren't going to be holding the bag\nBut we now his job he's not a developer he is a hedge fund investor his job is to find an undervalued asset and those are the listeners that can appreciate a business person this is what he's doing only you're the you're the one that's going to have your land undervalued he wants to find it undervalued asset turn it around in a few years make a quick buck\nThat leaves that the taxpayers holding them back\nWhere we have a mayor in ... and and the federal give you a chance to the second to we have a mayor that is fairly popular I Believe I don't know what the polls are with you know he's not running this year but he's certainly popular mayor he is supporting misery\nWhy well I\nCan I put that on hold because there's two points that we just discuss your uh there's ... they're saying they're not going to take a dollar of taxpayer funds\nThey've already taken taxpayer funds\nThey sued the city of San Diego and they took a hundred thousand out of their pocket\nAll ready so how can you trust somebody says I'm not going to take a dime when I've taken a hundred thousand before we've even wet and whether I assume for just so people are where they they sued them because the city sued soccer city city should both of us are challenging whether we met the criteria to be eligible to be on the ballot\nOr both or a prevailed\nOr they chose against that just sued the city to get their legal fees back we said\nWe don't like being sued I don't like spending money to defend it but it's a public process and if they felt compelled to ask for declare tore relief\nThen we'll go through that process or certainly not gonna take public money back we'll just participate in the process through the second is this this ten year you know bologna that's being put out there the reality is that we will have to go through a public process of an environmental impact report\nAnd and that will take a little bit of time on\nOur schedule university schedule for teen months\nRushing fourteen months to avoid public review environmental review to make sure that whatever impacts your projects generate are\nActually mitigated that's what's great about end results in California as we usually get things that are pretty good because we go through a public process do you think you want to rush through and left the developer define what their medications are I guess you got a choice to do that that's bad planning and California\nOne eight hundred seven sixty cafe and be one eight hundred and Seventy sixty five three six to ... uh we got a young lady on the phone I don't have a name but the Suzie are you there says he\nMorning bank are taking my call\nShore what'd you got you got a question for I guess\nGail I Am I Am concerned very concerned about the burden of more taxes on the taxpayers here and even though it sounds really good that it's for schools and for the death of the out there I Am not and then\nThat measure gee the way to go\nOnly because I feel and that measure eight and a lot more cleanly caught and it will not be a burden the tax payer and there is a timeframe or measure eight\nBecause they don't get on the ball about it then they will lose their sponsors and they will learn is that people backing the soccer and\nAnd so my question then is exactly what is the burn a measure gee on our taxpayers and also what exactly is your timeline\nOkay let's let's give them a friend who went to a gathering a shot at that\nSort of burned on taxpayers is zero not a penny of general fund money from the city or the state of California is zero zero\nThat's written in this and in the in the measure was\nAnd march back a democratic candidate that's one of the stories we're following on AM seven sixty\nA get out the vote event will be held today and so on a beach where Michael Evan who's running in California's forty ninth congressional district race former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and husband Mark Kelly are scheduled to attend Lebanon is running for office on a gun safety platform\nAAA says NDA guns are currently paying an average of three eighty four for a

F. M. B.\n\nBack everybody is your ... lawyer moot here's what eight hundred seven sixty KF MB we can take a few more calls it's live I saw was\nGreat Suzie I'm appreciate you know really I think our our ... too because it's a valid concern is that a show many details in both of these and of course All right let's just start with this three thousand pages and measure ... how many pages you guys have fourteen or team now All right now\nI'm a lawyer [laughter] pages really\nCan resolve and I could say the same thing on the other side\nBut fourteen pages is going to encounter something so critically important and and the the apple two the total amount of things that you have to do and you can do it in fourteen pages\nThere's there's a reason because measure gee is not ballot box planning measured she is a measure that simply authorizes the city to sell the land to the university at fair market value\nAll the rest of those details and there are three thousand pages that they set in concrete can never change\nAll that under measured she gets done in public and it's all weighed in on by community leaders by environmentalist by business leaders by the city it's all done in public that's the beauty that's why we only have ...\nAnd that as we talked I think it's a break as well and I think I even show live and that is that's the sweet and sour apart because quite frankly I agree with that and I grew transparency agree with public good overview but that concerns me on time\nUh I understand it's probably important but when you have fourteen pages saying we're just going to sell the land\nUm where the others leasing the land but they have all of a put down whether you like it or not they have all these things that they're going to commit to\nA Shia shoes are committed to eh not legally jak legally\nOne thing I Want to say though is that that they don't actually commit to anything they commit to this rain like they can build a eight hundred homes or forty eight hundred homes they can build a hotel or not though the hotel they can\nBuild a river park are probably not build a river park and so those ... specifics are really just loophole to three thousand pages loophole\nNow and the SDF used by that open and transparent process is going to allow the public to weigh in and frankly it's it it will be speeding because we know that uniformly city leaders almost across the board or have endorsed measure G\nAnd so that the council priority so we know the ... the\nBut the mayor is not involved in in this process it is the Republican and democratic council members and it is the public that will come and they will weigh in and let me tell you that\nWe have conservative groups that share those concerns that want to see in the process groups like the Lincoln club you know you don't usually see them a endorsing initiatives alongside the Sierra Club but that is how positive measure gee is that both of them agree that this is the way to go\nUh so so it's in that community support that friends talking about is the real deal and that's going to help accelerate the process the measure G. I. C. S. U. S. advocates have already done the legwork and they brought the community to the ...\nBrought the community to the table now Scott Sherman who was the a representative and the mission valley or he is also supported misery or he is there a representative of that area so you know again whatever that means\nUh we've got the mayor we've got the the representative of the the the area in question and they are not indoors change either and literally\nThe only two elected officials that have endorsed measure G and I'll say that the planning group which is made up of the citizens whose job it is to determine and to make recommendations on what goes on that land was on virtually unanimous in favor of measure G and opposed to measure eight\nTo watch the largest concern and I love the show you I I mean to me one of the biggest ones and and there's many\nIs the traffic is your um in in ... just them was bringing that up a little bit of a break um that\nCould be insane right with misery I mean the key is already and saying now but ... you know multiply that by I don't know what factor but a lot three or four times I don't know I'm just throwing numbers out that's an issue is and now it's\nThe biggest differentiate or one of the biggest differentiate between these two measures they said their their project soccer said he was going to generate Seventy one thousand five hundred trips until\nIndependent people said let's let sandbag are regional authority that's that is the authority on that determined that and they calculated it would be Ninety seven thousand not Seventy one five\nAnd under their measure they define what traffic improvements that they provide and they can never be required to provide one single traffic improvement beyond what's in their measure\nThat changed over ... didn't something I I'm I'm drawing a blank but something happened where they either rescinded that thought or something happened\nTo be I understand the confusion here's a confusing the confusion is that it was the two campaigns that went in together and they said you know what we're gonna do this right we're going to get them neutral numbers here and they actually funded study three sand act I came up with a Ninety seven thousand daily trips three times the chargers game day and and so\nThey agreed to every input how than the than he would be done what would be measured and then guess what\nThey asked what assets investors and extending his crew ran away from it and said we don't agree anymore even though they agreed to this study they find in it and then they ran away from it because they didn't like what it said\nThree times the chargers game day and then if you look into that fine print things they limit the amount of funding that they can that they will invest and and you know what it's all focused on internal to the property so they're going to ... stop signs and and street on the property that they will own\nOr that they will be Ninety nine year lease on and then know expansion of bridges no a widening of road nothing to mitigate what the rest of us are going to be putting up with and that was that deliver it\nThrough a three to one more thing real quick and then just go ahead of the uh so you're saying three times chargers\nGame day every day every day that that is true that is scary so I mean Ninety seven thousand trips a day and they are taking no responsibility for any traffic navigation or any winding roads or anything that would have to do with traffic levy Asian because right now it is bad\nAnd we all know how bad my mission valley is especially on game day it's it's insane and the trolley doesn't do enough\nAnd so we were talking about this in the break I think it's important to to say to everyone basically that this is something that your measure actually takes care of doing it can you speak on there\nSo because it goes through a public process and the California environmental quality act ...\nDoes traffic studies and ... and then outlines improvements traffic improvements known as medications but traffic improvements that will accommodate the traffic that would be created so the estimate for\nA ... fifty five thousand trips and it will impose through the environmental process\nAll of the traffic improvements necessary to absorb all of that traffic\nOn the U.S us a project or yeah so but that's something that you would have to pay for and yes okay\nYeah so that's that's what I asked yes you would pay for is the master developed ...\nA lot I ask how is this the issue is going to get all this money\nThat's the issue is a a University of ... resources and as part of the California State University ... I Know it will not be public bond supported by general fund rather than is in fact what they'll do is borrow money to put the infrastructure in place and they'll pay that money back\nWhen they do prepaid ground leases in public private partnerships to build out most of the buildings\nThey will finance a stadium with revenue bonds that will be supported by all\nThe myriad of revenues that will say it's the stadium just like they adjusted at Colorado State for the same stadium\nFor those of us who liked soccer and I know Justin as like a soccer maniac a minute I'm enjoying it more and more as I was over in Europe and watching the world cup well well being in Europe uh one\nThing that seems to be evident as soccer city I mean that's a great name or and they're literally saying the Knicks stone said\nWe're going to get a soccer team we are going to get one of those two spots ... well I Know I said maybe they should know we're going to get it and I said there's no guarantees and he said well I Can't guarantee it but I Will tell you we're going to get it and they've got inside info according to him or whatever that means I'm we're not talking a lot about", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Armstrong & Getty", "city": "San Diego", "day": "14"}
