special offered me a free bottle offer stay tuned we're gonna be giving up that phone number ... Jesus must give to ingredient number two because there's so many just three super bill does something that no other Fisher upon it can do it actually lowers cholesterol talk about these plants demos explain how this works why it's so important\nRight well I don't know anyone who isn't concerned about their cholesterol if you have high cholesterol obviously you want to lower it\nIf you have normal healthy cholesterol obviously you want to maintain it sure well in the world of dietary supplements there is one compound one ingredient that stand head and shoulders above anything else they're called plants they're all they have over a hundred and forty human clinical study\nTo lower significantly lower LDL cholesterol and again LDL as the bad cholesterol HDL the good cholesterol though obviously you don't want to lower HDL plants they're all only target Elvie out and\nThe studies are pretty dramatic they show that in his little is a few weeks four weeks you can see anywhere from five to Fifteen Percent reduction in your LDL level\nSafely and naturally absolutely no side effects very effective they've known about plants they're all since the Nineteen fifties and they work to be a very different mechanism than stat and drugs so I wouldn't tell people to stop taking stat and drugs we're not trying to position this as an alternative to stabbings\nStaten work by preventing the production of cholesterol in the liver plant sterile work differently\nThey block the absorption of cholesterol in the intestine plants their roles are similar structurally to the cholesterol molecules and they basically confuse little cells in your intestine called my feels into thinking that the plants their roles\nAre actually the cholesterol particles so the mice deals pick up the plant sterile instead of the cholesterol particles and the cholesterol particles in that sort of just get pass through your intestine than you ultimately excrete them instead of absorbing them\nThe point is if you're on that and you can take plants they're off as an addendum therapy to help control your cholesterol studies actually had been done to show that they can amplify the benefits\nAnd of course this particular product you get obviously first off the full clinically tested amount of the plants their roles to deliver the benefits as shown in the study\nThat's something that's very important 'cause a lot of products out there that you'll see that have plants cells on the label may only deliver a tiny fraction of what any study has ever showed any benefit for purity delivers the full amount that you need to get these benefits\nNow let's talk about the surgeon greedy and the formula co Q. ten which is also becoming one of the more popular nutritional ingredients all of us will tell us about co Q. ten and why it's valuable for our health what is what does it do\nWell co Q. ten is found in every single cell in your body if they're from the moment you're conceived until the moment you lead the earth unfortunately as you age you lose co enzyme Q. ten so by the time you're in your senior years you've only got about half as much co Q. ten as you did when you were about twenty\nWhen you think co enzyme Q. ten one word should come to mind pets\nTwo years you've only got about half as much co Q. ten as you did when you were about twenty now when you think co enzyme Q. ten one word should come to mind pat\nEnergy you cannot make energy\nWithout co enzyme Q. ten ... is the\nCritical pivotal energy component of every cell in your body Ninety five percent of all your energy is related to the amount of co enzyme Q. ten in your body without an adequate supply you become energy efficient you technically would have energy the fish and sell so\nCohen's on Q. ten delivers a whole panoply of different benefits were putting in fifty milligrams a perfect dose for you to get every single day it's going to support healthy blood pressure is great for your gums\nIf you're a person who has tender gums maybe when you lost their brush your teeth you noticed a little ... maybe a little bleeding could be a sign that you've got a co Q. deficiency coincide Q. ten supports immune function\nIt supports brain health and cognitive function it's a very powerful anti accident in fact one of the most powerful anti accident ever discovered they're actually taking a look now at coincide Q. ten in its role in exercise and muscle performance\nOne other interesting no coins on Q. ten really has become popular in the United states as a topical beauty products you're seeing a pop up and beauty products where one study recently showed up to a forty percent reduction in wrinkled death and his little was ten weeks or so\nWhen you talk like a very potent ingredient very safe and greedy and so the three in one product we're talking about these three amazing ingredient extremely safe for long term use for short term youth and any dosage\nAnd I don't know if you saw that report the other day but basically half of Americans are taking one or more pharmaceutical drugs so I Know a lot of people out there listening already taking something they're thinking is there say should I take it to my doctor\nThere may be no three safer ingredients and the three we're talking about today\nNow Jason as if the super pill wasn't enough with the co Q. ten for energy the plant sterile for controlling cholesterol and the fish oil for just about everything else purity is putting together an offer you see people can't refuse tell me about this great double free offer you

twenty five years before we got a lot of ground coverage and I was born\nWe do and it's all from Mother Nature and purity product list is nova print and of course you get the idea right away it's something that relieved discomfort\nWill build that sounds exciting right off the bat but let's get right down to business millions of Americans both men and women are dealing with issues related to their veins\nWhether it's on slightly spider veins swelling in the legs and they just come to that comes along with it or occasionally hemorrhage bottom line\nWe've got tens of thousands of miles of beans running through our body and like everything else the door the wear and tear up the gene and it seems like no one's really talking about this issue much less offering options still manages so what's the problem and what's this breakthrough from Europe\nWhile the breakthrough of course there's prescription in Europe one over the counter here and of course it's been used for fifty years safely will expand on that as we talk a little bit more about it and what is it well it's a wonderful well tested citrus peel extract\nTightens same it ... them up so that they were will work to push that black we've got red hoses the blue hose as\nThe arteries and the things that we've got to\nPush that the oxygen native blood and where does it pool obviously at the bottom half of our body\nAnd it's got to get pushed up through and back to the heart and if those things are weak and the the blood pools we'd only have a these problems unsightly ... spider ... we have a whole issue of circulation\nGot to get that circulates ... going\nAnd the U.S aside from standing on your head the way to do it is new va print HD now we mean I Do that is that does the same does that they used in these wonderful clinical studies that\nLaid out all over my desk here\nSo I can remind myself of all the wonderful science that's been done over the years since the Nineteen seventies on a wonderful fit to steal extract that helps your veins get strong so they can do the work of pushing and getting that circulation back\nThat your circulation is optimal and you know this the the ingredients\nIn this wonderful a new print HD also helps your blood vessels white it creates it little gas called nitric oxide we'll talk about it a little more but it dilate so why is the blood vessels so in those little tiny arterial that are just ... than\nThe white and and that's that's in our eyes and our brain that are critical little to issues that we need this great circulation so it works in more than one way\nBill I Know this is much more than just a cosmetic issue but there's no doubt spider beans were those visible beans you see on the legs are definitely a big issue for both genders may be more for women\nI sometimes see ads for those creams the promise to redo smarter veins and they're not cheap so I think you've hit the jackpot with this appeal to directly address the issue especially if it's helping to address the underlying cause\nIt certainly does because what we have here when we see spider veins there there's a lack of circulation in that area on the legs and so it's making new ones to tried to branch out and make sure that this is all happening so\nWe we want them to receipt of course and we live in an era when this should be happening because we become stationary we call it sedentary were sitting at desks or a great deal at the time were not walking and moving our legs and it's actually the muscles in our cats\nIf this is the real answer for you so it's very important that you understand the origin of this problem and yes there's good news there's something you can do about it and when we see it working so fast that's what\nGets us excited and of course we want something that's not going to complicate and we want it to be affordable and we want it to be accessible to us spoke today it is and what's the secret will the ingredients in this ... electric they don't just grind up sit for steel and put it in a bottle they might ... that they make it\nTiny tiny size so the absorption of it goes from eighty percent Ninety five percent and that's what puts it over the top\nLet me jump in with another question here though because you said it works rather quickly just start promoting ... the the function in the appearance at the beach but once you to actually do we inside how does it works\nIt works because as we have those one way check bells and our main they're they're\nLike little leave and they allow the blood to go up and then not back and so when it cools there in the the main gets week\nThan the the blood is cooling and the vein and then the vein expands because it's got got too much blood there one starts to expand as nowhere to go so when it's doing that era capillary then it's\nPushing the plasma clear part of the blood out that's where we get swelling me in our legs here's this study from the annals of cardiology Nineteen Ninety eight showing after the first hour of of a single dose of the citrus pill extract it produced a demonstrable effect so\nWe have to realize that we got to make those little\nA check ballot strong it's the same so we want to deal with making your your veins healthy that's the whole issue when you're treating disease you go to the doctor when you're promoting health you'd go to the dietary supplements and Mother Nature has some wonderful remedies\nWere pointing to them they're non prescription over the counter they're found and move a print HD if you're just tuning in and we're talking about a wonderful product called new footprint HD with the ... appeal extract in the doses that have been used in clinical studies says the Nineteen seventies and Europe non prescription\nThey're deemed to be excellent let me tell you about a survey eighty three percent of the doctors that good or excellent Seventy nine percent of the patients that good or excellent when they were poll about the ingredients and ... H date\nOr let me jump in here so now the other area where new for print can help\nAnd there's a lot of folks out there especially the men are going to sort of perk up cameras right I mean isn't a humanoid just sort of a bean and a special location and obviously the big advantage here is the new book for him to the caps must some cream were Lucian you need to deal with I mean nobody wants to see that parents if they don't have to write\nThis yeah the symptoms kind of come up at night I mean if you're sitting at the computer all day you go to bed you've kinda got to the pain and the and your bottom and so you get these kinds of symptoms you wonder what do we do here ... it's not\nA a ham right yet and uh so what do you do but it is swelling\nAnd the pain is weak and so you're getting this comfort and and of course you need to walk around but you need to sit down again and you don't want to do that you know that but it is you move along and your years\nI think all of us in the kind of lifestyles we're living we're gonna have some symptoms of this we're gonna be in a static environment where we can't move around too much\nAnd for hours and hours that lead is gonna pool and the lower half in our legs and so on we're going to get swelling and so on and of course it's just overlooked in Europe it's that prescription we talk about well it's not that costly there here it's over the counter all you need to hear is\nWell what kind of symptoms having why should I use this and of course we're reporting all the good science for the medical literature over the years\nThis started in the Nineteen Seventy\nSo my we have over four decades abusive this Malian prescriptions it's just been overlooked we love talking about this story because for a lot of people it's the first time\nThey've ever heard that something can be done about your spider Bain about that discomfort about swelling about your limb system where we're talking about things for the fans get weak way down into the small blood vessels we want to make sure that good circulation we have a return system\nFor the heart to do that\nWe want to strengthen up those same with these wonderful centrist steel

hemorrhage if you're lucky enough to be doing with that\nNow before we for the discuss the lake billions of them are white issues I Want to ask you about the loop system because earlier you mentioned

things that we dispose of in our body's lymph system is there for that and of course you've got to get that worked and so it goes along with the venous system because it's part of the returns system\nIs to get things disposed of into our system so that it it to the cells clean themselves up the limb is there\nTo make sure that we have a good immune system too because it takes things away and so\nIt's all part of great circulation in our body and and we want those things we want to remain healthy but then when you have these things well don't wait until this becomes unsightly and then\nIt's just caused medics that makes you do it all of that coming from week they insist the legs so it expands this and of course what's that like you and of course we want to get these blood vessels\nExpanding die leading and that that's the the other part of it we didn't understand early on\nIs it it's not just making the vein stronger it dilate said why this these small blood vessels to make sure that we really do get the micro circulation weighed eight\nSo you know it's pretty amazing now all of these issues are in a really smart intervenes hemorrhage swollen to the legs eat\nThe

[noise] so I guess my question is what do I do with this money that city\nWhere do you do have the option of just leaving it and were those big companies small or in between that you were with before\nOkay so the one with Eighteen thousand is on I'm most concerned with a smaller company and I'm worried that they go out of business what happens to that money\nFor the money would be okay and the four oh one K. but if it's a small business there's a different issue and that small businesses tend to have very high cost for one case right so I was scared that all that money out\nQuickly and move it to one of the low cost providers and have an IRA with one of them the three big blow cost providers for having IRAs are vanguard Charles Schwab infidelity investments [noise]\nOkay than we have them and let me tell you something do not call the\nAdministrator of the four oh one K. and say hey I Want to um move this money out and do an iron they'll say great what address you want to send you a check never take a check 'cause what they do\nIs they would subtract thirty six hundred dollars from the check they send you and send it to the IRS as withholding and you have to make up that thirty six hundred\nIn the next sixty days or you end up paying massive tax for not being able to make that up so what you do with whoever you would go with\nIs they'll do paperwork that will move the money directly from the old employer's plan straight into wherever you're going to have the IRA\nAnd you recommend an IRA or the Roth\nIra ... I'm not here but you just you know I hear you talk about yeah I just thought\nYou said the story is you can't take money there was in a traditional four one K. and put it into a Roth without having a big tax bill\nBecause all that money they don't end was pre tax correct so you go into a traditional i._r._a. without money not a Roth IRA okay and you can over time migrate the money\nFrom the traditional to a Roth as she could afford to pay tax on money each year or you just know you got money that they are that's going to grow over the years that you're gonna have to pay tax on Sunday so let's talk about the other one the seven thousand is that in a big employers plan or small\nA it's a very large employer they're trail the stock exchange\nSo it was a big employer the odds favor that that will be an extremely low cost plan probably lower than you could find in an IRA okay\nSo ah the only exception to that would be if they have that money administered by an insurance company for them the four o one K for by a bank\nIt's it's it's it's just through one of the three that you mentioned\nEarlier and you could just leave at seven behind and move\nBy a bank it's it's it's it's just through one of the three that you mentioned\nDown and you could just leave at seven behind and move the Eighteen\nOkay and then as far as contributing to that the and you're able to contribute straight to the IRA versus trying to go through back\n... great question so let's say let's keep those simple I in fact let me let me really think about this who is the company that administers the plans for the big publicly traded company used to work for its vanguard so if you wanted to keep it simple\nUm move both of them to ban guard and an IRA\nAnd just be done with the old employers for one case 'cause if it's with vanguard the costs will be low enough as an individual anyway and then you've got the simplification of just having an IRA there and then at vanguard open a raw for any future contributions the the twenty five to grow\nIn the vanguard IRA and then you open a new account with vanguard for raw in any current or future contributions you may go into the raw\nOkay and then those can be so just so I'm Sorry I I'm not a hundred percent up to date on all these states that Iraq is post tax correct\nExactly yeah and you're already going to have twenty five grand that center pre tax account you want to have money in a post tax accountant or raw truly great to have a mix of both but tilted more towards the Roth\nThis will be a way for you to do it you simplify your wife you just have an IRA vanguard a Roth IRA vanguard old money and the IRA new money and the Roth IRA and that would be a good way for you to build up money going forward\nChris is with us on the

Epstein and Brad white they are fiduciary advisors with that scene in white retirement income\nSolutions at ... dot com is a website if you'd like to learn a little bit more\nWe've been talking today about volatility because it's a huge concern for so many people who are heading into retirement But Dave there are other risks out there as well people tend to want to get out of the markets to avoid things like volatility and all the heart Bernie can cause but\nWhat are they walking into if that's the that's the decision they make\nAnd that's a that's a great T a question you you've given me Gen and folks I just got to take it back or or or I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you a story about ... what Dave Epstein did and and and what has happened since then and and and it's going to be\nA story about inflation and why we have to be\nSo mindful of what our purchasing power is today and what could possibly be and you know ten Fifteen Twenty years from today you know the very first home I purchased was a a little twelve hundred square foot condo two bedroom over in Bay park\nHad a little peak of the day and I was twenty six years old and it costs Seventy eight thousand five hundred dollars now Gen here in San Diego you already know that you're not going to find a two bedroom or the peak of the day for Seventy\nThousand five hundred dollars is just not going to happen ...\n... that I'm pretty sure yeah\nIn in my down payment was ten thousand dollars while in my my monthly payment I if I recall correctly interest rates were much higher I think my interest rate than was like eleven and a half almost twelve percent and my payment was like Bradley was like seven hundred and sixty dollars and\nI had a a hundred and twenty five dollar a chip away and you know and I knew I could handle it you know\nWell that kind of today which I no longer own yeah because I I sold it in in ... and moved up and\nYou know maybe I followed a different tack were buying hold but by sold it and I moved up to ... and got a bigger place and but that same conduct today Bradley's about five hundred and fifty thousand dollars yeah with things and so the down payment for that on a twenty percent\nDown payment you're talking to bill hundred and ten grand versus Mike Ken yeah so what I'm Talking\nThey say and so the down payment for that on a twenty percent down payment you're talking to you know hundred and ten grand versus Mike Ken yeah so what I'm Talking folks it's obviously\nIt's we're talking I've been told an eleven fold and\nWe're talking about inflation and so forth for those Gen who are you know are are frightened of the market in a lot of people got it handed to them in a way and that was it no longer got back in\n... what's what's uh what's that saying oh Bradley ... well you know I Can't\nTake credit for this it was um another article I was reading from another financial professional and I wish I could give credit but I don't have the name but he called inflation for retirees death by a thousand cuts\nYeah I mean that's perfectly said my friends and so that's really what it is gang and so I just come back to a you know we're talking about planning\nRight well when it comes to who I think too is right we if you missed the first part of our shall we talked a lot about how the volatility in the markets is is back its presence and that's a really scary thing not just in general but in particular for retirees that if you aren't going to make the money back\nRight life anymore but what the volatility of what the fear of the markets has done and it's really started back in two thousand eight right that is such an uh an old terrain you know experience two thousand right I mean ... there's a whole generation of people that were so you know I'm just\nEmotionally attack by the great depression in the twenties that you know people that I talked to whose parents went through that they left to this day which was like oh God there's still the money you know buried in the backyard somewhere right my dad just won't trust banks ever again I mean and I know you're you know\nHow they ... and actually how they spend ... don't don't have debt right pay off your whole lifetime it is a psychological thing and that happened again in two thousand a mind altering\nIt's yes and so now what that what we've seen so much is that it's caused people to say I just don't want anything to do with it I'd rather just parked my money in the bank but while it may seem like it feels good that you're not quote unquote losing money your money's just there and safe in a bank you are losing money\nAnd a couple of different forms the first is the obvious when we're talking about which is inflation\nIf for no other reason when you invest money if for no other reason it is to make sure that you can keep up with inflation that your money earns money so that you can keep up\nWith inflation if inflation's averaging three percent per year\nLet's say you're fortunate enough to have a pension from your work or you work somewhere in that pension they're going to give you two thousand dollars a month for the rest of your life and if it's from a private company that does not typically go get it it doesn't get a caller cost of living Lenny you know hits you between the eyes with this in twenty four years that pensions cut in half\nYep because of that pension stays the same two thousand and inflation's I've seen three percent it is cut in half and twenty four year\nIt's going to feel like a thousand yup and Braley a you know you guys\nIf you're pulling you know let's say you were retiring you can you felt like hey I Need to pull a thousand dollars a month out of my my IRAs and for one case a retirement to kind of supplement Social Security and and that's what I Need\nYou better in ... you better build a plan that says you can keep increasing\nThe amount of you're pulling out of your four when caves and I raise every year it's going to have to be more than a thousand more than more than that and more than that which means your IRAs and four one K. is better be invested in a way that's earning enough money to cover that\nWhat's than what they want you to tell me because you're getting a team yeah as I Know you you have the answer what's the number one worry of a retiree you want me to you every woman and I want you to answer I guess I I I I Know running out of money running out of money\nSo if you're sitting folks on the sideline and you're sitting in cash and you're getting no real rate of return you run that distinct very clear risk\nThat that could be you know I mean if you're not getting your money to work for you right you need to get that money working for you and working intelligently and then there's ways to get\nGood rates of return without taking risks and folks you know you could create these unique buckets of money that pay you income and we will teach you about those as well there's so much air to learn and having weeks\nOf volatility like we had in January and February those months in here just recently\nYou don't have to go to bed at night worrying that you don't you're not going to have the income you're going to have the best the boldest retirement possible and we must do one thing first we must build that plan\nAnd then identifies or the right investments that are going to be the engine that runs that plan and that's what Braley and I are are giving you that opportunity to get it done leave your checkbook at home call this number\nAnd you'll meet with our team here Dave Epstein is going to call you on Monday there's going to be a nice person answering the phone if you call this number and they'll ask get your name and your phone number and I personally will call you Monday or Tuesday of of next week so here's the number\nEight eight eight five six four seven eight Seventy once again eight eight eight five six four seven eight Seventy\nTalking today with gave at the end Brad why to that scene in my retirement income solutions and Brad as we talked about some of the guy that risk it certainly inflation and something we don't want to overlook anything else you'd like to add to this conversation before we need to get to our next break\nYeah I'm just going to go maybe rapid fire a little bit here with with some solutions because I I certainly want to make a enough time for for David to um to to share all that he wants to share yeah the\n... oh that's right you have I have another David here have another David yeah I don't know why that's not our special guest David Box only fair to\nMajor and it's only been you know several years on the patio and can't keep up with everything\nAll right so what are some solutions for those of you out there getting close to retirement are already have that are worried about volatility things in the market number one is when we build an investment plan for you let's segment different parts of your money\nLet's go ahead and create maybe one maybe two years or so worth of a buffer of market so that that's where you can always pull income from when the market's down and you won't have to go ahead and make rational decisions you won't have to poll from accounts that are down\nSo we will teach you had to do that when you come in and see us and we build this for you will strategically show you what rates of return different parts of your money you need to make your plan to work forever and then therefore how much we kind of buffer and how much we leave in places like the market a second step towards that is really concentrating on diversification\nA lot of people just unnecessarily throw the word market around now like everything is all just one blob of the market to not how it works [laughter]\nThree point one five to ... percent and that's the highest rates we've seen on ten year treasuries and like seven years so that's also a very interesting thing that's happening and then there's the fact that the tech market hasn't weighed like this right let me see if\nWe see a sell off in tech stocks particularly tech stocks though I'm like Amazon and Facebook and that's not all related interest rates there's been some data breaches\nWith companies involved like Amazon a potentially data breach and Facebook's had a recent data breach so there's been some soften these tech stocks but again\nMaking putting that in perspective it's been the tech stocks have been driving the market hire companies you know we call them saying companies like Facebook and Amazon and Netflix and Google these main tech companies\nHave been absolutely on fire in terms of growing and they've been the stocks been driving the market hires the fact they've pulled down a little bit um it's not that surprising it was probably you know about time for us to see tax Sox pull back and I think the third thing that we know is affecting the market is actually the global markets that the trade wars um\nAll this talk of trade war with China is having an impact and it's been really having an impact globally\nThe global markets have been really down compared to our market like the U.S economy has just been on fire we have been absolutely crushing it we've had the best stock market in the world um and so we you know us pulling back a little bit compared to what's happening abroad\nUm it's really been a lot less like abroad the global markets been down emerging marked down and we've just been doing great so I think it was sort of time for the U.S markets maybe take a little bit of a breather to an almost a recognized that things are slowing down globally\nPartially because of the fear of these trade wars with China\nSeveral components leading to this precipitous drop on Wall street even I'm going to go back to those rising rate I Know that they can still trouble where the overall economy but aren't higher interest rates are really good for retirees\nWill you know you're exactly right they are good for retirees especially retirees by the way who pay down their debt right which is something I've talked about for Twenty years the fastest way to to reach retirement early is to pay your debt off so if you reached retirement and you and you don't have a mortgage payment you don't have a car loan\nAnd you're probably not using credit card or to borrow money if if you're doing one retirement and the good news about race going higher\nIs that the rates on your money market and your checking account and CDs and again treasuries are going higher and if the most retirees live off of the income that their retirement money produces\nSo the good news and I think they're actually a lot of good news I think I think before you know we will see tenure treasuries\n'em over three and a quarter to even three and a half percent and there's talk that the ten year treasuries could eventually get to four percent in the next Eighteen months and all of a sudden we have rights again that retirees will be able to look out and go wow you know what that is pretty good I can I can live off of those those income checks and so I think it is\nFor retirees it can actually be a very positive thing\nWe're speaking today with nine time New York times best selling author David Box well known financial educator about the recent market drops I Know people listening who are in are nearing retirement David they want to know is this the beginning of a market correction\n[noise] so I should pull my crystal ball right now [laughter] right it's funny 'cause because here's nobody knows right ... ... what I what I what I Know and\nWe've been talking about this and maybe you know I've done other interviews on this um I Know that we're we've ... we've just had the greatest bull market of our lifetime\nI I Know that have you been in the markets even after the recession hit and even after the markets pulled down if you just stay the course today you have more wealth than you've ever had and\nAt the same standpoint the last day two months I've been telling people don't get greedy right like don't now is not the time to get greedy now's not the time to get complacent\nSo it's very important if you are about to retire or you're already retired it's very important that you're not taking too much risk with your money because if you're in your fifties in the markets pull back you can afford\nTo take the time to let the markets recover but if you were retired your\n... your comfort level was seeing your money drop significantly is going to be lower so it's really important I I just can't stress enough that\nWhen you approach retirement order or you're already retired that you talked with a financial advisor that you work with a financial wise or if that if you have a financial wise right now that you\nPick up the phone and paying attention to the news which I don't recommend you do call your financial buys or go back into their office sit down with them have them walk you through what you're invested in a lot of people who are retired that might be fearful of the stock market today\nActually have a very well we call very low exposure to the stock market\nLike army people who are retired and they're worried about stocks\nFor the stock market today actually have a very what we call very low exposure to the stock like only people who are retired and they're worried about the stock market and\nHalf of their money in an annuity gave him a guaranteed re half of their money and bond and they've got a small percentage of the stock market and they're so they knew they were very you're\nSo don't be fearful find out find out how much money you actually have the mark how much risk are you taking and again or what your financial was just a big believer that\nA a working with the professional\nFisher which is what we recommend people work with the register investment advisor when you work for the financial wise or the most important part is that they do a financial plan for you that they ... they get to understand what your comfort level with risk is and then they help you build an investment portfolio based\nOn your goals\nAnd your comfort level of risk if you have a very low comfort level with any risk well then you should have less money in the ... um but the key right now it's no this one markets are pulling back like they have been the last couple of days the most important you can you can just call your visor don't panic\nSits still don't do anything\nEvery market all back ultimately has had I Can't promise I Will always out but I can tell you it's always had a recovery right every single major market pull back\n... is that a recovery and so I'm just a big long term believer that you wanted diversified portfolio high quality investment built up a financial plan working with a financial wise you can trust that's there\nTo hold your hand when it gets like this right now which is this is a rocky\nDavid fantastic insight on this market drop one silver lining here and all of this\n[noise] well I think the silver lining is how incredible when the economy we have right now like let's not leave sided look at some of the numbers right now the lowest unemployment in America in forty nine years\nUnemployment is at three point seven percent right now what is why is that because we have an incredibly strong economy right now so she didn't pay which you know two years ago you know what do you believe that you could get to three percent well most people certainly GDP right now oh first chapter here\nThree point ... percent there are predictions that the third quarter could be as high as ... percent so the economy in the U.S super strong\nAnd things really are very very positive which is why by the way also we've had stock market hitting\nAll time not so just notice the economy are strong just wasn't very normal time to see a pull back in the market if anything is probably very healthy that we're seeing a pull back in the market right now and just notice the economy's doing really well the tax cuts that huge impact\nAnd for the foreseeable future we seen economy that's continuing to grow\nDavid Bonter always a pleasure thank you for your time today more mega my pleasure thing you\nKnow if you're going to a lot of the closest during seminars from upsetting and why I Love talking to people who are planning ahead and approaching retirement and for almost everyone to sneak up on your I guess the real quick\nAnd and a lot of people realize you've got to make sure I'm making the

here do ten o'clock talking law lights and everything in between and we talk a little bit about hate crimes and and and it is from a legal perspective it's a real slippery slope I think Linda has something to say about the Linda welcome to show how you doing\nHi good to hear you well thank you that does have you call in [noise] what can we help you\nSo if I can start pat graph I said at the council meeting\nOkay ah so it's a very short going hello hello mayor and can fall I Am here to give the information I hate crimes that I have been subject to in 'em and I must say my city on the one I'm more than one occasion I had been physically attacked\nAnd gone to the sheriff's department can report is attacks and they have not taken the hate crimes seriously we know the shaft on that work for you than asking you to help me make my hate crime complaints to the sheriff's department thank you\nOkay so I have\nThe time by a certain group of people train or a size six times and they said to me before they hit me why would that Dr pick a white girl\nOkay\nAnd I signed a law enforcement and they don't take me seriously\nWomen so you've been physically attacked and did you call the police yet and the police did a report yeah and you were were you injure\nYes it probably ... ugly injured\nWell yeah there were aiming for eye surgery that I had a medical America fair to say I had done back in the early nineties and it is happening today\nA doctor that Cory Booker\nAnd of that race and um so now they're jealous and white when they are the things I'm African American women\nAll right well what are the answer is I don't I mean whether that should go to the level of hate crime I don't know a a\nFrom a law standpoint but I Will tell you technically it's a crime and and there's something fishy about this and in that you think the police if they had evidence and they believed you they would they would a follow up and do you know you said\nSix times six times you're an act\nThe past three years yes\nAll right well it seems to me that I Would go to the city council I go to the da to the prosecutors I go to the police department and and and ready to\nLike me and she doesn't like me because I um [noise] yeah well we won't get into that um well the\nThing is is that I sometimes I think that some of our lives for us that not all of them I think some of them are afraid to do anything because they're afraid that that they didn't they left that as racist that's going on in the world right now\nUm I think that the world is ultra sensitive and I think the politically correct stuff is there and and and yes I think it it certainly could be in some ways and and another way to him and then there's the opposite ways of\nOf of you know police officers you know or whether it be white or black ... but we should traditionally she white ah shoot black people without asking questions I mean we got it both ways\nSo quite frankly I I think it really kind of depends on uh the\nSituation but I appreciate to appreciate the call and let's go to Sheldon the in LA Sheldon or are you doing\nWhere they'll say there for the\nChildren who were not getting the good communication here you are on a cell phone or what\nI'm Sorry I'm here yes I'm here\nThey're not ... I hear your voice ... where you're in LA what part of LA\nI'm a mere Culver City\nAnd and you get us loud and clear on on the air or you know hey great yeah that's true I used to tell you my grandmother used to be in Culver City I remember when I grew up in LA in in the valley but what what can what are you got to where do you got to talk about\nYou know I feel for the the lady just recently um but I think it's something else to that but um my my thoughts of of what's going on today a along with everything else is that\nYes these things including police officers that we know that have been tied to you know there'd be a Nazi and everything else they shouldn't be operating as police officers go we hold them to the highest regard\nYeah I agree and and I think for\nWhen you say shows them that that probably that's still a really low percentage though\nYes it's a low percentage choking right without a doubt it's a low percentage\nOkay but I agree anybody who's got prejudice or and either acts out\nOr certainly is is really vocal about it should not be a police officer in my opinion you\nKnow and and we should\nStart making examples of any race or any ethnic people have any room to stand out and say hey this is wrong this is what was going to do we're not going to tolerate it and let ended and what makes it worse is that our president and all these things are going on and he said back he encourages his base\nTo to rally this stuff up\nI mean we have to start there if you start if you're trying to attract retreat now you take the you take that route down first inning that the top just drop\nUp I mean we have to start there if you start if you're trying to chop a tree now you take the you take that route down first inning in the top just drop\nAnd show that I agree with you to one degree and disagree a little bit more I hundred percent agree that we need to stop it you know this country\nIs eroding very quickly and and we need to stop it and and I think where we can be more influential whether you like our president or not and and and and believe that he's either feeling the fire or not you know I mean again he's got the right to to speak we also have the right to vote\nAnd we have the right now and later to do whatever we want to do to make sure that the head of our country is who the majority of Americans want to have be the head of our country\nSo I agree with you or that it's got to stop I also you know I mean look we all have rules and and you know you're right the president has a\nMaybe we can get a cup or a Republican in tears\nWell ah yeah we ... that could happen if you I guess\nI'm I'm not sure\nI think I mean what he was saying was that they're not fairly representing California in not in that sense but the there's that kind of a\nYou have the representatives where there's a lot of representative that represent the locale or its specific area that might be leaning more a Republican or a right at that time but I don't think that I\nDon't I don't know if anyone really be on board but taking a city out of state just because you want to get one particular party a few more votes than I\nAnd whether it be Democrats or Republicans you can talk about the same thing in in a you know in the south in Texas and things like that I don't know I think our system is decent with a house in the Senate I just think the electrical college doesn't work\nFor the presidency and and that kind of thing I just think that's an old fashioned and ridiculous that's just me Don thanks for the call let's go to Larry in oceanside they Larry\nI'm Jeff ... was just a great job last week\nGo I'm going to um\nYou know we're still a republic we're not a democracy right\nAh no I I I I think we are both um I we we certainly fancy ourselves as a democracy ... are we literally a democracy know do we strive to be the answer in my boy we just\nWe do our representatives and can you see us going through the ballot in having like thirty five with the proposition that California has now is just crazy and I think that's going to drive people away from voting\nAnd they just won't vote for him I think I I think people are are you know and certainly in this election\nThere's a lot of um you know there's a lot of a disaster going on right now and the energy for both sides I mean you know the Democrats are really upset the Republicans are really upset a [laughter]\nAnd and and so I think people will go to the ... the ballot box but you know like many there are some some of these crops I don't vote for if I don't know enough about it or I don't care I Know I'm probably wrong I don't I don't vote on those all vote on the stuff that I think is important to me\nYou know I I think it's so much we have to you know honest you know good people to be in a representative and now it's the guy who has the most money by going to be the representative and yeah and that's how it's pretty much been always but um\nMy one it wasn't about that every week yup\nI'm Sorry what'd you to say\nI guess that I Love your show I don't do it everywhere\nYou're the man thank you but let me just say this there have been lots of people who have tons of money Ross Perot and others who\nTried to buy the election and and didn't mean bronco Obama like them or not he was taken nickels and dimes\nI think I think also with the social media nowadays you have a a greater chance of a a grassroots kind of candidate coming through and and actually making a pretty good charge but\nThink that the the doo wop ally of the two party system is really what's holding a lot of people back because there is some\nMost people don't feel like either party fully represents that they don't know how many part is you need to do that because there's all the way you don't do that either party by that and that's what the founding fathers never wanted us to have parties and the first place so\nIt's I I think it's important for people to kind of a you know the the whole voting\nAnd that and that's what the founding fathers never wanted us to have parties and the first place so it's I I think it's important for people to kind of a you know the the whole voting as a lot of people are going towards independent and the independent party or the way from just the party system in general because they like I said they don't feel like it it really you know murders and so we always\nAlways might you know you want to vote for the individual ideally you know that's what I look\nAt a lotta people unfortunately both along party lines and I think that it's all you need to be a little bit more savvy and it can be very convoluted especially with these commercials and no one really knows like you said who's funding them or what they exactly are trying to say go to read them\nAnd and that's in and I will tell you a straight up I'm an independent it had been probably forever I think I might have been Democrat and when I was Eighteen\nOr Twenty one or something like that but it's interesting though I just want to make a quick point is that we are living at a time where information is so easily available at any point we can just look up something on her phone\nBut it's harder and harder to know what the truth is sometimes or what are you exactly so we have to do more work yet we have the most access to the most information ever\nOK ironic Larry thank you for listening thanks for the kind words in a ... and tell your friends okay I Am I'm telling everybody up or you know you're the man thanks Larry appreciate good call a let's go real quick to Brad\nIn San Diego hey Brad\n... a need another hour for a show\n[laughter] I Know we need three hour we're going to be on by the way the twenty fifth or no twenty\nSix twenty seven the December for ah Britain ... will be doing for hours since I'm In the afternoon that'll be the hour we're gonna have some great gifts and stuff but go ahead what do you got\nA couple a question of what it's all on the news this morning it was kind of ironic all they they reported that in that ... coming up that there was a kidnapping but then they changed the story or Rick corrected it and it would've happened was there was a\nFight in a line of people waiting to get food just somebody was trying to cut ... yeah\nAnd so that made me think of is how come the people that are apply for asylum the legal way ever filed a class action lawsuit or tried to to prevent people from cutting in line of thought of that and my other question is\nI looked it up I to me I don't I'm not a
