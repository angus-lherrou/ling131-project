powerful than vitamin C. it's eight hundred times stronger than co Q. ten\nIt can improve your depth perception and millions of people in Japan use it everyday to slide wrinkles and fine lines from

these people do is they guarantee lie in the case of open door and\nIts competitors they guarantee you that they'll they'll evaluate your home they may come in and they'll do that on line they may come in and do an inspection\nAnd then they will make a firm offered to you to buy your home and then with the idea of being the you've vacate really quickly typically within a month can be quicker but\nThey just by then they charge you roughly the equivalent of a real estate commission to do it they charge you about six percent\nOf all I'd say just for argument's sake they said the house was worth\nTwo hundred thousand they would pay you like one eighty eight somewhere in there and you're out and you're just going\nSo the question with any of them oh and the reason they do that is they believe that they develop systems open during his competitors leave they develop systems where they can properly price a house cat it I'm dressed up however they need to end the landscaping or inside\nAnd get it sold quicker than you can with you going to a traditional real estate agent and having them market the traditional way whether or not these things are going to\nStand the test of

legit no doubt\nThat this is a a a real thing and the company's doing this I think another one is offer pat I think is another one and there's another one called knock\nAnswer with these companies they're learning how to price they're learning how to market their learning how to sell\nAnd then they add cities around the country very heavy emphasis on the south south west and west and the reason

well let me go and sign up for this 'cause I never hurts to have a backup card Kay she made it\nSo I I when I got the cars started using it because it actually had a better cash back more than the one I was using this way so that was going fine one afternoon I got an email from the credit card companies saying well we've got your address change which obviously was a month so I called them\nStopped the card know sent me an oil and the whole smear at that point to sue the cart into the two lifestyle and started using my original art at the end\nAnd at last September this last September I got the same message from the credit card company so I call them\nThey went to the old and so they sent me a new card and then it happened again and also all three times as happened it's been a different

should offer\nLike there's an issue though that I Need to point out to you the reason the court issue or may not care as much with a business credit card\nIs business credit cards don't enjoy the consumer protections\nThen a consumer card does under pre existing law and the card act was passed after the banking scandals so the Congress carved out the exception to consumer protections for business cards so as an example\nLet's say a criminal did run up a lot of charges on your car and if they were successfully able to take it over and run up charges their credit card company with a business card can say oh well\nWe don't think they you Tom took good precautions and so we're going to hold you liable for the charges or whatever which they cannot do want to consumer car so I don't like even if you're using a card\nFor business purposes I like for you to get a consumer card and just use it in your business and pay for it from your business [noise]\nOkay so is it best course of

is the website if you'd like to learn a little bit more about Dave Brat and their team you can also find out more about Brad book\nThe step by step guide on how to retire right again that's at scene in white dot com\nGuys we said this on the show before but it is the fact that more people spend more time planning for vacation then they spend planning for retirement\nBecause planning for vacation is a little easier it's a shorter period of time and it's more fun Brad retirement planning for most of us anyway is not very much mind\nWell let me ask you this and when you think of planning for a vacation and why is that fun well because I'm thinking about all the fun things I'm going to do and when you think of retirement planning why does that sound not fun\nBecause I'm so busy worried about the accounts in the investments and am I doing this right\nBingo so this little word association game I think is really happening for ... up there right is that it's a dreary meeting about budgeting and taxes and mutual funds and right now I don't yeah I think when you were to happen\nAnd I think it reminds people of you know just you know maybe mistakes we we talked about that in that first segment but you know that you know taxes gosh you know taxes\nRight I mean your eyes or believes you know I I Hope you're didn't swear of off the road right right right I yes right when we talk about this so that's a mistake that is not what you should think of when you think of the word retirement planning\nIn fact you know this reminds me so I was sitting with a a current client of ours I think it was last week and she is been applying for a few years since his late fifties\nHe liked what he does he's happy you know he's somewhat excited to the concept of retirement planning being a few years away like most people are right it's something to be excited about it should be certainly\nUm but you know he likes that he does not stretching out about it just comes and gets his regular check ins which we love about him he's he's diligent about this stuff he wants to get a check ins and stay on track this last time though on his review he came in with a little bit of a different scenario you wanted to go every kind of it through it on me in the middle of the review and\nHe and his wife love visiting Hawaii love it\nLove visiting their love vacation in Hawaii you know and he's telling me like read as much as I like what I Do every day in the morning you know here in San Diego I'm rushing out the door and I'm rushing in traffic and I'm trying to drive fast and I'm getting in front of the other car 'cause I got to get through I Need to be and then it's just bumper to bumper here and but in Hawaii it's all about island time [laughter]\nAnd I don't know that yeah I think everybody can resonate a little bit when you when you hear island time and we all know what that means no I Know I can certainly identify with that men fact this past Christmas my family and I had a chance to go to Mary ourselves and what I told him\nYou know I Know I can certainly identify with that\nIn fact this past Christmas my family and I had a chance to go to Mary ourselves and what I told him was and by the way they've you mentioned on the first segment we talked about not feeling embarrassed that are not letting feeling embarrassed or affect you procrastinate retirement planning so I should probably call myself out here a little bit and the story\nUm even though I'm a little embarrassed by it but\nMy wife had noticed on our trip and now that I had an you know that my fingernails once and the data that um I Do have that bad and gross habit of ... and it's you know I have a stressful job we work a lot here and I just don't ever even notice I'm doing it I literally\nYou know actually just smash my hand away and I have no idea that it was even that I was doing it right\nAnd it's typically what I'm thinking through something really complicated and stressful and it's just kind of some reaction I have and so she had noticed she's like you have in bigger females once since we've been here and I you know just my fingers and never look better that as a foul [laughter]\nUm and I told him it may sound smaller silly but that's just kind of a telltale signs for me of how relaxed and peaceful I was when I was there\nAnd that's the kind of stuff that I think about for our future on when we do our financial planning I think about it being a means to an end\nTo have in existence like that\nAnd I can understand how they would love Hawaii and maybe you want to spend retirement there\nSo right there in the meeting we built out that scenario for him you know the plan initially was for him to work until sixty five because here in San Diego that's what it would take 'em for the plan to work that was how the projections worked for him\nAgain he didn't mind it but when we did the Hawaii plan and we sold their place here we bought a place for a certain price there we assess the difference for him and the cost of living made a few adjustments and it turns out it would have worked just fine even at sixty three for him\nSo he was pretty shocked to realize not only is a doable but doing certain things it's very very doable and doable sooner than he thought yeah now that doesn't mean he's going or they're going to move to Hawaii that's not the point the point is that this in my opinion\nIs what retirement plan and should be all about right I Want you to think of your retirement like a movie except right now it's a blank script\nRight today is a new day and that's our favorite thing to do your day the thing we love to do the most of the thing we love to do for you the most help you write that script that story right your retirement movie you want to ride it out the

did you realize it was important to set up your business and this way rather than a sales process\nGen and when I started in Nineteen eighty three in the business was within in a large insurance company and basically it was all about selling insurance\nYou know and and if there were other insurance companies had a better plan a better policy you couldn't go out there and and represent them that was called selling a way\nThat was actually cause for termination\nSo and I started in Nineteen eighty three learned a whole lot about insurance and in in Nineteen eighty eight I I just knew I I just needed\nTo not be a captive\nA captive a agent advisor to any one company so that's when Dave Epstein became independent in Nineteen eighty eight because I knew it was the right thing to do\nFor myself because I could sleep better at night because what was the right thing to do for my clients and as my my career evolved that that just became more important as as each month and year went by\nAs the whole industry evolved and changed interest rates changed off of events in the in the economy in the markets change you know since Nineteen eighty three I've seen a lot\nI've seen a lot Jan and uh and that's what makes Epstein and white so unique and Gen sorry I'm his own biased so special ... ... this way\nWe are independent fiduciary that is such a narrow sliver of this advisory

special standard and it is a special standard and that's to do what's in our client's best interest at all times so you know what what makes our planning here first uh uh uh what I think right number one in this community is that\nWe don't have some agenda\nAs to what we're thinking about selling a client a product before they come in trust me when I say Jan in a lot of firms that that happens

what investment is right for you unless we first have a plan built\nGet cut off took out pair of scissors and cut off thirty five years\nAnd and now he's got a hundred inches left well you know if it's possible we can live to be a a centenarian we could live to be an age one hundred but really normal normal life expectancy you know if you're if you're a man is maybe now in your early mid mid

F. M. B. [noise]\nBack to the lawyer in blue jeans on AM seven sixty KF envy\nWell come back to the lawyer and blue jeans show my name is attorney Justin Isaac I Am joined by Brad seeming with the seeming team under Kelly Williams and uh\nWe talked a little bit in the first of all week we've mentioned it in the first ... that we're going to be talking about rent control and there's a few things that are on the ballot this year that affect rent control and also you know property rights interest in taxes and things like that and\nThere's there's a lot of misinformation when it comes out there because some of these measures\nAnd Phil and also you know property rights interest in taxes and things like that and there's there's a lot of misinformation when it comes out there because some of these measures some of these propositions are carefully worded or on a [laughter]\nPurposely worded in such a way that might be confusing and that's probably done because they want to get the measure passed and usually the the legislature the you know the city council that will make sure that these measures are as straightforward as clean a clear cut as they can be but\nI'm sure everyone knows that when you step into that ballot box is always not it's not always so clear and our goal here is to discuss some of these measures to kind of clear up the murky nuts and talk about it like blue jeans lawyers do and I kind of get to the nitty gritty without having to worry and just we're waiting to the ... basically so\nBrad let's talk about this now ... ten if he could just a kind of break it down to the listeners in the most blue jeans a realtor way that you can [laughter] we'll\nWe'll do our best to make it nice and clear so you know probably this intense coming to the ballot here for the state of California and it it really pertains to what's called the ... act\nAnd the cost of ... Hawkins act has been in place since Nineteen Ninety five and restrict cities from establishing rent control um on single family and condominiums as well as a newly constructed apartments anything built in Nineteen Ninety five\nAnd the second thing it does it restricts what's called the vacancy control okay and if you don't know it rent control is rent is basically the government stepping in and saying you can only a raise the rent by a certain amount each year and it's typically based on inflation or two percent rate somewhere in that race\nIs that in the the numbers that they come to for the rent is that based on the market around them or is that some arbitrary number they come up with\nWell it it it pertains to current market rent and then moving forward okay so the increases are restricted I'm so rent control restricts the increases of a an occupant and what a landlord can do so it's a little intrusive on property owner writes\nI'm ... and it has some benefit for the for the tenants as well right they have a set amount that it can only go up by and so they're kind of protected under that the second pieces is vacancy control and that's the more ... from rent control piece that means if you voluntarily vacate a property has attendance\nAnd the uh the homeowner is getting the the the property prepared for market\nThe vacancy control actually restricts the amount that they can put it back out to a market for a can't come up to market runs an interest in and that's very intrusive and and this costs of Hawkins act helps protect homeowners and landlords in that sense right\nUm so you can't establish that more restrictive rent control and it also protects you know if you own let's say you have rental property right you own a rental home or a condominium um they can't impose rent control on you as of today\n[noise] so so you would say that costs a Hawkins is not necessarily a by legislate or rent control measure but it's more of a a\nA law that prevents a government intrusion and the property owners or decision making right right okay so\nOkay so the vacancy one I did not know about and that is pretty remarkable because you know okay look LA San Diego San Francisco are rents are out of control by see something in the newspaper once a week and I'm sure you see this all the time ... but\nWe I still believe that it's important that people have the right to kind of choose within reason of course ... what they are rents are going to be and I actually I I kind of take back with the within reason because it's their their property they can choose to rent it out whatever they can kinda get for it and it seems\nA little intrusive like you said and unfair to\nTo dictate to a homeowner what they can or cannot cannot charge\nAgreed agreed and you know we we talked to in the beginning here about what prompts ten means and let's let's be clear on that right so prompt ten\nA no vote on prop tens means that the cost of ... still remains okay a yes vote on prop ten means that repealing the Costa Hawkins act in removing those protections currently under the current law\n... which means that cities municipalities won't necessarily enact rent control but it gives them the right to do so absolutely which I Would assume they would oh I I well for the major major markets I Would assume they would\nWell here's what's interesting we have one on the ballot in national city already so we don't get to that a little bit later but measured W for national city is rent control profit or a a measure that are being presented a national city this term\n[noise] and so that okay so we're already there basically kind of jumping the gun because the costs of Hawkins doesn't doesn't get taken away than measure W can't be enforced\nWhat can subject to what's already in Costa Hawkins direct ya and exist under certain properties prior to Nineteen Ninety five and multi family property so it can exist it can't it could pass 'em but it would be subject to what the protections are under prop tanker around excuse me ...\nAll right let's get phone number out there again one hundred seven sixty five three six to one eight hundred seven sixty camp and be give us a call if you want to weigh in on this and we're talking ... ten rent control so\nAnd in fact we're talking about eliminating the protections to the property owner to give the cities they mean is the ... the ability to put in rent controls in chain kinda ... rules that might otherwise restrict the property owners\nAnd here's the big thing if costs of Hawkins goes away if this passes costs of Hawkins repealed what\nHappens is if you own a condo or a home this isn't just about the big apartment owners or or people who own lots and lots of rental property this is a you own one extra home\nAnd you decide to rent it out and you could be subject to rent control in the future and so it really affects a lot of us so that this affects a lot of people that are in I own my own home um and let's say I wanted to move out of my house to rent that someone else I might be impacting and it might mean an effect on my value as well so\nOne thing I'll point out is you know we have a housing shortage we have a housing shortage a number of units available for sale and we have a housing shortage in the number of rentals that are affordable\nAnd that's the big issue here so the bigger issue is how do we create more supply there's lots of demand for homes in San Diego ... how do we create more supply to fix this um and make affordable housing available to a larger population that wants to be here in San Diego and work here in San Diego\nAnd and does this make more housing available\nIn my opinion it does the exact opposite\nYeah and you know I I saw this in the front page of the paper to um it it goes into\nA and it goes into this exact thing about measure W and it sounds like people are already are trying to sell their properties and national city because of the\nPotential impact and uh here's a couple of quotes from a financial standpoint or to sell the property is it now or never meaning that they're anticipating measure W to go through and one thing I Do want to point out is ... Penn I looked at the polls\nAnd never meaning that they're anticipating measure W to go through and one thing I Do want to point out is prompt ten I looked at the polls there is a poll that just came out yesterday\nAnd it seems like forty one percent of voters favorite prop ten thirty eight opposed and there is a pretty significant margin of error there too but that also factors in about four percent who were leaning that way but not necessarily guaranteed so it doesn't sound like it's doing very well\nAt the at the ballots are not going to do very well at the ballots and also the people who are against prop ten seeing this article seemed to uh\nYou know allude to the fact that they have most of the money when it comes to advertising so really thirty six forty one percent kind of in their ... it doesn't sound like it's going to happen but it's still an important thing to know about especially if you are one of the undecided and uh and you know\nSay what you will we do have a short a housing shortage here but I Do think it's important that we not to make\nI'm measure W so I immediately we're seeing be the possibility of a cost Hawkins being repealed and national city jumping on this with some rent controls in some other things that they're trying to impose\nAnd I think that like I said this is going to be some unintended consequences because\nWe were talking during the break and you said how much is going to impact building and people who already have property national city their margins are going to go down to you know you do make sometimes you make a profit from renting a house out and if you are stuck on rent\nControl and you can't make those profits that you would expect you know gradually over the years you're kinda stuck\nSo are you going to\nTry and save as much money you can from each rental month or are you going to do those are\nBig wholesale changes to your property and keep it up to date or you know so that's kind of what we talked about is that you might have people who\nWho don't put as much money back into the property and the property doesn't isn't very presentable and renters then ranchers can't do anything about it because rent is controlled so you're you might have a whole slew of properties who just don't look great but it's controlled at that rent\nAnd usually the market would by itself\nMake those properties less desirable and left side the rent would go down as a result but not with this\nOh what's interesting here is that you're absolutely correct and in that landlords will have a much harder time re investing back into their own property is if they can't make a profit by improving their properties and taking great care of their attendance what's the incentive for them to to fix anything and and so what does it it drives the stock of\nAffordable inventory for renters into the ground\nAnd development wise new builders are going to have a really tough time building anything in an area like like national city is actually stops in my opinion a lot of the multi family in additional unit growth that we really need we talked about inventory supply for ... for new affordable housing\nI don't believe that this is going to help that at all yeah and one thing I'll point out I think rent control the the supporters of rent control have really good intentions I think they have great intentions in in bringing affordable housing to San Diego I just think it's a short term band aid on a much bigger problem\nUm and so finding how do we bring more supply how do we incentivize the builders to bring that affordable housing in and bring more to these different areas um one more thing I'll point out is you know national city it was interesting that we pointed out it's not the last so national city passes measure W\nThey won't be the last surrounding area that looks at it I suspect areas like Oklahoma Mesa are asking veto outlying cities of San Diego might look at this for future a future belt so it's not only the impact of national city they might have much larger implications\nYeah and I think I Do think I agree with you it's going to be it could be a domino effect I I just I'm not in favor really of allowing I I like freedom of choice\nAnd I know that we do have a housing shortage in San Diego California specifically but I I think that again the unintended consequences that that go with these\nRestrictions these measures who I mean I imagine you know just in the front page of the of the paper today they're talking about how people are already trying to sell\nIn anticipation of this so now we might see a a mass exodus of people wanting to sell out of national city any rental property and that's going to probably take the housing market in that particular area by at least a couple of points I'd imagine but like you said to you're going to have a lot of these businesses and developers who\nThe market in that particular area by at least a couple of points I'd imagine but like you said to you're going to have a lot of these businesses and developers who might not want to build in there and national said he's been making a lot of news as far as you know infrastructure and and developing their area they're they're putting a lot of parks in I saw big project\nI'm that's out on the water I Believe too but you know we might see a slow in that growth because of this measure and while it's noble in its cause\nIt might have the lasting impact that they don't want which is just slowing everything down and kind of backtrack and all the progress that they've made\nAnd and I would agree with you I I I think there's a lot of these unintended consequences that that we aren't looking at in the big picture yeah um you know it's it's interesting as you read through the actual measure and get down to the details there's some really interesting things that are in there and and one of which being you know relocation costs so if you're a homeowner and you only one of these properties\nAnd we actually have a client who who recently ... sold the property under rent control in Los Angeles\nAnd he really just wanted to sell it and move on and um because of the length of time of\nHis tenant and the fact that they were a senior in the property and they they had been there for so long under market\nUm he had a duplex and had to pay over twenty seven thousand dollars and relocation costs\nJust to relocate the tenants out of his property that was his that he wanted to sell and so\nYeah it might be nice short term for that tenants but the impact that that has on a on a homeowner on someone who is trying to sell small property as massive in an evaluation differences is huge to sort of our home on who should really look at this yeah um and be be real serious about what the facts are\nWell segue from that let's talk about ... five and we have a few minutes before we have to go to break but a ... break it down for us if you could\n[noise] so ... five is basically a rewrite of a current proposition that's already in place right we've got prop Thirteen which in California's is a nice nice thing that we have yeah we do we\nChris and I discuss this a few weeks ago and we will I Know we will in the upcoming months too but carry on\nSo so prop Thirteen is basically a limitation on um a property taxes for California homeowners so um it's based on your market value and he purchased the home and it's fixed with incremental increases about two percent per year at a maximum um for all homeowners in California and property owners as well\nUm one thing that's out there is prop sixteen prop Ninety so prompt sixty in Ninety allow one for a transfer of your tax base if you're over fifty five\nSo if you're over fifty five years old right now under this a prop Thirteen you can reduce or you can you can sell your home and purchased another one at a that's a lesser value instilled carry on your tax base to the next property which is really nice said as you\nGet a one time exemption for that and it also covers um other natural disasters or other reasons why you would need to move but the the the large majority of people that use that are fifty five plus and use at one time\nThis rework of it would actually give the ability so one thing that's very restrictive in it it doesn't allow you to buy a larger property or something of greater value so if you decide that you want to move up\nYou have to meet the brand new tax rates at the new property value [noise]\nUm and you know we've we've dealt with it for a long time I don't think it's the end of the world but what's nice about that is I mean with people all the time that can't sell they don't have the ability to sell and buy something else because their tax rate might go from twenty two hundred dollars a year to ten thousand dollars a year if they decide to move on to the next ... yeah\nAnd I'm I'm all for relieving than number than the amount of inventory in any of these proposition how much inventory can we bring to the market [noise] um so that we can kind of relief some of these other a tight areas in the market\nAnd and one of the things if I'm correct me if I'm wrong about five is the ability to transfer your tax basis to other\nCounties and they have to accept it because I Know in you know there's only a few county on not ... but there's I think fifty who I should know the fifty eight counties in California\nUm and you can't transfer your your tax basis to every county there's not reciprocity in every county but there are in the sun and if I'm if I'm Bad believe him right on this that prompt five makes it where they do have to accept your tax basis in every county\nIt's a state wide proposition so ... so the\nProp Ninety as what currently covers you under those counties I'm the exact number I Believe is it's under twenty I think it's somewhere in the Thirteen rain that reciprocity has rest frog I've currently so and some of those are going away you know like one coming up the end of this year is actually going to go away so if this passes allows\nYou anywhere in the state and transfer that tax base whether you sell for more or yourself or less\nAnd there's actually will will be a new calculations so the calculation will will be based on your current tax base and then the difference of what you sell your property for there to what the current property is worth\nSo if you sell property for seven hundred and you buy for five fifty mhm you'll have a reduction in your tax amount in taxes and if you go up yourself for seven hundred and you you buy for a million you'll pay an additional cost for that difference but not the whole thing yeah\nAnd that's kind of interesting it it gives a little bit more freedom of fifty five plus a occupants to move it gives them that freedom we have all this aging baby boomer population it\nGives them a little bit more freedom to be closer to family yeah or to make the moves that they need\nTo less restrictions on them yeah basically this would be the a ... for for senior citizens and people who qualify under sixteen ... I'll be careful making that [laughter]\nI'm just looking for like some kind of comparison but it seems like what it does is it makes it less restrictive on people who might you know have a little bit more of a restrictive lifestyle anyways\nSeniors you know they're they don't have as many options as younger people do and they might be on a fixed income and things like that so we it's I think it's a I like it I think it's a good measure\nSo um I'll probably well\nWe'll see I'm looking to reveal who I'm voting for but I did look it up we do have fifty eight counties here so I'm pretty happy that it was correct on that but we do have to go to our last break here uh this is the lawyer blue jeans show my name is attorney Justin Isaac with Brad semen from the scene in teen and we'll be back right after that [noise]", "show_name": "Armstrong & Getty", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "21"}
