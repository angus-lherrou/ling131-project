have to deal with\nJust talking about the importance of supporting our bullies because of what goes on out there that's the kind of crap they were dealing with today in the capital as you have the protesters and again from a political movement standpoint\nWho doesn't want to be part of that is what I Believe ideology and by the wayside for a moment one of the things I've never been able to get my brain around\nHow especially young people go yeah those people make a lot of sense you know what I should be due I should be part of that now\nLet's be real for a mom and a lot of those folks in D.C are are ... ... they're paid these are folks who don't have lives the rest of us we got to work we have lives\nAnd we uh you know go about our business letter the day and go oh okay that's what the losers were up to today yes those are the losers were up to today the losers that go out there and they get paid and in many cases they end up getting paid more\nIf they are willing to get arrested so yes they ... they are those people but nevertheless just in terms of winning hearts and minds it's fascinating\nNow us uh segments talking about police talking about law enforcement and we've had obviously this immigration debate going on for ever and a seemingly no resolution and so I [noise] but the other um aspect of\nThat conversation that often is April ... ... refugees and I have long had\nMy focus on refugees\nFor a couple of reasons one is principal and the other the implications of refugees\nNow a lot of was made though it wasn't big in the news cycle because obviously we know what the news cycle has been\nBut a lot was made that we ended up having the fewest refugees in decades at least since Nineteen Seventy five according to the state department oh my gosh we're not importing you know even more people are into the United states and paying for all that to happen or it according to PBS at the end of August\nOnly Nineteen thousand eight hundred and Ninety nine refugees had been brought in the prior eleven months compared to forty five thousand ... dissipated oh my gosh and that was a bad thing right\nAnd then they went on to talk about how we're only anticipating three thousand being brought in next year oh my gosh that's just terrible now here's one is often not discussed the\nImplications the implications when are we going to be compassionate to Americans before we try to be compassionate to the rest of the world\nHere's the way this works what you're not told\nWe as taxpayers pay to bring the refugees into the United states average cost him to be around fourteen thousand dollars per refugee and according to the center for Immigration Studies a typical immigrant guess what happens when they get here where they live on government assistance for a minimum of five years\nAnd the average by your cost per refugee sixty four thousand three hundred and Seventy bucks that\nYou're ready to hear how much it costs to relocate a refugee into a say so if we get involved a thousand fifty seven bucks so we can actually relocate rightfully say he for refugees into safe zones without importing them into the United states\nAnd by the way Ninety One percent of refugees we bring into the United states end up on food stamps and sixty eight percent also ended up receiving ongoing welfare other programs made available now how compassionate is that\nToday we found out that we have the lowest unemployment rate in many decades three point seven percent\nHow is it that we made progress with those that have been long term unemployed those that had the toughest time those that were not as educated that more skilled how have we made improvement in young unemployment anybody ever think that maybe cracking down on illegal immigration\nAnd not bringing in refugees to compete for entry level work might make a difference\n[noise] something that's never discuss back on June seventh of last year I actually made the case for how it could happen\nAnd we have seen over the past year plus exactly that is it anywhere near the entire reason no but it absolutely is part of the reason people automatically suggests that we have a responsibility and that kind of cost\nTo import people in to compete against the most vulnerable in our society\nIs you're really cared about the most vulnerable in society [noise] you'd give them the opportunity to ask what Donald Trump has been doing his policy once again\nOmission is the most pervasive form of bias in the ...\nThe form of bias in the media\nStories one side of the fact I'm Brian mud and for the right one article\nI enjoy helping my listeners like Nathaniel who owe the IRS tens of thousands in back taxes he told the Irish they didn't have the money to pay but it didn't matter they put a lean on his home anyway it's an annual heard how much I respect optimal tax relief\nWhat you don't hear the for cops that have been killed in line of duty over the past week and their families the widows kids without fathers that's what's real\nAnd if not for us then then who's going to be so as a again every cop is a good one now hundreds of thousands almost all of them are and God Bless them because of now for them where or any of us are any of us\nAnd uh let's see I I Believe we're actually getting in right now on the line that the police officer oh go ahead and go right to you you get to the front of the line because you're another\nThe police officer want to hear from you in go\nAnd see how are you tonight hey doing well\nFantastic now I just wanted to comment that I have to agree with all your saying I've been in law enforcement now for six years and [noise]\nIt's especially with coming from my department you you just see it face to face 'cause we are in a college town itself so\nI'm everything that the media puts out towards is you're definitely feeling it especially from that younger generation who only been taught that way and it's like one interaction after another where you're trying to change that\nGod Bless you man and are the folks who serve with you um you know there is one thing I'll tell you in a again I Do the series down here in South Florida every week\nI Will tell you that there is a lot of support\nKind of like the silent majority that came out and made Donald Trump president elected more Republicans top to bottom the United states of America in twenty sixteen than at any other point since Nineteen twenty eight\nOf us out there are a lot of good folks that that really do get it in bed do support you and I know just often isn't depicted in the media and certainly with many politicians but but the stay strong and and thank you guys were all you do or certainly is appreciated\nBy we'll switch gears go back to senator Collins and her big day Joe in Gainesville, Florida Joe do [noise]\n[noise] Hey Joe [noise] do Europe [noise] alright\nJoe you're you're you're up let's go to Glen in Springfield, Illinois Glenn go\nTo Brian or can you hear me good yeah we got ya\nOkay have paid for taking my call and thank you for all that you know\nI'm I'm call on a\nCentral Illinois I'm proud to say that Springfield is my home town that's where I'm calling from but I'm I'm afraid to say I'm not proud of it was from my home town of\n... I heard some of the comments that he made the other day a face to face to Brett Kavanaugh and I was appalled\nAh that's\nThere's no uh respect there no oh I Know a professional demeanor now and I think that Dick Durbin and and and I'm saying I Want to his constituents Springfield, Illinois picture of an old saying that apology\nNo doubt and I I I credit Senate for college it's refreshing that she took the time to sit tight with this man and get a one on one card I kind of a conversation with\nThat I gave her credit for that no doubt she\nHer find this moment and uh you're absolutely right about Durban in all the others I think I mean how many politicians are we we started with Chuck Schumer\nToday and be Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegation a line [laughter] he before we heard or anything from from Christine Ford before we had any\nBacks present it said that he believes her and what happened in this country in part because of people like Dick Durbin because of people like Chuck Schumer who said that they believed her\nThat's all part of the damage that was done in this country to go to Anthony in New York Anthony go\nAnd how would you call it is very much for your for your great show\nUh I just wanted to say I'm finally proud of\nRepublicans I'm an independent but I'm really family proud of the Republicans they started fighting\nProbably they started fighting back uh it looks like a karate kid number three hundred or when you don't mention the Trump goes out not to take a bath we had to fight back against the early age\nAnd the Democratic definitely didn't expect dish so they they they got they got it handed to them so\nYou got an interesting take here this is not something that's been advanced it at least in my presence before I'm I'm interested if you get your take you saying that potentially Donald Trump being Donald Trump may be provided the\nNecessary Jews for Chuck Grassley to figure out that he's not washed job for Susan Collins to go holy cow I Do have the backbone for Lindsey Graham do I don't know it actually attempt to be Spartacus is that kind of what you're you're talking about here\n... really because I mean if you remember when Trump Card every time every time you were saying everybody everybody would go to Iraq\nAnd now they're all coming back and they're standing up and I mean it's amazing I mean I get Lisa Murkowski or that could be eyes and then turn around and went to step in it\nBut uh it's okay she I actually I should say welcome to once you once you get thrown out of it or not elected again so we'll see how that goes as far as the rest of them do finally proud of them standing up and doing the right thing\nArguably Walmart deserves better but I appreciate that that's a really really compelling thought a good call Anthony in New York there but stay in New York for a moment let's go to Frank Frank spin extremely patient of Frank go\nYes uh Ryan but ah I just like to say a lie or support or the confirmation of a justice Brett Kavanaugh but I just want to find out I I've been thinking about this the whole entire week what's wrong with these Democratic senators how\nCan they keep believing the stories that from the\nFrom the lady uh but actually they actually don't know what the procedural issues are in the Senate if they don't understand what they're talking about when they're accusing of Brett Kavanaugh of things they have the actual physical evidence in regards to miss the capital had showed every bit of evidence he's proven where the timeframe where he's been\nAnd what he has done throughout his life and they continually for some reason\nTo believe that what they hear from this woman is actually true let's say whether it is or is it\nBut I Believe I'm Sorry a a missed the money I make five boroughs democratic where we're from the city of New York I have a different understanding of different things but I I feel very sad that these Democratic senators Congress or confused\nIn regards to what they're thinking feel about Brett Kavanaugh as a whole I think they should give this guy won the last month and then we will see if they were right in that role they should actually think about resigning\nInteresting a very interesting call their oily and I understand given your political disposition why you're inclined to travel down to bad they've given them one more chance\nMy my daughter will ultimately is a bit more of maybe cynical which is you know they have it be by any means necessary and you know politics from Seoul no pun intended\nBut the interesting I just specially coming from Democrat to hear that on principle you think there comes a point and we're close to it to where these people should resign alright I Am by mud in for the great one\nHere's the

western Wisconsin we can even include the Detroit area under a wide swath of heavy rainfall potential today the north east mid Atlantic\nA behavior a pattern of behavior by the left that's being very clearly demonstrated over and over again\nAnd I remember uh other you know intense times that were based on a particular issue and uh for example after the twenty sixteen election when when uh a W was talking about uh you know the bridge loan mhm\nUh and you had an end even before that right or before the election or you had the the the passion when they talked about a bailout and right on ... but that wasn't unification there were people there was an intensity there\nThat existed McCain fined gold you and I were working together yeah McCain Feingold McCain Kennedy right right or the immigration bill mhm that was a that was a that's when they you know blue the phones out of the ... of Capitol Hill you remember that when I\nRead that was on a specific topic yeah I did ...\nSame thing right that's yeah titles are short lived yeah sure sure like this this is different because it is about Kavanaugh ... but it isn't just about Kavanaugh right this this this isn't about this isn't really about Trump\nAnd reading right here it says but rather than a Wall Street journal or interesting that they write this the same day that you know you do the same week that you know you and I are having the same thought going while it was the never conservatives the capping off fight isn't about Trump we're all deplorable now ah and it says you look at you know talks about the cabinet\nIsn't part of you know a isn't part of the whole Trump ism thing\nRight he's he suffered from that can believe that we talked about how many never Trump or as we mentioned this last week how boom I said ooh wow all of a sudden they are absolutely\nAnd in supportive of a cabinet and furious and I haven't talked about the never Trump or is that I Know that it builds alliances with Democrats because of their hatred towards Trump and now they're fighting with each other\nBecause when it comes down to it\nWell except maybe for Bill Kristol [laughter] the one to one old out except for except for Bill Christ that I haven't seen anything from George Will and it's like ... yeah exactly so you know they're not part of the ... he he's not some of their rights and he's done some Steve Bannon insurgent\nAnd the judge is the epitome of the G O P legal establishment a Supreme Court nominee from central casting\nAnd it and you know and it's a great point spent twenty six years in public service and the hope what what and that's why it's not about him what I think it would I think it is and I think it's bigger than just Cavanaugh I think it's the realization from\n\n... from a I think you're the realization from a lot of people that don't like Trump yeah\nAnd don't like where the Republican Party is going where they've realized\nA we've got to come home for a while because those people are insane I Know a case you're Cortez yesterday said the writers insane or we'll go through whether she actually had any substance to that but when we talked about the many things out there when you see what what are the left is doing to Kavanaugh when you see the presumption of ...\nWhen you see the presumption of innocence is is gone when an allegation itself is enough to destroy someone's life\nThis goes beyond a political issue it goes to what one Trump the election it is the it is the culture war but it's also and and and I say a culture where because it's a war on\nIt it's it's about it's about fairness\nIt's about the belief in the constitution look\nWe don't we were never tremors we've criticized Trump when we were we were never on that never I never got about ... we voted for\n... you and I don't practice political high dollar tree we don't worship anybody you're not going to see us at rallies going ra ra ra whenever my candidate does we will tell you who was the best ... well you know who has the best idea and what particular issue and why\nAnd we end up voting for the person who most reflects what we believe not everything that we believe because that would be impossible as and as adults\nWill see that with ... [laughter] [laughter] I think I Would only vote for air as I read Rick Perry and one of his was one of his first interviews after dropping out of the elections when he was extreme you know well uh you know I guess he wasn't your first choice tilting interviewer will know my first choice was me [laughter]\nAnd and so I I think when when you see that that ... it it's just been it's been brought back to ... going on and many of them who started making alliances with people on the west yeah\nYou know trying to build these emotional as I saw on social media from some of the people but I Know that are numbered Trump hers but all of a sudden the brakes have been put ongoing whoa you'd really do this\nI mean you really ... this is what you really we while\nWhat will you know we thought you know this is an almost like the McCain funeral what we thought that there were actually people out there in the Democrats' side they don't want it to come together to find that common ground that we have and now the realization is no they don't and and I think a lot of people this is a wakeup call look the party isn't perfect\nCat if you listen to the show you know when we talked about the Republican Party [laughter] or or listen to the pocket from yesterday showed [laughter] but the the the party isn't perfect but again everything's\nWhen you get to the point of the actual election it's a binary choice mhm it's a choice between this group and that group neither perfect so what do you do you look for the best one\nAnd I think that's what a lot of uh never Trump or is looking at right now saying\nWhoa ... know who you know when when um oh ... who was it uh I'm trying to think of the the the the person\nOh oh yeah yeah it was a member it was Glenn Beck who said he couldn't vote for Trump rather vote for Hillary\nRight yeah ah I thought this would because I I I saw that a a Shapiro interviewed him or he interviewed Shapiro or something like that and I saw it on social media are a lot of people furious same excuse me he said don't vote for Trump vote for Hillary\nAnd and that kind of you know that kind of thought process doesn't exist right now well except for Bill Kristol a and\nAnd uh that uh Jonathon ... they're at a ... on Fox News on the on the the the money block and I think Fox businesses as well he was one of those otherwise\nConservatives that when it came out with the I'm with her remember that yes hash tag I'm with her right\nYeah by the way that was after\nThe the the house report the house GOP report the eight hundred page report\nOn ...\nYeah so I I think that's you know what's happening so again or you look at that and you say wow liver looks for Republicans then I see this Washington Examiner or which is a for anybody to know a very conservative outlet\nGOP gloom Republicans predict house majority will be swept away by democratic spending to nominate\nFive weeks before the critical mid term elections House Republicans are

Carter right need the I Believe it was both of them that did the story on the Pfizer courts rebuke in the Obama administration this goes back to ... way back in May of\nOf of twenty Seventeen well his story goes to the specifics of it and the specific of the allegation will get into the the the details of it but here it is just the first line congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met with Democratic Party lawyers that's Perkins Kuwait\nYou don't ah you you've got to be careful I guess which way you go keep in mind in the house things may be working for Democrats according to the polls maybe right now but in the Senate\nThere's a lot of close races and there's no one no talking about a blue wave in the Senate so you have to assume that McConnell still going to be in place or in the new year but the point being\nA Democrat doesn't want to go out and blatantly violate that rule\nAh because they know internally that's going to create a lot of problems for them going forward\nI'm not saying they won't do it but but uh there's a huge disincentive for them to to to do that but you probably could see them saying look ... and it it's going to be that it's already this from the liberal media or NBC News on on Wednesday\nWell there are dozens of people thousands of people I think they said over forty people that have said that that that have ah have information at potentially they could be witnesses that's one of the words they use potentially and their story or that that could help substantiate all these claims and blah blah blah\nThat's not how this works they don't get to control that but the but nonetheless that will be the narrative and you'll probably see a couple of senators or during the day on Thursday or friday more likely on friday as they try and hold up an elevator doors open\nThey're going to try and and block they're saying this was not enough the the we need of a greater background check they did an interview enough people uh they didn't talk to Ford or\nThere's new allegations that are coming out yeah uh that are uncorroborated too so we need to investigate them since there is no cooperation we need to find the ... I mean it's going to go down to the ... but I I I Do believe that\nBecause the uh Republicans most likely want to abide by the rule that Democrats will do everything they can\nTo claim for example is Adam Schiff has done all along and Adam Schiff perks and not on this but Adam ships and who will be talking about\nUh the whole of Russian collusion investigation coming up in the bomb shell or out of a of out of DC uh yesterday about the James Baker mhm uh apparently telling the house or the house uh uh I don't know which panel it was\nBut uh in in test closed door testimony yesterday telling them\nTestimony yesterday telling them he talked to the Democrat the Democratic national committee's lawyers right before they got the warrant right and and and James Baker top FBI official\nAt that time which without question shows that politics played a part any talk to them about\nWhat was going on me talk to the DNC lawyers about the Trump Russia collusion investigation that was going on which is absolutely the wrong thing to do right\nNow you cannot nobody can defend that in an investigation so it's getting to where you and I asked questions over a year and a half ago is this where this is going and we ... you know what I'm saying is every question that we asked\nAbout where this were what might have happened here in what they might be investigating every single thing that we asked the question on has come true\nIt is it's all come out in a in a series of reports you know if you look at it did it work well at least it's it's there has been people the media has looked into those questions I guess we can say right\nUm that well first of all one of the first questions the big question really\nWas there a potentially is there are we looking at\nPossibly a gross abuse of power\nUnder the previous administration that that uh a person or persons knowingly used false information to which is the Giuliani pointed out you know there's a there you have it there's your your your perjury\nUm but they they in soliciting for that uh Pfizer court warrant\nAnd we'll get to that coming up falling off the top of the hour my point that Adam Schiff has do Adam Schiff\nHas claimed for the longest time that there is collusion their ... and since we can't see it he's able to claim that there's collusion and out of the feeling the Democrats do the same thing here claim that there is evidence yeah I Know in this because Republicans won't release it so they won't release it and they know the Republicans won't release of because Republicans\nYou know a ... ... ... ah in the in the Senate want to keep a this ruling affect that hey we can't be black but not every\nBackground check we do have every ... of of every judge we're not going to do that\nAnd so I Believe they'll use it to their advantage and may forced to Republicans to release it here and the next couple of days I Believe that will be one of the tactics that we will see tomorrow I Wish you and I could finish the show here\nIn the next twenty minutes and we could just repeat the ... the first two hours the rest of the show go home get some sleep and then wake up at seven AM so we can be up all day tomorrow because I really don't want to miss any of what's going to be going on but in the ... I really think that you may see that let's head right do you go to mark his in Virginia\nMarcus welcome you're on run I Radio Welcome to the show high [noise]\nHow're you doing [laughter] hey I just what you were saying Adam Schiff should be investigated I think he's been a leak in the old time he may into [laughter]\nI Know yes I mean well I don't know if you ask for it right we all believe yes I mean I grew up in a a whole family a Democrat my whole life and even even my father lifelong Democrat my sister my brother and all everybody [noise]\nThey're they're like totally disgusted with what has happened with the Democratic party there I and I don't think it's going to last I mean they they uh\nOverplay their hand well they went off the rails said\nThey did but keep in mind markers and and and thank you for the call we all share is a\nBig big old there hey my I got two kids in college and fake socialism the greatest thing in the world\nOh sure and and that's what's going to keep the insanity alive that's why it's not really there I don't see them coming back from where they are a because this is now the mainstream the mainstream has to follow look [laughter] uh it doesn't matter a who's a protester is what the causes\nThe party the protestors the far left\nNow leads the party they leave the media they're very active in the media like they're part of the media you know that's what the ah you know they were saying former CNN officials or or or management uh including Ted Turner\nAre saying they become a CNN's become too political and Jeff Greenfield coming out saying who used to run CNN coming out saying you know it's these the people at CNN believe they are part of the anti Trump resistance their activists as we've we've known for a while but\nThis is not going to change it's not going to and they're not going to they may have overplay their hand here but what they'll tell us we didn't do enough\nWhat they'll tell you as we didn't wrap it up enough\nAnd even if he's confirmed this weekend\nAnd we move on from this don't believe that they're empowered\nBecause they at least got the delay got they got they got the supplemental background check done and all of that they put the pressure on Trump and and they were able to manipulate Trump and the Republicans although it's Jeff Flake and that's that's going to be\nAround it but on the the other side they're going to know\nOr that they're in they're in trouble because you because of the Supreme Court at this point then you have\nA a a five four maybe not on everything that would be viewed as originalist store construction as far as they call it conservative which would I think is mislabeled ... of it but they will ah ah you know it's going to if they know\nThat if Trump is reelected in twenty twenty that's why I think they're going to go up up the insanity or whether they win or lose any seats or whether they take over the house or whatever there it's going to be pure insanity from now till twenty twenty\nBecause they know that if there's in between now on twenty twenty if there's a Supreme Court a seat that opens ... we've seen how insane it's been now where they're promoting the fact that there is no presumption of innocence right [laughter] well I mean this is where they are right now so far where they go\nWho knows but they don't ... I Can't\nI don't think they can imagine Trump being president until twenty twenty four because then there's a possibility of two more Supreme Court seats that was your civil they moderate their message in order to maybe be able to win or will they just up the insanity for the next two\nYears yeah the uh the Trojan Horse a tactic oh we'll\nJust moved to the middle a little bit in order to gain power right which is what they used to do\nThat's what I said yeah they pretend to move yeah middle ... eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nBucks more red are ready to do with a record ...
