new condo a program filled with professional strategies tactics and advice on what condos are all about and whether one might be the right move for you\nAnd right now let's take you to one of the most competitive markets in America Chicago where the condo market is red hot\nJoining us now is Rebecca Thompson real tour and principal with Thompson real estate group in Chicago Rebecca is a real estate pro who worked for buyers and sellers every day and she was also the president of the Chicago association of realtors Rebecca welcome to\nOur years in sellers every day and she was also the president of the Chicago association of realtors Rebecca welcome to real estate today\nThat much for having me on the show glad to be here\nWe are so glad you're with us so Rebecca how's business in Chicago\nOh this is great we still have sunshine temperatures are still nice and hot so the market is still moving\nThat is awesome so Rebecca in your experience what kind of buyer beware single family homes and skip the town houses and instead buys a condo in Chicago\nCondo living is about two things the location and convenience show somebody wants to live right near the financial district or they're looking to live right along the river right along the lake front\nMost likely they're going to be in a high rise but maybe they don't necessarily need to be in one of those areas they're looking at single family homes they're looking at condominiums they're looking at town house they have a lot of options\nOut there thinking about carrying that stroller or just those groceries up and down three flights of stairs or two flights of stairs parking in the garage and having to walk outside to get inside through that still\nThat may be the prime candidate for a condominium someone who is looking to have maintenance on site\nSome buildings even have grocery stores gyms onsite except for the condo buyer in Chicago it's somebody who is looking to being a location that may not have any single family homes or someone who's looking to have every single one stop never need to leave\nSo interesting location inconvenience [noise] now in many parts of the country the lack of inventory is a big problem is that also the case in the condominium market in Chicago\nYeah Chicago's single family homes and kind of any markets are both down we've seen in the story even just the last month we saw another five percent decrease in in ... so it has been a challenge\nTo a farm in the market for a condominium and say it's a starter level condominium so your studio or a small one bedroom am I going to have a tough search on my hands\nGet difficulty the search is always dependent on where you're looking so if you're looking for a studio or a one bedroom some markets like the west loop\nYou're going to be hard pressed to find something because that's one of the neighborhood where we're seeing in the story very low light companies have come in there people are excited especially in that duty a one bedroom option\nThere wasn't much inventory to begin with now if you look further north further west further south there definitely are other options but it all depends on where you're looking\nAnd also what type of place to look for if you want to be in a high rise or if you want to looking at three flats\nUh well yeah that makes sense so in many of the major cities in America or condo purchase or has a certain amount of time to examine the condominium documents the finances of the condo association\nThe rules of the association and more and if they don't like what they see they can just walk away from the deal is that how it works in Chicago also\nJesse Chicago we do have an attorney review period\nThat overlaps it's typically that first five to seven business days after they go under contract during which the seller is required to turn over all these shows the Asian document that way they can see did assessments go up are there any specialist essence plans for the building\n[noise] those are the kinds of things that any perspective on by I Would want to know before getting themselves into a protest\nIncreasing and that is not a time to just kick back you got to really keep a close eye on the calendar to make sure that if you do have an issue you get in within that timeframe\nAbsolutely but that's the important piece about working with a great realtor and a great real estate attorney they're going to help that prospective buyer keep on top of that\nYeah they will so Rebecca in a super competitive condo market like Chicago where there aren't enough condos for all the buyers out there how does the buyer when\nThe first step is to talk to your realtor about what you're looking for ourselves as somebody who's working with me\nI'm going to sit down with them and find out the ins and outs everything they're looking for\nThey want something very specific and so when we find that we're looking of course on the law but there's also\nPocket lifting resources so either within their company or there is in the case of Chicago there's something called the private lifting network that is off the MLS but actually a part of the multiple listing service and read that services the Chicago area\nBut then they its challenges\nThat buyers availability is even if you were working with me and let's say you had to go out of town and we see that right place pop up as a pocket listing\nWe don't have three days until you get back in town alive even use my cell phone and we face time and you get to walk through the property with me that way and that's feels like the one we can pull the trigger then\nUsing face time that is awesome what Rebecca I really appreciate you being on the show today and talking about how to win in the competitive condo market of Chicago Thank you [noise]\nEven thank you pleasure talking with you as always\nYou to Rebecca Rebecca Thompson real tour in principle with Thompson realistic group in Chicago and the president of the

professional economists journalist\nOr industry expert and asked them tough questions designed to help you have a complete understanding of some of the most complicated areas of real estate\nAnd today we're talking about the appraisal appraisal problems you have a signed contract but the appraiser says the house isn't worth the money the mortgage and the whole transaction is on the line\nWhat can a seller do and how about the buyer let's talk about the appraisal with a pro joining us now is Jamie more real tour and appraiser with Jamie more appraisals in Warwick Rhode Island\nJamie ... past president of the Rhode Island association of real tours and currently serves as NPR's regional vice president for the New England states Jamie welcome to real estate today\nThank you for having me Stephen we're glad you're here so Jayme if I'm selling my house and it appraises lower than the contract price can I appeal even though that means on telling the buyer to pay more in the bank to lend more\nActually quite honestly the buyer typically is the one that appealed it and it's interesting because you you're you're thinking well I'm trying to tell the buyer they're overpaying and they get mad at you because\nAnd it's interesting because you ... you're you're thinking well I'm trying to tell the higher they are paying and they get mad at you because they want that house and they were afraid to sell or it's going to shake it you know not let him now\nThat's interesting so the buyers the one the appeal that's awesome\nCase was fat\nAnd I can understand in some situations because and this is actually in markets where there is not a lot of property for sale that's reasonably priced for the first time homebuyer and property that we're seeing kind of\nCreeping up in value these days you know the one that eventually property there's lots and lots of those and they were more and more people\nIn the marketplace trying to buy those property the prices are creek and sometimes they're creeping up higher or or faster than we can porch with the appraisal because there's not a lot of fields and the area yeah and that they are\nYeah it's always a good idea when you're in a situation like a landlord tenant relationship that you die apple coverage you know I think about renting a property\nLike they've met you know you do become a business owner and the landlord\nSo what that means if you want to be prepared for something terrible like a last ditch and if you don't have enough coverage on that land more talented you can also get a caller Marshall liability towel they're just like if an individual you might have a personal\nUmbrella policy such a thing all they're\nIn a business setting so that the Marshall umbrella policy that would really give you a lot of extra protection and I am a landlord and that's something that I've only done to make sure that I got enough commercial liability protection and take anything\nCame back to me and take our ever involved in a lot of heat which thank goodness has never happened\nBut if it were to happen\nI Would know that any large amount I could I could get that coverage I had to hire an attorney or had to pay out damages if I were found it fall in the last ...\nMore of that is great advice for anyone who owns property whether it's a condominium are not frankly thank you for joining us on the show and

buying condos all across America from first time buyers to empty nesters to invest condos are red in today's real estate market\nOne of those buyers will have to make a key decision before they buy should they get a home inspection after all if you only own from the paint in what's to inspect\nLet's ask a pro joining us now is Nick ... co founder of inter not cheat the world's largest home inspection trade association Nick welcome back to real estate today\nI'm Glad to be back on it if we are buying a condo\nQuestion number one should we get a home inspection\nAbsolutely following up personal gets um instruction on a regular residential home we should also going to expect someone you buy a condo\nThat's interesting because in most condominiums the owner of the unit is not responsible for the roof or the structure of the building they don't have a basement and usually the pipes and electrical are also covered by the condo association so again what is there to inspect in a condo\nDon't let the square footage for thinking that there's a lot less touched by just because the square footage is the last eight but he still has many of the same system so it's\nA regular house passed on top of that money Congo fires are empty nesters and so on but there's also look for safety issues at a particular show you the elderly\nSo you want to make sure that condominium is they\nStart looking like trip passer ... maybe tile comes in contact with a carpet there might be a little left there maybe get the flush out the door I looked at the smoke detectors for instance the electrical outlets switches to make sure that their state\nAlso look for ... out of the condo so if there was a time or you'd have to leave a condo in an emergency\nWe want to elect our clients about how they would accept the building that we would probably even walk from ... stimulated accent of the building case there was a fire or some issue where they had to evacuate come down to the emergency exits\nThough I Know that one of the main purposes of home inspectors is to save the buyer money in the long run and in a condo probably the most important component would be the heating and air conditioning stack I imagine that's a big part of your inspection\nAnd it's been something what am I working right that the filters clean stuff to make a difference in terms of energy efficiency\nSo you'd be telling your client about how all that ac unit is how much life expectancy it has and obviously whether it's doing the job cooling the place\nWe do all of that so there's a lot of information that comes with a ...\nIt's not just looking for\nA really a a tour of the home and it allows your client just sort of understand but the home and the Honda that they could be moving\nAnd very last Nick let's look at the other big ticket items in a condo which are the appliances you've got the dishwasher the range the microwave depict installed you've got washers dryers I imagine you look at all of that too and what are you looking for their\nWell while making sure that it all worked swell and with the microwave oven and we also look for me so we have Michael Avon lake detectors that we ...\nAnd we make sure that the microwave Salt Lake condos are older and the appliances that are older but running fine but microwave which may be operating well eating their food well might be late so we want to make sure the doors are not like you know that it's like\nI say so neck to sum it up it sounds like if I Am buying a condominium and I want to make sure that number one it is safe and number two I'm not going to be showing out a lot of money in the near future [noise] it sounds as though I should invest in a home inspection even though it's a little living space\nI most certainly agree especially on the safety\nWell neck I really appreciate you pointing those out to us great information and thanks for joining us today thank you for having me ... ... founder of international
