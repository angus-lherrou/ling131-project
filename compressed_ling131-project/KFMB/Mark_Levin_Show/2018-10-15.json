Clark real tour and investment specialist with century Twenty one signature real estate in Des Moines Iowa ... is a national thirty under thirty on hurry\nAnd is currently serving as NPR's commercial and business specialties liaison for president Elizabeth ... of course to welcome back to real estate to back thanks so much for having me that we are so glad you're here so of course the first of all how business\nIt's fantastic it's always that that's all I can\nThat's wonderful so Christ a year now thirty three years old twelve years ago you bought your first investment property\nBut I Know that even though you are a real estate investor your heart is really with your clients helping them grow a portfolio\nPortfolio that will generate income and wealth overtime\nAbsolutely absolutely I you know I was lucky enough to have that\nOpportunity to invest a young age and given that opportunity the other is really weren't that many\n... when you are young real estate investor get started first of all how young is young who is your youngest investor ever\nYou know what I actually had a young kid from my home town actually that by his first\nHome which actually wasn't investment because it needed to work it was a foreclosure that he had found in ... he was willing to put the work at it and he had just graduated high school through his eight\nTeams so yes I think he bought the property and like you and then he had just graduated in may and his parents help them\nYou know with a little bit of a down here because it was not something that could be financed graphic day or anything like that but he got the financing on it though and he held a job through high school that show that good enough income to cover the payment and it was crazy by far the youngest\nThat is awesome and so when people come to you and they're very young and they say I Want to invest in real estate what did they tell you about the reasons why\nHonestly most young investors are looking to build a stable future which I think it's so encouraging right now because I you know our generation is is really good at all they wanting to do the things that they find\nFun and though I Love the fact that they actually eat you know investing in real estate at it and then the ... creek and the hard work themselves as something that's a fun activity for them so I it's really encouraging for\nMe so far I Want to invest in real estate and by my very first property am I going to need you know a great credit be really solid reserves like money in the bank and see a really high income or not so much\nWell you know obviously life an easier one of those things are are there but it's certainly not something that should stop you from investing actually you know one of my my biggest investors I've been working with in fact first got my licence eleven years now he's built a very impressive feat got\nHundreds of units across the state of Iowa a little bit you know across the border in Illinois and a black guy\nAnd he bought his very first property on contract he ended up buying the property on contract from\nA landlord there was just tired of having every model every time a tenant moved out you know you're paying your carpet things like that plans or rent it out and then felt like you know I put all of this however good I think I'd probably try to sell it and you know it sold right away so that's where he got his\nVery first nest egg to start going so he bought his very first event that property on contract with I think if I remember I was something like three or four thousand dollar down with the owner financing situation and you just\nFelt from there so it's crazy what you can deal with a little bit of resourcefulness\nThat is awesome and among your clients are a lot of them young\nYou know I Will say that you know I feel pretty diverse client base which I'm very proud of it at this point\nBut a lot of mine that isn't that the one that I was just telling you about that I've been working with for over eleven years you know he had been investing since he was in his\nEarly twenties he's now forty nine and had built something that and I consider forty nine young especially that he'll he built and you know he started in their early twenties and he hasn't stopped fence so I Would say good chunk of my that's definitely what I Would consider young\nSo let's look at the big picture a person comes to you in their twenties and they start investing in real estate tell me how is that going to change their life as the years pass\nI'm sure you've heard that the million times and it's a very different context on on the show here but the wind beautiful thing about real estate and you make or lose money only one yourself so if you can buy into something early if you can start building that portfolio of rental especially and how you're paying your mortgage for you and building equity for you\nIf you can do that at a young age the sky's the limit on what you can do because that first and that said that second it back to that third invest but it's something that you can continuously snowball and wrote in the down payment option for a bigger and that that and you just keep going and it grows exponentially in a way that you would never imagine on paper\nThat is great advice will ... I really appreciate you coming on the show today in talking about investing in real estate at a young age thank you\nAbsolutely thanks for having me anytime\nYou're very welcome Christopher Clark

staying on track when you were building well\nWe have to set up barriers that prevent us from appetizing our financial success that's\nOn our special show that foreign light\nBut first it's time for our smart home technology report\nWe're going to look at some fascinating trends involving smart speakers\nKnow you might not have an Amazon Echo or the Google Home where the apple home pot but according to an article on slate the data suggests that someday you might\nBe a sign of the survey from adobe which says in January of this year Eighteen percent of American households owned some type of smart speaker\nBut in the months since then that number has jumped exponentially and now thirty two percent of American households have a smart speaker nearly a third of all American homes and by the end of this year it's just admitted that half the homes in America will have a smart speaker\nAnd forty percent of those we'll have more than one\nTo watch every when doing with their echo their Google Home or their apple home part\nWell for that there were some really interesting and surprising results\nOkay the number one activity that American Jews with their smart speaker at home according to a survey for meals in Ninety percent of the people were smart speakers used them to stream music and Dora spot by Google music Amazon Music or apple music\nNext up eighty one percent report using their smart speaker to get real time information traffic and whether\nNext according to Nielsen Seventy five percent use them to get factual information like trivia or history and sixty percent use them to listen to the news but in a tie with news and this is fascinating [noise] sixty eight percent also said they use their smart speakers\nFor something completely different they're using them to have fun just to have fun\nHey Google tell me a joke\nOur time a ladder during a performance to reach the high notes [noise]\nThat's right people are asking for laughs or they try to dump their smart speaker with difficult or fun question Alexa how many inches from the earth to the sun\nIs five trillion eight hundred and eighty nine ... get Seventy nine million nine hundred and forty eight of us are hungry sixty five inches away\nWonderful and the last one on the list plan your meals\nYeah this may sound kind of basic but we really can tend to overpay for not only food dining out when we just don't have a plan for our meals and so I'm a big believer in thinking about it on a weekly basis making sure that you've got enough to make multiple meal\nSo to save time if you make a lot at once and then maybe put it in the freezer and make lunches ahead of time anything that you can prepare ahead of time is probably going to save your money and definitely going to save time so it's just one way to simplify your life so that you can focus on the big things big wins in your life\nGreat advice Lauren you know following you on Twitter is a great experience because

president of the American society of home inspectors as she is the oldest and most respected non profit professional organization of home inspectors in North America and has more than eight thousand members Tim welcome to real estate today\nThank you glad to be here we're delighted to hear So Tim here we are getting into the fall season what should I Do first if I Want to make sure that my home is in tip top shape\nFirst thing I Would do is check your gutters and down spouse because the biggest issue with the homeless water and in the fall gutters get clogged up with leaves and other debris and need to make sure you keep those ... clean so the water gets really moved away from the house you don't have any moisture intrusion you\nKnow that's a really good point okay so the gutters and down about bats where to start now what about the windows and doors what am I looking for their time\nYou want to make sure your windows and doors er Cox concealed properly southern cold there doesn't get into the house [noise] make sure your windows function\nA lot of times people leave their screens in the windows and wake up people take your screens out storm for the winter because the ice and snow and sleet and hard cold weather can really take its toll on screen so we suggest people to take their screens out\nSame thing was screen door's take your screen door screen out and put in your storm door\nSo what about the roof now how can I really know if my roof is in trouble or not what do I need a pair of binoculars\nOr you could use that that is true but I Would recommend contracting a qualified roofing contractor have them come out and inspect your rough they can let you know if there's any damage shingles bacon also let you know how long you refer last what the estimated life is but again that's another place of water can get into the home\nIs absolutely right now a lot of us think about getting the air conditioning system service before\nSummer but is that another area that you should have inspected prior to the winner\nAbsolutely a lot of HVAC contractors have maintenance contracts where they charge you a nominal fee if you have both of those check and so what they do is they come out in the fall and they check your furnace\nAnd they come back at it in the spring and check your air conditioner so that's a good thing to do every year and again it's a big safety issue or to make sure that furnish us functioning properly and efficiently also helps to reduce your heating bills gas or electric\nInteresting another area in the house that I Know is really important especially in the cold weather months is the installation but Kim how does a homeowner inspect back\nSometimes that's difficult especially in in the walls but at the addict people can get up there and they can now measure the insulation see how much they have in specific areas of the country\nYou'd have more insulation or less insulation so if you're up in Minnesota or main\nYou probably have more insulation and the addict than you would maybe in in Washington DC Virginia where the Carolinas because they don't get the cold weather like they do with the north so I Would strongly recommend having an installation contractor come out and expect that have all the investments you can make it a ... insulation is one of the best\nBecause even though you spend dollars insulating their home you will get that back and lower air conditioning and heating bills\nInteresting now Tim obviously are shows on all over the United states some parts of the states are going to be warm and sunny all winter long well of course others will\nBe covered with snow so are these fall prep strategies appropriate for your house no matter where it is\nAbsolutely and the fall if you're in a southern climates South Florida Arizona you may want to have your air conditioner check again because during the summer months it really works hard almost twenty four seven so it's best to do that\nAre both in the spring and fall and in these warm weather climate by having your furnace center air conditioners service in the fall or the winter no matter where you live I can say the homeowner money on their utility bills\nThat's very interesting because yes in the southern states people are going into a season in which you're going to continue to need their air conditioning even after this brutally hot summer we just went through\nThat is true very true\nWith him I really appreciate you joining us today and talking about maintaining your property thank you\n... guide you
