out for a few days or somebody asked me a minute ago they had been I I think you're over generalizing about a\nMob mentality of a left turn to destroy people's lives okay let me give you another example Matthew Collins a student from heart at Central high school in North Carolina\nWas actually kicked out of high school football game\nFor wearing a usa torch holding shirts now the torch was the the the statue of liberty George on the front with the words usa on the front in red white and blue and one sleeve was a red and white stripes of flag the others flee was the blue and the stars of the flag\nOn the back it had his name like a Jersey what habit says Trump forty five was the number for him being a forty fifth president\nNow the reason why he was wearing the shirt to the football game in high school football game is because he was participating in the usa America night\nOr the principal saw the back of his shirt and kicked him out because the shirt quote offended someone\nYeah but definitely not a mob mentality you got to high school kid wears a shirt that says Trump forty five on the back\nLooks like a Jersey where the usa on the front and the and the torch being held\nOf the statue of liberty and the principal kick them out of the game in the sands comes and find them in the stands because someone who was offended and you don't want me to believe that there's a mob mentality against conservatives by the left in this country come on\nThis is what they do to silence high school kids\n\nYou know county west today said in the oval office illegal guns or not or the problem\nSaid again ... ... illegal guns are the problem not legal guns we have the right to bear arms and was left say they say the president is taking advantage of a black man a token black man\n\nWho clearly has mental health issues\nShaming Kanye West because he doesn't say what they believe he should be saying as a black man\n\nThey call them a token negro phasing attention or they say should be in a mental hospital and they say about ... that this is what happens when a black man well not a black man this is how they put it\nWas what happens when they grow don't read\nThe car sellers who are debate all the time on TV I consider my friend I disagree with him on this one\n\nThis is what happens\nMe saying the guys now an educated tell you what is what happens when negroes don't read [noise]\n\nYeah it's it's definitely not a mob mentality is definitely not a find somebody destroy somebody character assassinate them I mean it was world meant I mean I said this earlier said again yesterday October the tent is world mental health day\n\nSo your shame a guy that you claim has mental health issues\nHow's that work out in ... for him [noise]\nYou don't care about his mental health you just want to act like he's crazy so you're going to attack him and say he's crazy because he got off the Democratic plantation and started saying things that you don't like the when he said\nBush aides black people all he was a brilliant artists then yeah\n[noise] really an artist in Ferguson filling in for mark ...\nFor years I've been sleeping on my Casper mattress\nI take it over every mattress I ever had it helps me get the best night's sleep period I Want you try Caspar you're going to love yours to Casper is a high quality mattress ended up for the full price and I sleep calling comfortably every night thanks to the unique combination of phones or provide the right pressure relief and alignment in Casper\nWas an assault on our White House definitely not a mob mentality though by the left no\nThat was you're not going to get thoughtful and now that was from a\nA thoughtful play by play and political and now you're not thinking that was an assault on our White House when\nI was an assault on our White House I tell you oh it gets better listen more MSNBC not just Kanye West that just assaults on our White House note when when Bill Clinton was doing or sex from an intern in the oval office ... that was not an assault on our White House\nOh we're not a\n... you began to analyze some of that stuff that was said I'm as we one you saw a there was a lot of profanity week there was\nActually more than you heard we we were able to bleak some of it out [noise] uh but there was a ... to make it in there [noise] um that was crazy that runners I mean the things that that is a tiny I said oh it's my favorite yeah\nPasses talked about had a lack of male role model in his life growing up that a lot of mail energy and he was wrong ... was because of the male ... with\nThe cap on he felt like a guy who could play catch with his his\nHis 'cause he didn't have that opportunity which was sending you know when he also said you know a lot of African Americans out there they don't like the gang to like make America great again and the reason being if you are anything but a white now\nHistorically life was better for you than it is in the current lawmakers sunny alley disastrous think someplace and even the president was that this was just as I say a lunch that's an outright lie I went to the White House my health several days ago and I suddenly thought you know unpredictable contests and they suggest what so are we there was absolutely a press\nThat went down the way you would think actually a meeting between the president Kanye West Jim rallies or by the way Kanye West said or blacks really like you get caught up in the idea of racism over the idea of industry his comment to a white police brutality is to release the love\nAnd he said that there should be in Chicago easy id Asian centers that\nSort of ... which is a the namesake of his I Need a savior ... that ... that sentiment is what gave him the ball to go for it and make so much money do they hate us I'm just stunned across the board you\nKnow we're gonna have a thought they were to have a conversation which we would follow up on 'em in part on criminal justice reform sentencing and prisons which is by the way a bipartisan really important idea a there was that was mostly nonsense\nThat was mostly nonsense 'cause\nThat man I'm white man was conservative\n\nThat was an assault on our White House immediately after ... anyway us in the oval office wow\nThat was bonkers if you thought you were going to get a thoughtful way by playing political announces you're not when we knew that you guys and MSNBC ... because that was an assault on our White House\nYou can't analyze some of that stuff that was crazy thank you for that thought for now is is that what you promised as you are not going to give U.S China you are on the mark of in show been ... been filming in Iowa\nHave then how's it going doing well how are you doing good [laughter] I just wanted to say that I'm as a as a black woman a young black woman I Am so incredibly proud of Kanye West\nHe's speaking for the people like myself who are the the super silent majority right I mean there's like ... eight percent of us or something crazy and and I think that there's more out there\nAnd I think that we're winning we're actually winning that's why the left is going but there that's why the\nThe mainstream media is going bonkers as they call him because they know that if we get just a few percentage points more of the black vote it's over for it\nDoesn't matter what they can say whatever they want to say they can keep pushing that that racist talking point that the Republicans are racist but people like myself are waking up\nAnd I'll tell you something that I'm thirty three years old I was born and raised a lifelong Democrat I was a liberal I Lived in idiots okay I ate up all of that crap that they fed me my whole life which was that you know I couldn't get ahead that I Would never be treated equally I never felt\nMore loved and when I went to south haven Mississippi and I went to a Trump rally and I wore that make America great again hats and I totally\nYour own home now you you need to go to a mental hospital you need to go to a mental hospital right away\n[noise] right well I'll tell you what you know what a mental hospital is better than the Democrat plantation\nAnd you know what they look how quickly they turn on you when you don't agree with what they say and the sad thing about it is is that the car sellers what's really sad is he's ...\nThe person that they put up there to lie to all of us are there was oh\nOh I Know that I I think I think he's a leader in the Democratic party because he's able to marginalize into black people that they can't you can't disagree with the Democratic party or you are going to be an Uncle Tom and you're not going to be accepted in your communities you're not going to be accepted in your church except in your neighborhoods\nBut Ben I'm Talking to more and more black people on getting\nOut there and I'm saying things that I'm Talking to people and people are starting to wake up it little by little and you kinda have to produce them and ask them questions and things like that but people are starting to say Trump not that bad he's not the racist that people keep lying and saying that he is\nYou you oughta you ought to look at you you ought to look at it that this just my scrolling down my Twitter feed right now are people that are listening to the show tonight who were telling me that they actually believe that Kanye West's should be in a mental hospital\n... mental health shaming someone the day after world mental health day\nDemocrats telling me they care about mental health needs should never shame anybody to shame someone and use mental health to shame a person\nThey have no schools they have those you\nKnow what and and it's okay if they do it it's okay if they do it but if we split up and we say one thing that they're going to hurt the ... point orthodox and it's sad it's sad because uh you know they run the media\nThey really do we have a few people like yourself and the and mark within that you know are are telling the truth but for the most part\nYou know they're they're bought and paid and they're on their their brainwashing people twenty four hours a day and in fact the matter is look at the black community oh you have to do it open your eyes and see I live in Memphis, Tennessee run by Democrats and it's on that\nAnd you go to every single Democrat city black people have\nGot to wake up they've gotten wake up and said well if you're an area than for us to continue\nTo vote for one party and makes no sense on planet earth when that party has done nothing for your school system has done nothing for the prison system it's done nothing for bothers the lack of fathers and the home the welfare state and\nAnd people are that eventually wake up and they'll look around and say that the party has never done anything for me and\nWhat I did that a lot to tell you something been it changed my entire life at the moment I was reading pill\nAnd God Bless you Shona I think you great to talk to you you know you're talking about unhinged um I got an article who sends me earlier says you and your dog can now pee all over Donald Trump thinks two statues\nThey're set up in Brooklyn a it's a these boss of Donald Trump with fake grass and says beyond me\n\nIf that's not an hands just that's not a mob mentality when you

the reduction of the uh the the fights an application and or the other memos that bend the Trump Administration sent to the inspector general which she only reason that you would send up into the

justice based on the five application just throwing that out\nMm [noise] you know ... it's an interesting um it's an interesting time because\nYou I I went back and I saw a couple of things you mentioned about Mueller mentioned about you know Russia and pro ... over the last few days but they weren't the stories that we have been saying\nYou know going back to the um it was the day of the Papadopoulos indictment and the New York times at when the president tweeted no collusion\nAnd then the New York times wrote the story he was tweeting that as they were proving there was collusion\nWith an indictment by the way proving well the indictment had nothing to do with the collusion nothing\nAnd so that narrative became again they were writing it as if it were fact and I mean like\nA legal fact documented do you want\nLegal facts go to Sarah a quarter dot com or go to you know uh when they were back or is there a quarter and and Solomon when they were going back a circle

has all but die and it's interesting there's nothing on it is handled yesterday and and the interesting thing is that seemed to happened about the same time that the White House sent all that information\nTo the inspector general everything has gone quiet as if it never existed because I ... I wouldn't have predicted that move where he would just handed over to the I G I wouldn't have thought of it I guess yeah but well there was some is\nDirection there because we were talking about the fact that our allies don't want us to really like some of our allies writer for were given to the inspector general that didn't make any sense to us for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nWe'll see that region today the Florida Panhandle the Big Bend area dry out under clearer conditions good news for the region from Mother Nature we can look at the entire deep south and the mid west today

that he had bought\nThat being said Jim rounds old Jim Brown is not a part of popular culture today\nA you ask the average uh a a thirty year old if they know who Jim Brown is bearing on who you're talking about that the the the old guy that you know they might remember the fact that\nYou know he has worked with gangs before mhm uh you know Jim Brown comes into\nThe substance issue huge for anybody who's paid attention over the last Thirty years as to what he's been involved with a Jim Brown is not part of popular culture today with the youth and millennials like Kanye West is the left is scared to death of Kanye West because he smack in the middle\nOf the the culture that is expected by the elite liberals to be a liberal supporter mhm\nHe cannot have a different opinion and if he does have a different opinion than Trump is exploiting the mental issues\nThe Kanye West had nobody was talking about mental issues economy was when he when you know he was at the award show where they know on the let no no no uh nobody in a lump was talking about his ah you know his mental state when I he said that uh George Bush a hates all black people because of Katrina didn't hang\nRight that that that that's not a because it again that's not a threat it's something at that time politically they could use a not so much the Taylor Swift award show moment but the the uh George Bush comment\nAnd it was notable to the left but they didn't they didn't label him as insane\n... if you think about his demeanor because I I don't know by the way I don't know what a ... a ... what do you call it the the hero voyage or or what whatever Trump is on right now\nI'm [laughter] I'm not sure what that means [laughter] uh I I really don't know ah ah well I\nThink you can you sometimes you can go through a lot of Cairo journey is what he said yeah you're you're there you go through a lot of Kanye West lurks go OK I understand this for not understand the sense at all why are they are and I do I have no idea what this means\nYet get back in time to get back to you know I mean look look to the Beatles for inspiration she loves you yeah yeah yeah she loves you yeah yeah yeah\nWell no I disagree with you if you're looking for complete and total accuracy in a song\nTax man mhm yeah\nSure also from the Beatles yes yes I mean that's accuracy is death I mean that that was come you understood that exactly wasn't one for me was that when they have the Ninety percent tax I was nine for you in one for me it was on yeah which was actually the tax rate at the time you know and\nI think the but if you look at his demeanor and the way Kanye is actually taught I think he was on chemical things where he said a couple of things and listening to them as like I was like\nI was like if you don't look at the video you're like is that Conyers talking because she is demeanor was calm and straight to the point it wasn't so Taylor Swift moment it wasn't that\nIt wasn't the moment after Katrina the George Bush um it wasn't that\nIt was something that the content of the comment really couldn't be debated by the ... so what do they do\nWell to go to the labeling and the name calling and then you know all of a sudden will now he's crazy which means he's not capable of making a thought at all you know this goes beyond the media love they uh you know and and the comments were all over the place you know the the token comment a from a Thursday\nOr you know to the\nInsane comment but the same comment is well he's not capable he doesn't have the facts why who to do the wires Khamenei ... why is anybody surprise that\nA a black man in rap ...\nThat's been in rap now for a couple of decades mhm looks overall\nAnd remember you know your\nLot of rappers view themselves as a lot of old rockers did as revolutionaries ... and you look what are you looking for you're looking for where you believe\nManipulation may be happening well if you want to look at manipulation if you want to look at bigotry if you want to look at in tolerance if you want to look\nAt an elite a stab which meant that is telling all blacks you must think light or something is wrong with you I'm not surprised more male rap stars haven't come out and said\nWell this is ridiculous mhm\nAs Tanya is doing I think it's completely and totally normal that you'd look and you'd say wait a minute the Democratic party has been manipulate look we get calls\n\nFrom blacks all the time that said I finally woke up and realize the ... now it's not the majority but it's growing mhm and obviously when that message is put out\nTo any demographic that exist out there that you must act this way you must think this way there's only one way to think and if you don't think this way you are betraying your race\nSomebody's finally going to stand up and saying you're full of it right that is just naturally going to happen and that's essentially the point the county I made on ...\nYou know this this is ridiculous that someone can't think independently but they've got they've got to be a part of groupthink\nI mean imagine Trump has said that\nThey would be done that\nNot that all blacks think alike but they should think alike politically it would be over CNN would have a twenty four hour special report on it\nAnd and that's that's the thing they and and for ... it is ... you know it's the point ... who he's always been he's getting attention you know because well that's what he likes\nBy the way I made a mistake of just you know mentioned a few ah you know running backs out there who I

agenda\nWith respect to tell them that this is such a thing called about it's about our country being able to produce everything that it needs right here in this country and the good thing about that which is why not it was so bad the good thing about doing it here it's we create more jobs\nNo hair Mary it's horrible the last thing you would ... the last thing you would ever want to do\nIs make a law that everything must be produced here because done prices would skyrocket through the roof you would have monopolies that would make the goods and services that you get\nPrices would be much higher than they should be dude and retail doors shutting wrapped and right on the opposite ... you would go in a massive recession if we had a policy that we produce everything in this country\nPrices of goods and services would skyrocket through the roof it's not whether you are capable of producing everything right here because yeah with modern technology\nFor the most part we probably could produce now there are some there are are are some rare metals that we don't have access to that we absolutely have to get from from other countries but said we even had those rare metals\nIt depends on who's in Washington but I Believe we will get to the point of self sufficiency where you know we can produce for the United states and export at the same time which is a which will be a great point a to a to get to we're not there yet but as we\n... really one of the most underreported stories\nOf the entire year ...\nIs that the United states is now on it happened about three weeks ago became the number one producer of oil\nIn the world mhm yeah [noise] um and and this is it I mean you if you put in place all the things of that that will make an economy great again [laughter] um and they did\nBy the way I think that's the number one reason I found is supporting um uh the uh the the president his tax bill went way way down\n[laughter] but um the you know the [laughter] that'd be enough for me [laughter] it's not the case for me though mine went up a but but the line to you that right\nSo the but but you put in place all those dynamics for great economy and all it's working up until what the ... three numbers we talked about the GDP numbers from the second quarter and said hey this is great\nBut what is the third quarter fourth quarter and then first quarter of next year look like if the cost of raw materials is still high and increasing still going up that is a negative that is strictly\nControlled by the government that is something that is policy put in place that doesn't need\nTo be there look\nAnd you don't win and we said we stayed with China and the intellectual property yeah we understand we understand the case there we didn't understand Canada Mexico or Europe or even\nA for the most part are not that you couldn't have done a few things different in in TPP but remember\nThe great victories of the dairy with Canada was already in the ... candle and already agreed to that yeah I'm a you know ... before so that was lauded as a great victory and uh but that was something we already had before and decided not you know the Trump Administration decided\nYou know not to what to take that you and I went through and and and uh as you know Wall Street journal and others didn't look actually at the the new NAFTA and then there's not much change from the old\nNAFTA the biggest victory that the president has claimed that he claimed a what\nUh was the fact that the terrorists worked to get what he wanted with the automobile industry right along he did in the automobile industry was increased the cost of producing an automobile in Mexico in the United states and in Canada yeah\nNobody is debating that that's not what happened right and that's viewed as a victory well if I remember\nTwo of the president's major goals\nHis goals his stated goals was to reduce the one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit I don't see how this does it because the majority\nOf the new NAFTA does is the exact same as the old NAFTA ... except for automobiles the dairy which would have been in TPP anyway only increases the U.S market to Canada by one percent ...\nUh and uh the rest is still the same right so you ask okay what were the what were the because that the president's trying to make the terrorists are worth it because we got we wanted in automobiles what did you get\nYou increase the cost of automobiles for people in the United states to produce them in the United states in Canada and Mexico raising the cost of an automobile for all three countries and\nBecause production costs went up you are less likely to be able to sell those goods to you know producing them in the United states and sell them elsewhere exactly the opposite of the two things that you want it reduction in the trade deficit and to produce things in the United states to sell them elsewhere\nWell and and the right now we are I mean if you look at at at oil that's one great example of because of the technology created a in recent years and and how much more efficient they are as an industry\nAre now you you talk about you know the farmers so I mean you if you\nIf you say it's a very populous viewpoint right we need to help the farmer but when you think of the role that they play and and the and the global market in terms of food uh you know set of before a few minutes ago but\nThey feed the world that food goes all over the world um you know and and they're telling the administration look your your your money that you gave us a thanks but no thanks we need the business that's what we need\nAnd and that's the because forget about the political pawns president doesn't need them\nHe doesn't need to uh I Know everybody does it politically but this president doesn't need that\nAnd they're telling him basically it's it's doing the opposite\nRight because it is you know it's just protectionist policy which brings about\nRetaliation from our trade partners and then all of a sudden the farmers are hurting and it's not just ethanol farmers [laughter] it's ... I mean they get their government bailout\nWith the ten percent mandate so I have to believe inside the White House right now they're probably scrambling\n... of of getting things done as you said it was ... it wasn't just a coincidence that the president announced yesterday that show\nAnd and that's the other thing too I mean for the president has a ... you know the uh the supportive of a lot of people and other and I know people who are otherwise\nConservative and say you know they supported the president they say well well this is all negotiation\nBut wait he was a master negotiator why does he need the threat threatened and ultimately cost people a lot of money and hurt industry in order to get the ... the grocery Asian done\nA master negotiator he doesn't need to do that well\nAs I said you know and again ... ... we can go through any political rhetoric are out there but where was the win in NAFTA right\nWell and that's it except for the you know ... and you can look as we said you can look at it the one percent increase in the market share\nFor the United states in the Canadian dairy mhm but then\nThey really won the you know they they the the whole timber thing which will be which will help America actually ... but the president did allow what what we\nExcept for the dairy that now which increases the market size you know the our our market potential of a one percent of the Canadian business which isn't a lot of dollars right overall was that worth the loss of business with the terrorists that the president\nHas put on that does raise the cost of goods and services\nAnd affected the cost of raw materials\nAnd other goods and services for American businesses are businesses to actually produce it to get a one percent share more of the dairy market of Canada\nWhich is miniscule by because now but now he mentioned that but his big victory this is what the president said we're not is this isn't our opinion was the automobile thing I got what I wanted an automobiles what did you get\nWhat we made it so some ah some employers of in Mexico have to pay sixteen dollars an hour ... some have to do that won't find you've just made them say okay we're going to go to automation quicker\nRight ah and even with the\nWas it uh I think it was a Wall Street journal said most and I forgot who else said well it's only a two point five percent terror so really isn't going to affect that it isn't that great\nSo we're just we're still going to sell it and try to you know and and we're still not going to produce anything in the United states we're we're not we're not transferring any business to the United states because of that but the other thing the president want to do is make sure that\nWe could in the United states seller vehicles overseas well that's less likely to happen because the cost in the United states and Canada are and in Mexico went up ... as to his caps on what Mexico you know could send us in cars before other terrorists hit\n... we have an ... they haven't reached that cap\nCar by and in the United states has stagnated so they looked at that promote Canada and Mexico and said it sort of like what they did in South Korea\nWhere they said okay you can only you we've now doubled the amount of cars or with the safety precautions to twenty thousand that we can sell in South Korea instead of ten thousand so see we doubled the market for the United states or the United states was only selling six thousand to begin with\nRight they weren't ... already Murray jak haven't even mentioned the cat well they're not read the caps have been set in NAFTA the two", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "12"}
