with high speed\nThe company Qualcomm came out with what it calls quick charge a few years ago and many of the more recent phones have it\nBasically your charges your phone from zero to eighty percent in about a half hour now that's really fast and then this beep slows down to protect the battery and the rest of the charge takes about sixty minutes\nNow not all phones have it but you can find a

seven sixty of envy\nIs real estate today you're Nineteen your biggest investment\nBack now with our special show scary thing our annual tribute to Halloween which is this coming Wednesday and of course one of the scariest things in real estate is coming up with a down payment now in our\nFirst hour we talked about new research from the Urban Institute about barriers to homeownership and how coming up with that down payment is so frightening to some people\nThey don't even try to buy a house but those fears are largely unfounded because sure some people are not ready to buy but many who are\nThey think they need more money than they really do and amazing as it may seem most people don't know that their state or county or city probably has down payment assistance programs ready willing and able to help homebuyers get into that house\nLet's talk about that now joining us once again is Rob ... with the organization down payment resource Rob launched downpayment resource to connect eligible home buyers and eligible properties where it's hard to find a down payment programs Rob thanks for coming back on real estate today\nIt's great to be with you again okay so Rob let's talk about those down payment assistance programs\nFirst of all it's not just for first time buyers every time correct\nCorrect and I say that for two reasons one is that\nPart of that is because the definition that's normally used for first time homebuyer is that you have it on the on the last three years so you could about over the past\nAnd not own a home for three years at for these purposes is still ate the first time homebuyer requirement also there are in our database probably about thirty six percent of the programs down at any first time homebuyer requirement\nInteresting and another thing Rob about downpayment assistance programs [noise] you don't have to necessarily heavy starter wage to qualify I understand that people can actually be making a really good amount of money and still get the assistance\nThat's absolutely correct a lot of it has to do with where you live because the uh ... household income limits on these programs they not only the area for the program the program but they vary from state to state city to city region to region so if you live in high cost areas\nThe area median income is higher than low cost areas so depending on where you live you might be able to make over a hundred thousand dollars in your household and still qualify for a lot of these programs\nThat is amazing so Rob how to our listeners learn more about down payment resource and the down payment how that might be available to them\nBut they can go to the down payment resource dot com and\n... button that says find programs\nAnd to her about six or eight pieces of information about their household\nAnd then assess the hotel how many programs eligible for an a telling about those programs\nWhere find that money most importantly right by that you're eligible for money better at a pass to get there and and it's just for the world so that it'll tell him not only where the where where to find the money who are the participating lenders participating education spiders and so forth\nI see syrup let me back up just for one minute if I learned that I Am eligible for down payment assistance they don't just write me a check right all that happens during the mortgage application process\nExactly exactly so it's really important when you're looking for a home to find a lender as a lender before you go out looking for actually that that's the first step because you don't want to get excited about trying to figure out if you go for for it or not right\nBut when you're talking to different lenders thing that you want to be sure and do it asked\nWhat downpayment assistance programs they participate in that letter participates and lenders that they don't necessarily participate in every program most large metro areas have dozens of programs so\nReally find out first when you talk to lenders how they can help it with these programs\nThat is great advice and Rob I really appreciate you coming on the show today in talking about the latest report barriers to homeownership by the Urban Institute\nAnd also the ways the down payment resource can help people find the money they need to put down in a house thank you for being here\nIs David it's always great
