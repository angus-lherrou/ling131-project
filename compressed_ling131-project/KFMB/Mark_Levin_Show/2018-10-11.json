I I I'm surprised we all saw him um this morning he was actually streaming on our station in Panama City\nUm and I believe is from Jacksonville television station [noise] um and um\nHe was in a parking garage yeah right yes\nAnd and and his coverage or was seen worldwide people were picking them up worldwide and when we threw out\nUm you know the TV station a that would be a W. J. H. G. ah which did streaming coverage um um basically when when we went off the air they started their streaming coverage and and continued until they lost\nMore than just power they lost power at their transmitter sites and that was pretty much game over for them but they were only twenty feet above a sea level they were confident that their staff was going to be safe in that situation\nBut they continue to keep an IT guy on board\nTo make sure that they kept feeding that and so they set another sister station and our system through and this gentleman and not garage I\nAppreciate his honesty because what he basically did was documented\nWhere he was where he was standing yeah and and and and smartly I'm not going to go stand out there by the edge of the parking garage but what I found interesting was that that parking garage was also home for countless people in their cars yeah\nYeah I just the ... is his name and a lot of people were following him a Drudge Report actually even put up a lead a early Wednesday and uh and he had been during that time basically staging and showing\nYou know the well a calm literally calm before the storm\nAnd and uh so he was he was broadcasting essentially a through periscope\nDrew periscope ah for periods of time thirty to forty minutes or even shorter times\nBut then as you mentioned are going live later and this is something that again it it is too I think display the power of a storm for many of us that have never been through a storm and very few people relatively speaking\nHad been through a storm like this but when you're able to show people how powerful this is what it does and he's just going to be there by the way\nHe anticipated being there for up to a week or longer because he knows that's going to be next to impossible to get out of that parking garage because of the you know the damage left behind\nAnd that's what you hope to do you hope to show people\nThat this damage and how powerful\nThis storm is now hurricane Michael becomes tropical ... Michael or in the last hour or so but still when you look on the radar of Tom this thing right now a Michael\nEveryone in the state of Georgia right now is feeling some effect of Michael as it's centered over a Georgia and moving toward the Carolinas\nWhat do we expect them next and the next twenty four to forty eight hours and beyond\nWell initially what we're going to expect that his life you know there there still is a life threatening storm surge going on [noise] um to begin with a Panama City in along the coast there they still are anywhere from three to five feet a inundation going on right\nAnd so we haven't had a a you know the water to recede but we're also going to have tremendously heavy rainfall from Michael and that's going to be life threatening flash flooding and it's going to go across not just Georgia the Carolinas and they don't need any more water\nRight there still saturated and there are places that are going to become impassable it would\nNot necessarily be out of the question\nTo to find some of the major roads Ninety five can I say Ninety five and not a ... we're going to need to be aware of this is ... if if if you're if if you're working and your job is to drive somewhere bottom line is you're going to need to be alert to this [noise]\nUh the wins a high profile vehicles we're twelve hours from now still going to be looking now we've got a\nA Seventy mile an hour wind and within the next half hour they're going to update that with a with an advisory they were giving one hour advisories this was the last advisory at twelve o'clock eastern time\nThat we'll be moving on to uh just regular a three hour advisories and\nAnd um and so it's going to accelerate and speed\nAs it becomes a little more entrenched in the mid level jet stream and so that'll Pickett's speed up the I'm guessing a ... probably not by the time or off the air but twenty three miles an hour for which the into the northeast and when they're still going to be forty miles an hour\nForty to forty five miles an hour or and so\nUh now above the surface\nWhere we don't have the friction of the earth five thousand feet\nWins have been already clocked I'm\nUsing Doppler radar or at that level it eighty to eighty five miles an hour and so where there's a heavy cluster of thunderstorms and there is one currently ... crossing over highway six team which goes into making from savannah [noise] um there's heavy rain there and\nThat thunder storm translates those higher wins to the surface and so in those storms\nThat they could seeing us two eighty miles or maybe even eighty five mile an hour gusts even though we're looking at it a sustained speed of Seventy miles an hour so we're going to drop about in half\nAs we go over the next twenty four hours to around forty to forty five of the speed of wins above the surface\nAnd and so right now as I said we're Seventy will be down to about forty five will still be in the tropical storm range and I believe that it will exit\nThe United states or as we get up to\nFriday morning out into the Atlantic as a as a tropical storm\nAbout we're\nNot it's not it's not going to become a remnant it's not going to be just a cluster of storms that are moving their way off in a and a general direction John trout great meteorologist or admire him a lot\nIndicated Ninety five court or and that's exactly what it's going to be following the court or although it will be on the west side of that court or and we've already learned that the west side of that court or\nHas some some some roots that are between Colombia and Ninety five and moving its way up toward Charlotte in Rockingham and so forth that are\nThat have their own issues when it comes to a flooding and that includes going across Lumberton and Fayetteville\nAnd both of those areas um south of Raleigh which I think it'll scoot right past Raleigh\nThose areas are are we're gonna have to be watching them as we go into today tonight and tomorrow or to see if we have more catastrophic flooding ... we can probably we can probably saved for the next time we talked about turning around and don't drown\n[laughter] yeah right right exactly ... and you have to you have to proceed with with caution and don't think you can get through it as you mentioned yesterday you don't know if that road has been washed away under the surface of that water you it's impossible to tell that so it's always best to turn around\nAnd certainly a we're going to keep people posted throughout the morning as meteorologists Tom hale\nAnd later John ... will

point is is not that are that are arguments had changed any or have become stronger we may ... and I think it should be called talk show host you learn\nHow to debate better and put your points up for

... today [noise] okay I disagree with that but ah he's not insane like they are over there I really think that's worth a [laughter] when you you know you're you're you're comparing and you're saying

just opened then to or an ... an agreement just agreement to\nAn opinion that they might not even agree with one hundred percent but they see that there's rational thought and critical thinking to

him out of the building that's progress\n\nDance words it's not it's it's the opposite of progress\nI think the key is here is that it is the evidence the last couple of weeks and then what has just

wonder again in those districts\nKeep in mind a number of those districts or the race is is on\nTo fill the seat that someone has is leaving a Republican stepping out\nAh what does that mean and some makeup of that district changing and we look at Texas thirty two uh that is a ... a Pete Sessions or the the demographics in in his district or change\nYou know um that's that's something that will change of politics and it's much of that district is uh I think in fact I think all of his Dallas County and Dallas County has gone balloon and well gosh going back to a\nObama and two thousand eight so for a decade or Hillary won in fact that district or buy a point and a half and I believe it was\nA so we'll see what you know what that means for Pete Sessions as he right now is only a while it was a poll in late September by one point but he's been you know he's been somebody who has been a strong contender\nAnd years ago you would think well that's not going to change it does change in those districts when the demographics\nChange I I'm you know one of the things and and again you look for any type of barometer out there to see if you know the whole cabinet thing\nHad you know well what kind of it it's going to have an impact it's what kind of an impact is going to have ... and and uh I look at Montana for example in Jon Tester and I I guess Charlie Cook came out the other day and and uh also ... has now said it's a toss up our see peace says it's a toss up\nTester's been up uh in July was up by three in early September he was up by two by late September he was up\nBy four but that was latest poll ended nine twenty to fry an egg up over Matt Rosendale the Republican challenger what happens in you know that state as we get closer or a Jon Tester has never been over fifty percent\nIn any of the the polling or a he is he is just over\nThe margin of error you know just slightly over in in his in his um\n[noise] a ... for example he was a plus for that was a margin of three point seven margin of error and it was up by three that was a margin of two so he's over but now it's a\nSenate race it listed as a toss up and the question is in a in a place like Montana\nWhere conservative politics still wins in the majority of Montana mhm after everything that we have seen and and not just cabinet but everything that's coming out now you know the Hillary videos getting played everywhere\nThey you know it but we played on yesterday show the comments\nI'm\nOf the former attorney general mhm are being played you know a well if they go low will kick them from Eric Holder mhm\nThey're being played or the you know CBS News story I mean even the mainstream media picking up that Democrats have said they're not going to take the high road instability now is there a politics of choice\nBy the way had Sarah Palin said if they go low will kick 'em oh it would be the number one story and the mainstream media right\nSo you you see the strategy that they have which is not a strategy of expanding their base because it's not claiming you're going to be you know on civil claiming that\n... claiming as we said during the whole Kavanaugh thing 'cause this is what to me that was the big message that came out of it the ... the criticism that Democrats put on Republicans or anybody else that didn't agree with them is if you if you believe in the mindset of due process\nAnd a presumption of innocence\nIran unable as ... you weren't able or a rapists and that's what you do mhm that's the message that they set out\nI I ... if that's a great selling point in America today than we certainly are doomed if that if you believe that gives you an advantage and it does in an election then you're right we're heading down the wrong path I mean we are doomed as we've always\nDoing away with civility wins in America it will prove may right\nEight six six Ninety right I [noise]\n... for your goals eight six six Ninety ... wrote a review
