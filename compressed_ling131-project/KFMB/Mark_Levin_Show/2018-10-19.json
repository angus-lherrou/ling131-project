Sorry go ahead\nNo that that I Would let me speak I'm Sorry mark a that some of it you know what\nBut what it does it get control some people it goes I mean it it is what it is and and\nYou know when I hear you say you know people hate the conservatives are they hate the hate is a very powerful word\nTo very power or um you know I did why some of the people in the other party I mean I'm I'm a conservative no matter what I Love what Trump do it um\nYou know I I Can't believe that he not a Kennedy by now uh you know in my opinion however\nYou know I hate saying it it it it's over taken a\nDay and and you know I grew up in the eighties we didn't have this kind of hay and uh you know it it it's really hard to swallow watching my kids go up and said hey environment and I don't like that or\nMhm [noise] well I I understand that you know I and I appreciate your call I understand that you don't like no I'm Glad you didn't say you hate that word\nBut I understand that the ... but that's what is going on and that's why I said we ... we have the second civil war notice I didn't say that I said that the I think Democrats Mr misinformed and they think we're evil so that's that's a big difference right there\nLet's go to a\nThat is Joe and ... junior Joe you're on with mark\nMark the morning [noise] hey I'm real good topic and I'm\nI'm actually calling into a little story about my sister but I Want it to all of a you know on Facebook [noise] I've I've shutdown Facebook just because even if I had it with my friends and family only I still found\nEndless arguments on there for I mean just\nFor no reason you know it's almost like they were troubling me waiting for me to say something and then they were all along you know um it it almost feels to a point sometimes when I'm Talking to people I Can't even really say what I where I stand because people just get annoyed at the name Trump sometimes you know\nDon't don't give up maybe someday she'll come around the ... billion socialism in Europe and what's going on there if you ask most of your opinions I don't think many of them be happy with what's going on I don't know what you saw a but it's it's depressing hanging there my friend okay it'll it'll come around some time\nTo hang in there um I was just thinking of a you know people are funny that way I worked at a station in uh Los Angeles as I said I don't want to say too much about it except for one of the hosts had a\n... have there's a gal on whose father was a famous I don't want to see what he did but it was it was pretty famous at us in this day\nAnd they didn't talk for a Twenty years or something and then um one day a host said to me you know mark a her father died\nAnd she didn't even know it and I had to tell her the news and she said a whole wow I never got a chance to say goodbye so they hadn't talked to her I think was at least Twenty years and you think that\nFinally when he passed on but it was too late to say goodbye to him\nBecause she disowned him all those years for personal reasons so one has to think that\nEventually you hope people come around before something serious happens and I always tell my students you can never tell someone you love enough that you love them because life is very short but when you hear the family stories a brother and sister daughter whatever that because of politics\nThey disown their parent or their brother who they know their whole life assuming there's nothing terrible going on in the relationship\nJust over politics and you see that almost always on on the left hand side third discouraging but are brought up the topic because it does happen it is something that needs to be talked about like let's go to Amanda in Woodbridge, Virginia you're on with mark\nMark it's great to talk to you I'm I'm trying to get a\nYou know Republican and conservative my whole life and I went into the military right after high school and um it most of the people um that I let it in the military where he chairs because they felt like the Republicans were the only one that would ever support\nA raise for you know the military pay as I kind of you know just that OK well they're there for me than I Am for them um and then it went on um\nWhen I'm the first or do you\nGo for him about um I just remember listening to the radio and and just being like I Need to find someone that talking about this too\nMuch time I was driving a lot and and the spending a lot of time in the car and um you just want it to listen and you know I've found conservative radio and\nYou know I haven't really talked about it with other people until people started asking me who you're going to vote for oh why are you going for them and it was like people started coming to me and pulling it out of me I wasn't I was pushing anything on them\nAnd um when it came down to trumpet with like for a lot of people around me it was the straw that broke the camel's back and they just walked away from their friends and relatives just stop paying my friend and I\nAnd they just said how can you you know for somebody who's just you know terrible and I'm just like you stand I can mad at Republicans for Twenty years for letting the media and the and the Democrats walk all over I mean this guy won't let anyone walk all over him\nAnd he still conservative saying that like our country better and I still see people rallied against him and I'm just like wait a minute we agreed to kind of me in that we in this country's ever seen you know we have I mean I'm the\nJobs for truck drivers should at least five thousand dollar bonuses for someone to start that job you know I mean\n... ... jobs that are just they don't have enough people to do them and and you know these tech jobs that pay huge amount of money so you know if you get the right degree you can get a great job if you if you don't have a degree you get Dr driving a truck working construction and\nEveryone seems to be still upset anything close to stand back and look what's going on but\nYou know I I had a friend\nTelling me writes my faith that I get so mad at you when I when I read the the ship boat that I just want to shoot you in the head and she made the hand signal like even when I got my cat and I miss trips so hurt by that and\nYeah I I haven't talked to her and that was you know nine months ago and\nIt just seems like a lot of my friends are just like you know we can't regulate demand that because she like Trump and I just don't want to be around her anymore and it it is hurtful and um we had some time I just felt like I was the most hated person on the Internet because on top of that\nI'm a transgender woman so a lot of people on the right hated me for a chance at lower hated me because I like Donald Trump and you know my family a lot of people my family this like me because\nI've transition then and also because I'm a Republican and then I have a ... ... people that looked at me and like how can you be Republican nephew chance he hates us and I'm just like not only does it you know and so it's like all these angles for coming at me\nTelling me that I'm wrong for the school I Am and I don't think that anything worse than my people telling you they can't accept you for who you are\nAnd and it it's just horrible\nWell I feel your pain and I had to use the bill Clinton line but I can hear the sadness and you know my heart goes out to I Can't imagine what you're going through a\n... is it's tough enough or the challenges the regular life holds for all of us let alone or when your friends or abandon you and maybe some family members to\nSay it's pretty discouraging I think you need to find new friends you know people who at least will share your Republican views\nOr to begin with and I think you're going to find a not everyone but a lot more Republicans are tolerant despite the fact that we have this view that we're not tolerant people uh that you know we're racists bigots and homophones is all this kind of stuff\nWhen we're not you just have to find the right people and and maybe it is that time to do that and maybe joined different organizations that ...\nI Know a volunteer work for a Jeff does is\nRunning for Congress in my area and Jerry Connelly and ... ... is an army veteran and his band aid on that is also African American and tear economy this older white guy who's been there for ten years called him a racist I mean it's\nLike a ... a a [noise] by the way I've got I got to think if your service and then well my advice to you\nLike a ... ... yeah [noise]\nOh by the way I've got I got to think if your service and then well my advice to you you didn't ask me is just hang in there and there are other like minded people but you know in this world\nIf or when I ask people how many good friends do you have in some people's brain say non and some say one and some say to it's hard to find good people it's hard to find special people I just want you know you're not alone that way that we all have those kinds of challenges maybe not your particular challenges but we all have our own Lincoln I think said\nThere is someone I don't like I'll have to get to know them better\nUh it it's tough life is very challenging and and can be very stressful and it's hard hard enough now we have a different colors are set we've reached a new level where your political views are enough to lose your friends let alone anything else so my advice to you sound like a nice person just keeping their don't give up and and try to find like minded people\nOkay and you have you have a great night [noise]\nUm ... the thing I just brought this up because I Know it's a real issue just imagine aside in this country whereas some causes set including my young friend there for all Americans to the final analysis John Kennedy said that even about the Soviet Union that we all read the same there\nYou know and what is this stuff is pretty sad to see
