can't compare Bernie Sanders to the president I face carries much greater weight being president psychotic or what about the assassination of the five policemen in Dallas\nFollowing the anti police remarks that President Obama and Eric Holder and tragically he didn't even remember the political get up and looking at\nMy house or you just said something and not even allowed to say\nWhile Trump is blamed and I told you two days ago you could see it coming they're starting to aim at Trump trying to turn this story and the Trump um that's perfectly fine things say whatever they want about Trump it's just a easy just just far away\nBut if you bring up the fact that Obama was truly trashing cops and law enforcement and holder was too and they're nationalizing these uh these local police departments and some of the really reckless things that they said\nWhether it was ... percent or Baltimore both towns by the way ... which have not recovered from what took place a\nYou're not allowed to say that stuff you're not allowed to say that stuff\nAnd yet the fact is their rhetoric was outrageous again I don't consider it being the reason that these are\nThese cops were murdered the guy was an absolute not and so forth and so on but the media will never be consistent because the media are of Obama's ilk they are progressive ... that's who they are and they and they reject the

votes he's eighty two percent bipartisan votes but nobody in the press ever covers them so I'm delighted to be on your show because you're alive and you talk about issues\nEverytime I tell the press that eighty two percent of those bills on the score Carter bipartisan they don't want to talk about it they just want to attack the president and I said what do you like the president or not\nThree of those votes for our veterans eleven of them are are regulations seven of them are to keep the government open and fully fund our military funded the anti age you know I'm the only one in the region in this Washington region whose Republican inside the beltway and if you don't have a Republican and a Republican administration [noise]\nThis is going to be a one party town and will be like Chicago or Baltimore where you don't have different voices you know speaking up and and working for our local region\nAnd so I think it's really important that we have a voice that it's going to be able to work with the administration for priorities for the northern\nVirginia now here's here's your opponent West is not just a Democrat and I will be fine\nShe's a radical she will join the radicals in the house of representatives I mean the hard core radicals the open border radicals the mass\nOf government radicals and so forth and so on and I'm In\nThe pillow says put in over a million dollars in the race and now Bloomberg's coming into doing two million because they saw what we saw in our polling which is the races tied very close\nAnd they kept saying they thought they had it all put away but I'll tell you we're we're in here we're fighting because then we can get this great record that we have of you know growing the economy is getting more people back to work um you know passing the opioid legislation that the president signed this week at the White House\nThat I was there with Democrats and Republicans\nCelebrating that we got this national emergency in the opioid crisis six billion dollars that were doing to help\nAnd the president want to talk about that so I appreciate you being a place where we talk about issues and the good things that we're getting done for the country and my opponent opposes this agenda and just wants to resist or they were about results there about resistance I'm about you know getting things\nThere that improve the quality of life in advance our economy protect you know our citizens public safety I been endorsed by the police benevolent association but I've also been endorsed\nBy and supported by the federal employees pack as well as every business group involved so I brought together a diverse coalition\nWhat what kind of groups have back your opponent\n[noise] um well the ah the metro union group that as a running in a cash out I\nKeep threatening to shut down the um the metro in the Washington DC area and violate yeah and violate the law\nAnd they're attacking me for not raising taxes so my opponent attacks me and then people like this was this was a union that was so you know this functional that the Obama administration supportive suited\nAnd that's who supporting her and and other union cruise but she hasn't gotten you know any business endorsements she wouldn't even sit down to interview with the police benevolent association and this is someone she put her own\nStaff into fake parties city costumes\nFries police in or out to imply that she had the support of the police when in fact the police have endorsed it\nOh the staffing to fake parties city costumes\nFive police in or out to imply that she had the support of the police when in fact the police have endorsed and supported me because of my record on\nPublic safety on let me ask you this for ... let me ask you this before we run out of time roads it's a big deal in northern Virginia [noise] uh there's a lot of road construction going on and that's even before the president pushes through an infrastructure program but she's a heavy duty tax or on the toll road as of\nYet was he was for that that that's forty six dollar told you the when you go into Washington she was for them before she was against them and you know she was on the committee that ... they put through that but more importantly she thinks she was against them\nYet Terry McAuliffe who put that into place how she was ineffective and persuading him now you look at something where I Know we might disagree on this but I really advocated for the I'm a pay raise for our federal employees and the president and you know the administration initially it was going to do a pay for it\nAnd I went to them politely and made my case and talked about why it was important that people who you know the FBI the CIA other the other day got their pay raises so they can do the good work they did and\nYou know arresting a character that they got today and so um I work politely with the administration on that she was ineffective and getting Terry McAuliffe to do anything\nUm and and get rid of that forty six dollar calls and so we need somebody who is defective who can work with you know a Republican administration or a Democrat I demonstrated that and and I've always been\nSomeone advocating lower taxes [laughter] Terry\nAnd public safety which is why I'm thrilled to have the support of our police and\nI think\nYou are in a tough district some marginal districts\nAnd what they're hoping of course is that they can scare the hell out of everybody in northern Virginia\nA particularly the federal workers and others and the teachers are the usual unions and so forth to turn those people out to what they've done in the Democratic party is they have selected the most extreme radical Nancy Pelosi like candidate they possibly could\nAnd they're hoping to turn the entire area blue so it's crucially important let me speak to live in I sat there many conservatives out there as well I don't know it is crucially important that you come out and vote up and down the ticket and you come out and vote for Barbara Comstock\nUm she may not be as conservative as you like but she's not a radical cook like the like her opponent who clearly is and I've known you for decades and I know you're a person of integrity and ethics\nAnd I think it's very important that uh that the people come out and vote for you conservatives moderates independents at the Republican Party unite as the Republican Party's uniting all over the country 'cause this is a different kind of a lecture I'll give you a sixty more seconds\n[noise] well I I thank you mark a for highlighting and really talking about the issues that matter here and we just have a great opportunity now to continue on this path to prosperity that we have a great economy going and are strong military and national security so I thank you for highlighting that and\nYou know if I've got a plug for my website is Barbara Comstock for Congress dot com we are being outspent yet we're still say staying narrowly ahead are tied because\nPeople understand the good policy of getting more money back into your pockets back into your businesses\nYou know the pointing you know our our military and our

because they're building their parts more expensive why the terrorists we look at issues that could possibly affect\nAnd hurt the Republicans one of the things that we didn't talk about yesterday was the farmers farmers aren't happy because of the tariffs you may you may have destroyed family farms that have existed for a long time\nA big because you've taken away because of the terrorists taking away their supply chain yeah and as we told you win even though the president came out and said okay we're going to free up money for them they said that's not going to save us right because that doesn't that doesn't make up for the last ... and the fact that we're not we're going to be shut out of the supply chain\nThat for ... and we don't know for how long I mean are they could lose their

good morning from\nSo uh yeah here we are here we go um were inside of a two weeks now well it will be ... it will be two weeks from right now that will be ... analyzing\nA you know everything that that has gone on I mean there are ... you get every single day I mean I saw\nYou know that uh oh okay that looks like now that the Republicans are going to lose the house yesterday but then I saw other articles dating well no that's not the case and that's why we'll bring you the polls and will tell you what they say\nWe really don't make predictions what we will tell you is the issues and the events that we believe will affect the outcome of the election yeah uh I've always said for me it's very hard\nTo figure out what people are going to do on election day for me just go and everything the pollsters may ... you know believe in some of the pollsters do get a get a dump a you know pretty good especially in a presidential election but they've missed major elections as they did for example in Ninety or where they weren't even\nClose over the summer on a national poll the Democrats had ten point lead over the Republicans now it's down to four so we'll see where that goes within two weeks for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nIf you're not familiar with the term nor Easter it's what a good portion of the east coast calls a pretty significant storm with wins out of the north and east\nAnd that's what's moving up along the east coast today and steering those wins right into the shores of New York New Jersey on the Delmarva where the heavy rain and the region today from the Carolinas all the way up through well at least Long Island\nAnd then back into the Appalachians as far as near Columbus ohio a good part of the country though is drive from the Mississippi all the way over to the Rockies will see clear skies today for the northern central and southern plains including Texas\nThe Bible that my tax rate in my town is higher than a quite a bit higher than yours I Believe I'm a\nYeah my my tax rate is is very low which is why it's one of the most attractive areas in terms of people moving to it um but even aside from that if you've got a a home that's worth more than ... where's your your taxes are higher\nAnd would have already right so when when you see that and you see the number of of of people and and remember ... ... ... the the the people that will be at that age\nUh aren't we're not talking the super rich were I hotline about what is viewed in many of these high income areas as solid Republican voters who are in the middle to upper middle class\nRight and they're getting hit and they don't like it and\nTheir only recourse right now there's still a supporter of Trump what's their records to send the message by Republican congressman and we've always we worried about that from the very beginning\nI don't know how it's going to affect I'm simply bringing up the issues out there that when it comes to people's individual budget when it comes to bend paying more money I don't care who you are nobody wishes to do that and even though won't change everybody's vote\nIt has the potential of changing five percent of the vote yeah which makes the entire difference in a house election\nYou just followed it has the potential of changing five percent of the boat yeah which makes the entire difference in a house election so that's that's a you know that's one thing we've talked about the Democrats and we've talked about what what they face the whole cabinet thing\nI'm just the insanity that has come a out of the uh the the Democrats the ... the the the fact that they plan and this is the one thing that may ... that is they're coming out bluntly and saying we're going to raise taxes\nSo many of them coming out now I'm going to raise taxes now we're going to raise taxes now we're going to raise taxes now we're going to raise the corporate tax going and we need to raise taxes more we need to raise taxes they're actually admitting where they're going to raise taxes and which could hurt that we've also talked about the care of it\nRight in the ... in the Republican Party that's one I'm yesterday auto auto dealers see slower sales sparking fears that along expected declined is here now the economy overall\nMay not be an end and the terrorists overall may not change a significant portion of people voting in this election\nBut it will change those small business people that are being affected and\nA caterpillar a worse at the the the caterpillar story then they're they're being blunt the terrorists are killing us but the steel in an automobile the steel and aluminum tariffs by the way that this isn't a China thing\nRight it's the United states and Europe and and and Mexico that they're still in effect ... and it's killing them it's raising the price as we said\nWhen the president came out and said there I delivered for you I gave you the I gave you the the new NAFTA or whatever you wish to call it nobody's using the new name by the way [laughter] All right\nAnd and uh the his you know and the only success that that he claimed\nThe the biggest thing that he promoted was what he did to the automobile business and we said that's unbelievable but he's promoting the fact that he has raised the cost of buying an automobile in the United states Mexico and Canada and that's viewed as a good thing\nWas a story last week about forward grumbling going to be losing a billion dollars mhm they believe the terrorists are guns that are hurting them remember every supplier and every small business that deals with Ford in the United states knows that that's coming\nOr or or a feeling it already and every dealership and every deals that remember the steel tariffs really been affects that we're from China which has increased across from the beginning of the year that's actually that's actually nine months ten months old now because the steel prices were up forty percent by the time we got\nTo June of this year so you look at that you look at the fact that automobiles are going to go up in price because of steel costs and now because of terror of cause and because of the new NAFTA\nAh and then the farmers as we mentioned in the last break the farmers that are being hit and you're talking about your your talk if you're talking about\nA manufacturing people with manufacturing jobs that have technical skills\nTon of those people are Trump supporters if you talk about the farmers you're talking Trump\nCountry and you're talking about farmers that are dream Lee upset because it's not only their current profits\nBut it's the fact that they may be shut out of the supply chain that took them decades to get into and now it's disappeared you made the comment you said a in our ... and you sort of wonder if that's\nWhy he went to you know even though it was wishy washy ethanol plan I Wonder if that's why he went to Iowa because Frank internal polls are saying you're getting killed with the farmers right now at it as\nA couple of weeks ago because I Will would be basically the center of the corn belt but the farm belt it it's not that everything is about the the votes in Iowa or any election in Iowa it's that you're trying to reach that region when you go to Iowa you're speaking to the industry\nThe farming industry not just a ethanol and corn but it's the farming industry uh you you want to reach out with that saying we're going to help the farmers\nAre and and you know in this region in this area in the state\nAnd I don't know what you do in terms of of ah of reconnecting the supply chain this is what they're worried about\nOr they need to have those farmers those companies need to have trade partners all around the globe and when those trade partners for instance when Mexico a set up a port trade with with Canada or\nAny nation that they're selling to those farmers\nIf they're going to a different direction as a result of a threat of a tariff or a terrifying that went into place or or any of that if they have to make arrangements a lot of time around the time you don't get that back right away you're not you're not going to get that business back right away and\nThat's the concern that this is why the farmers came out a couple of weeks ago and said look ah thanks but no thanks on this you know a four point seven billion dollar a handout we need the business the business is worth a lot more\nRight it's still not making up for what our losses are right and we're ... we're we're ... we're out of the loop of the supply chain now we don't know when we're going to get back in ... I took a deck I think one of the ... was it took us decades to get into the world's supply chain now are viewed as unreliable because they don't know what you will do\nRight uncertainty as a killer this is what we saw after the recession\nThe problem with bailing out old with banks were are putting money into all the banks the coffers of all the banks by the federal government or during the recession or in two thousand they to the end of two thousand eight and into a two thousand nine they there were three apparently large banks that were on the brink that we're a\nPossible high risk but they didn't want to run on those things so they put money in all of the coffers well then it made all the banks look risky and that's the problem you create you muddy the waters well when you talk about trade\nTrade deals between nations that are set up\nUm you don't you don't reconnect that bridge it's like blowing up a bridge and believing you could rebuild it repair it tomorrow\nYou can't\nThat's going to take a lot of planning that's going to take a lot of reassuring but if there's political uncertainty\nAnywhere in that\nThen your former customers are going to stick with someone else a another nation in this case mhm and they're going to get their supply chain repaired\nAnd our discussion right now is not really so much on the the the substance of the economics of it it's more of the politics of\nWhat is going to be affecting this this uh election we talked a lot yesterday about how the Republicans in so many ways\nWere set up in a way that you don't see a political party ... in a midterm election with a ton of positives and de opposition political party that the Democrats are in a complete mess\nAnd that there are many things because the the economy right now but the majority of Americans\nPolitical party that the Democrats or a complete mess\nAnd that there are many things because the the economy right now but the majority of Americans looks really good mhm well we're talking about is the ... you know in the the impacts that starting to be felt now and making investors very were wary and a core\nConstituency of the of of Trump supporters which are the farmers that aren't happy at all now so even though there's a lot of good for Republicans right now there is still bad lurking out there\nUh when it comes to economics that there are Trump supporters that are extremely wary about where he is you know where he may be taking\nA you know the their particular economy and what's gonna happen to their livelihood so we think it's very important to bring up all the issues that may be affecting this election both positive and negative for the Democrats and positive and negative for the Republicans just to give you a more

Radio Welcome to the show high\n[noise] I tell you a long time ago you guys are awesome thing to point out something that you and they let it probably do not think about or see ah the rhetoric side of it with ... or it's fate and all the other things like that the\nYounger people there are all round Eighteen a lot of them love that\nI talked to a [noise] like that or whether in that are bad\nYeah yeah we we lost we lost about half of that and we've got a bad reception there I I don't know about that I you know that\nThe bats anecdotal evidence and we're talking about influencing votes really we're talking about likely voters or the Eighteen year olds aren't in the likely voter category right now for this particular mid term they're certainly not so there may be something they're on social media\nAh that's one thing but the the problem with it is again for people that you know we're looking at at certain issues and concerns\nUh they've got to know that uh you know and and they're undecided during the center they've got to know that they can you know that they can safely you know cast that boat and that's what you're trying to do it you know you don't want it you don't want to jump into something where again it's\n[noise] it's unnecessary it's it's not a positive I've always\nUh yeah I've I've always been about getting every when you possibly can and once you have the when a accentuate the positive about way in which would ban and go after Evan Eddie\nRight yes because ... I mean we've seen it he's a liar\nUm he's a he's ... and and by the way these lawyers that have lined up against Trump you know he can go after them as a group and include having that he in that and and there's a there's there's nothing wrong with that or he can go after them and\nBe I I mean that that's something that's an effective tactic that you know does work\nBecause it's true he doesn't have to make anything up I mean he he doesn't have to call anybody names you call Evan Eddie a liar well that's just that's just true or that the guy brought a nothing lawsuit against you it was baseless then you've got again you've got something\nThat if you go you're going to bring you go to the baseless lawsuit you'd go to the um uh ... you go to a a a cabin on and you say these are the people that are against me right and to me I I people say well what do you mean that's a well no that's a positive uh what came out ... of the news story that\nYou get you get the help from the left you get the capital of thing you get the care of and thing you get all these other things that\nYou know and and of course uh you know I'm a Cory bookers plan\nA you get the you know Camilla Harris plan you know this is what they want to do or the or or work or or any of that you know there are promoting this but that's not going to work we're promoting this and look what's working you can demonstrate that your ideas are working and you can point out where there aren't going to work and\nThat's something that is extremely rare in politics even with ah other effective presidents of the past you know you can show already a track record of getting things done that are helping the economy\nYou know and and that's it and and and by the way I I Do want to um\nClarify you know we've criticized the former President Obama speaking in Nevada ... on yesterday's show or when you know because he said don't forget who started this and I think he's right we shouldn't Donald Trump started this economy we shouldn't forget who started this all your writing\nMr Obama or so the the the whole thing is again you you you have those positives stay on them because what is the rally\nWhat is a rally a rally is a a ton of positives and the map this massive group of euphoric people that are ready to take action\nYou know that's that's where ... if you think about it every day on social media should be that rally between now and November I mean it's not that you have to have positives you can go after Chuck Schumer writing\nBuddy ... because I I think it's very important to understand that in the real political world I mean you'll have the purest out there saying I'm against the negative advertising this ridiculous right of course you have to point out one ounce and you've got you've got a point out the negatives of your uh you know of your candidate you have to point out the negatives that\nThe government can't give you all the Iran right that somebody is lying to you when they tell you that they can make it a beautiful like the frustration that our last caller ab all solve crime may not related right well so that that that is then that's why I started to have if I started laughing because\n... you know that has been going to happen you have to point out and and I believe in times you have to give blood is we've gotten London passionate about it during the Kavanaugh hair instead it's unacceptable to us and we've been blunt\nThen you're not an American\nThat if you ... if you don't believe in the mindset of due process even for capital\nYou know they were and the Democrats are trying to we use a lot of that in every well [laughter] it's it's not accord a lot it was a political court where people were put under oath and people were put under old under threat of perjury if they lied and it was not a criminal court it was not a civil court but\nIt was a political court that had much\nOf the same enforcement mechanisms that a criminal court has when you testify right and and so a a a a person's reputation\nIs at stake it was a political court and yes Americans expect fairness and they expect due process Democrats said we don't believe in due process we believe it's very important to bring up the fact\nThat they don't believe in the first amendment they don't believe in the second amendment they now don't believe in due process under the law they don't believe a presumption of innocence\nIf you're not on their side the American civil liberties union has just shocked away\nAny pretense of carrying about Americans and our civil liberties and they just made it clear during the cabinet hearings we don't care we point out in a very passionate ways you can see I get passionate about this because I think it's very important to point out\nThat people say well I you know it's it's offensive if you tell somebody they're not paid for it because they believe there are a patriot well know there are some standards\nOf why you are a patriot there are some standards of why you are an American I mean what makes you an American it's the fact that you believe in the constitution if you reject the basic tenants of the constitution if you reject free speech if you were jak freedom of religion if you will if you were jak\nThe second amendment if you reject a due process under the law if you were jak the electoral college if you reject the Senate\nAnd and you wish to change all of it then you don't believe in America I mean I don't know what else to say you're right it's it's not and people said what's a shocking thing that you're saying\nNo it's not they're the ones that are shocking by claiming what do you believe in America we're just against the basic tenants of the constitution of the United states mhm well that's what America is\nYes that's that's it bomb you and\nWhat they're trying to say is a well it's like when they say no we believe in free speech ... no you don't it's your side that says that if I use the the the wrong pronoun in California that there's a penalty ultimately of going to jail\nThat free speech oh\nNo no no see your free speech as bigoted your freedom of religion as bigoted\nAnd and so no we believe me we believe in negative you know this isn't about the fact that you know that you need to that you need not to point out in a very blunt manner [laughter]\nWhat the opposition is for and what they really stand for\nAnd the fact that you you know you can point out and you can tell people this is what's wrong with them\nAnd you can probably say yes this is negative campaigning because what they're doing is negative to this country mhm because they don't believe in the basic tenants of this country and so yeah nobody's saying that you have to be nice to them all the time no no our point you know when you have\nThe way and then move onto the next when well again I think we'll\nGet to win for calling out a O'Rourke or a Schumer or any of them to me those those are positives when you're calling out what they're promoting\nAnd saying look what I'd done look at look at what we've been able to do in such a short time and what we're doing right now with the economy and look what they want to do with it and back to and\nAnd the other end by the way and sometimes the name calling the the slogan name calling or the nickname calling is very effective [laughter] liar Lanny I now I made that went up I don't know I'm not making use of the ones I I don't want to get ...\nWas a ... was it I don't know\nYou went to see when you thought you said sure I forgot what it was just ... yeah I bought a use somebody's got those listed somewhere all day like names ... no ... we've said this oh well now it's for people in office it's running it's beautiful ... is that line said any more [laughter] and as far as we know that\nFor people in office it's running it's beautiful ... it's not like that anymore [laughter]\n\nAnd and as far as we know the president ... Walker believes that Mr Cruz's father involved and they have a cat [laughter]\nAs far as we know about but but look I'm we said before I thought one of the greatest um in terms of theatrics but have a point to something solid was him sitting at that table with an empty seat\nAnd the and the name of of of that was the on one side and as you were on the other that was the best oh my gosh that's brilliant and he I mean that's something that works really is a big word but\nThat's something that's it it's effective they're not showing up they're not here at the party\nI'm trying to work with them they don't want to work with me it was a brilliant political moment\nYes because it's real simple it's it's brilliant in its simplicity that you're showing your demonstrating that you've invited them and they're they're not showing up that's what that represented\nKeep in mind the former president didn't invite members of his own party from Capitol Hill to come in and that that's not from us\nThat's from Chris Matthews she didn't like working with Democrats he didn't like\nBecause he he believed he could do a lot of ... by the way that was also rich we didn't pointed out of the comments he was making\nYou know it's not about one man ... really [laughter] a recess appointment really it's not about one man Mr I don't need Congress to get things asked Mr recess appointment down down nine nothing yeah exactly and there was a free court when when you lose James Byrd\nWhen you're a liberal president that that last Ginsburg stoner sorry\nThat a little too much and I'm thinking you were trying to do it on your own their eight six six Ninety read I\nWas told that he ... he wrote a [noise]\n\nIf you have driven over one million preventable accidents three miles been registered to joined the million mile club on line I read I radio show dot com red eye radio in our sponsors support your safety on the highway\nTruckers quick question for you how\nDo you sing entertain when you're not on the road some truckers watch DVDs on laptops others just bring a book on their home some people even resorted trucks dub GV are spotty lifeline no thank you me I like to one line to the end of the day but live HDTV in my care\nAnd what does portable satellite Internet news it's easier than ever mounted to your roof are still until your day is over there and just shut them up in your sleep or cannot tenders or lightweight shut up and miniature ... daughter Clara on June\nBut it gets even butter reduced there is no longer TV contract disappearing as you go programming you pay for only the most you actually use check it out of this for my truck", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "27"}
