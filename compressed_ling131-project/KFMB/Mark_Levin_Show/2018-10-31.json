Congress said that so the interpretation by many legal experts in probably by many judges\nIs that since birthright citizenship was going on at the time and Congress says yes we agree with this and it's in the immigration and naturalization law we agree with the way the fourteenth amendment is written and it's been interpreted the wrong way\nStill chose Congress approves of it and the court may come out and say federal courts would probably come out and say because they would cherry pick them mhm and it would be you know a ... and they would come out and said nope sorry you can't get involved in it and in all likelihood\nBecause of that Nineteen fifty two congressional ruling there is a great chance that the Supreme Court would just say\n... as the Supreme Court has done before we're not going to get to the interpretation of it like it took over a ... too close to two hundred and ... was a right to two hundred and Thirty years before they ever\nSaid that the second amendment was an individual right two hundred and Thirty years but the Supreme Court to finally get to that point if you get don't get to the exact right case and write it in the exact same with the right way\nSo Congress has so many so the Supreme Court is forced to look at it they may just come back and say don't you don't have jurisdiction there ended up story\nAnd so you never actually get to whether the you know get to deciding what the original intent was like they did in Heller mhm for the for the second amendment ... and that's the problem\nSo in all likelihood we won't see it changed in my lifetime because of that right I I Wish we would\nBecause the original intent had nothing to do with illegal immigrants and and that and and children of illegal immigrants in this country that I ever did right eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nEight six six months he wrote on radio [noise]\n\nIf you have driven over one million preventable accident three miles been registered to joined the million mile club on line that red eye radio show dot com red eye radio and our sponsors support your safety on the highway\nEveryone eventually sees when trucks carrying side grocery store shelves goods down but community\nProducts that keep the business running for what they don't see is what the trucker carries inside you're driving your ... your pride would we do we see you\nKnow we see you carry a career that help support families communities\nWe see you carry the title the friend and neighbor [noise] parents have provider we see you carry the sacrifice and the perseverance of a job well\nEach was a determination to get the job\nWhat you carry inside\nBecause it's what's inside\nI tend to an owner operators you tired of chasing empty promises RSVP it looking for you to join the team offering a dollar Seventy five per mile for cello drivers or two dollars per mile for teams RSVP based on miles that had an back\nHome or not an airfield caddy Larry there no treatment rentals needed a male hidden secret how our I think the today an eighty eight RSVP three six five that's a A R S P three six five or a play on line and R.

poll six days out plus\nYour calls and and comments and we'll get a little bit more\nSpecific on the the whole fourteenth amendment a debate a yesterday you noticed that nobody has really saying that the original intent was to include illegal immigrants as you can I mean that the the fortune the man was passed after reconstruction it was about former slaves everybody knows that for ... electronics here's your forecast\nThere is a line of showers and thunderstorms today extending from Detroit down to Texas and we're going to see this line of showers continue to progress eastward slowly today\nAs the front becomes more pronounced will see the showers extend into Dallas in central Texas with some heavy thunderstorms likely for the architects today\nAnd the same band of showers will then move up through portions of Missouri southern Illinois central Indiana and northern Ohio to include Detroit and areas of northern New York Georgia and the Carolinas will be tried today but tomorrow will pick up shower some of the system\nSubject to a jurisdiction means more than simply being present in the United states\nWhere the fourteenth amendment was being debated in the Senate centered alive in Trumbull the key figure in its strapping an adoption stated that quote\nSubject to the jurisdiction of the United states meant not only know legions to anybody else send up quote mhm and senator Jacob Howard who introduced the language of the claws\nOn the floor descended contended that it should be interpreted in the same way as a requirement of the Eighteen sixties six civil rights act which reported citizenship to all persons born in the United states and not subject to any foreign power\nOr the\nSupreme Court has never decided otherwise now the problem is though as ah let\nMe see I've got the ... right here in the Eighteen Ninety eight ruling that that is being brought up by many people on the last two Ninety eight rolling in the long Kim arc case the Supreme Court held the children of non citizens when born on us territory are us citizens by birth however\nThe parents in question in the long case were legal immigrants meaning that the court did that they may have had it in their opinion but they did not address actually the status of children born to parents in the U.S illegally they made that claim but that was not\nA a case where they actually made you know a decision on it it was an opinion in a case but not directly involved in that case right that makes it at that point\nBeing is that the parents were here legally right the parents were here and even though they said it did\nIn in in a case but not directly involved in that case right that makes\nIt at that point being is that the parents were here\nLegally right the parents were here and even though they said it did cover it as he writes here he goes what the Supreme Court has held this is really not go back to Johnny spent\nThe Supreme Court has never held otherwise some advocates for illegal immigrants point to the Eighteen da da da da da da da and mark but that case merely helping a child born on us soil the parents who are lawful permanent legally dominance out residents\nWas a citizen even though they said in it they expanded it out that wasn't part of the law so they actually did not create legal precedent to that point right\nNow the only other problem that the the the president would have with that and and by the way I'm I'm from the and and I I Know you are to uh uh I'm from of course when you understood why they pass the fourteenth amendment to begin with\nYou know after reconstruction and you know it had to civil rights act of Eighteen sixties over right right where you knew that everybody knew it had to do with former slaves yes\nThat that's what\nThat's what it was all about because the parents of those children being born the children being born slaves the the parents in that case were not subject to any foreign jurisdiction\nNow that the problem is because uh I as I said I don't believe will see it in our in my lifetime I'd I'd be you know that's really a dump statement because who knows how long I'm going to live\nBut [laughter] but if I Lived Thirty years more All right let's throw out a figure who only Thirty years [noise] um you know I I I still don't think we'll we'll we'll see it because I think one of the road blocks is look the president's right I agree with the president on this\nUh but the problem is that Congress in Nineteen fifty two added to the immigration and naturalization act\nThey added a portion that basically agreed with the way\nThat the fourteenth amendment was written they said we agree with this this is the what immigration should be this now they didn't they didn't specify and they didn't say a children of illegal immigrants become citizens all they said was we agree with that\nAnd so the courts probably will look at that saying well since at that time they didn't say we disagree with how it's been interpreted and we disagree and the law should change and you know when it comes to illegal immigrants because they didn't make the change\nThat many judges in the federal system including the Supreme Court might just say well that's up to them to if they they interpreted that way or we go back to Eighteen Ninety eight and even though the the courts it's not technically legal precedent wasn't opinion\nAre based there that the court might just refuse to hear\n[noise] right\nAnd center act on it and it may never get to the point of talk of defining what jurisdiction mean eventual eat we will get a bench Lee someday we will get to it but it took two hundred and over two hundred and Thirty years to get to the ... was it to hell or two thousand eight\n'cause of two thousand eight\nOr nine thousand five two thousand I forgot about roughly two hundred and Thirty years if if I ate it took ... to finally had the Supreme Court interpret the second amendment that it was an individual right\nSo\nA two thousand it well time flies so that that's\nThe problem and that you you have you have to word it the exact same way I just don't don't see it but those are the legal challenges that you face right now that the Eighteen Ninety eight opinion that's\nNot law which uh again this is where the fourteenth amendment was not written specifically to address it as a true construction and she would look at it and say doesn't say it applies to non citizens\nAnd in order to apply in order and and you would need to that's how I Would do it as a construction is doesn't say it if you want to say it differently than say it differently but it but it doesn't include it\nBut will it ever get to that point where they even\nThe Supreme Court actually hears and the whole goal is to define what subject to the jurisdiction of the fourteenth amendment actually means will we ever get to that legal place\nIs my question Brian again I just I don't see it in the next Thirty years I'll Try that out for a drug\nBut it's a way to start the ball rolling [noise]\n... yeah I mean I I think ah it certainly brings up the the debate and we if if the president is you know going to take action near through executive order then you're going to see it and the courts the question is will the high court\nTake a case like this and and so when you look at the question yesterday where chuckle when I heard it I said well it's really the wrong question 'cause it's kind of president do this with executive order will of course he can if nobody challenges\nThat can do it effectively as the question and and right now he's not going to be able to do anything effectively ... the only thing is is that it was a political reaction to\nThe the care of him or to well illegal immigration in general um and and the president's not wrong or whether he's doing it now or any other time\nAnd the approach maybe that's the point maybe the whole point is let's see if we can if if this thing because they know full well it's going to be challenged\nAnd so at that point you you decide when you know you're going to announce this now we understand to the\nAh the political leverage that is is created quite possibly a by just the announcement of between you know now and and uh well six days for about the mid term\nBut beyond that it is also something\nThat I think in the current political climate that has to be discussed because ultimately what does it do\nNow it it it brings up the discussion but I think it gives us closer to and hopefully somebody on the right will\nPosition the Democrats to finally say that they're for open borders mhm so that's you know that's part of the I guess that's the political side of the effect of it the legal side of it will be interesting but it won't be quick\nTo this isn't going to happen\n[noise] uh uh the the executive order will come out and it will be immediate an injunction immediately will be paying you know mediate block from the courts right\nAnd then they will go into the courts and it will sit there for however long it takes to get ... and I don't go to see if it ever get right\nAnd this is something that I I I again I doubt it would be fast tracked no because because it's it's not like to travel ban right\nI I I again I doubt it would be fast tracked no because because it's it's not like to travel ban right that affected people immediately right\nSo it would feel that they would would write what what what you could make the the executive branch could make the case and the travel ban that there was a an immediate threat\nThat we had people traveling from certain parts of the world that had been trained and that were coming here and that yeah it was reasonable to review that process that travel process from those parts of the world\nAnd and that was something that they could make the case for in this case it's not that kind of wild many conservatives might say look at it is a it's an immediate threat or has been a threat for a long long time the problem is well get technically it has been for you know a hundred and fifty plus years but\nIt is not something that is going to be fast tracked because it it just it is not adding any kind of knew immediate threat we understand what's going on with the hospitals on the border I Know that growing up on the board I Know exactly what their burden with and

a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those men and it has to end\nOne is ridiculous and it has to end but you can't it's just so that the ... am seven sixty\nEven definitely goes with it an act of Congress now they're saying I can do is just was an executive I certainly\nThink that if the president were assigned such an executive order and I hope it will be carefully fared this would be in the Supreme Court pretty quickly talk and breaking news\n[noise]\n\nInternet\nRadio waves are currently I'm Jerry McNamara will ah continue to take a look at uh the the different culture a throughout the week in throughout the show as we uh we always do also coming up here in just a a little bit uh what's destroying the planet your pet\nI knew it I've been watching her for a while she goes out and she you know especially on a sunny day she'll she'll lay on the grass she's just trampling the grass just laying all over you know and she's not a small dog\nAnd bad ... says that if the Democrats don't win the house she's going to move to Canada I thought all the celebrities will be out as soon as they said hey pot legal\nWell here's the thing what she's saying that in January 'cause right now you know if you look at ... five thirty eight then a ... you know what I mean is that one of those same things to say\nShe no she doesn't have to leave right I'm going to pretend that I'm going to leap best right like way we are bad look we know the Democrats are going to take the house we know that okay I'm going to make this proclamation well\nBut what does she think is the you know I mean what what would be the the the goal was saying that I mean what you think that is going to do that people are gonna go man we better get out and vote for a Democrat otherwise Barbra Streisand gonna move to Canada\nYes I I Can't live in a country that bad doesn't live in\nI guess [laughter]\nI Can't [laughter]\nI just I Can't I Will but that I mean because that's really if you think about it that's the underlying\nUh you know I guess far behind saying something like that\nThat she's going to protest\nCountry or for a long time yeah it's amplified now because social media exists so it seems like it's worse than ever remember when you use to personally insult a politician we used to have duels in this country\n\nYou will be challenged to a dual so that actually existed and and so yeah we don't deal with it but we understand we don't deal with that type of rhetoric on the show it's not how we want to explain we have\nA we have told people that agree with you know majority opinions that we have who sometimes use those tactics we believe it's wrong\nThat the left has to use it because they don't have anything to argue they can't argue the substance of the issues we can there's no need for us to do that they need to do it because\nThey're lost ... lost their last uh but when it comes down to it when you want to see the different reaction\nOf right there the letters that were sent now the castor bean is themselves were not toxic but it doesn't matter from what we know or the FBI still hasn't said whether those were live explosives or not in fact we know one of them was not the one cent to CNN\nRight we know that was not a but when you look at it\nWhen you look at the reaction of the media to similar instances one ... and those are the these are envelopes sent to the politicians in power right now and two appointed individuals' in our military and the CIA\nWas there anything on CNN where they were blaming the left\nAnd that was there anything on Fox where they were blaming the left for no no it was just quiet story came out of people moved up you know people moved on mhm said OK yeah brought brought back memories we talked about it brought back memories of nine eleven and then we moved on oh good\nLooks like they caught the guy but now the charges officially filed last week during all the\nThe uh uh coverage of a you know the um the mail bomb scare ...\nWere they treated the same by the media are those were not biased we're not biased you can be biased by including one story and making accusations against one party on one story that shouldn't be related to them at all\nYou ignore the other story mhm\n\n[noise] yeah I mean it it was not it it's it's as if okay yeah that happens fine I'm comes with the territory as Don Lemon right might say\nAnd that's it\nNow it's a given that high profile individuals politicians and presidents are going to be a target of a number of attempts\nTwice the secret services in place for presidents and it's why most people even if they're not serving the public there the even in the private sector or they're they have a high level very high level of security\nBut the point is is that the the media went all over\nWhen it works for when they believe it works for their side they stay on it for a long long time they will it ... it is the story but it doesn't work for them politically if it's the other way around\nIf the other side is targeted and\nWe can send that reminder to a ... of what happens is the skull east and the attempted assassination of multiple Republicans that's something uh Don limited CNN apparently needs to be reminded of\nYeah yeah I saw that yesterday that did come up yeah yeah and ... a a a ... yeah I really have to you know to that one right\n\nWell the interesting thing is as they talk about the fact that hate pulling spiteful about rhetoric and Anthony ended up is what causes these murders and then that's exactly\nWhat they proceed to do that I was at the ah MSNBC is a a contributor Steve\nSchmidt ... said conservative radio host like rush and mark within have blood on their hands for mass shootings and other crimes perpetrated by crazy people he also included judicial watch news busters judicial watch Breitbart judicial watch\nTraditional watch\nAll they do is to get the landlord nation to the people they're not ... if you look at what judicial watch is it's about getting information I specifically documents right documented evidence or information to the American people\nOh oh oh\nForget it [laughter] and we can't have that [laughter] that\nSee because the point would be from the left well you are you know you're you're part of the problem so you get people motivated by how well the world\nWould\nJudicial watch could get someone motivated to do something violent and any of the others by the way up are mentioned in yet within that list but right you can't put judicial watch up in terms of controversy the only\nControversy there is the only debate there's between the people who want the truth of the people who don't\n\nIn terms of why they exist and their attempt in their mission statement\n\nHas anybody ever debated anything that they have been able to uncover any documents that they have been ... been able to ah to essentially bring to light\nWell I heard that uh you know mark Levin dissected the fourteenth amendment in the constitution today so certainly he has blood on his hands right explaining the Constitution's ... how dare he [laughter] [noise]\nWell but here's the thing by the way some people do of mark works for the same company that we do yes but the people know that but yes\nBut so no one at at MSNBC or CNN\nSome people do of mark works for the same company that we do but the people know that but yes\n'em but so no one at a MSNBC or CNN or any of the others are response no\nNo no just [laughter] or you would have to come out and and then accused them of course being we're responsible for the attempted multiple assassination on that ball field on that day were ... was shot\n\nBy a if you say one side is responsible you have to say the other side to me there's no way to ignore that you can try to ignore that but you just look stupid doing yeah\nBut I what I just I Love and ... is the fact that as they denounced the fact that heated rhetoric causes people to commit murder mhm they just keep an open it up with wild and insane and crazy accusation\nYeah well what Michael Moore say revving up wrap it up so here you go that's response will wrap it up\nThat's ridiculous so uh so that would mean also that Twitter and Facebook and social media that'll response to have to go the right I don't have to go free speech is the problem or anything that that any of these individuals who are actually responsible for this anything that they participate in\nHis response right well know anybody that they disagree with right yeah\nWell I mean I'm Talking about if if this person ... saying that your you know that that uh that that talk radio and\nBy the way that the way he calls in just she'll watch uh he's he's labeled a former Republican strategist but he has no conservative and he's no no you know he maybe he may be somebody who's uh he he may be a case\nLike John Case a wildly absent of critical thinking right\nWe can just end up there you can\nCall himself what whatever he wants to have you noticed the number of people that call themselves Republican strategist yeah and conservative who are not any that maybe they claim they were at one time but they're not anything close to it but they wish to keep the label\nWell we get that we've had that for years on this program because I'm a conservative but and then the boom of liberal view yeah you are not now nor have you ever been a conservative\nEight six six Ninety run I\nWas told that he ... he wrote a [noise]\nBe a part of the conversation by calling the
