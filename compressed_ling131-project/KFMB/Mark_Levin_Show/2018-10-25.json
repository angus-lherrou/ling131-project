[noise]\n[noise]\n\nA threat I radio he is Eric hardy and I'm ... eight six six Ninety read\nI welcome and a good morning I'm I just I just want to address an email that I got yesterday because um [laughter]\nIt was just too good because we we were talking about economic things yesterday and we're talking about uh the uh you know the uh uh a corporate tax mhm and and as we said before I keep forgetting we always get new listeners but but uh I'd made the comment as we've made before that corporate taxes hurt the poor the most\nFamous person she wrote me just completely baffled by what do you mean those are the corporations I had to explain to them\nNo or\nYou pay everything that a corporation is when you see\nIs financed by the consumer everything right uh their their their profits are financed by you\nEverything's financed by by ... money to pay their taxes right the the taxes to corporate taxes are paid by you the consumer your the consumer pay for their expenses because if you if you if that's not the case they're gone right so a corporate tax is they still tax on the consumer you don't see it directly\nAnd therefore who does it hurt the most who has the least expendable income the poor for cobra electronic here's your forecast\nBoth heavy showers in southern Texas will continue to slowly move eastward throughout the evening\nAnd into the day on Thursday we'll see that area of low pressure hug the Gulf Coast and provide heavy rains from Houston over to New Orleans so I can certainly\nYou only the windshield wipers on through a good portion of the south as this system continues to move eastward we'll see the heavy rains into the deep south by tomorrow\nAnd you know I've got a couple of emails from a yesterday show you know and I'm Talking about well you think the people who are really going to be turned off by the horse race thing and blah blah blah blah blah blah you know these people are with them they hold on a second you missed part of the conversation we're not talking about the people that are already on board we're talking about the people in the middle\nThat win elections for you right that's true you need to convince you've got to go sell the brand essentially to put it in the president's ah you know we'll house to shoot my customers by the\nBy the way I don't know I I I answered the the one email from the one woman who wrote that\nThe the the one that because it sounds like that's when you're relating yeah mine was from a guy but but I'll get my mind you up at the end and it was the same thing and and I answered you know and I answer back I said look I'm Talking about you arrive yeah this is going to change it I'm not talking about my I wasn't talking about my opinion I was talking about right somebody else who told me\nWho was a supporter and we were talking about the possibilities of what could harm and move independence one way or another and the argument was it's not going to change their anybody that I Know well no that's not the point\nThat it's not you're not you're not part of that you're you're already in the restaurant eating you need you need to build a business out this is this is exactly what the president can do\nAnd this is unique to this president by the way because the Republicans we've been screaming for years can't get their message across and if they could get it across if they could go out there and promote that message a very simple message then they could get\nOut they could they could gain more seats instead of losing seats and this was back then not right there early now\nAnd they could they could gain more seats instead of losing seats and this was back then not right there early now we're talking about getting a message across to people who have not been fully convinced yet if you've been fully convinced\nWe've already made that point you're not the one that we're talking about you're not part of that group\nThe the Republicans but more importantly the president right now or they're capable together of getting real things done\nThan they need to get our message out there there is this\nAnd and we continue to have to fight this all the time were where we get people to call well you guys think that you can convince everybody that we don't know who that's never been the goal to convince everybody but there are people that\nLook people [laughter] people evolve every day it's not maybe not be the majority of the population but people learn every day and a teacher's politicians how many look look one of the great one of the greatest things some of the greatest callers we get are people that have called the show and upset you know I used to think this way\nAnd then I started ... you know listening to you guys and other people in this politician and this guy and\nYou know you you referenced some people and I gave them a listen to on economics and I realize I changed my mind completely ... people change their mind you're not trying to get everybody to change your mind them you're trying to get that that person in the middle\nAnd we were talking about specifically yesterday undecided it's about it's the political strategy of always growing in your basement never being satisfied with what you have\nAlways trying to grow it\nAnd we believe if you promote free markets conservative economics conservative principles and you explain it in a simple way\nA nation that largely remains and we're not talking to you who are listening to the show you have sought us out you saw it on shows like this you've sought out information life is so we're not referring to you you're already you're already aboard but when there are new people and we get them all the time\nAnd you are able to introduce them to different ideas\nThere is a segment of the population that's willing to listen it might only be five percent but that five percent makes the difference\nIt almost probably ... I Would guess Ninety five percent of elections out there that is the goal the goal is to win that the goal is not to get an immediate satisfaction because our candidate ... news a little bit more heated rhetoric than the other candidate we understand that\nAnd that's what I Love when people runners you guys don't understand the frustration out there you're kidding me in terms of if you\nLiked but just what you like to sit in this chair for the last almost Thirty years Mm [laughter] oh no it's always it's always complete peace and quiet here [laughter] yeah right but that's what it is a in a conservative radio talk show host for the last Thirty years yeah\nIt's really an Tom [laughter] it's always a very high scenario it's like doing constant yoga all the time at a table and oh it's like sitting on a beach so like that just\nSitting there and I'm ... I I got friends in St Thomas sending their version island saint Thomas speech a what a nice day that's what it is day after\nDay yes cures and and so the goal is is is the goal to get that satisfaction of getting that hangs out every day at the other side that you disagree with and you believe is unfair\nIn some cases evil no that's not our goal\nLook after them on the issues go after them with with uh you know with everything you've got on the issues and spell out where their plan is wrong or what they're doing is wrong and and be very clear about it that's part of it\nBut the rhetoric because it doesn't need to be the ... the point is is that you feel like there's this limited window and that the the the windows closed and it just might here within two weeks and so the point being is that\nBecause we've been doing good so long and we've seen the do nothing Republicans time after time where they've had I mean mess of doors just wide open for them\nBut you've got to get a consistent message out think about where we are right now in terms of social media and communications we have the ability to communicate twenty four seven any given person can be communicating ... you can set\nThe messages are ahead of time to automatically go out while you're sleeping you can you can communicate right now around the clock\nGet the message out while you've got the economic wins or create some more of those economic wins and you're building again the base you're trying to get more people into the base that aren't on board already what frustrates\nMe is understanding that the left uses the heat of heated rhetoric that they that they use they do that out of desperation they can't win on the issues they're angry it's the only thing that they have left because they're they're angry and I understand\nThat on you know the other side on on the side that I'm most closely relate to\nThat it gets frustrating because they're always just so angry and they were spewing out their hatred\nTowards you and you want to attack back we don't need to because the reason that they're doing it is because they don't have the substance of their ideas behind them and they're frustrated as hell mhm we don't need to act\nThe way that they do they need to that's the only way they've got nothing else they need to be that way we don't need to be that way some of us choose to be that way we don't need to be that way because we have the substance to back up our ideas that they\nWork well well you know here's here's the you know where where they've gone as a party there former leader was in Nevada and the other night and we've gone over the years from that speech at the DNC in two thousand six or two thousand for\nA to him becoming president in two thousand eight on hope and change to just the other night Nevada bill ... who vote on oil almost it was it because it became if you think about it it's not even a political tactic what what do you\nWhat I Would have expected to hear from you know the great or greater\nBrock Obama this big speech built on principles and it was basically if you guys don't get out and vote they're going to win adapt well okay thanks captain obvious we already know that\nDon't boo vote I'm OK but can you can you\nCan I add one benefit and as we said a total lack of substance on actually hitting the the the issues that's the difference look at you know we've talked about how we don't like to political ideology on either side and but I Do under ...\nUsually hitting the the the issues that's the difference look at you know we talked about how we don't like to get political ideology on either side and but I Do understand that because of political ideology on on the left\nIs based purely on personality and on the right it's not I still don't like political idea I I just don't like political I doubt if we worship a candidate and it's still always has bothered me but the fact is I Do understand if you have great admiration for somebody who is promoting certain principles and ideas\nRight that are that are specific\nAnd work and promote freedom and liberty yet then I get it but as you said you saw and I think you you made a great thing Obama was almost begging the other day for what you saw was\nThe shell of\nThe Democrat Party which is the other night which is no ideas just imagery and simple as yet\nExcept for free stuff\nYeah yeah for every ... art eight six six Ninety read I\nRead on radio with a record ...

revolution and you know they've got all the all the answers\nThey'll make you know John John John John Saddam we said that the president and the Republicans were making progress than they are and so what we want them to do is be able to focus on that message and keep the message going it's that simple\nStatement made about long lasting or anything else like we didn't say anything but of course I could I could defeat you on that because I pointed out uh with you know Kevin ... and Gorsuch you have to construct yeah you're\nRight on the knowledge that right and\nAnd you know that we want we we were the ... we were the first to say that in the executive branch should we look at Obama most about Obama done has been dismantled because if you don't use the legislature if you used executive orders ... uh in order to run your executive branch instead of trying to get legislation passed through by legislative branch yeah it's not going to be long term but the tax cuts could be long term\nWell and and here's the thing to what did you have with the tax cuts in in the uh the while not retaliatory but the the response from the Democrats was what\nNot that we're gonna take it back to you know thirty five percent we're gonna we're gonna take it to one eighty five percent\nRemember right almost right away what we need to raise that we need to raise it to twenty five percent what ... what was the Republicans that weren't even saying twenty five percent during the whole discussion on it and we didn't think they would get anywhere close to Twenty one percent so it's you know this this whole thing\nOf of being long lasting a good economy is not going to be defeated\nBecause the American people want to keep it going\nI'm the last administration tried that they've tried everything they could to step in the way of private sector you didn't build that that was their attitude that was the attitude by the former administration but the the fact of the matter is is private sector built all of it the roads the bridges and business\nIs that right but the the story that their referencing doesn't actually say that they could turn out to be the case and maybe National Review has sources of their own but they're not sourcing they're not using those source ... from the a P right\nYou know so it it's just because the problem is is with with if you're going to you know that if that are in the echo chamber of social media especially if that false information misleading information is going to be out there\nThan it is you know it it starts to become or build a narrative in the wrong direction\nIf you start on the wrong premise everything that follows a may sound logical but it still is built on that false premise so you know we just ... and we have a great deal of respect for the people over at National Review yeah events but it was an oversight here in my opinion because that's not what the Associated Press story all\nI can understand that because when I read it the first time mhm that's what I said do you write I said oh there's there's I'm reading here says the ... and then I read it again I went oh it's not what the ...\nWas Washington Post on there headline had it right there headline habit that the powder that was sent along with them there was harm you know a along with the suspicious package was harmless and and so the the point being is that\nThat the narrative is going to grow obviously politically it's going to grow and and build and and still continue up until election day if not past that and you don't you don't do any good by you know repeating false information now\nPeople are going by their trust of National Review\nYou know based on the headline which which National Review to me is extremely credible ... at the time I I don't know maybe it's too late by mistake whatever or like I said when I first read it mhm that's what I told us it or if they're saying the bomb was harmless but this was in our ... not on the air\nAnd then realize oh no that's not what they're saying if you read the sentence again they're separating the sentence and Associated Press separates the two yes\nAnd then says pipe bomb now again we don't know there is that's the one thing that we've talked about which again which is when we went through all the different questions that you would ask and the questions that and and that's why it's very important to find out you know whether they were you know ... whether they were active\nBombs that could have gone off and could have gone off and would have gone on\nA ... you know and and whether they would have gone off because of the time or or whatever\nOr were they set to go off and what they've gone off or where they just explosive materials that would not have gone off or would we find out that they actually were not explosive materials and actually weren't bombs that they were fake bombs because at that point you would look at it and the questions that you would ask is an investigator would be different\nIf they were all fake bombs than they were meant to just scare mhm or they were meant to be used as a political statement mhm well who would benefit if they were all fake bombs and they were sent prayed political statement would be the next question that you would ask right\nAnd so again we don't know and that's why we are when\nWe talked about you know CNN and others blaming Trump\nFor all of this incredible divisiveness which caused this and as we said don't even realize the irony that they're saying the divisiveness must stop but yet they create the maximum divisive this\nBy blaming somebody for an incident where they don't have the fact they don't know we have no idea\nYeah the motivation behind the the the uh the person or persons\nNobody has any idea and they create this same divisiveness claiming that they're against the advice of this and it's exactly what they're doing how many times a week on the left doing that it's like [laughter]\nWe're accusing you of something which is exactly what we're doing\nYeah right well anyway specially without knowing all the facts here\n\nYou know they're trying to put a puzzle together with without all the pieces\n\nThat we've got to ... in fact until they find we may never know the motivation if they don't find the person responsible and even if they do sometimes you don't know motivation you it takes a great deal of a detective work\nAnd I know sources of said they believe it's the same you know right people are ... percent or group of people based on which area which again that that the number of the number of of\nAh devices that you send out is more evidence that the FBI can can use I wouldn't be surprised at the FBI or wouldn't be at all surprised if they solve isn't solved it pretty quickly mhm\n\nYeah if you look at the nature of ah how this was said uh the the packaging the if you look at the um the the one packaging for the the device that was sent to CNN\nOr a you know the multiple stamps it went through us ts bomb each of these by the way\nDepending on who they are even Soros has his own private security go through you know he doesn't open his own male uh usually people at that level don't open you know anything themselves all of that sort and there's a great deal of security um but\nBut of course with uh the the Clintons that's the case the secret service for actually has their own sorting that they do so the male doesn't doesn't it's not delivered\nYou know to the doorstep or or in the mailbox like it would be for you and I of course that's that's that's something that's going and has been for a long time and place but but the point being is that\nThey have a a great deal of resources that the secret service has a great deal of resources into and and finding out you know and and putting together the puzzle\nThere's a there's a pretty good chance right now based on just having cameras everywhere these days\nThat they know it may be where the facility or facilities were at these were sent from oh and I find interesting is the fact that the FBI knows right now whether these relied bombs or not they know right they haven't said that we haven't heard anything that said that they were armed and ready to go winds and could have been triggered\nBy a ... a phone or whatever I that would be the next question why not write well because in and and I know is is there a reason that you'd I'm I'm I'm not throwing out of conspiracy and I'm saying there is there an investigating reason why you wouldn't\nIt well and if they were armed or or or if they were at that at that point those were those devices were ready to go off I'm I'm Wondering about the level of security especially\nReady to go off\nI'm I'm Wondering about the level of security especially in the middle of New York city a right there in the building CNN building or the those employees were allowed to go back it was it was after three o'clock some time but but they were allowed to go back in the building\nI'm ... and so does that tell us anything about\nThe threat the level of threat based on what they know about these devices will find out in the coming days you know because if they were armed and they were ready to go off then and you suspect that there might be more would you allow people to go back in that building\nYou know it's one thing with the Clintons they ... they always have as ex presidents do a secret service detail and they're always going to have that a great level security\nUh but if it's if you're talking about you know the media\nYou have to assume right that's the if the threat is real and if that were at that device word dangerous or we're\nReady to go off that there you would expect that there might be more or possibly in the system somewhere um but I don't know we really don't know it just that's the question that we have we're not going to speculate to the point of\nOf conclusion because we actually there's really not much to go on here we just know that you've got\nA\n... ... you've got these devices you've got a we know who the targets were who they were sent to and and that's about it we ... we we've seen the pictures on on the on line and in the media\nAs to what the packaging was at least with the CNN device but again where the the the FBI and the and uh everyone that's involved in the uh of course the investigation here they're putting the puzzle together you can't do that this is why I caution and I think it was\n[laughter] we can't you can't watch Fox News I don't care who they are they have the the the so called experts well here's what we're looking at even the experts sitting in a studio can't tell you what they are really looking at\nThat looks suspicious which we already know that's all we know about this entire situation suspicious packages we don't know anything else that's it and when the FBI tells us or\nAuthorities tell us more than we can start having that broader discussion eight six six Ninety ...\nSomebody else was very much and they're recording the radio [noise]\nListen to read I radio show wherever you are with our free app for your iPhone or
