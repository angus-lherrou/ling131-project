just exploded this weekend another you know bombshell appearance by Devon newness Henri abroad Romo show where he reveals what the information superhighway and go into the FBI was\nHow the shuttle information and mainline did right into the FBI\n\nRight into the FBI without bypassing all the usual channels folks\nListen let me just give you my experience of why this is so dangerous when I was a federal agent why this matters so much when when I was running a fraud cases in the New York office or in the Melville office in New York when I was with the secret service\nIf it was a small ... remember treasury checks most a lot of people still get them your tax refund you'll get a treasury check recalled ... cases what would happen a lot with these ... they were really boring cases it'd be candid with you but these teach ... cases would be\nSay you were getting a tax refund and you know it's made you know you don't get your check and they would call and the Irish who say well we mail that three weeks ago well what do you think happened folks they got stolen that they did the check got stolen someone signed didn't stole that simple as that ... we hated those cases why do I tell\nYou anything because once in awhile if the case wasn't worked at a quick enough speed\nIt constituent recall the Congress person then the Congress person will call the secret service off hey this is congressmen whatever Joey back and donors are my constituents didn't get her tax refund she believes the check was stolen and it's been a couple of months what are you guys doing\nYou know by\nThe boss would have that thing would get an extra level of scrutiny it would be short was handled we the boss\nI've just\nListen I I Know I hate\nTo make it out like there's a ... class and upper all a terrier but really at sometimes sadly these connections matter I Wish they did and I wish everybody was treated equally I'm not here to lie to you know I'm here to give you the truth those cases would get a handle by the book because they you know it was a congressman call an addict care of it but they would always be by the numbers\nWhat's so deeply disturbing about\nSpygate case if the guy who was running for president in the United states Donald Trump\nPresident the United states and instead of handling it\nBy the book hey we're going to look at this information where it came from we're going to run down all of these leads\nWe're going to make sure these leads are legitimate this dot CA before we do any of this it's going to be by the book it's going to be documented they did the exact\nOpposite they took the book they were ripped out the pages they used it as toilet paper they broke their own rules in their own die out their investigative guide they broke their own rules for verifying information which procedure they craft\nAll over due process they make no effort to handle this thing by the book so now do you see as being a former fed myself why this case really\nAre hard to say something up upsets the hell out of me\n\nBecause I actually did this kind of stop not out not spying on presidents\nBut it's really really irritating\nThat the consequences that ... that was that we're ... we're so enormous and there for a treasury check case we ... and cross the teeth you\nGuys didn't do about spying on the president United States oh it's just what planet we live on\nThis is crazy\nI let me take a call a seven seven three one three woman if you want to join the show Tom in Cape Coral Florida and area I Know very very well how are you Tom thanks for joining

resonating with\nThe American people well I've got a question here why would you and the Democrats still keep pounding impeachment ... that we're going to impeach now anybody who knows how the the system works and let's say they took the house they could impeach\nHim that doesn't mean he's out of office so that is simply an impeachment mhm and then\nAnd you're never going to pass the Senate you would need two thirds mhm so it would never patch it's never happened in the history of the country so it's not going to happen so why are you doing it because you're motivating the Republican base\nRight keep shouting at though pleas for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nThree days with steady rain and you're going to be looking at the dangerous situations pretty much anywhere and that's what we've got today flash flood watch in effect for portions of Texas in through Oklahoma\nKansas portions of eastern Nebraska\nIowa Minnesota and Wisconsin\nBrought up and down I thirty five and portions of course\nI'm forty I Seventy I tend from LA to Texas drive bus from central Texas to Florida I Will be wet today mainly from that system known as Michael\nOf ah of Brock Obama's political career\nWho he was as a political operative and and there was a lot of jokes made about community organizer right\nBut the community organizer especially in the Chicago area oh can mean in a number of things but politically it means getting people to the polls that's actually what it means um you know for politically or for any area not just Chicago but\nGetting people to the polls they they what they did is they grew that they nurtured that and they own that better than the Republicans did in fact the Republicans didn't know how to do it in two thousand eight\nAnd in two thousand twelve they beat Romney's team Romney was if you you and I were following the post debate polls be the polls that happened right after the debates between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama President Obama at that time and the polls showed that Mitt Romney\nOr on the issues landslide numbers even the exit polls yes and so massive massive numbers the difference was the organization that's what happened in twenty sixteen\nThe RMC had been working in the DNC didn't see this because they were busy with you know the whole fusion GPS and you know Christopher Steele Russians and all that\nUh but they are and see where they were putting their efforts was much like they in fact uh some say that as they designed it\nAh after that model of getting people to the polls that's what it's all about you can call it what you want but at the end of the day it is getting people to get out and vote and\nThat's what happened with those states that that Trump ended up winning that nobody saw\nAnd it was that you know boots on the ground type you know community organizer the organization you know that she's trying to speak of it it really doesn't apply internally I mean\nWhipping the votes is one thing\nThe Democrats though has had a playbook for a long long time and will long after a Casio Cortez is gone you and I kind of touched on the other day of kind of dismissing things being able to turn their head on a a Joe mansion\nYou know and and not you know but look the other way with a Joe mansion in certain cases and and not really worried about things like that when they can they know they can use Joe mansion for other things so\nThe\nThe entire equation is not going to change in fact I don't think the Democrats are the party would wanted to change because on many issues uh they'll do what they have done in the past which includes the kind of behavior we saw with Obamacare we need to pass it so you can see what's in it\nWhich includes lying to the American people about what's what it's going to do\nWell and she was saying that we need to organize for the pressure's not within a you know the the the body which would mean the pressure doesn't come from you know whipping up the votes at the pressure comes from the outside electorate will that happens all the time will tell you that that ... that that's dating a are nothing new the other thing is when\nNow you have the excuses no she's not a leader of the party she's not a leader of the party you well you may not believe that she\nShe is and she isn't right now but the mainstream media believes that she is that's why she gets on precedent did television time from the mainstream media\nAs a a candidate for Congress ... who has one nothing yet who was a bartender a year ago\nThat he has said it said you know they basically was the leader of the DNC has basically said she's the ... she's the future right I mean\nShe may not she's not the leader of the party right now but if she's the future that's what that's what the media is going to turn to the reason a media turns to that is because\nThey see what's going on with the left by the way you know from the outside in who who's leading the Democrats right now and has been leading the Democrats what force what movement is leading the Democrats well it's it's overall if you were to term it\nCollectively it's the protester\nIt's the extreme left\nBut what's the problem with that\nIs that how many different protests are they're the reason right now that they can dismiss someone tomorrow and they are a Beto O'Rourke does not need a a former president Barack Obama to campaign for I'm In Texas is because\nThey're so over you and it doesn't matter who you are\nOr you've minute though you know what's gonna happen if\nIf ... loses Obama's going to come out and say he should've used my endorsement well that's what he does he go party will say he ... he reads ... shouldn't be rejecting right Obama's or an endorsement but really I mean that I'm I'm Glad you brought that up because that's something else from last week\nThat we really didn't get a chance to talk about but really that's unbelievable it shows you know you and I you and I started working together Thirteen Years ago so you know we were we were together or three years when Obama first got elected right and and we remember every single moment of it and we remember\nThe the political I dollar tree that for\nPresident or an Obama remember his you know the the DNC speech from when they when they did it from the stadium with Greek columns and everything else and people were falling over him and it was and\nNow look at it today now out of it now I ... yeah our our goal is to have the liberal takeover of a of a of Texas A M ... or ... nah we don't want to ... years after his out no we don't want him\nWhite made because and and that's it what what a Casio Cortez doesn't include here\nIs internally externally the political pressure by the way it always comes from the outside a that's a good courses and and it's always the people on it like we said yesterday about Republicans if if\nThe Republicans were jailed last year or as the president took office in January of twenty Seventeen like uh they are now after capital\nThan we probably would see if they were ... on the issue of health care we would see Obamacare gone completely but that wasn't the case and so that that there is one example of political pressure being a precedent in in in one year and then gone and the next\nWell with the left the problem is is your political pressures coming from every different splinter\nGroup it which moves in multiple directions tell me which direction you go in are you going to be with the feminists are the transgender Z because you can't on their boat right now they're fighting with each other ... as we predicted\nRight three or four years and and so that's the problem that they created they they basically over a couple of generations they were out a ... and indoctrinate in children and and and young people\nTo believe that it was that it's white to wake up today and find a new oppressor find a new reason to be a victim and that might include somebody with that was with you and part of your group yesterday [noise]\nPresident Obama or just not really into any more\nThat I mean I just wanted was speaking engagements and that but ... but think about\nIt shows you how the political wins yes Ken Ken just blow the one of the probably the biggest political idol of my lifetime\nAnd make it so he's not even relevant two years after he's out of office yeah ... years are running right from him saying that don't need an don't need his endorsement here and that's because and and you and I've talked about we thought this might happen because we saw some of the signs\nBecause the less believes he truly wasn't a liberal right that he truly he was he wasn't in it really for the cause he\nWas in it just because of the gig right but he really wasn't in to doing what needed to be done to move the political lover as far left\nAs they thought maybe it and we're really his own party as closely as as many thought he was

Russian collusion isn't an issue now\nThe economy's not an issue ... except ... well whether this year for Democrats [laughter] no no the [laughter] you don't I didn't work the ... the ... the economy being bad not in an an issue right right it's normally that's where you have the advantage what is bad\nMhm right now yeah what's that well\nUh I don't know when you have an unemployment or at its lowest and fifty years\nI'm ... and people are when you look at the did I not say bad yet when you when you look at that I ... that's the problem when you when you go through it now let me have unemployment the lowest citizen fifty years what else matters\nLet me ask you about this because this has been talked about the premiums going up in Obamacare mhm but nobody seems to be talking about ... not even the media's not talking about the but the economy\nIs bad for Democrats politically it is you cannot you\nCan't spin a good economy to be a negative ... I I guess I guess the point that I'm asking is is it in ... and ... is\nThe Republicans are the majority one and the Democrats you that's that's my point why is that there was there to be a ... ... ... that's what I mean it's bad for Democrats or what is their issue that they can use\nYour point there is well what what's your ... how do you spend a good economy because what else matters to people what else matters if you're going to work every day you got a solid job and possibly even offers on the table immigration\nCare about the credits [noise] they don't care about the credits\nThat's not something that helps them\nIf the government forces a mandate and that's what was being proposed the even President Trump has talked about in the past raising the mandate right ... percent right well if you do that that becomes a that becomes a big problem politically ... outside of Iowa good I just I've read\nLike three different articles on it and that's what I thought it was was okay you're trying to please both sides but you're not really pleased anybody well because you're not mandating it the oil companies aren't going to do it ... it's not a mandate on it so you're simply saying I'm\nGoing to allow them I'm going to allow I'm going to allow the industry to do what the industry doesn't wish to do right and sell it year round well I think you're probably going to see pushback\n... first of all I guess we'd have to see what the participation rate is well once I won't be the largest cities like Houston in LA they don't want more smog what gas stations going to be the first to put want to\nPut a Fifteen in when you do as well as I Do on the Internet is going to be fine you could damage your car you know of of a fast or you could damage your lawn mower faster if you use e Fifteen mhm right but it should just be the ten percent should be the max and putting Fifteen Percent is is just ridiculous so nobody's going to do it\nSo is this the way the president's just trying to appease people without doing anything\nIs trying to appease the farm\nBut you can't get there from here because there is no great motivator there really is no incentive even with changing how the credits work even with changing because changing it to sell it year round\nHow does that ... the benefit those that are blending at well okay you could blend it year round and you wouldn't have to change up at the refinery level as often that is not that's not promising to them because ultimately it automatically comes back down to the consumer right\nSo the mandate is on the blend here's my question\nIf the mandate is on the ... right at ten percent but the mandate isn't there for Fifteen Percent but those companies the the the the oil companies that are putting out let's say they responded to the incentive of of changing the credits\n\nWe went to I don't know sixty Seventy percent of the\nOf the ethanol or the gasoline so would would have a Fifteen Percent or ethanol concept on the market what would happen with the consumer many of the consumers will be driven to look for the ten percent seek out the temp right\nWhen that happens and you have a glut of the eight Fifteen on the market then what happens then there's pushback from the retailers that's why the retailers don't want her to have a ... this is why it is destined to fail\nYou're handing you believe you're handing something to the farmers and the corn states but it really doesn't fly without the mandate and he knows politically outside of Iowa you can't get an e Fifteen mandate done right now\nYou can't\nI mean you might get Chuck ... on board [laughter] to help you ... I mean he's a farmer himself [laughter] so [laughter]\nWait a minute he's only trying to scratch grab pleased back [laughter]\nThat's right you don't even I everybody's paying virus like that I think those are just now well I did I mention I didn't even think about that I mentioned earlier the leaders don't worry tomorrow yeah is he dropped out trying to I'm a ... [laughter]\nAll right Mr Trump did men do start the story for you but ah I just I mean I when I read it I'm picking this doesn't do anything and you're just ... it's the eight Fifteen that his band in the summer months um they do have even eat Fifteen out there there is some out there but as it is not it is not mandate it\nWell the the question is is that if the city's believe like Los Angeles or states like California\nWho through the California air resources board I could see them coming in because you know a Houston and in Los Angeles compete\nFor the number one or a spot in terms of the smoggy city or they don't want the fifteenth on the market they're not going to want to be Fifteen on the market which is an interesting position to be [laughter] they can blame Al Gore by the way for this this whole thing\nUm but the ... [laughter] a part\nBut the the problem is ultimately\nThey won't want more smog they don't they will try and I'm or could try and move way ahead of it even if they don't believe it's going to fly they would probably want to get ahead of legally by going after the EPA will give\nThe rule or exemption is but here's your here's the difference ... is president going to come up to mount started doing this because of global warming\nWhy I don't know why you know you do it ain't gonna do it as a rice helping the farmers right we're we're ... we're helping they'll be suffering Chuck Grassley\n[laughter] yeah [laughter]\nBut they're not mandating that you buy Fifteen Percent there well making it available where you could do it year round well there even though I don't I I I don't expect anyone\nTo sell something when it's going to be promoted instantaneously\nIf it comes to fruition after tomorrow ... you're going to see a bombarded all over the Internet over newspapers\nIt ever was mandated number one that would be fury right or as especially from members of of of Congress but he's not doing it because of global warming he's doing it because he's he's sort of because of a\nWishing to to help farmers right right which we said to begin with that's not how you run industry you don't have government setting ten percent mandates to begin with because the president made it clear ... you know he I think he would do a mandate mhm and have taxpayer subsidized more\nJust to help the farmers an economy shouldn't run that way\nWell and volcanic he knows he can't get that mandate done right now at least a politically outside of those ... states eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nBucks more readily radio with a record ...
