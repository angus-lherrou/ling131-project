solution\nYou hear these Democrats running for governor like yo I'm In Florida you hear them running for the Senate and house Medicare for all Medicare don't show a lot of Medicare\nThe trouble is

specific types of diseases and so forth and so\n[noise]\nIf you can show any pharmaceutical company any\n\nYour tax returns where he'd be don't maybe you don't even have tax returns your that poor they will provide you with the prescriptions for free or an enormously reduce costs but often for free they have programs where they specifically do that\nSo\nFew truly cannot afford meant for men and I don't know if that's the right name or not\nOr very expensive prescription and you can show based on your income or lack there of that you can't in about a week doing ten days time and a friend who worked for one of these organizations\nYou will get those medications almost always\nFor free why does anyone ever talk about that [noise]\nWhat this idiot will not talk about is the problem of supply

twenty five cents out of every single dollar spent by every state goes into medicate am I missing something I thought the left but already solve this problem in Nineteen sixty five shortly after Medicare was founded they founded medicate\nI thought Medicaid was supposed to resolve all this apparently it doesn't so what do we need more government\nThat'll fix it Medicare for all that don't fix it go ahead\n[laughter] [laughter] well\nIf they don't make a profit there's nothing to invest\n\nWhy ladies and gentlemen do people put faith in somebody like this are Bernie Sanders or the whole say lengths of leftists\nTo make judgments\nAbout industry to make judgments about society make judgments about your own life your own quality of life\n\nWhy do you put faith in somebody like this she doesn't know anything about health care she doesn't know the first thing about medicine she doesn't know anything about doctors and nurses she doesn't know about pharmaceutical companies she doesn't know about capital investment for pharmaceutical companies she apparently doesn't know about these free programs\nThat that the pharmaceutical companies have and they spend billions of dollars doing she apparently is utterly and completely illiterate on the subject it doesn't\nMatter she's in eighty a lot\nLike Obama's any ideologue killings in any allied like standards isn't any a lot\nLike ward isn't any ... does it matter\nSpirits is irrelevant knowledge is your relevant facts are irrelevant even though they claim to possess all of them\n\nThere's no profit and doing the right thing she said\nWhy does\nSocialist do the right thing to communist do the right thing to bureaucrats always do the right thing this constant attack on the private sector on capitalism and the inability\nOf most people that can run it in a dress is very frustrating to me look around your ladies and gentleman look around you\n\nThe overwhelming majority of what you see was not created by the government\nWas created by individual initiative or a group of individuals getting together it was great it through a freedom and private property rights and yes a market\nSystem a market system\nWe don't even appreciate what we have and who we are and what we've built instead we have these radicals who talk like more on\nJust throw around phrases Medicare for all there is no profit and doing the right thing\n\nPhrases Medicare for all there's no profit and doing the right thing\n\nThere's a hell of a lot of men and women who spent their lives committed to finding chores\n\nWho spent their lives to finding cures for the mist Stacey Abrams ever did\nAnd they need to be paid\nAnd there needs to be investments and you have to have our day and your hat that capital\nAnd that's how the system works and it worked so brilliantly why we have more pat and send any multiple of countries put together [noise] I'll be right back\n\nHere data is everywhere data breaches Facebook breaches big

they have five million dollars they got to court two million dollars ... from the\n... act they got money just fallen out of the sky\nAnd so we got a tough race on our hands on it it's like we're up a little an after capital of course uh the rest of the country so high you know that the laughter is just out of control so we've got a bump and we hope that stays\n[noise] you know they're getting enormous amount of money you talk about the Soros front group and Tyler has her front group and some Bloomberg's after spending you got all these leftist multi billionaires that have set up all these groups to to launder their money through and then to give it to these candidates\nAre like the Kennedy you're running against and they use this money to go on TV\nTo train disarmed the public to try

didn't find out you are but it's more like as as somebody when they came over to my house one time and they'd seen pictures of my cat that came over and they said\nThat's not a cat I said it talking about the ... it's the panther fan [laughter] I'm pretty sure he was hanging out at the attack as I got a sixteen pounds is\nComing up on the show today the latest poll on the tax plan what other issues could affect the outcome of the mid term elections and we'll talk just a little bit about John bathe her because that story on the whole pot thing has has come up will tell you about the new company that will help you move out of San Francisco and\nThe Turkish president says ... killing was premeditated and we'll talk about the owners of a bakery will appeal to the U.S Supreme Court the EPA report on ethanol that came out we never got a chance to talk about it\nA lot of a ... yesterday and just are are complete and total election coverage and everything that's going on and and I think it's important because we talked about the polls but I think it's more important to talk about the issues\nThat may be affecting what's going on the stock market yesterday in the volatility of the stock market caterpillar and not worry why because they're building their parts more expensive why the terrorists we look at issues that could possibly affect and\nHurt the Republicans one of the things that we didn't talk about yesterday was the farmers farmers aren't happy because of the tariffs look you may you may have destroyed family farms that have existed for a long time\nA big because you've taken away because of the terrorists taking away their supply chain yeah and as we told you win even though the president came out and said okay we're going to free up money for them they said that's not going to say butts right because that doesn't that doesn't make up for the last is that right ... and the fact that we're not we're going to be shut out of the supply chain\nThat for ... and we don't know for how long I mean are they could lose their livelihood with farmers I mean this is for them if it is their livelihood so that that towers over Kavanaugh and the caravan and and and anything else that might influence votes and this is they could lose their lively and you've\nHad a ton of small businesses out there that have been affected by the tariffs on steel and aluminum\nTariffs you think about it a farmer them hit them in any industry in any region right and in our region its its oil and gas but a farming ah and in the Midwest\nAnd there are every ... every other business is essentially related to that economy the farming economy so it's not just the farmers but it's the other yet uh businesses in that area that are supported by the\nInternet and that's an unknown quantity right I don't know how you figure I don't know how a lot of these things I don't know how you figure it in and come up with the formula as to what's going to win\nIn in two weeks all I can tell you is the issues that have a great probability of affecting the election both on the Democratic side as we spend a lot of time on and also the Republican side sure what it could hurt

well it will be ... it will be two weeks from right now that will be ... analyzing\nA you know everything that that has gone on I mean there are ... you get every single day I mean I saw\nYou know that uh oh okay that looks like now that the Republicans are going to lose the house yesterday but then I saw other articles they need well no that's not the case and that's why we'll bring you the polls and will tell you what they say\nWe really don't make predictions what we will tell you is the issues and the events that we believe will affect the outcome of the election yeah uh I've always said for me it's very hard\nTo figure out what people are going to do on election day for me just yeah I mean everything the pollsters may\n... you know believe in some of the pollsters do get a get a dump a pretty good especially on a presidential election but they missed major elections as they did for example in Ninety or where they weren't even close\nOver the summer on a national poll the Democrats had ten point lead over the Republicans now it's down to four so we'll see where that goes within two weeks for cover electronics here's your forecast\nMoisture tied to hurricane ... in the Eastern Pacific will shift some of those reins into western Texas today we have a marginal risk of flash flooding of severe weather in place for the region another whether maker will be a surface low near the southern tip of Texas\nSo a couple of systems moving in rain and thunderstorms certainly possible along the Gulf Coast today with marginal risks of flash flooding in effect and the below normal temperatures will continue for the southern plains Fifteen to twenty five degrees below average\nVaries greatly yeah and then of course the value of the home yeah that influences\nThe ... tax rate in my town is higher than a quite a bit higher than yours I Believe I'm a\nYeah my my tax rate is is very low which is why it's one of the most attractive areas in terms of people moving to it um but even aside from that if you've got a a home it's worth more than ... your your taxes are higher\nAnd lower rate right so when when you see that and you see the number of of of people and and remember ... ... ... the the the people that will be at that age\nUh aren't we're not talking the super rich were I heartland about what is viewed in many of these high income areas and as solid Republican voters who are in the middle to upper middle class\nRight and they're getting had and they don't like it and\nWhat's their only recourse right now there's still a supporter of Trump but what's their records to send the message by Republican congressman\nWe've always we worried about that from the very beginning I don't know how it's going to affect I'm simply bringing up the issues out there that when it comes to people's individual budget when it comes to bend paying more money I don't care who you are nobody wishes to do that\nAnd even though won't change everybody's vote\nIt has the potential of changing five percent of the\nNobody wishes to do that and even though won't change everybody's followed it has the potential of changing\nFive percent of the vote yeah which makes the entire difference in a house election so that's that's a you know that's one thing we talked about the Democrats and we've talked about what what they face the whole cabinet thing\nI'm just the insanity that has come out of the uh the the Democrats the ... the the the fact that they plan\nAnd this is the one thing that may ... that\nIs they're coming on black me and say we're going to raise taxes than so many of them coming out now I'm going to raise taxes now we're going to raise taxes not we're going to raise taxes now we're going to raise the corporate tax rate that we need to raise taxes more we need to raise taxes they're actually in many where they're going to raise taxes them which could hurt that we've also talked about the care of it\nBut in ... in the Republican Party that's one I'm yesterday auto auto dealers see slower sales sparking fears along expected declined is here now the economy overall\nMay not be an end and the terrorists overall may not change a significant portion of people voting in this election\nBut it will change those small business people that are being affected and a caterpillar a ... to the good caterpillar story then they're they're being blunt the terrorists are telling us write the steel and an autumn of the the steel and aluminum tariffs by the way that this isn't the China thing\nRight\nIt's the United states and Europe and and and Mexico that they're still in effect mhm and it's killing them it's raising the price as we said when the president came out and said there I delivered for you I gave you the I gave you the the new NAFTA or whatever you wish to call it nobody's using the new name by the way [laughter] All right\nAnd and uh the his you know and the only success that that he claimed the the biggest thing that he promoted was what he did to the automobile business and we said that's unbelievable but he's promoting the fact that he has raised the cost\nOf buying an automobile in the United states Mexico and Canada and that's viewed as a good thing or there's a story last week about Ford grumbling\nGoing to be losing a billion dollars and they believe the terrorists are going to ... that are hurting them remember every supplier and every small business of deals with board and the United states knows if that's coming\nOr or or feeling it already and every dealership and every ... remember the steel tariffs really been affects we're from China which has increased the cost from the beginning of the year that's actually that's actually nine months ten months old now because the steel prices were up ... percent by the time we got to June of this year\nSo you look at that you look at the fact that automobiles are going to go up in price because of steel costs and now because of terror of cause and because of the new NAFTA\nOr and then the farmers as we mentioned in the last break the farmers that are being hit and you're talking about your your talk if you're talking about a manufacturing\nPeople with manufacturing jobs at a technical skills\nTon of those people are Trump supporters if you talk about the farmers you're talking Trump\nCountry and you're talking about farmers that are stream Lee upset because it's not only their current profits\nBut it's the fact that they may be shut out of the supply chain that took them decades to get into and now it's disappeared you made the comment you said a in our personal meaning you said I Wonder if that's why he went to you know even though was wishy washy ethanol plan\nI Wonder if that's why he went to Iowa because for the internal polls were saying you're getting killed with the farmers right\nNow as a couple of weeks ago because I Will would be basically the center of the corn belt but the farm belt ... it's not that everything is about the the votes in Iowa or any election in Iowa it's that you're trying to reach that region when you go to Iowa you're speaking to the industry\nThe farming industry not just a ethanol and corn but it's for farming industry uh you you want to reach out with that saying we're going to help the farmers\nAre and and you know in this region in this area in the state\nAnd I don't know what you do in terms of of ah of reconnecting the supply chain this is what they're worried about\nUh they need to have those farmers those companies need to have trade partners all around the globe and when those trade partners for instance when Mexico a set up a port trade with with Canada\nAh any nation that they're selling to those farmers\nIf they're going a different direction as a result of a threat of a tariff or a terrifying that went into place a or any of that if they have to make arrangements a lot of time a lot of time you don't get that back right away\nYou're not you're not going to get that business back right away and that's the concern that this is why the farmers came out a couple of weeks ago and said look thanks but no thanks on this you know a four point seven billion dollar a handout we need the business the business is worth a lot more\nRight it's still not making up for what our law says All right and we're ... we're we're ... we're out of the loop and the supply chain now we don't know when we're going to get back in ... I took a deck I think one of the ... was it took us decades to get into the world's supply chain now are viewed as unreliable because they don't know what you will do\nRight uncertainty as a killer this is what we saw after the recession\nThe problem with bailing out all the banks were are putting money into all the banks the coffers of all the banks by the federal government or during the recession or in two thousand they to the end of two thousand eight and ... and into a two thousand nine they there were three apparently large banks that were on the brink that we're a\nPossible high risk but they didn't want to run on those banks so they put money in all of the coffers well then it made all the banks look risky and that's the problem you create you muddy the waters well when you talk about trade\nTrade deals between nations that are set up um you don't you don't reconnect that bridge it's like blowing up or bridge and believing you could rebuild it repair it tomorrow\nYou can't\nThat's going to take a lot of planning that's going to take a lot of reassuring but if there's political uncertainty\nAnywhere in that\nThen your former customers are going to stick with someone else or another nation in this case mhm and they're going to get their supply chain repaired\nAnd our discussion right now is not really so much on the the the substance of the economics of it it's more of the politics of\nWhat is going to be affecting this this ... election we've talked a lot yesterday about\nHow the Republicans in so many ways were set up in a way that you don't see a political party in mid term election with a ton of positives and de opposition political party that the Democrats are in a complete mess and\nAnd with a ton of positives and de opposition political party that the Democrats are and a complete mess and that there are many things because the the economy right now but the majority of Americans looks really good mhm well we're talking about is\nThe old you know in the the impacts that starting to be felt now and making investors very were wary and a core\nConstituency of the of of Trump supporters\nWhich are the farmers that aren't happy at all now so even though there's a lot of good for Republicans right now there is still bad lurking out there uh when it comes to economics that there are Trump supporters that are extremely wary about where he is you know where he may be taking\nA you know the their particular economy and what's gonna happen to their livelihood so we think it's very important to bring up all the issues that may be affecting the selection both positive and negative for the Democrats and positive and negative for the Republicans just to give you a more realistic\nYou on it we got a pilot flying J downloaded free

Radio Welcome to the show high\n[noise] I tell you a long time ago you guys are awesome thing to point out something\nThat you and you're listening probably do not think about or see the rhetoric side of it with a gun or its face and all the other things like that the younger\nPeople there are all round Eighteen a lot of them love that I talked to a [noise] like that are there and bitter bad\nYeah yeah we we lost we lost about half of that and we've got a bad reception there I I don't know about that I you know that the bats anecdotal evidence\nAnd we're talking about influencing votes really we're talking about likely voters or the Eighteen year olds aren't in the likely voter category right now for this particular mid term they're certainly not so there may be something they're on social media\nAh that's one thing but the the problem with it is again for people that you know we're looking at at certain issues and concerns\nUh they've got to know that uh you know and and they're undecided during the center got to know that they can you know that they can safely you know cast that book and that's what you're trying to do\nIt you know you don't want to you don't want to jump into something where again it's [noise] it's unnecessary it's it's not a positive I've always\nUh yeah I've I've always been about getting every when you possibly can and once you have the when a accentuate the positive about when which would have been and go after Evan Eddie\nRight yes because ... I mean we've seen it he's a liar um he's a he's an end by the way these lawyers that have lined up against Trump you know he can go after them as a group and include having that he in that and and there's a there's there's nothing wrong with that\nOr he can go after them and\nBe I I mean that that's something that's an effective tactic that you know does work\nBecause it's true he doesn't have to make anything up I mean he he doesn't have to call anybody name you call Evan Eddie a liar well that's just that's just true or that the guy brought a nothing lawsuit against you it was baseless then you've got again you've got something\nThat you if you go you go to ... you go to the baseless lawsuit you go to the um uh you go to a a a cabin on and you say these are the people that are against me right and to me I I people say well what do you mean that's a that's a positive uh what came out ... of the news story that\nYou get that you get the help from the left you get the capital of thing you get the caravan thing you get all all these other things that you know and and of course uh you know I'm a Cory bookers plan\nA you get the you know combat what Harris plan you know this is what they want to do or the or or work or or any of that you know they're promoting this but that's not going to work we're promoting this and look what's working you can demonstrate that your ideas are working and you can point out we're there's aren't going to work\nAnd that's something that is extremely rare in politics even with\nAh other affect the presidents of the past you know you can show already a track record of getting things done\nThat are helping the economy\nYou know and and that's it and and and by the way I I Do want to um\nClarify you know we criticized the former President Obama speaking in Nevada alone on yesterday's show or when you know because he said don't forget who started this and I think he's right we should Donald Trump started this [laughter] good economy we shouldn't forget who started this all your writing\nMr Obama or so the the the whole thing is again you you you have those positives stay on them because what is the rally\nWhat is a rally a rally\nIs a a ton of positives and this map this massive group\nOf euphoric people that are ready to take action you know that's that's where ... if you think about it every day on social media shouldn't be that rally between now and November I mean it's not that you have to have positives you can go after Chuck Schumer right everybody\nElse because I I think it's very important to understand that in the real political world I mean you'll have the purest out there saying I'm against the negative advertising when this ridiculous right of course you have to point out on nothing that you've got you've got to point out the negatives of your uh you know of your candidate you have to point out the negatives that\nThe government can't give you all the Iran right that somebody is lying to you when they tell you that they can make it a beautiful like the frustration that our last caller at all solve crime and you know not really very well thought that that that it then that's why I started to have the uh started laughing because\n... you know that isn't going to happen you have to point out and and I believe the times you have to give blood is we've gotten London passionate about it during the Kavanaugh hearings that it's unacceptable to us and we've been blunt that you're not an American but if you will if you don't believe in the mindset of due process even for Kavanaugh\nYou know they were both Democrats were trying to we use a lot of that in every well it's it's not a quarter law it was a political court where people were put under oath and people were put under old under threat of perjury if they lied and it was not a criminal court it was not a civil court but it was a political cord that had much\nOf the same enforcement mechanisms that a criminal court has when you testify right and and so a a a a person's reputation\nIs at stake it was a political court and yes Americans expect fairness and they expect due process Democrats said we don't believe in due process we believe it's very important to bring up the fact that they don't believe in the first amendment they don't believe in the second amendment\nThey now don't believe in due process under the law they don't believe a presumption of innocence\nIf you're not on their side the American civil liberties union has just shocked away any pretense of carrying about\nAmericans and our civil liberties and they just made it clear during the cabinet hearings we don't care we point out in a very passionate ways you can see I get passionate about this because I think it's very important to point out\nThat people say well I get a lot of it's it's offensive if you tell somebody that ought to pay for it because they believe they are a patriot well know there are some standards\nOf why you are a patriot there are some standards of why you are an American I mean what makes you an American it's the fact that you believe in the constitution if you reject the basic tenants of the constitution if you reject free speech if you were jak freedom of religion if you if you reject\nThe second amendment if you reject\nA due process under the law if you were jak the electoral college if you reject the Senate\nAnd and you wish to change all of it\nThen you don't believe in America I mean I don't know what else to say right it's it's not and people said what's a shocking thing that you're saying no it's not they're the ones that are shocking by claiming what do you believe in America or just against the basic tenants of the constitution of the United states mhm well that's what America is\nYes that's that's it I'm you and\nWhat they're trying to say is a well it's like when they say no we believe in free speech will know you don't it's your side that says that if I use the the the wrong pronoun in California that there's a penalty ultimately of going to jail\nThat free speech oh no no no see your free speech as bigoted your freedom of religion as bigoted\nAnd and so no we believe me we believe in negative you know that this isn't about the fact that you know that you need to that you need not to point out in a very blunt manner [laughter] what the opposition is for and what they really stand for\nAnd the fact that you you know you can point out and you can tell people this is what's wrong with them\nAnd you can proudly say yes this is negative campaigning because what they're doing\nIs negative to this country mhm because they don't believe in the basic tenants of this country and so yeah nobody's saying that you have to be nice to them all the time no no our point you know when you have the when the move onto the next when well again I think we're getting a win\nFor calling out a O'Rourke or a Schumer or any of them to me those those are positives when you're calling out what they're promoting\nAnd saying look what I've done look at look at what we've been able to do in such a short time and what we're doing right now with the economy and look what they want to do with it and back to and and the other\nEnd by the way and sometimes the name calling the the slogan name calling or the nickname calling is very effective [laughter] liar\nLanny I now I made that went up I don't know [laughter] they can use it if you want to say I don't want to get a ... was a ... was it I don't know when you when when you thought you said sure I forgot what it was just ... yeah and I bought\nA used somebody's got those listed somewhere in the names ... no ... we've said this oh well now it's put people in office it's paid running it's beautiful tired of that is that line that any more [laughter]\n\nWe said the so well now it's for people in office it's running it's beautiful ... is that line that any more [laughter]\n\nAnd and as far as we know the president no longer believes that Mr Cruz's father involved in the ... [laughter]\nAs far as we know about but but look I'm we said before\nI thought one of the greatest um in terms of\nTheatrics but have a point to something solid was him sitting at that table with an empty seat and the and the name of of of that was the on one one of them are on the other that was the best oh my gosh that's brilliant and he I mean that's something that works brilliant as a big word\nBut that's something that's it it's effective\nThey're not showing up they're not here at the party I'm trying to work with them they don't want to work with me it was a brilliant political moment yes\nBecause it's real simple it's it's brilliant and its simplicity that you're showing your demonstrating that you've invited them and they're they're not showing up that's what that represented keep in mind the former president didn't invite members of his own party from Capitol Hill\nTo come in and that that's not from us\nThat's from Chris Matthews he didn't like working with Democrats he didn't like because he he believed he could do a lot of it on his own by the way that was also rich we didn't pointed out of the comments he was making\nYou know it's not about one man really recess appointments really it's not about one man Mr I don't need Congress to get things past Mr recess appointment down down nine nothing yeah exactly ... suffering court when when you lose Ginsburg if\nWhat if you're a liberal the president that that last Ginsburg stoner sorry that a little too much and I'm thinking you were trying to do it on your own their eight six six Ninety right I\nAgree with what radio toll free at age ... he wrote a [noise]\nBe a part of the conversation by calling to shovel tell a hotline at eight six six nine zero seven three three three nine red eye radio and shut will tell us what matters is inside as the saying goes when it comes to power there's no replacement for displacement which is why western\nStars still offers you they're incredible sixteen leader Detroit duty sixteen engine that's right sixteen leaders are legendary awesome and when you affect one in a western star forty nine hundred fifty seven hundred or a sixty nine ... you're not only get plenty of power you get plenty of efficiency to\nDon't settle for anything less than you want or need find your nearest dealer at western star dot com and get your top back\nReserve and at first stop centers almost half of all drivers vent an hour or more looking for parking is easy to send hard earned dollars his hind ends searching for that elusive spot in the stress a safe place to park his or something you should have to worry about reserve it can help", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "24"}
