retiring well the entire program about how real estate can help you build wealth and generate income\nAnd your senior year\nNow we're going to continue our conversation\nA person who actually teaches real estate investing people around the United states [noise]\nJoining us again now is Peter ...\nReal turn with bishop west\nReal estate license to match\nPeople all around the United states joining us again now is Peter ...\nReal tour with bishop west real estate license to Massachusetts Vermont New York and Florida he's been a real door for Thirty years and he carries many of NPR's advanced certifications including\nThe certified commercial investment member designation Peter thanks for coming back on real estate today\nIt's a pleasure to be back thank you for having me\nWell Peter I appreciate you coming back when we left you in our first our we had just finished talking about a tried and true real estate investment strategy in which you buy another house but you keep the one you're in and rent it out that seems like a great way to start\nEspecially if it is a rental market for example where we are in Venice, Florida right now there's a terrific went to the market because the air being being what it was so strong yeah top dollar\nBy renting out of the Arab a and B is a weekly or monthly went on as a annual rental mhm but an annual rental is slow and steady slow and steady wins the race\n[laughter] that's always going to able to Peter if someone's leaning forward and listening\nTo this and they're fascinated by it how would you advise that they find a good property that will continue to generate a good amount of rent\nThe first thing that you need is a good realtor that knows the market and not somebody that you know from the gym or the country club that's nice to you\nA realtor that specializes in investment property and understands somebody that's willing to sit down and go through the course let's blame the pros and cons some states it's easier to our residential rental property than others\nYou need to look at regulation and what the landlord business is mhm but the next biggest critical piece of advice is when you into real estate for investments whether it's residential vacation rental\nIndustrial you got to know what you're doing what I mean by that is you need to know the landlord tenant laws in that state\nAs how it pertains you understand that part of the business of lentils you will be on top of your game or within Seventy five percent on the way the successes understanding the rules\nThat is such great advice and you know we already mentioned buying a new house in keeping the when you already have but if you want to stay in your house and you're not going to move how would you recommend one of our listeners pays for property they find\nOut you know get if you have equity in your current how it could refinance your home and take equity or you get a bridge loan between the two properties mhm there are a lot of private investors out\nOh is that what they call hard money\nYeah absolutely could be called hard money\nPrivate equity the investors but what a lot of folks can do you can't buy it yourself but you can fast is if you have a\nIRA you can take it to be a self directed IRA\nSome banks do it some national come next to it and you invest the money you direct where it goes so for example somebody looking\nFor money for a down payment on the alert to finance a flip property or take it into something needs\nFifty Seventy five hundred thousand a good source of self directed IRAs because that person is going to get more in a real estate investment based on interest in return than they would if they were to um just have it with a institutional IRA company that's paying\nProbably two percent today stock markets good maybe it's ... percent\nYou're Peter that is fascinating and let me ask you another question about all this now you have\nMore than one hundred properties if you combine Florida in Massachusetts [noise] did you just kind of end up there or was that part of your plan to have one hundred one properties by this time in your life that\nWas kind of planned out the Massachusetts is where I'm my home and I raised my son as it turned out that yes it was in the plan Venice, Florida is the right\nSpot has a lot of desire ability and therefore it gifts of based on the Gulf Coast rock and go up and down and do what I Need to do so that was definitely in the plan\nThat is wonderful one more question for you my friend tell our listeners if you will that if they retire and they have anywhere from\nA handful of properties to a whole lot of properties what will their life be like\nI wouldn't know what we're from it is and that's a that's a nervous worked for bay but I can assure you that\nYou'll be able to live the lifestyle that you're looking to live without worrying about it because you're controlling your own destiny\nPeter that is just such great perspective and thank you for all the insights and the advice wonderful job my friend and I really appreciate you being on the show\nThank you it's my pleasure you're very welcome Peter West real horror with bishop west real estate license in Massachusetts Vermont New York and Florida\nComing up on real estate today\nSelling your great big house I sold my single family last year and in addition to locking in that equity\nI no longer um a lawnmower [laughter] [noise]\nThat's coming up on our special show retiring wealthy\nBut first it's time for our smart home technology reports\nToday of big questions\nAre smart speakers on the way\nPossibly pushed aside by smart display\nLet's talk about that up to now there have been three main players in the smart home arena Amazon Echo Google Home an apple home pot they all started as just smart speakers really smart speakers which you could ask anything and the speaker would answer by talking to you\nKnow that was the status quo until Amazon added video screens their big echo show and they're cute little echo spot were game changers because with their bright colorful screens you could watch the news watch the forecast and watch the steps in a recipe\nFor more than a year Amazon owned that space until last July when Lenovo launched a smart display with built in Google Assistant\nThere was followed closely by another Google display from GPL but just this month Google announced it their own version in their biggest development yet the Google hub the replacement for its original Google Home the hub has a seven inch video screen and premium speakers built in\nHope the replacement for its original Google Home the hub has a seven inch video screen and premiums speakers built in\nAnd when it comes everything Google is known for from Youtube videos to step by step map directions to your personal calendar but now you can see all those things not just hear about them\nNow the Google hub is a smaller device which would fit justice comfortably on a night stand is in the kitchen and perhaps because it would make such a good smart alarm clock nestled right next to your bed\nThe Google hub does not come with a camera\n... shells this Monday October twenty second and its entering the market at a lower price point one hundred fifty dollars compared to two hundred and thirty dollars for the second generation Amazon show\nThey can sell that house and put a quarter of a million dollars in their pocket\nFree of tax\nAnd if they're married it's five hundred\nExactly so what I'm saying ... some people doing as well is taking that exclusion by another property and start that exclusion all over\nAgain start clock up again a child to slash five hundred\nAnd that's particularly useful for people who are thinking a gallon size so why can't sell the big home ... and fifty five hundred thousand start the clock over again on the tunnels in kenner Fifteen Years cell that walk in your clock ... free forever\nTom do that is such a great strategy Peter\nSo for example I'm In my early sixties and I sold my single family last year and in addition to locking in an equity I no longer own a lawnmower\n[laughter] I can go fishing whatever I Want\n[laughter] [noise] oh my gosh you know it just comes to mind that real estate can help\nYou in so many ways in your later years you don't have to limit yourself to being an investor\nYou can be just smart with your primary residence\nCorrect exactly Peter\nAwesome advice great job and I really appreciate you sharing your knowledge with all our listeners today thank you thank you very much I enjoyed it quite a bit you're very welcome Peter Crouch real tour and associate broker with macaroni associates incorporated in Alexandria, Virginia
