by the end of that interview by the way and it's fascinating detail what\nUltimately did make it because lord knows how much they had that they went ahead and edited out but anyway uh so we're talking about the lack of climate credibility at the United nations now\nShared with you really well done a ... piece from the specter that put in context how wall United Nations has been on the climate prediction every single year for years\nYet for some reason they retain credibility for some reason we subsidize this nonsense for some reason and we know what the reasons are all political it's embraced by those on the left now\nI think any honest in decent person you are wrong if you're way that heck wrong for your entire professional career somewhere along the way you you have a sense of you know maybe I should do something else\nBut if you are part of the leftist climate science crowd\nYou're going to keep on keep it on and they're gonna keep on federal and your your nonsense and that's exactly what we've seen it's fascinating as you take a look at the entire way this thing came full circle you go back to the Nineteen seventies what was that it was the big global cooling and the ice age right\nSo I uh actually pulled earlier this week and the un report came out in the June twenty fourth Nineteen Seventy four times article it was based on this climate science called another on stage\nAnd then on April twenty eight Nineteen Seventy five Newsweek they published a story that clean world because that's what was going on\nManmade global cooling\nAnd then somewhere along the way it's like oh crap that's not working out\nSo then it became one in the eighties and nineties you'll remember what it was a member of al every aerosol can every little above that hairspray for that big eighties here that was another chunk out that it was ... oh yeah the elimination of the ozone layer\nAnd then somewhere along the way are like oh you\nIs actually has something to do with the ozone layer and guess what if we actually dedicated the entire effort in this world towards eliminating that we probably couldn't because we're probably not going to be highly effective at taking out the sun oh and by the way some of those are holes [laughter]\nFunny thing is sunspots you know [noise] [laughter] [noise] so that one way and then what did it become ... global warming only got global warming for many years Frank and then ... oh\nNot buying it to go from global cooling we go from the ozone layer to global warming to something that actually Israel does something that's actually real to climate change\nAnd that is how they completed the corrupt circle because climate change Israel always has been always will be funny things happen we'd had ice ages we've had periods of extreme heat\nWe've had a minimum of three mass extinction events all remarkably enough before we were even on this planet\nIt must have been on like the the dinosaur flatulence you know you know like a cow farts they actually are more polluting than than like a you know cars so if you just had if you think about it is it the pita crowds to really think about this for a moment if we don't eat meat\nI I mean what happens you care more about the the ... or do you care about uh you know your your climate change there because he got you know we're more cows what's going to happen\nThis is a real moral dilemma you should consider this anyway apparently or what happened was a bunch of ... and I dunno flatulence ended up leading to a ... extinction events ... it'll be just you know following all the logic to its natural\nConclusion you say [noise]\n\nWas getting two sides of stories [noise] one side effects I joined back and we'll continue to bring them to you I\nAm Brian money for the gray one march\n\nDo you remember when comedy was great\n... wasn't profane and it wasn't worried about hurting someone's feelings well after being gone for far too long great comedy is ... an ounce things see our TVs made comedy rate again tour coming to our performance theater near you find ... theater\nIn the affected areas and it makes a difference every now and then you see the pictures Mexico beach you'll see structures that are still standing right next to whole areas that are just completely wiped down nothing but the brain and you'll what's the difference there\nHad an idea that a lot of those homes were built well before we had the Miami Dade standards after Hurricane Andrew in Ninety two went back and took a look the average home that was built Mexico beach is Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty three\nWell before those standards what brain homes and so the media you is your in one of those types of homes and you're at a point to where you could be impacted by a hurricane\nYou know you you might want to think about your situation or because if you get a hurricane that's like a tornado comes near you know think about the impact in your home the ones that are standing\nBy and large are your structures that were built\nAfter Ninety two with those upgraded and updated standards to me the difference not only in life and death but it can make the difference\nIn your home being there versus your home being wiped out can make the difference between a community that can be rebuilt and something that isn't even recognize civil was mentioning Hurricane Irma last year you go to the uh the lower ...\nYou'll see when you go down there every now and then like huh wow it seems like there's a lot of space where they're used to be homes\nThat's the case there are there any more Arabs completely wiped out many of them were just taken straight into the ocean and the and the lower keys for or McCain through and he got others Mm a couple of shingles missing\nCan be the difference of life and death big big deal so anyway\nAh just ah as you're seeing these pictures putting everything in context\nA you know you get it was I I think very very much like Andrew in I think we're very fortunate that it went in in an area that was ... as sparsely populated relatively as that area to minimize the damage the devastation caused because the the Israel\nBut thank God it didn't go into a place where you had millions of people for example at that size and that strength\nAlright uh been talking about some of the financial frauds the climate for on throughout the course of the show oh we're going to check in the title one that talked about single payer Todd in Ohio do\nA a nice to be honest to God I just want to point out real quick what are your friends to get out our fans check it out onto two birds that allowed or were Crowder\nUndercover and the Canadian health care system they him in a couple of his buddies go in with

good job showing it on there so\nThe our TV uh yeah you go check it out appreciate a dog and a by the way you know you're you're absolutely right I Want to clean up being here in South Florida we've got a ton of Canadians especially starting in about a month during what turns out to be our season and a lot of folks come you around for exactly the reason you're talking about health care because yes when you are in that type of environment\nUltimately you're at the mercy of the system and the system ultimately is going to weld dictate unless you end up paying through the nose the exact a

easier Tony I'm Gary ... eight six\nSix Ninety or red eye Eric I'm sure you agree with me on this we haven't even had the discussion on this but I think one of the things that the Republicans learned who might have forgotten about it is\nA the anger isn't just a Trump the anger was never all just at Trump\nFrom the left the anger has always been there the rage has always been there well excuse me\nIt's been there for the last couple of decades right now I'm going to say but it had been there last couple of decades it was there a Bush like I said we forget we have short memories Bill Maher was one who said well yeah you know we we said Bush was Hitler we said Romney was Hitler but they really weren't but this guy really is\nNo as we found out it doesn't matter who you are\nIf you are on the other side they will come after us they will defame you their rage will be amplified and will continue to be amplified to the point where you're like I really can't believe when you when you look at it when you saw some of these protesters you say I really can't believe\nThat you know these these people have\nA critical thinking bought that actually goes through their head\nWell keep in mind I mean you know for a at least five days or so Jeff Flake was a hero remember when Coons called him a hero he was a hero in all this when he delayed the process a that was until the vote\nYour hero until the book but it and it doesn't matter who you are even if you're on the west they don't you're not useful to them anymore ... does not need ... Obama campaign ... [laughter] so it doesn't matter who you are you're not immune for ... here's your forecast\nAs cleanup continues in the south after one of the most devastating storm systems to ever hit the U.S we are looking at it again today for clear skies in the region\nThe Florida Panhandle the big band in fact the entire Gulf Coast from the tip of Texas all the way over to southern Florida looks to be dry today as a big pool of Canadian air\nHas now filtered in through that portion of the country we're going to pick up some rain showers for portions of the mid west\nEspecially southern Illinois and southern Indiana along the Ohio River\nAll the protestors go home and it's so you know you you still have some talking members of the house talking about in ...\nNot going to happen it's not going to happen because\nNot going to move on it when when you know you want to do well if you want to open this door if you want to go down that road go for it I'm sure you'll have some radicals on the left on Capitol Hill that will keep talking about it but it's not going to happen for a reason because there's nothing there\nNothing there it's the reason the confirmation vote went through and he was ultimately confirmed\n\nYou're not going to have them well we can move and we can do this it's those stories are given the same credibility that the Van Jones story was given when when when Van Jones is rolling up his sleeves and working in a grassroots effort to change the mind of the electorate ... know\nThat didn't happen in fact Hillary\nHad a net loss of life doors and Trump had a net gain after the election after the election\nBecause these people don't live in reality they don't look at the facts in anything they don't they don't care about the process they want you to believe that that the process is that they slap on the Superman tape and they're going to be a hero in a moment\nAnd it doesn't happen that way you had a situation in the cabinet or confirmation process that was while it was distorted if you look at it the President Trump was the one that really made that happen in terms of extending it out\nSo there was a supplemental background check\nThere was zero zero credit\nCourse and he wasn't looking to get credit\nBut the people he wasn't looking to get credit from the the media or the left of course\nBut the people the everyday people look at it and they'll they'll look back on this process and go well one of the you know what is it the ... the ones I I mean that don't follow it every day and we know people work\nAnd some people work around the clock and thank you for listening and you don't take it in like like we do or or or your average new sound would do\nSo you don't have all the details but they look back on this and they look at the facts of this by doing just simple research and they see that it was the president himself\nThat allowed to process it was Chuck Grassley that allowed her to testify it was the Republicans that gave her every single chance to prove her case and she could not\nThat's the reality of this all\nNot that the but you know the left wants you to believe in the protesters and the ... and the baby's\nWant you to believe that it was the Republicans who squashed it no they opened it why you could not have given them or her\nMore of an opportunity to come in and prove her allegations not not to the fact that she has to prove them like a court of law but just something just to stand to have\nA preponderance of the of of right of the the evidence something\nTo back it up and she couldn't do it now\nAh and neither could neither could re mirrors and and if you look at what was actually done the uh there what what didn't what did we find out the only thing that we didn't find out\nWas Ford who said that her\nThe the uh the note and whether she had video whatever the polygraph done and the therapist notes would cooperate what she said and she refused to turn them over right it's really the only thing that we don't know because she refused and her lawyers refused to to turn them over everything that we now\nI mean there there is and if you can point to the the as the FBI said we only we know that ... you know we know that are not ... but when the ... uh came out and said that uh you know that her lawyers oh you're twenty people we wanted to interview well that's not the point\nThe point is they asked her directly who are the people that you say are witnesses\nTo the actual event but she pointed out the witnesses they interviewed them none of them right\nCould cooperate and say that anything happened in that case and none of them said anything she had plenty of time to talk she could have gone back to the Judiciary Committee or Dr Ford could and she never did\nStand with those no she could've answered them over a nearly well it was two weeks ago when the when the Judiciary Committee and the chairman asked asked for them right because\nThe the story came out that she uh and her lawyer prove or lawyers were offering those therapists notes to the FBI\nThat's interesting that we learned about after we learned that they weren't going to interview her and the supplemental background check that really is convenient\nOh no we're we're willing we've called them we were going to give them you know you weren't you knew there and they weren't you have to come to you had\nPlenty of opportunity or are they would have simply taking them and given to the Senate Judiciary committee how were they were not going to make a judgment on it they would give it to the Senate Judiciary committee ... and the Senate Judiciary committee would have gone over would have gone over then right there isn't anything of substance set the left has on the ...\nThe only thing the left has is again and it was ever changing you always believe women well unless it's a conservative woman\nOr a you know you ... you never believe the you never believed the uh the the man you had white males on the Senate Judiciary committee but when it came to the substance of the actual case\nYou know of of the political trucks that's what it was it was a political trial people say it was just a job interview uh yeah you uh don't involve the FBI in a normal job interview and uh you don't put people under oath\nUnder penalty of perjury for the average job interview so if you're saying it was just like an average job interview\nOr you're a little bit of a you're a little bit mistaken it got down to the point where all they had was an allegation and they believe that allegation should\nBe enough ... rarely if we reversed roles would that be enough ...\nReally is that where you are now the allegation is enough\nAnd then you've got to the point with Cory Booker well uh it doesn't matter the the whether he's guilty or innocent doesn't matter it's just there's so many allegations right that he should step down because yes yeah so then you get what you want to have multiple unverified allegations and that's enough for somebody to step down nothing that\nThe left are brought up nothing that the mainstream Democrats brought up we need to make sure the right to clarify this because we always get those road that's not just the if this was the mainstream of the Democratic party right and that's what they were trying to get you to buy\nThey were trying to get you to buy that the allegation is enough\nThat if a woman says it in this case it must be bully not another cases but just this particular case it must be bullied now I Know that they generally said all women must be believed but then the woman that said well why don't you believe you not say just conveniently ignored right\nYeah and and so that's what we're being told that the preponderance of the the the presumption of innocence uh uh you know doesn't exist are up for for a man or defending yourself in a passionate way shows guild mhm\nUh everything that they sure why does not pass the rational thought or critical thinking test ... none of it and it was from again I we need to repeat this this is not\nThis is not the fringe Democrats this is the mainstream of the Democratic party it is the Senate it is the Senate Judiciary committee it is the leadership of the Democratic party\nAnd they're trying to get you just to throw away any mind set of due process site\nWell as we saw even independence when the polling came out last week you know didn't buy it when they found out oh we didn't know that over witnesses said they couldn't cooperate it well the no\nConfirm yeah and and that's that's it I mean if you look at the end while it was a a fifty to forty eight vote if you look at the process from start to finish every opportunity was given to the accusers\nUh the the process was even distorted to that extent so in order to facilitate that and then ultimately it came down to one while I was voted along party lines\nWith with what two exceptions really and then other than that that's what is always going to be and it doesn't matter that it's Trump as president it doesn't matter that it's kept when I was the nominee is where we are as a nation politically right\nNow if Trump wasn't president if it was somebody else yup and he was Kevin always up there yet it would've been the exact same ... same right than a division was not created by Trump it was not

Bush or anybody else\nCame together and most did on the right or for judge Kavanaugh's confirmation and it really was about\nWhat the work and and and the results of the work of this president by nominating Kavanaugh but also the Senate or more importantly and more recently uh the work there\nAnd why it's important for Republicans in this case right now to be banded together or because it used to be where we could have the discussion will still have them I'm sure of the you know the far right conservatives on Capitol Hill versus the moderates\nUm but the ... and one of those moderates along the way would include Lindsey Graham\nI was just going to I was just going to ... um mentioned that that we knew that three weeks ago mhm that the left was motivated because they hate Trump right uh I don't know how much more motivated they could get I don't know why this royal debate the more or whether there'll be a\nWhether there'll be more of a sign of of despair and hopelessness we know that you know young people and I haven't seen a change in the ... young people that vote Democrat are are not enthusiastic about voting in this mid term ... and that could hurt the Democrats\nBut what I Know now know is that the Republican Party you mentioned Lindsey Graham you might look at look at Lindsey Graham and the fight to defend Trump and his pet yeah because if you are defending his pick your defending Trump right there is a unity there if you see that George W. Bush or read that\nCalled Collins numerous times ah to tell her how to a vote when you see the Collins beach\nYeah and and except for ... really are ... there were some things I disagreed with her honors and beach or like when she gave a Dianne Feinstein the past ... the big passed but she shouldn't have done because Dianne Feinstein was the reason that we got to this point to begin with\nAnd to say that I Know that she would never leak anything like that is forgetting about everything else that she did wrong and\nUh but the fact is Collins speech was very very thorough walked through every single a point and came across as very very\nCommon sense and this is Susan Collins defending the great Trump pick of Brett Kavanaugh or you know you can only fight so much within\nYour own party before you realize it's working against you and the things that you wish to\nUh uh get done as a Republican or Republican Party right now it's a pretty big party it's a pretty big party going from conservatives to moderate liberal really is it's funny when you come when it comes to spending culturally uh probably a more rights than they've been in a while\nA more constitutional is than they've been in a while when it comes to social issues not spending issues are there as bad as Democrats have been in the past ah ah ah right now and you know but and and that's a shame but overall when you look at it you have unity in that party\nAs I said last week like I Can't remember when we had shut unity part of it is the fight uh from the president but the president has always had that fight in rhetoric\nBut in substance you know when some of the people that he picked and how he would change his opinions or a ... on them and not stick with them and you know even you know going after sections as he still goes after them as he did others early on\nMade you think OK doesn't really know who is picking this really of confidence in the people out there and hymns sticking by Kavanaugh\nWasn't just rhetoric it was the substance of no he stays and we're going with him and I don't know whether that embolden other people to say what they what they said I don't know you know ... what was the spark that drove Lindsey Graham\nTo still be on the Sunday Morning news show same Google campaign anywhere in any purple state yeah\nRight ... you know and that's it ... because\nThat's where the effort has to be we can still have the discussions within a the right on issues of where we need to go especially putting pressure on them to control spending to change fiscal policy or to the extent that it is going to be meaningful\nAnd mean great things long term for this country I I think we are light years right now or to say that this kind of momentum can get us to that point where we can change the spending habits I mean for Republicans and\nTheir mentality on that is is not there yet we're we're probably away from that because that goes back to again what we said the base uh the the rank and file Republicans and and what they want out of their government but again that's a discussion we can have\nUltimately what has to happen though and this is this is you see this to some extent on the left while in social media and then the protests calling out or or even officially the calling out of a Dianne Feinstein I mean before this process the uh Democrats of California you know not backing her officially\nA for her run and that kind of again that's there's that's an anomaly often on the left they are better than the right at\nLetting the uh mansions of the world and even maybe a high camp uh uh do what they do\nDo what they do in their state because it gives them the seat ultimately on other and the vote on other issues I'm On the right there has to be I I guess a greater unity politically on Capitol Hill\nOf building\nBuilding the wall really if you if you think about it that guards or guard this nation\nAgainst the kind of behavior we saw over the last few weeks this is not this kind of behavior is not over they believe they almost got there they believe they did change the process they do believe they can change the process on other items if they get a head start which is why they start with well we need to do away with the Senate\nAnd we predicted this at the moment they talked about getting away with a good well why would the electoral Donald the Democratic senators won't before that don't that's it's not going to have you know it's not ... but the point being is their behavior is not going to change and they'll work to that and and\nIt means if the because if they're willing to you know to talk about and and maybe even get some kind of movement growing movement and the calling for doing away with the Senate which gamble never happened\nThey are willing to do and and work in any in every direction to do away with this and that and those little things and that guard has to be built that power that castle\nIf you will that wall that ... has to be built around this nation to protect this constitution\nYou can get a few things done if you're not unified but I Believe you get a lot more things done when you're unified especially when you're unified over the substance of of an issue in the substance is here\nI'm a very easy presumption of innocence right due process constitutional issues not defending somebody when you talk about those are all ... we usually moral issues\nAnd that's what has United the Republican Party I Hope it continues to unite them through the election and if they are able to take the house it'll be interesting to see if they can take that unity into two thousand Nineteen in two thousand twenty\nAnd get legislation passed that is extremely productive and conservative\nAnd hopefully give Trump the chance to win in twenty twenty against state yeah Camilla Harrison Ford Booker\nRight by the way I remember after the Roy Moore last that's when they got the tax deal done and that's when they got that legislation done they couldn't get it done before they lost that seat when they lost that seat that was motivating it shouldn't have been they should have been ... motivated before that\nEight six six Ninety read I\nWas very much dimmer roast tend to record the radio [noise]\n", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "13"}
