the nicest people I Know as David Limbaugh and he writes great books and he's got one out right now called Jesus risen\nNow this isn't exactly my area of expertise but it's become his area of expertise he's written a lot about politics and so forth but he now has written extend\nTentatively about Christianity David Limbaugh how are you my friend\nMark how are you a thank you so much for having me on\nWell it's a great pleasure in the book is as I said Jesus risen first of all let me ask you this you are more and more a writing you're really you become a bit of a scholar in this area of Christianity and so forth how did you come to this point [laughter]\nWhen I was a [noise] a young adults I wasn't really a believer I I Would always believed in God but I I didn't quite have branched out of the Bible until I really started studying it and and I had to overcome\nSome hospitals up ... overcome some doubts and when I finally became a believer I I thought OK I'm holding in my hand the word of God with the Bible and I was\nSo in all of that so made that I wanted to inhale it and gobble it up and read as much as I could learn as much as I could about the Bible and theology and I I Wish that that time\nBut there were some short cut that there were some a guide some performers that would help me get a hold a ... a handle on the Bible more quickly than I did takes a lot of work if you do it on your own takes a lot of work anyway and and it's worthwhile work but as I\nStudy that I I I wanted to share what I learned because I was so excited about it so I tried to write a book on it and this was before I had any platform hadn't written any columns and written any books and it didn't really go anywhere it was premature but then I started writing a column and\n... and probably ten or Fifteen Years later I'd written all those columns two columns a week\nEvery week and I got five books under my belt and I thought well I now have a platform I've got a little more confidence\nUh and I might just try this again so I wrote my first Christian themed book again ... explain my faith journey and why I Believe in Christianity and then from there and I've just gone on to write other books in the last one was a book about the gospels are where I go through\nThe gospels and explain what the text is in a kind of paraphrasing chronological order and then also interspersed commentary from some of the greatest Christian thinkers\nAnd some of my own inside and I wanted to continue with the New Testament after that because I ran out of space literally on that book so I started with the book of acts in this book and\nIt has a history of the early church and six of Paul's Thirteen of pistols his letters to the early church is so that's what this book is it's just a continuation of a my a trek through the New Testament\nA and I got more to go and the next book of ... my publisher agrees to do it so what what the in the short answer the question is I was on fire for the Bible remain on fire the Bible study that really pretty hard for a lay person\nOr the last Twenty years on and off and I wanted to share that passion get help people where I was Hoover who were doubters and wanted to learn more\nAnd give them some kind of a primer and and a deep dive if they wanted to go further I Hope this book is both deep and accessible at the same time and will help people learn about the Bible and most of all inspire them to read the Bible for themselves and learn about it\n[noise] let me ask you this question when you look around the world\nYou see Christianity under attack even in our own country just under attack in different ways to look at the middle east ... same with Judaism you would think that the only religion that ever existed in the middle east was Islam yeah and you just the third religion to exist\nAnd Christians have been pushed out of most of the Arab countries obviously there are individuals who want to push the Jews have sort of Jerusalem in Israel but when you look at our own country talk about the Supreme Court and the courts generally there is a growing hostility\nTowards Christianity steel sink your book\nWill help people better understand that they don't have to be afraid of your face to face\nYou know that is such a good question I I really believe that the Judeo Christian tradition is at the bedrock of our constitutional principles and I realized there's in white and that influences and Judeo Christian principles a behind the constitution and our liberties\nAnd what our tradition stands for the Judeo Christian Church tradition stands for freedom we believe were made in God's image we believe where we have these innate rights ... writes that come from ... that comes from our religious tradition\nAnd ... as a result of really believing that from the core of our soul\nThat we all men are entitled to that freedom we by definition do not want to suppress the freedom and liberty at any one else their religious or political liberty and that includes people whose views are and they're not the U.S\nTherefore the laugh in response to your question has nothing to fear for for much atheist had nothing to fear from as Islam as long as it doesn't attacked us has nothing to fear from us\nAnd yet the the ... the ... the the totalitarian the authoritarian the suppressor of free speech and liberty come from the left\nAnd we do have something to fear from them and so I don't like this notion that Christians should or Jews should sit idly by while the secular left destroys our liberties destroys our way of life destroys those sacred values that that\nUnderlying under guard all of our freedoms\nAre and we can't just some Christian some passive Christian suggest we can't just pray and expect God to do it all of course we pray and we put it under his control but he put us here for a purpose we didn't just we we weren't just placed on earth but he passed it by standard we need to be active and there's nothing\nIncompatible between Christianity and political activism as long as we are acting in accordance with our principles and that's what I think we try to do and I we have to fight the last as hard as they buy that we don't have to be as dirty as they are but we do have to be as relentless and it's intense\nI and that's what we need to do and yes they have nothing to fear for much we have a lot to be concerned about in terms of what they would do to us if they have the power\nOf the book is Jesus is risen it's by David Limbaugh or you can get it at Amazon dot com or you can go to my site secure they're already ... show Facebook's Mark Sullivan show Twitter we have a link to it is really a fascinating and um\nSo went into the er the audience little interesting discussion you and I had when I said I Want you to come on and discuss your book\nAnd David is so respectful of other face another leaves and other people he said well are you really short because you know I'm I'm Talking about Jesus and you know and you're Jewish and so forth\n[noise] and I said I get it it's okay I Want you to come on my show I Want you to talk about this I'll tell you why David and we're going to come back in thirty seconds\nI see more vibrant some more rigorous alarm the Christians say better society and I feel the same way about my own religions Judaism\nSo let's discuss that a little bit when we come back we'll be right back\n\nDown pollen dirt we spend most of our time indoors so am I read in the outdoors when you're inside too with over six hundred scientists to choose from plus custom option we have a solution to make your indoor air cleaner fresher and\nYeah so and that's been documented in and\nA lot of people want to debunk that because it has any interest of the secularists to uh say to rewrite history to revise history and say that the framers were not religious men that they were secularists and that\nUh they they say that as a result of that we should get back to our secular values and when they they wanna radically transform fundamentally transform our nation\nOr back to secularism and those kind of values that but because they distort what really it really was but we know for a fact what they want to transform us back to is something that's anathema to our founding principles and we watched the totalitarian tendencies as a laugh\nOr as Obama tried to bring on and he wanted to fundamentally transform the nation into nothing like it appeared at the time nothing like it was founded and you've written eloquently about this and you know that his son in mental transformation was not a restoration of where we started\nAbout a radical transformation away from it and the completion of the destruction of our founding principles in my view\n[noise] now again not [laughter] I Want to say I'm an expert on this subject won't even say I'm close to that [noise] but the way you're dividing your writings on this and you kind of touched on at the beginning is how his house and then where do you go from here\n[noise] okay I Am\nA again wanting to complete my Journey Through the New Testament I'd already written some of the Old Testament\nAnd I want to help readers really understand the Bible so these this and I want to give them the historical perspective until the book of acts in the early church the history of the early church it really happened in history these are real people\nAnd and I wrote and I and I included the book of acts as I say with the history of the early church and then six of the apostle Paul Thirteen of pills he writes these forms the Iraqis letters to the churches after he had planted these churches throughout the Roman empire and they're falling away from the religion they're falling prey to\nThe secular influence is just like we see today the secular influences up the pagan city of corn which was\nDominated by a sexual immorality and I ... from the\nMainly feature of the the love God it's Africa ... and Paul would write to these churches in such a personal an intimate way saying look I've formed you as I Would birth a baby and I told you the truth gospel and here you aren't deviating listen to the listening to these\nPagan influences and following year less will desires and he told them what they needed to do to get back on course not follow the false teachers but remember what he told them when he was there\nAnd then he gives them instruction on practice a Christian living how to live right\nNow to be good and moral people listen to the Holy Spirit of a bay the Holy Spirit\nAnd then and then continue to do what is right and he also expanded on the doctor and the Christian doctor\nAnd what's interesting mark is this really happened in history and I want to give readers a sensor that history because when when they when they read that they will understand it really happened in although Paul wrote these letters to a particular churches\nHe didn't know that though they were inspired by God they would be a ... to all of us for\nThe next two thousand or however many years the world exist\nSo they're of universal application to all churches and all the people who read these letters even though they were written to individual people at a specific point in time in history we still profit for men today as Christians waved their holy scripture the New Testament they become part of the New Testament and God's word in our view\nSo it's just ... miraculous how this has occurred and people can really\nProfit from these from these words which we believe are God's work so I Want to help all my book is not\nA God's word it's a book about gods were trying to sell a tape people's understanding of dance they're learning curve reduced or intimidation about the Bible and most of all it as I said again inspire them to read it and gobble it up like I've tried to do the last Twenty years\nWell you're very much the renaissance man the subjects that you've written about it\nStrikes that you've written about over the years really are um [noise] a very well they cover a lot of territory and this is this is an area I Know that is very very important to you and true to you and you dedicate the book tell everybody that this is to Christian and Sam who who are they\nAre Chris my oldest daughter and Sam is her new husband and they got married a month or so

present it and the people get to see the FBI or what you forget about is the FBI is not investigating anything on the ground with them I wasn't a criminal matter it was a background check they in fact what the FBI\nWould deal with it would be put into the three oh two\nWhite which then the Democrats and the Republicans would both have\nThat's how that works right that's the only role of the FBI and its entire equation is to give the Senate the information\nYou're making it sound like the FBI but then do an investigation on it no it would end up in the partisan body anyway\nThat's in fact the only purpose the FBI serves in this scenario is to deliver that information to the White House in the Senate\n\nIf I mean she would officially be given putting it into the three oh two had she'd done

I'm ... I'm sure they're going to make this work while your daughter's in ... wedding is certainly paramount uh I'm certain there was there was no way the Danes was going to miss that\nAre either of those events\nThe vote if right now the Republican Party um and I I really have to wonder about like you know if you look at at ah at lake in his comments about the report they seem to be I guess indicating that he still could be I guess what I'm assuming\nKnow so um yeah uh that's different though when you broadened it out to the rest of Texas now certainly he's done better than um\nA lot of the people who jumped into different racist\nOr the former ah Dallas County sheriff Lupe Lupe Valdez\nUh and uh you know her running against ah the the current Governor Greg Abbott um that's you know again he's he's very well in the lead but well when you broaden it out to the state right level you've got to go wild you've got to realize that you you have to pretend you're in the middle\nWell that and that's a bit of Russia's trying to do is try and do you try to picture himself and he's not in the middle on anything no but he he realizes that he has to lie even take get demos he can't be truthful even with Democrats in Texas and hope to get elected and yet the realization I mean the Democrats used to be that way all the time they used to\nWe need to move to the middle we need to move to the middle we got to move to the middle we've got to move to the middle\nAnd and then over the last ten years or so no they were going to basically this is who we are I guess my point is that when you think about\nTen years ago right now when you think of ten years ago mhm when Obama was running for president ... wasn't it right about now right around this was in October\nRemember he held it would've been no would have been the convention where he a conviction ... when he was at the stadium the football stadium in in in Denver\nThey had like ... it looked like\nHe was a you know the ... the entire stage it was set up when these elders and everything else where he looked like\nSome Greek forum yes yes ... and ... and people going crazy and and remembering his first term Evan Thomas from Newsweek at the time he's God blight yeah\nHe's he's a ... you'd always post partisan he's God like he hovers over the rest of us he's the smartest person in the world to now ten years later\nOne of the leading\nSocialist candidates in the country I\nRide on Obamacare and we don't I don't need all by it when I Do you know we don't need about ...\nThe only as a Hollywood they come out and that's that's a great point because here's ...\nThat's a great point because here's the thing is that aesthetic ally in inside the state it doesn't work but\nA work has no problem taking money from outside the state from the liberals who have been pouring money into the state of well into his coffers in order to be Ted Cruz an effort to be Ted Cruz um you know so you know he wants the liberals basically fill liberals to you guys stay outside of Texas\nLook we've got our liberal places in in Texas but there are plenty of the districts that are blue and counties that are blue including the county we broadcast from yeah but but here the the point is though the point is\nNot who he would have gotten in addition if he would have got ... Obama mhm but the fact is he knew he could reject Obama publicly yet\nBut but then the signs of and I'm going to ask core yeah doesn't care yeah Obama means nothing no no no no that's that's exactly what I'm what I'm getting too\nIs that it does nothing for them and it only irritates someone who might be in the middle and tied right\nI mean is it only works against that middle which might get you over it actually is the only thing that in this case especially that's going to get you over the top for the win but he knows by\nEssentially denouncing and saying you know turning down the Obama endorsement that it does not hurt his base\nRight\nThey don't care right we don't uh biggest Obama's yesterday's news\nWell listen I mean I'm liar Lanny Davis remember he was going to be the hero\nYou know so he was the here over the ... the point is is not that Lanny Davis is is a rock Obama but the point is is that there is a new hero for different reasons every day on the left am I the way that you're always going to be the demon tomorrow that's the way it works because you could be someone who is a fellow victim\nOf whatever right now but tomorrow you're going to be the oppressor there's the person standing next to you will have a new reason to victim and will need a new oppressor and it's going to be you here's\nHere's but my my uh again I could be wrong but here's my here's my got\nThat liberal Democrats the ones that would vote for you know a beta or care in the state of Texas so I\nLook at I Can't believe we're gonna use the word they look at Obama and say he was a poster right he really said he was going to do all this stuff and he didn't do a damn thing right he just sat up there and he liked being president but he really didn't believe and didn't push the leftist causes\nThat we believed in that he went from God to like to pose or in ten years\nOr by the beginning of his his\nUh inauguration to the end of his term as president of the United states that is how the modern day liberal looks at him\nThey look at him and they just say wow\nOkay also eat him anymore he's not to think about this now is Obama is not ... as a president like Kim 'cause you and I talked about is that you know by the by the time we got to the terms that Obama would be the leader we've ... owns have predicted it but I thought there was a great chance that Obama\nBecause there was nobody else in Feinstein you know or or or pillows he's getting old and you know Schumer is to New York and so it would still be Obama that would be the leader for a while of the Democratic party is nothing anymore\nNow going back to the the tragic night here in Dallas in July or twenty sixteen when five police officers were killed by Michael Johnson and the hours that led up to that horrific night it was just a few a couple of hours before it started\nI was online uh I follow the local media on Facebook\nAnd one of the local TV stations was live Facebooking\nThe protestors because it was a protest march and was peaceful up until that point of course [noise]\nBut they were talking to the leaders of the protest associated with a there were a couple of different groups that were represented there are including black lives matter but the leaders of the protests the ones who are speaking\nThis was about six forty five PM in the ... that was the reason that the television station was life Facebooking this because they're broadcast the six PM broadcast news broadcasts was over so they went to like Facebook\nSo I'm watching the thing I remember the most is them saying\nWhat does Obama done for us to remember this was the beginning for twenty six ten months before the twenty sixteen election July twenty sixteen waters Hillary done for us\nNothing what did Obama do for us nothing and I thought to myself you know there because that was one of those\nUh cracks in the foundation if you will of the left although it had started happening before that for me it was telling\nMe 'cause you had young activists and the two that were speaking were African American what does Obama done for us\nWas Hillary done for us the left or the Democrats the Democratic party thinking they're going to get the when you don't get the when just because they may agree with you at the moment\nThe protestors are carrying the party the party doesn't have direction because there's no one single cause no it's melting irrational right and it it it always will be that's why the party has no direct line\nBy right now that's what you get with identity politics yet 'cause there is no there is there an identity there is there is no general issue or goal ... goal that they actually want because when you split everybody yes when you when you continue to expand your pie of victims and therefore expand your pie of oppressors\nYou end up never being able to as a party having a particular political goal this is probably the closest that you'll get to a political goal which is to defeat Kavanaugh\nYes if the activists are are are going in multiple directions well then then the party is led by them they're going in trying to us every direction and they have no direction at all\nExcept for abortion rafting right now you're nights the Democrats right eight six six Ninety read I\nWas really much to stand there regardless it's radio [noise]\nListen to read I radio show
