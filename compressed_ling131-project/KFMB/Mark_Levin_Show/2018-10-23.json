never has a response\nWhy would my opponent or why would better or not want to run in Texas for governor or state rep or senator to do all of these social things where at least it's constitutionally reasonable to have the debate but they know that stuff doesn't sell in Texas so the only way to win the only way\nTo go came up when they had been below the and Chuck Schumer and the rest of the left

conservative I assume you would join the Freedom Caucus is that correct\nYes sir I've already a publicly um a said that I joined the Freedom Caucus I've supported Jim Jordan and his race for speaker I fundamentally believe that his campaign to quote do what we said we would do hardly something that should be earth shattering but unfortunately in Washington DC it too often it is\nAnd we all know when we get out here on the campaign trail and you and your listeners know that the failures in Washington stem from their failure to do what they said they would do that is why Trump is successful and why people are a proud to support him is because when he said you're going to do something he endeavors to do it but Republicans in Congress\nFailed to do that they're failed to repeal Obamacare they failed to balance the budget and they run away from border security and the consequences are dire or seeing people with two and three and four times the cost of their health health insurance

Bush administration right we had a decade of economic growth that was on average and you know this is somewhere in the one percent two percent range depending on the year\nWhich was causing that continued stagnation what's causing the lack of the ability to build buildings have the jobs that we need a lack of economic growth which obviously harm to the deficit and debt as well\nAnd now what do we think we're seeing four percent economic growth forcing the United states for the first time at a decade labeled as the most competitive nation on earth right we're seeing a jobless claims the all time load and not just for everybody but for groups like Hispanics and black business owners other folks\nThat we're seeing incredible successes\nAnd that is not rocket science\nIf you leave money

Tennessee\nAnd Texas only in Nevada had democratic affiliated voters exceeded Republican affiliated voter so far in early voting according to the data key Senate races are underway in seven of those eight states\nAnd we'll prove pivotal in determining which party controls the or the chamber the latest data suggest robust enthusiasm among early Republican voters that could put a dent in democratic co spray blue wave in next month's midterm election remember I'm reading verbatim from the NBC story\nA Republican or Republicans typically dominate a early voting by absentee ballots while Democrats tend to tell you the advantage with him in person early voting for example the entire early voting picture and Florida\nWhich has yet to be gone in person voting is incomplete\nOr in Arizona were two

percent of early voters had a Republican affiliation\nCompared to thirty three percent of the Democratic affiliation right twenty three percent of early voters were not affiliated with either major party and the group as other\nIn the NBC News or a partisan analytics in Florida where democratic Bill Nelson who's running for re election in a tight race against Republican governor Rick Scott forty four percent of the early voters had a Republican affiliation versus thirty eight percent who had a democratic uh\nTight race against Republican governor Rick Scott\nForty four percent of the early voters had a Republican affiliation versus thirty eight percent who had a democratic affiliation\nAn Eighteen percent who are not affiliated with either party in Indiana where democratic Senator Joe Donnelly is facing reelection challenge from Mike Braun fifty one percent of early voters had a Republican affiliation compared with thirty nine percent who had a democratic affiliation\nAnd ten percent were not affiliated with either party you know that's something to be looking at not just the\nNot just the voter enthusiasm of Republicans and Democrats which by the way is extremely important mhm because if you have more enthusiasm of Republicans and emerge mid term election like that that's almost unheard of\nWell especially when you talk about first day of early voting one one reason they take a look at that as it because people are essentially chomping at the bet to to ... to to get there say and who was at which group is that that is more motivated to get their first that can tell you something\nAbout the the point I was trying to bring is not not the Democrat or Republican but\nIf you have if you know if ten percent or in one case was it the in Florida eight Eighteen percent not affiliated were independence going right now where the polls\nOn were independence live right now our independence being affected by what has gone on now independence for the most part did not like what was going on in the Kavanaugh hearings which may be a huge\nUh you know a driver to the poll of independence but we're independence going in this election I haven't seen a lot of you know election polling analytics on independence we've heard a lot about the enthusiasm of Republicans and\nDemocrats but of course that's key because independence and most elections decide\nYou know where the country is going mhm and I just haven't seen much I'll do some more research on it now yeah I'm going to do more research see what's out there on on independence but it just popped into my head right now we spent so much time talking about were Democrats or Republicans are\nAre not realizing that a significant portion the the determining factor of votes in most states is still you know the where the independents line mhm\n[noise] yeah you you get to the break down to the polls that we do have available to us and that number of I guess are not independence but undecided voters starts to become much much smaller and that's where that's why we're you know for me\nI'm anxious to look at some some of the latest polls\nBecause you go back to uh the Montana race or any of the other Senate races and if you've got numbers that are that are pre Kavanaugh that that's something very different though I mean it's it's something that because people will make\nThis this inevitably happens the closer you get the more the the fewer undecided you have\nAn any given race and it's crucial just I think\nThat it's the job of the pollsters\nTo to show those numbers as close to an election days you can but you know again or they haven't been as active as they were in years past than you and I've been following it you know for a while maybe that's going to change in the in you know later this week what\nWe know for example that the internal polling that was being done roughly two to three weeks out of back in in twenty sixteen\nThe Hillary people knew they were in trouble and the internal polling you didn't hear a lot of talk about that at all in in the general public but after the election post election that's just started hearing that\nThey saw you know that that's when they started seen in some of those districts in those states you know when we're talking about Pennsylvania and and in Michigan and Wisconsin that's why they saw some of the change at that point mhm and\nThey said oh and you know they saw that swing at that point and in most elections as we see what you see in July is not necessarily what you see the last three weeks right now internally because they're doing the polling consistently\nYou have the political parties that have an idea they see where the momentum is going at this particular point 'cause we are just two weeks out now so for the last week\nEspecially if you went inside most political parties and say we're what is your polling showing you're going to have one or another say okay the momentum is moving our waivers and moving our way mhm we just don't have access to those particular polls at the moment\nAnd how will we know afterwards yeah because the the ... the analyze you know what happened in a particular political election you know we'll we'll be analyze after the election but it's what's happening right now in the internal polls are probably showing that\nBut when we look at so many of the polls out there so that that haven't been taken in two three four weeks some even more than four weeks out what was going on in September is not the mindset of the voter of a significant portion of the voter right now\nRight yeah I mean it it's it's I think um it it will be interesting to see what the rest of the early voting turnout is like and and where those numbers comeback but but ultimately you have to get down to those polls in each of those individual races and I just suspect we're not going to see\nYou know a a [noise] I guess an onslaught of those polls leading up to that a leading up to election day or two weeks from today by the way so um but the early voting\nOn Texas and Florida are you know it will be interesting I think to watch but then you go to those tighter races I'm In Texas it's it's a war\nThan and cruise the crews and latest poll has been ahead by at least in the latest two balls or by seven points or so and they are seeing the average he's up by seven and he said over fifty percent and and each of those last few polls so\nYou know that's not one that I Would call at this moment two weeks out assuming those numbers are still in that goes back a little over a week ago\nAssuming those numbers still hold that's not one that I Would call a you know neck and neck or or up in the air and undecided right now I'm you know too close to call if you will I think it's right now that momentum is with Ted Cruz\nA and if you look at it for the last poll for the ah was ah I don't have it here in front of me is the last poll for or\nOr work and Cruz was a week ago that yeah it was a little over a week ago\nI guess my point would be that doesn't even include the last debate\nYeah that's and that's my point is that is what I was I was asking you at the top of the hour or the or the pre show meeting\nI said you know because I Would I Would think that you would have won and maybe maybe we'll see one or later today or or Wednesday that covers the debate maybe they were waiting and and going through Monday to to have people digest that debate and\nAh you know I don't know I really don't know but I I expect we'll see some more polls\nBut they probably won't be as numerous\nDebate and uh you know I don't know I really don't know but I I expect we'll see some more polls but they probably won't be as numerous as what we've seen and and um the last month or

know ... we set it why not just have a\n... game separate they they could have a three hours of protests and kneeling and then they could have three hours of football but I'm\nHere just to National Football league stars on opposing teams had to be separated before game on Sunday over the long simmering tensions related to the national anthem protests as Colin Kaepernick weighed in on the side of an old ally the incident between Arab greed of the Carolina Panthers and Malcolm Jenkins\nOf the Philadelphia Eagles took place at the start of the teams week seven match up ... at Lincoln financial field in Philadelphia on Sunday as teams do every week members of the eagles and Panthers began congregating at midfield\nFor the ceremonial coin flip to determine which team receives the ball to start\nThe uh the game a when a that to happen uh apparently then Eric read um you know a a approach\nAbout Malcolm Jenkins label him a subtle sell out and then Neal colonialist for not kneeling apparently Jenkins as part of the group\nThat the decided okay if the NFL gives us money we won't meal anymore and so Eric Reid doesn't like that so we called him a needle colonial is now you notice that nobody on the Buffalo Bills has been called a needle colonialists by that\nBecause the bills don't attempt and don't get into anybody else's territory\nThere never able dog ... anybody else's territory that's very true on the field so you'd be if you can't look at the Buffalo Bills right wing with their own Gerard yeah yeah yeah look during the colonial yeah in fact of the opposite they're anti Neal colonial's because when they're on off and say keep being pushed back\nBackwards there now gaining any territory they're being pushed further back yes\nIn fact I I was looking at the other day they have the worst are very close to Arizona but they have the worst attempt at colonizing in the NFL gaining any new territory\nNow they have become the oppressor they're just as bad as Trump they're just as bad as any top ... because they have decided that they will negotiate to try to make things better\nAnd the radical left doesn't want to negotiate show they want the constant and they want it's\nThis constant a debate I'll do they want to be able to cry racism day in and day out and the fact that it's never going to be solved because it can't be solved once it solved or once you get to where most people believe society is today we're racism is not a factor like it was\nFifty years ago or sixty years ago or a hundred years ago or a hundred and fifty years ago they have to win says that it's actually worse than it's ever been or they lose their purpose or purposes gone they can't say that things are getting better for and so boom it's going to blow up\nAnd a significant portion of the NFL of blacks in the NFL that were initially supportive of it and said OK enough we made the protests we've made our point we've got the money from the NFL to put to good causes we believe are good causes\nNow they aren't the defenders of the victims now they are the oppressors is what happens\nGraduates happening with the Democrats everyday it's happening now in the NFL\nWe've been saying for years here not unexpected no because it doesn't matter who you are the person standing with you nearly with you as the case may be in protest could be the oppressor tomorrow\nAnd that's what's happening now Malcolm Jenkins is a sellout\nRight I'm sure you know ... whatever other labels and want to throw at them but a Neal colonialist that's the that's my favorite one mhm he's now Neal colonialist yes that term was used on an NFL football field yeah well that's a first at least\nWhether they're making progress right [laughter] eight six six Ninety red eye looking to

Trump Administration is considering reverting the definition of gender joy biological objective and scientific standard drawing the anger of the pro science lab\n[laughter]\nThe party of science [noise] [laughter] [noise] [noise] they even have their own sign your guy\nYeah I just I just I we I was gonna bring a strobe district just didn't have time and I was just thinking what we were talking about\nYou know how the expanding victim and oppressor base of the Democratic party right now we're ... we're using the example ... of the transgender movement against feminist mhm were feminist now and we've set feminism is dead if any man can be a woman whenever they wish to be a woman sure I mean\nIf you look at the ... in fact the uh the civil rights act this is gone if anyone anyone simply by claiming simply by claiming can belong to any protected group there are no protected groups\nRight and we saw this with the whole bit war in a while [laughter] messier easily mathematics lesson from last week well [laughter] it's also strategy less than on what not to do but it\n\nAnd the matter what their goal is are are they stealing or ah right they still in for money right a buddy\nThrough colonial because it was it was it was coupled [laughter]\nI don't know I mean [laughter] it's real bad [laughter] but the but the thing is is that um the the\nIt was it was part of the whole well there's too much money in politics or oh who's the guy that was on I'm used to be on CNBC then he went over to MSNBC\nOr Dylan Ratigan you know that was his ... and he you know have have a fake anger thing going on but we said look break this down of work do you do what I'll break it down to two words oh Casio Cortez\nShe spent next to nothing compared to her opponent Hillary want Hillary didn't win right\nBut I Know but nobody in the lead really has complained about money in politics right sit right Hillary so it was funny because some I saw that on social media if somebody said Trump won because of the money in that said ah\nHillary raised more money and then they just shut up they were quiet life right ooh a look at look at the uh look Democrats don't complain about money in politics them if they're raising the money right you see that in the exact nope nobody's complaining about not I\nHave not heard one Democrat come out and say it's just\nWrong that Robert Francis O'Rourke is raising on President had money pursue it rained all in fact it's quite the opposite they're they're promoting the idea you have sons is a good thing\nSo when that started coming out and that was became a ... but you know that was McCain fined gold and and that's when the rules and regulations came out as two groups of people that couldn't that couldn't run advertising or you know within most at sixty days of of an election I Believe ... six it is within an election\nBecause it might influence an election right well that's the only reason you're one ad is to influence an election and the reason you run ads close to an election is to influence an election and at that point we just said do these people understand\nHow the country was formed do they understand about the petition of government for redress some grievances irrespective of who that group is do they actually understand that and clearly they didn't want to understand it so we said this spat going back ten Fifteen when you when I started working together\nSo going back Thirteen an hour or maybe almost Thirteen and a half years ago right when you and I got together and I know we were saying that beforehand ... but it's like we said we don't believe in the first amendment you don't believe in the second amendment and so that's grown and grown and grown and grown and grown and since that time we have said look if you don't believe\nIn these major attendance of the constitution of the United states you actually don't believe in the United states right and now we're to the point here where they don't believe in the Senate they don't believe in the the well the who was who came out said that the presidency was adequate\nAnd that was a few weeks ago was that that was that Michael Moore was Michael Moore so it was somebody in that same end up it was the same time well no it was at the same time when he said it's over that the ... century essentially the the office of the president of the United states you know it's over this is you know it's it is now gone it's\nAnd then someone in that same period said we we need to do away with the presidency altogether right\nAnd so but we've heard the electoral college just to go now it's the Senate that has to go right back to being picked up by more on the left every single day if you go to social media oh it's just not fair of a sudden it needs to go Senate needs to go to and as we've said that's extremely important because if you do understand the constitution which unfortunately\nThe majority of America does not\nHave you seen the polls a majority of American can't tell you what the three branches of government are they can't tell you what the rights are in the first amendment to the constitution they don't know they a lot of them don't care\nBut the majority of Americans don't know recording to the polls and when it comes to this you know the separation of powers the three branches of government that the vast majority of Americans can't tell you that well then you don't even know how our country works\nWhich I then we have stayed in we understand why people say the country isn't exceptional you don't even know what makes us exceptional right or if you believe that the Senate shouldn't be gone if you believe that the electoral college should be gone you don't understand the basis of what this how this country was formed\nBut it wasn't that that it wasn't on a pure democracy it was on a representative government we're the minority would be protected were individual rights would be protected something that the left used to understand and promote\nAnd now they don't care as long as it's as long as they they don't care to protect the minority as long as it's the minority that they don't care about [laughter]\nOr they don't care about individual rights as long as it's individual rights of people they don't care about right and but when you get down to it it's a clear under ... I'm not understanding of how the country was form so\nWe have said that that's a huge issue for many conservatives because they do understand the constitution and they understand everything that we've just talked about right now and that has energized them to go out and vote switched beyond just because\nThe Democrats were against a nominee that Trump picked because Kavanaugh went way beyond Trump that's why you had the conservatives who are never Trump ... ... ... most of them [laughter] not all most of them uh uh come aboard of that time and that's why we've seen I I Believe more United\nA Republican or Republican Party so you can look at that you can look at some of that may be driven by the fact that look we're concerned about the house because the whole Russia investigation goes away if we lose the house and uh also when it comes to judges the fact that if they win the Senate\nOr ... and Trump has another chance to get another judge in maybe in the next couple of years and that would be unprecedented because conservatives understand that if you can have a construction is cord and you can have\nOf not only a five to four but six to three ... that that can move the country in the right direction for the next generation and that is extremely important the other thing is and this is new and it's the caravan\nSure and it's it's interesting too is that if you you mentioned it earlier but it bears repeating here they even if the care of and\nThey likely won't reach the border before an election day two weeks from today that the news cycle is what's keeping that story there and and we've talked often about how the news cycle you know changes so not drastically but so often\nUm and they because the protests by the left is one thing even even during the Kavanaugh a confirmation process itself what was the first protest\nAll those documents remember we need to be able to agree we need time to view the that was their first protest was that it became about Dr for but we said\nA member we need to be able to agree we need time where I view that that was their first protest was that it became about Dr for\nBut we said after he's confirmed whatever happens in you know we didn't make it a a production but if he's confirmed on a Saturday through the vote this was before the confirmation vote then on Monday and they'll move on to something else as they did\nBecause it it but there is there's a the pumping there's a new protest and new hot button a almost daily but certainly a couple of new ones every week so we got two weeks left so you've got the care of and that's that right now is new but that goes back\n... if you did I get this adds onto a consistent issue that's been around for a long time but the Republicans thanks to this current president when he was campaigning for president\nOh and if you think about it you know everybody talking about the conspiracy theory and who's paying for it and who's not paying for\nIt is working for the white it as a motivator for people on the right to get out and protect because if he needs money for the wall he needs to house the president if he's going to get money for the wall he's going to need the house ...\nAnd and so to me this has been a huge motivating factor and\nUh I saw the other day that after uh the the illegal immigrant caravan the wishes to get into the United states from Honduras that they walked about nine hours my whole at that and and blisters and they were going to rest while well at this pace they won't get to the United states for a month\nRight so ah you know if that was the pace that they are are are going that has to you know who was supporting them you've got you know a right wing website stating far right wing website stating that it's you know ... groups of Wall Street journal\nStayed in you know but basically they are not sure they talk about the leftist politician in Honduras that organized system started it and then they were surprised how quickly\nOr the number of people got aboard they talk about the people without frontiers\nThe U.S Mexico a group that isn't got involved in it who directly is giving the money nobody is really sure here at this\nParticular moment yeah a lot of these groups are have funding in the past\nFrom folks on the left including cirrhosis but whether they have directly given the money or not who knows right but the fact is if they are right now it's working against them will have some audio coming up here just a little bit actually from the view right right which was a really good from a from Meghan McCain talking about it all coming up plus your calls and comments eight six six Ninety read I\nRead on the radio with a record ...
