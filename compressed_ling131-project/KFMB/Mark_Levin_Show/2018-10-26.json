scientists the Republican running for governor of Florida on\nThis program I've been a fan of his since the day was elected I Walk to work in the house of representatives he saw that he has enormous integrity he's a he's an Iraq vet to very smart guy graduated from Harvard and he's so smart and um\nAnd he's taken the lead on so many issues that are important to this country run to scientists how are you my friend\nI'm doing great mark how're you doing\nI'm doing fine you know I watch this debate last night was your opponent Gillum and I got to say this\nBefore we get into substance he is a very nasty guy I mean the he he turns to you and he must have called you a liar twenty times uh he uh he just said some incredibly snarky things I thought to myself\nThis guy's cocky he thinks that he has it in the bag and I suspect he does not mean and what did you make of the debate\n... work I think I think that whole performance was really beneficial for me I mean you know when you're running for governor mark obviously you know voters are going to look to see you know do they agree to it or not and so I'm somebody who's running on keeping Florida low tax said he wants to massive pack\n\n... he's running saying that\nWe should abolish ice and so there are different obviously Cheech policy differences but in the governor's race of instead of like a senator a house race\nIt's more than just about your position has about leadership and who could actually do the job and I think his antics\nJust showed that he's not somebody that would be a good governor even apart from his radical left wing ideology so I think his whole performance back fire\nI think a lot of people that Dan looked at me uh and they obviously now get a sense of my biography my service of the country um and I just think that they were the easy decision that I'm just a better leader than go on\nOne of the things that's very very troubling to me knowing you know for several years\nYou lead the fight in the house of representatives to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital\nWhen nobody thought it would go anywhere you lead the fight in the house of representatives pressing for moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem you succeeded along with the president along with are are wonderful and bashed her Freeman and so forth\nAnd then for him and his party to suggest that you're supported by neo Nazis [laughter] when in fact you're the biggest voice for the state of Israel in the United States House of representatives my jaw hit the floor\nWhile I think it was so ridiculous that I think voters just just laughed about all I mean give me a break and this was from a guy who actually opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and he's been endorsed by\nThis radical left wing group dream defenders but he actually signed a pledge to the group\nSaying he would support this radical manifesto they had um and this group dream defenders one of their main ah things is boycotting Israel bbs\nThey say Israel a genocidal apartheid state so that the group he stands with he will not just of Elvis group 'cause that that is who he is\nAnd I'm actually just today there was a group of we're thirty eight sheriffs\nIn Florida right give them a letter asking him to get the ... dream defenders because uh the pledge that Gillum signed a said that police in prison have no place injustice they want to abolish\nAre basically traditional law enforced may get funded and then spend the money on welfare programs with very radical stuff it's dripping with hatred for men and women are in law enforcement and it's just totally unacceptable and go I'm he will not budge may\nBe restricted by God and and that's just unacceptable for us so yeah for him to say that I I think it was um I think we're the total ... voters are sicker people aren't aware or just lashing out like that folks and and I could get really backfired big car\n[laughter] you know ... when you sign a petition you know you're putting your signature to ensure there's no confusion\nAny signs of petition in favor of boycotting Israel he signs of petition in favor of moving police officers out of prison and more than that as you pointed out but I don't think the moderator quite comprehended what you were saying\nYou're talking about he says abolish ice and moving under the Justice Department I don't know how that changes anything moving ice from one a building to another building as somebody who served as chief of staff to the attorney general his problem is he rejects law enforcement and your point was this\nOne is a criminal alien served time in a state prison in Florida\nThe doors open and they are either turned over to the fetch who deport them or they come into your neighborhood and he supports that person going into your neighborhood and not\nDeported isn't that basically his position\nYeah I asked him on Sunday night's debate of CNN will you honor a dictator request they're called Decatur is when the federal government wants to take a criminal illegals coming out of prison will you want to detain requests from Donald Trump's ice agency he would not say he would do that and so if\nYou say oh I don't want criminals on the street without the moderates he pledged not to cooperate with by this idea that all he wants to do is move it under the Justice Department mark you know about him trying to backtrack off its position you know where he was running ads in the primary thing abolish I equate bay one open borders that is what the far left one\nAnd he was playing to the bay so the idea that all he wants to do with like administrative tweak or he's lying when he says that ah he wants to abolish the agency because he doesn't want immigration enforcement\n[noise] now when we come back after the bottom of the hour run to scientists by the way what is your website Ron\n...\nNow when we come back after the bottom of the hour round a scientist by the way what is your website Ron\nRon detain dot com\nOr we're going to put it up on my social sites ladies and gentlemen runs being big time outspent\nDisguise Soros behind him he's got Styron behind them all the left wing billionaires and left wing groups they're targeting Florida they know if they take Florida it's going to be very difficult to win the presidency and the future and they're getting behind a true Bernie Sanders George Soros people for the American way which is so he works\nFor radical when we come back I Want to ask Ron to censor certain FBI investigation that's been taking place in Tallahassee where this guy was mayor and Mr Guillen connection to it and there is a connection to it we'll be right back [noise]\nAnd\nI enjoy helping my listeners like Nathaniel whoever the IRS tens of thousands in back taxes he told the Irish they didn't have the money to pay but it didn't matter they put a lean on his home anyway it's an annual heard how much I respect optimal tax relief\nAnd there was a turning wrote a cease and desist letter to the station and then the letter the attorney said a public reports have said that Andrew is not the subject\nOf the investigation but as you know mark some of these ... words you can be a subject of an investigation you can also be a target of the investigation his own campaign attorney\nDid not put in that letter that Andrew is not a target he just said he ... not a subject so that to me is is a is an interesting er mission uh because the bottom line is\nWhy would they be investigating corruption in city hall if it had nothing to do with the mayor you wouldn't have had those FBI agents around him on these trips like they were on\n[noise] Enron designed to see immediately tried to racialized suspicion that the reason you were bringing it up and for that matter I guess a local media is bringing up is because of his race\nNow last time I checked it has nothing to do with somebody's race when there's an undercover agent giving somebody I'm a value to try and see if they'll take it any tuck it has nothing to do with race and I notice he tried to do this over and over and over again in this campaign let me ask you a question your running mate who is your running mate\nOh her name is Jeanette noon yeah she's a state representative from Miami\nShe's a Cuban American\nCuban American and and when we get elected she'll be the highest ranking female Hispanic I'm a history of Florida government\nMhm I noticed the media doesn't talk much about that of\nCourse not but I'll tell you with Andrew lashing out like this I mean when you start talking about corruption people understand about black or white it's about right versus wrong and if you're using this off as to whether you're a mess like dams or did\nThey mapped the problem it's interesting mark there wasn't just the the illegal stuff that he died when he was on the Tallahassee city commission or he did vote to raise property taxes on people but he also voted to increase his own retirement benefits\nBy tens of thousands of dollars basically doubling could pay and so he wanted a people Tallahassee to pay more and he wanted somebody has to go directly into his pocket so he's always been a self dealing politician or whether ... whether it's legal votes like that which are corrupt anyway or illegal activity like accepting\nThe Hamilton ticket and turning around and given these guys the deal they want it\nAny work for this group people for American way is that correct\nYeah and here's the thing about that that's a very ultra liberal groups so if you look at people for the American way filing may say they pay Andrew Gillum this is ... mayor a hundred and thirty thousand dollars a year to work forty hours a week\nWell the mayor of Tallahassee is a full time job so how how was he working forty hours a week\nFor people for the American way so one of two things are true either he is actually doing that in which case he then collecting the people have power happy which may explain why they had the highest number of murders and the history of the city last year and have one of the most ... are they have the highest crime rate in Florida or\nHe ain't working forty hours a week and that's all just a fraud and he's basically accepting money without performing services so what are the other uh is problematic no matter which way you\nKnow I'm a little confused when I met the nation is and the Floridians are too you can be mayor and have a side job with a group like people for the American way founded by Norman Lear at a Hollywood entered a hundred and forty thousand dollars on the side\nYeah and I think that would be the question is their people for the American way\nIn forty thousand dollars on the side\nWell yeah and I think that would be the questionnaire their\nPeople for the American way that that was in exchange for him working forty hours a week I think he probably wasn't doing forty hours a week I think they were just trying to funnel money to him but if he was working forty hours a week for them\nTo make the people tell me feel you know they have the guts out of control crime problem is raising the taxes he's doing all these gang\nAnd yet he's working for the left wing group so it's a problem either way but it's interesting even though the documents are out there um journalists do not pursue that at all I mean if I if I Walk on the wrong sided fight walk\nYou know they try to do a do different stories on me so it's definitely a double standard I mean it's an obvious question that would really it should be investigated by the press\nI Want to hear to other things before you go and then is health care and taxes [noise]\nHe uh has talked about Medicare for all this is the big left wing push Medicare for all and it's been pointed out Medicare for all means everyone on Medicare loses Medicare\nEveryone on a on a ploy your private employer health care plan loses their private employer health care plan every union member who's union is negotiated a healthcare plan they will lose their health care plan\nEverybody will lose the health care that they have now\nWith some theories some obstruction some concoction or create or Washington DC will have the science fisted system whether you like it or not whatever you have today disappears so what does this response to this pet he would eliminate all existing health care plans for everybody that's on them including Medicare\nOne little correction market or eliminate I think that for about three hundred million people the two things that Bernie has built keeps or the VA in the Indian Health\nService so now I get ... games that are that Elizabeth Warren has a one one thousand percent her health care if they do there but bottom\nLine is right so here's the response is when I called them out on this was basically to act like\nHe didn't know what I was talking about he was running commercials saying single payer Medicare for all two months ago but he realizes that topic and Florida because we have senior citizens who have their arrangement they've been paying into Medicare the Medicare Advantage program\nWe have obviously millions of people who earn their health benefits through their employer um through their employment\nAnd he wouldn't take all of that a way you have no choice you get dumped just as you said dumped on a single payer which we know will cause a tax increase it it will bankrupt out\nIt'll hemorrhage money and so they'll have to ration and so yeah you may have the right to have all this great stuff but you're not going to find a doctor that's going to be able to perform that there'll be waiting lines and we know the drill and all that so that is not popular once people know what\nIt is and so basically he just tried to run away from it as much as he can um even though in the primary you were saying that the way that you're when we're in Florida so we're going to keep reminding voters\nTalk about let me talk about let's in taxes now I mean one one of the reasons a lot of people come to Florida from these blue states as you don't have an income tax\nAnd that's also one of the reasons you have such a dynamic economy such a diverse economy in Florida and I have a home in Florida so I've seen I've seen the difference between the no tax income tax state and I have a home and I my primary residence in Virginia and an income tax thing\nI cannot believe with all the proposals he's making it says I've never supported a state income tax\nThat's what these guys do I saw it in Connecticut years ago and so forth so I'm not an favorite and then they push and push the spending in the debt and then either they push for an income tax or some court orders and income taxes supports an income tax and in ...\nSo there was a study done a nonpartisan study that analyzes all his spending proposals and the conclusion of the study was here in order to make it work he would either need to do one or two things have a state wide sales tax\nOf thirty eight percent or impose a state income tax which could reach as high as thirty five percent so those are the only two realistic routes or he would be able to pay for because you know he wants to pay for single payer health care he wants to pay for free college he wants to do all this other stuff\nAnd that's what it would cause so you go down that road a Florida is done economically I mean it would totally critical our economy and critical our state and we obviously can't let that happen um at all\n[noise] Fifteen dollar minimum wage Seattle tried it it's been a complete failure\nAll the cities at trying or what they wind up doing is the the the people who are earning minimum wage or low wages they're the ones who were punished\nBecause what happens is people get fired small restaurants can't afford it even chains can't afford it and so the price of food goes up less people go into these outlets and go into these places\nAnd people lose jobs they lose camps I mean this doesn't help people actually mandating a Fifteen dollar minimum wage when it has this consequences it\nSo mark I started off blue collar kid I had to work forty hours a week before I got to college I worked all these jobs for six bucks an hour through college I wouldn't have been able to get through without that and it Gillum his policies were in place\nI Would not have made Fifteen an hour I Would have made zero the if I Would not have had the opportunity for any of those jobs and so what he will do is he will put hundreds of thousands of people out of work\nHe will cause businesses to shut down businesses to leave the state um but here's the thing markets Seattle thing you mentioned a lot of the people who who who kept their job they did get a pay increase the Fifteen they still ended up with less take home pay because their hours got reduced by the ... so\nIt's really been counterproductive and all the evidence points that way but yet he's ... says he doesn't care and this is what he's running on\nParticularly a harmful to young people are trying to get their first job particularly harmful in minority communities people trying to get their first job\nSame with his open borders policies particularly harms another skilled or low skilled the

numbers\nAnd figured out that a significant portion half of almost half of the increase of the GDP since April of last year\nOr the acceleration of you know it going from roughly two point two percent\nAnnual growth for the last few years under Obama\nTo from the middle of last year or two right now a two point nine percent half\nAlmost half of that growth just under half ... uh is because of government increased government spending defense spending federal spending increased state and local spending you and I talked about the flaws of the GDP\n... you know and it's the only thing that you can go by so you go buy it and not that there wasn't government spending before but they looked at the acceleration of the increase in spending\nAll over the last year and said that is cause for half of it\nAnd the reason that it's important is you know we look at you know everything in an economy and what might affect it we look at the good portions that we've seen mhm we've also looked at the things that can hurt the economy the the terrorists the increase because of that the increase in cost of\nOf timber and steel and materials\nOr the you know the housing up or slow down so over the the the last a month\nA government at times believes that they can and people believe the government can help the economy and at the same time manipulated into success by picking winners and losers and they can't look\nNot that there's anything wrong with increasing defense than adults do you know I'm there um but what we want to do is set that aside and look at where the growth is and isn't in the private sector\nBecause the the the what creates well what really moves the economy is the new goods and services that are produced by the private sector ... and the GDP lot of times takes in government spending and the transfer of money as actual economic growth and it is not right\nAt eight six six Ninety ... if you want to join us for the bona show for cobra electronics here's your

now that's up ten degrees from yesterday and Saturday even better eighty one in Dallas Chicago\nThat's actually quite victim status so they can help straighten us all out and where you\nFit [laughter] well you know my hair Eric you were talking about what's at the tweet was a Donald Trump junior to\nPut it out earlier yeah Donald Trump junior making some a very good points on social media uh yesterday Thursday and and I think on Wednesday as well\nSaying well where was the call for civility when someone sent fake rice into his residence and and it was you know that got ultimately close to to his wife it was intended for him Donald Trump junior and the same thing happened to his brother he was asking uh I forget who was he was asking\nUh in in that tweet or he was responding to somebody else's tweet um but that's that's the whole thing is that there was no call for civility when that happened I mean you see a number of things have happened or that\nAnd with any president or presidential family but especially this one you've had how much you know that has happened had been sad\nUm and we have to point out\nBecause Gary laid it out a and thank you my\nFor the call a this was several months ago but you're talking about when you call someone\nHitler what the threat is\nThen we were talking about civility then that was the setting yes and the media was you know talking about well civility and civility we'll wait a minute when you compare to someone to a arguably one of the worst\nMass murderers\nHistory pure evil ears\nSomeone to a arguably one of the worst mass murderers and history pure evil\nYou're saying the threat to someone is that guy is capable this person is just like Adolf Hitler and his capable of doing the same heinous thing\nAnd when you do that that becomes a threat\nThat that you're saying that this person in this case the president is the same kind of threat that Hitler was and that's the ultimate\nThreats\nSo the call for civility and the media pretending like this is all on the president you got to give me a break rhetoric is one thing comparing him to a mass murderer that one of the most evil people to ever exist on earth\nThat's very different\n[noise] uh not only hit third but when they combine Hitler with fascist and the authoritarian mindset yeah Donald Trump which has to be a dictator as we said nothing to indicate set in anything that he has done in any of his executive orders anything that he has fought from the court's everything\nHas in in my opinion well let me All right let me say that Ninety nine point nine percent of what he has has of what he was promoted maybe somebody can find one percent and make an argument that that will be willing to listen to so I don't want to say one hundred percent ... so Ninety nine point nine percent of what Donald Trump is best promoted\nOr his rhetoric may offend you mhm uh his provocative nature may or a offend you but what does he actually does\nDoes he deserve is it fair\nTo relate him to one of the worst mass murderers genocidal mass murderers in the history of the world right is that even close to any type of accurate portrayal no it's just pure demonization and inflammatory rhetoric and what is it designed to do\nIt is designed to create range in the people that will believe you fear and right it is not an attempt to have a discussion on the policies of the president\nWell let's look at this and\nIs that too much government intervention no it's Hitler it's the same as the guy who are committed a genocide of six million human beings in concentration camps\nThat what Donald Trump is he's a fascist let's throw most selenium there to well what you know while rabbits and let's combine\nHitler was Mussolini and let's combine the worst\nBrutal evil people that have ever existed and say\nThat as Donald Trump well of course that's just the most bizarre and inflammatory things that you could possibly say\nAnd the other point that we made over the last couple of days is after\nThe Steve Scully shooting a going after the the I Can't think of his name right now but the man who was a\nA you know a supporter of of a Bernie Sanders who attempted to assassinate members of Congress if it wasn't for the Capitol police you probably would have quite a few dead Republican Congress people right now ...\nAh they came to the defense and we're we're able to stop that that situation Steve ... represented ...\nSeriously injured did that change the rhetorical nature the inflammatory rhetorical nature of Democrats at all or have they add it up\nTo the point of as we saw with Kavanaugh auditor insanity over the last couple of months\nThat reality is it's not going to stop live we live in a nation of free speech and people are are going to go to the limit of their of of of free speech and they're going to go to the ... that's just what happens\nIn our society we may not like it people may view it as an civil but it's the reality\nOf where we live and what is the thing that will temper that but we'll temper that is if they continue to lose elections Americans must reject must reject that and it gets to the it gets to that point and so\nYou know we we have talked about you know also the morality the media and and this is that we think extremely important when you look at Donald Trump being accused of treason mhm the Russian collusion almost two years of it\nNever ending pounding by the media and they sit there you know when Sarah Sanders defense and said look it's it's been ... the the law is against is president coming from the media had been never ending right\nThe source stories that have been inaccurate that you hide behind your sources say well this is what our sources told us well if you if it's not true and you can't prove it's true you don't always believe\nYour sources well it you know you have or the remember the indictments that came down with Papadopoulos and Manafort and the president tweeted a that day you know\nNo collusion\nAnd then the New York times article that said he was tweeting that as they were proving collusion something to that\nEffect nope nope no and that's false\nThat that is a blatant lie or complete incompetence either you don't belong at any you don't belong on Twitter if you're if you're putting that kind of if you're a reporter putting that kind of BS\nOut much less a major newspaper because there was no proof non still none\nTo this day nothing and you have what a false narrative that has gone on\nAnd still goes on and no one knows what more has in front of them know that may change\nBut what hasn't changed I'll tell you right now is the false narrative well\nThink about this it was just a couple of months ago in front of the White House remember they were there for days because of Russian collusion right and trees precedent now we have the midterms it's not even a topic of discussion right it's like okay we can't go anywhere with this lie that we have perpetuated for the last\nTwo years so let's move on to something something else and then they they attempt to walk away as if oh no we bear no responsibility for the instability that happens today or the heightened inflammatory rhetoric that exist today were completely innocent were just reporting\nOn we're just we really don't think it's a bunch of crap right the only thing we're doing is telling you that uh she got\nThere illegally he came to power illegally and with the help of another major nation that has the uh that that\nIllegally and with the help of another major nation\nThat is the uh that that in terms of new is the only match really for the United states on the planet in terms of a threat\nAnd ah he is he works for the Russians he's friendly with the Russians he's a fascist and he's capable of killing as Hitler\nWas remember it was just a couple of months ago we had followed the survey for the last ... over a year and that showed that the majority of Democrats still believe that the Russians hacked into the election machines and twenty sixteen\nYeah and we have a um an election coming up and what eleven days yeah and ah and where are they screaming about that it's gone

saw this with Kavanaugh\n... don't only claims stability if it is politically expedient for them Michael Moore just makes our point\nWell you know what you what you see here is the positioning by the

I'm Gary McNamara eight six six Ninety or read I welcome and a good\nMorning I you know I Wonder whether the whole ... thing is going to move into the background and we were you and I talked about this when it first you know most about a week ago it was first started that\nA woman came back from vacation and we saw the you know we saw social media\nAnd lot of Republicans were saying well this they're doing this in order to affect election day and you and I came in and said wait a minute when you see how far away they are and how far they can walk in one day I'm not going to get here to weigh after election day so really this is going to hurt them this is not going to\nHelp the the Democrats\nAre and I saw the story that the president you know plans on sending you know eight hundred troops down to the border\nWasn't as big of a stories I thought it would be and I wonder that over the past week at the media has looked at this and said this isn't going to benefit us\nLet's bring it up after the midterms fry we believe this is actually helping Trump right and so since this isn't really going to say this is only going to hurt us before the midterm uh sort of bury the story a little bit or not give it the emphasis that we were giving it before [noise]\nYeah I mean it's it ... it is the the um the the the political tool at the moment\nRight so if there is a greater political tool than you kind of jumped to that and we'll see where the story goes with the you know suspicious devices or whatever we're calling them now I'm over I suspect that if if they know\nWhere these things are being mailed from there it will only be a matter of time if if if not hours\nBefore they find out or at least know with a person might be\nUm ... and and even apprehend them someone had said on Thursday morning was watching some of the coverage and a one law enforcement I'm a expert not not an unofficial or investigator in the case but\nAn expert commenting said it's quite possible we could see somebody arrested or apprehended\nAs early as today and that that's just just based on how quickly it works and how much physical evidence there is in this case\nYou get that and and we find out what the motivation is I guess of the person possibly I'm assuming that they are taken alive\nAnd it becomes again I'm that\nChanges this narrative and and do you go back up your the media or you're a an operative on the left\nYou go back to the caravan um the care of and seeing it kinda paused because of so many I guess I'm concerns along the way now you had um you know the the department of homeland security saying look you know people will be apprehended that's going to be the case\nIt's one of the reasons that they're losing but you and I said this\nMany times only need is true mhm and when you look at the things that we believe they work mhm that's why we promote them that's why we do the kind of show that we do we spend a lot of time talking about this yesterday that's why we break down everything that's why we get down\nTo the issues that had and we get pushback from people on the right when we do that by the way mhm there are some not all but there are some of the right\nThey want to believe the rhetoric they want to believe the height\nYou know you and I and and that's why we you talked about dictator remember when uh we'd we'd sit here Obama's Muslim we said where's the evidence right well his father now where's the evidence that that's what he believes if you look at what he believes what does he believe he believes more in the church of Jeremiah Wright mhm\nWhich wasn't preaching you know Islam but was preaching hey [laughter] and not Christianity but was preaching a radical hate him or hate America or a\nMessage message and thank you very much ... [laughter] to friday or hate America message ... as he said come on\nIf you look at Obama certainly not religious what you think\nThat if somebody like Obama worships anybody else out there or do you really really think that you really think he's devoting that there is I got up there that tells him what to do and please and so we had some fun with it but we said no the evidence doesn't show that at all evidence batters across the board and we've pushed back because we've done that\nOr one of the biggest push facts we had was when we made fun of jade helm Fifteen remembering twenty Fifteen ... remember the number of people that called us more furious at us because we were a mock and it was ridiculous\nOh the government's secret they're going to be in Texas and it sees a secret raids that are going on and and remember the tunnels and Walmart and everything else and people are jumping aboard\nThis crap mhm but it's pure crap and you buy into it\nSeparate yourself from those idiots over their\nDeal with the truth that's all you need to do is deal with the truth not being fantasy bizarro conspiracy theory world because everyone knows the tunnels were under target exactly [laughter] well I mean we're we're just going to start off that thing that I've never forget the I'll never forget that moment in a jade helm ... Fifteen\nWhen you know it was the night we were getting barrage with\nPhone calls you guys just don't understand you don't understand what we know we know we know and that's always the argument from the conspiracy theorists oh we know something that you don't know there are more I feel special because somebody else has told me in and and I know and this is when they were talking about how top secret was and we had to bring out\nOf the uh a press release that was done\nFrom the local chamber of commerce at one of the counties that you know you were going to have the special forces in that had already figured out the economic benefit to their county right by\nMe down somebody that was going to be spent on those days was going to be may be spent that's how sink rented was right that the chamber of commerce had done it I mean they spent over two million on the tunnels under Walmart alone [laughter] you know we we've dealt with it we we've dealt with it after the nine eleven conspiracy bribery remember we had to go to\nWe actually had to go on the show to Popular Mechanics and these are people that listen to our show yes so it's for us it's a constant fight and you know with the nine eleven conspiracy theories that people were buying into I remember we had to\nRe portions of Popular Mechanics number Popular Mechanics said look\nI'm we do mechanics and so we weren't getting get involved in this and we realized wait a minute that's what we're here for\nThese things these theories about mechanics in physics are being put out there that's what we do let's see whether they're actually possible or not uh what was the other way we uh we dealt with it um\nWe dealt with it the night of the ... brothers oh man\nSo we go on it we had been getting a information coming in\nAbout what was going on ... in Watertown uh uh about\nThirty minutes before we went on about eleven thirty central that night and we started coverage route twelve thirty when we started getting confirmation of the of those reports because there there was breaking news and we we continue that coverage or through the end of the show\nSomewhere in the middle of the show we started getting emails is the Boston bombing the other by bombing suspects\nAnd when they essentially went through Watertown and and uh that night that uh you know one of them died and the other one uh eventually was captured the later but when you look at the the the ... about I don't know half way through the show when we looked at our email it was coming in and it was about\nWell it's it then they gave us Pacific name these are the people that they're chasing these are the people that there why are you saying this\nAsking us and they were and by the way they were to Middle Eastern names right\nAnd look we're not going to be\nI don't have any a desire to go out and be first I only have a desire and I believe responsibility to be accurate if we're because we often report on breaking news\nWe don't I Do I Do not want to be I don't want to put something out there I don't want to be a Brian Ross that ABC\nI don't\nBecause here's what's different about specific names if we if the details do change on on breaking news stories we know that better than most people because we recovered we've covered some big stories over the years\nThe details do change but we're talking about like numbers or maybe okay it was over on this block or it was in this town not this town where that is a specific name\nIf those names belong to people who are innocent Brian Ross\nOr anyone else that might be reporting something\nThen you start saying that because the bran wrong so they'd be see after the Aurora shooting well right there's information that there's a man with that name that belongs to the Tea Party well how do you know it's the same one you just put that on ABC TV and he got burned and and he got burned big time\nI Believe the goal and it is our goal to be accurate but the thing is is that there were people just they just kept pounding as for the last half of our show because we weren't putting the name out in fact you and I it wasn't until about thirty minutes after the show was done when authorities announced who they were chased phone\nAnd that was the ... and we set it on the air we set it on the air that look there's a couple of names out there we just can't verify for many\nSo now ... who they were chased from and that was the ... and we set it on the air we set it on the air that look there's a couple of names out there we just can't verify many legit source that we believe that we have confidence in that it is that that is true and as you mentioned thirty minutes after our show\nIt wasn't the people right and so again we were called every name in the book we're you know you name it we were called it for hiding the truth from the people\nSee that's the implication you're hiding something from the people were not looking to hide anything we're just looking to be accurate\nAnd so when I look at this week that's what we've been focusing on is for\nThe Republicans and the conservatives just focus on the truth but so you can you can passionately attack the other side\nBut don't play their game I've set up before they need to do it they don't have the substance of the issues they can't back up their points of view they need it they thought of desperation that they do it\nI don't feel desperate and whether whether whether the side that I favor more wins an election or loses an election right I have never felt the need to use inflammatory rhetoric\nBecause I feel I have lost the substance of my argument\nTwo thousand two thousand eight denied of election night uh you know are they all the power goes to the Democrats and we got calls why aren't you guys angry ... look it didn't go my way I'm disappointed\nBut I had my thing and it well we have been blunt uh I've\nA friend of mine yesterday posted well you know the whole country's going much more conservative right now and I said look on social issues they aren't fiscal issues or not and explain it to him to death mhm the country's not only the way that I Want when it comes to that Republicans don't care about the debt that we're putting on future generations right they've completely\nJust said let's not even pay attention to it right that doesn't matter\nAnymore what we put on future generations doesn't matter anymore we don't care we think that's wrong for the Republican Party right we think that's immoral or the Republican Party to not be wearing that as a badge of honor every single day\nWe understand that because they are following what the people are doing that yeah the rank and file of there and that's why we brought up that remember that the swamp\nJust three years ago the swamp was about Republicans who wouldn't be fiscally responsible mhm that's gone yeah I find that that swamp doesn't even exist anymore of fiscal responsibility in the Republican Party that what
