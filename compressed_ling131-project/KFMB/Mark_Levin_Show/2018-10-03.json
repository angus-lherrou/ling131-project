an all time high unemployment is a fifty year low taxes for families and businesses have been cut wages are up\nAnd so forth and so on perhaps another apology from the New York times like the one they had to issue after they got the twenty sixteen election some virus only wrong is in order [noise]\nTwenty years ago [noise] we don't know why the Irish didn't look at it they gave it a pass says the New York times isn't this fascinating and who's going to do is an anal exam additional burger families officials burgers or the New York times I'm just curious\nAll the me I can tell you that way\nI Can't stress enough that you must protect yourself from thugs who steal personal information email address or Social Security numbers medical card passwords and retailers are being compromised every

are really funny and uh we put it together came out today it's doing great\nA happy cookbook let me ask you the ... to make America smart\nIt's a great the happy cookbook and we have it up on march ... show face but mark ... show Twitter and get it on Amazon any major bookstore but it is it's a nice you know diversion from all the stuff that's going up but I didn't know you know Greg Norman\nGreg Norman a actually just between you and me\nYes ah my wife and I spend a lot of time down or in the Jupiter, Florida\nArea they don't give away your address for God's sakes no no Jupiter, Florida is large yes I'm\n... and so I we have met a Greg Norman through Fox and friends and uh you know we'll go down there every once in a while and he's got a little golf course that will play out\nAnd have a very nice guy and one of his recipes isn't the cookbook and he loves this thing called crispy crackling pork loin which is you take a pork loin and you've got to get a special caught because uh\nMost pork loin stone have skin on it but you need the skin because you're put in the five hundred degree of it and you just absolutely knew for thing you cook it for three hours\nAnd the skin becomes so correctly it it's a delicacy and I was talking to various it's Stuart what's yours and I was expecting something completely\nDifferent fish and chips I Would think a very recently\nI was expecting something British uh but he said exactly the same thing and apparently it's a it's a an English thing it's popular in Australia and so uh that's one of the recipes in the in the cookbook if in fact it's on the back cover the darn thing\nBeautiful and you've got a lot of very cool recipes in here have by you and your wife too which is a which is really something worth a look you know let me ask you a question here is\nYour ... times comes up with this long article and I now read most of it\nReally trashing the president trashing his father traction making these these these broad statements about how they're essentially tax cheats going back twenty more than Twenty years and um\nAnd they and they basically lost the IRS and they said well the Internal Revenue service basically you know look the other way and so for\nNow the Internal Revenue service doesn't look the other way right and this is a huge uh you know family business it's a privately held business I don't know how they got access to all this stuff so I don't know if it was in the er\nAnd the filings with the state or or whatever it was but they are trashing Trump is he's not a self made man and look at all the money he got when he was a kid and and on and on and on this is really a set up isn't it for the Democrats or keep saying we want Trump's taxes and they're kind of handing love working with each other here in the political way\nBut that's their playbook that only God I mean they're still litigating the twenty sixteen election they cannot believe they lost to this guy\nAnd why did they lose because he cheated and he didn't just cheat at you know colluding with the Russians he\nCheated his entire business career and his family cheated his dad cheated they screwed people in the welfare system so that they would get rich and you know the allegation is you know he had said that he started Donald Trump did with just a million of his father's dollars but you know this story\nYou know the allegation is you know he had said that he started Donald Trump did with just a million of his father's dollars but you know this story says oh what are they talking about I think I think I read\nFour hundred and Fifteen million dollars is what his dad gave him so he wasn't a self made guy he was a bold into his father who was a cheater as well\nCrazy but you know let's let's see what the facts are right now it's just one of these allegations that it's been linked to a major\nBudget but isn't this problem it isn't this the problem is a huge article yes\nOne allegation after another and what are we going to spend the next six weeks on this right through the mid term elections it's all time though I don't ever remember anything like this when the Kennedy family LBJ became a multi millionaire just a poor man that that got elected to the Senate he dies a multi multi millionaire I mean\nSo much and and Trump makes all this money before even enters the presidency and they just can't wait to get their hands around his neck\nHow many times mark have we seen in the last year because it's been very effective that are members of the left and the Democrats in particular have or\nHave worked with politicians you what you want to talk about a collusion look at the link between the press and some a\nLiberal Democrats for instance uh I was watching the special report program on Fox News and in a a young correspondent who used to live at my house of Peter do see that who you're talking about a minute ago he's out in Montana and he was covering the story about uh the reelection campaign of John tester\nAnd Jon Tester's got a problem right now because a lot of Montanans are veterans and they don't like what he did to Dr Ronny Jackson who is the president's picked to run the VA\nBecause if you remember Jon Tester leaked these are allegations unfounded allegations are I think he first started out on the floor of the Senate or it was in a committee hearing he had these pages this stuff about\nHow Ronny Jackson was a drunk and he crashed the car someplace and they did these inappropriate things and he was given people bills and all that stuff\nAnd you know what then it got into the bloodstream at the media and everybody was talking about the White House came out like within a day and said look we've done it a ... an investigation we can't find anywhere that he crashed the car or these other allegations but the damage was done and he was dead it was a kill shots and it all started with\nUnfounded allegations and that brings us right to where we are today how many times have we seen\nThese things and it's just that they keep doing it because it's work ...\nWhile I Want to recommend that people have a little diversion here this is a really wonderful a cookbook and uh it's a

the NATO was funny listening to the audio as it was when I first read it yeah yeah ...\nMaybe even reading it had a bigger impact to me because you are here and we're doing our pre show me not read it I just burst out laughing and it was just like you gotta be kidding me there but it but it makes a great point that's you know that that's where we are or that's where we\nWork I don't know where we will be ... ah tomorrow or even later on\nToday by the way the FBI aground a background check could be completed today\nYou know what's interesting here is I was reading the ah from the hill\nThe headline caught my eye and and and I thought what Senate GOP coy\nOn when final vote on Kavanaugh will happen is that what what what do you mean coy well Here's Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell being coy according to the people with the hill quote\nI'm not going to answer all these hypothetical you all know how it works after you filed cloture you have a two day wait so it's not like filing cloture produces an immediate vote\nWhat I can tell you what certainty is will have an FBI report this week and we'll have a vote this week\nDoes that sound like being [laughter]\n\nYou people need to seriously calm down in the\nMedia I mean just take a breath being coy I\nThink he gave you the best answer he can give you it's not like the votes going to happen because you're not going to know right I mean that's basically what he's saying you find a culture and there there's a two day waiting period so\nIt's not like if they go and filed culture and then all of a sudden run behind closed doors and then can you imagine putting chains on the doors and the fake a spray painting the C SPAN cameras you know and then have you know to make sure nobody could see it\nI'd be talking about all the positives\nAnd that I'd be talking about also what your political enemy spouses and you would reflect on what\nTalking about all the positives and that I'd be talking about also what your political enemy spouses and you would reflect on what has happened you know in the campaign and I think that's what they would focus on at that point\nUh I just don't think that they would look backwards who knows I mean whether they could have a a a separate committee of you know continuing investigation as to whether she did commit perjury and ... and and not make it high profile because there would be no hearings it would just be an investigation and down the road\nA as a warning shot to anybody who might do it to a a you know a future\nNominee with you know try to come in and and commit perjury if they could prove it probably was perjury right you know they might they might do that as long as it was low key yeah Adam you're not going to hearings on that or a big to do on that because once they come from him\nThe battle is over we callers to well they shouldn't go after every Democrat no the winner is you can you get him\nA on the Supreme Court yep after that that the victory that's the super bowl\nYeah that's it uh and and I think Republicans to a ... you also campaigned on look\nAh this this this kind of battle may not be behind us necessarily while it is specifically with cabin on there's a real possibility that this president whether in this term or maybe in his second term would not would have the opportunity to see another justice\nAnd that's a big

art yeah where did he actually break the law Fred Trump not downright strike fried or because you know Donald Trump or this this was not about his personal taxes it was about his father's as you mentioned and his father's been dead since Nineteen Ninety nine Fred Trump passed in Nineteen Ninety nine\nBut that's OK fair game go after a dead guy on how you set up these so called shell corporations was it a legal corporation or not\nWas what she did legal or not are you going to do the same with Warren Buffett by the way or any of the billionaires that do the same thing set up tax

travel to the middle\nPart [laughter]\nThey return their their work boots and their coveralls to Amazon or after thinking about it for a minute after the election uh watched a\nAnd twenty sixteen but the the entire ah the entire story shows where the law was broken\nSoldiers of that coming up here and just a little bit students demand a professor be fired at re promotes due process under the law or best headline of the day I Love this one ... floods wildfires\nYou candidates are running on climate change all of that one on Amazon to pay Fifteen bucks an hour that seem to be a big story yesterday will have to have that what happened to the size of documents story and their Russian collusion\nBecause that story just has been buried since I don't remember that one what was that well well it it must have nobody has has covered it in and we did all I think about a week ago we we brought it up we said oh so Trump decided not to release it but\nHe didn't go to the he didn't go to his a director of intelligence\nAbout the uh the information whether she'll be declassified he went to the inspector general we don't go to the inspector general pretty quiet just classify something you go to the inspector general give something because you perceived there might be corruption and what you have ... for governor electronics user forecast\nIt may not sound like much that an area could get six inches of rainfall and be under flash flood watches and warnings what\nThat's what we have over the next couple of days in effect for multiple states including California Arizona Nevada Utah Colorado and Idaho where even six to ten inches of rain is enough to dislodge Sandy soil Roxanne tree limbs and flood dry creek pets\nSo that's where the Christopher Steele you know whole thing comes comes in a ... to this ah\nAnd ... and one of the key players they're fusion GPS a was married to still is married but at the time her husband was a high ranking a department of justice of racial Bruce Bruce or and then\nWe know what they used you know the the ... and ... and all that ... well so we wanted well wait a minute just doesn't make sense you you don't give it to the inspector general the inspector general only looks at corruption and\nA\nAnd by the way that's almost a replay of what happened I think maybe it was a ... a week ago Monday or writers down we brought it up yeah because there were just other things and we just started going over we what we don't understand why would you give it to the inspector general inspector general\n... you know you get this information at some redacted you're looking at it and and and\nUh all of a sudden oh the light bulb goes off it would be an internal matter which would be in a scenario like this if it is a fact that people\nAt the Justice Department are under in the Obama administration\nOr more working to get information and use that false information that ...\nUh to get a warrant knowingly using it to get a Pfizer warrant then that would be corruption that would be abuse of power that would be a massive\nIt it leads to the the the claim a from Rudy Giuliani mhm that uh the he believes\nAnd it leads to the the the claim a from Rudy Giuliani mhm\nThat ah the he believes they committed perjury right yes that they that they they they signed documents stating that this information is intelligence ... when in reality it was simply you know a opposition research and I was and they knew that it was an intelligence and they\nVouch for its authenticity ... often to study our credibility ... and and you know again that's what Giuliani said we don't know but\nIt only goes to the inspector general\nIf they believe people there because I where would you get that if that was what happened right these than it would start inside the Justice Department with American people reaching out to in this case you know Christopher Steele or an impossible you know we don't know if there was anybody else involved we do know when he was involved but\nBut if if you if you do the unwritten action and and they're saying well it's too sensitive well that would be again\nThe director of national intelligence your ah your attorney general in the head of the FBI a foreign powers and so you would be going in that particular direction and probably\nYou will be discussing it especially with my palm pale secretary of state former CIA director and say okay you need to talk to the British are because we need to get this a release you know what do they want to keep quiet and not that that may not be that that could be being done right now we don't know or could have been done already\nBut to say I'm giving it to the inspector general to look at it look at why\nInspector general only looks at corruption right they look at corruption in the department he's\nLooking for corruption in the department of justice that's what his job is his job does not to declassify it's not just job is not to look at a a document say wow I don't think you should declassified and and that was the impression that you got when the story first came out\nIt's like well wait a minute he's inspector general undo that right\nOh mhm\nSo after they on rejected it apparently someone in the administration looked at it and said this is corruption give it to the inspector general\nBecause that's because that's what you would look at it the ... the inspector general's basically are there to investigate what happened in in the Justice Department I mean that's the whole purpose of that position to do that is a centrally that internal\nAh investigation have the the inspector general's office really as internal affairs or you know to a large degree so when\nAnd and when they saw that if I could see General Kelly\nLooking at the president and saying Mr President if you come out and point things out that's going to be purely political right\nSo it only has you know there's we we have to build a political will to go after people if the inspector general comes out with an official report\nThat's different not that the president and the end and uh the AG sessions couldn't\nGo after people for this it's that it would start in the political arena if you have this over\nTo the inspector general who was appointed by Obama this is the process by the way if if you look at a you know the things that Trump has done not talking about you know the things about uh\nThe licensing for the NFL or or or licensing for the media the FCC licenses for the media or any of that not not the words not what he said but what he has done\nHe's been very respectful of the process\nAnd this would be the process you would want to go through\nTo see the have the inspector general\nLook at it and say please take a look at this and and do your due diligence here\nTo see if this is exactly if if it's what we see\nAnd then you noticed the media you know you had some what websites covered I didn't even see Fox saying why the inspector general ... somebody may have done it I've not seen it and I haven't seen it on their website right but I haven't seen really\nAnything maybe ... or maybe a\nA you know National Review covered it the federalist I don't uh you know I Andrew McCarthy did I but I didn't see it right but it just the media when completely quiet on it but the other thing that I noticed was\nThat the new has like a couple of days after said I don't know why they didn't release it I don't know understand why it went to the inspector general and all of a sudden everything's gone quiet on that front to yeah everything that you haven't heard from Jim Jordan you haven't heard from uh Denver noon as a in over a week on it saying well look we need to get this stopped released why\nRight because if it goes to the inspector general they're looking at corruption\nAnd what what was the corruption be if it's about the Pfizer warrant and the text messages and everything in the upper management of the FBI and the department of justice there's only one thing that it could be because that's what they were ... acting and that would be corruption inside\nOf the department of justice and the FBI and maybe some of the intelligence agencies and and what they did but specifically for the inspector general it would be at the department of justice and the FBI corruption that's what he would be looking at this\nAnd so yeah one so we put two and two together a little over a week ago it was like oh and there's been nothing on this story none of the media the\nMedia is gone quiet on the ... higher Russian collusion narrative\nThink about it I mean I Know right now the focus is Kavanaugh but they're they're very capable of a walking and chewing gum at the same time when it comes up going out at a drop in New York Times brought up his family tax yes exactly why not collusion oh where's that story\nBut that's a great point you made is you know he's going through the process and ... if you look at it and they ... somebody said look if you were at least is then they're just gonna say you're cherry picking and you're interpreting them don't know what you're saying you're interpreting something here that really doesn't exist here you go to the inspector general\nNobody's going to debate the inspector general no not even not even the the the Democrats he was appointed by Obama right Michael Horowitz was ... so you go to him and he Ben and he does it which is the proper process to do with it yes that way you take the political aspect out of it right\nAnd especially right now if you look at\nOkay all the claims that well this would be a disruptive of the of the ... investigation\nAnd you know the president that actually you know acknowledge those claims but all of that is taken off the table when it's when horror which takes the investigation himself all of those claims go away\nBecause or which will you know even though you know the president won one of this done a\n... in an expedited manner or which will do his due diligence that's his job to go through this and determine if there was any corruption [noise] do you want to get in we do have a line open eight six six

just\nSeven sixty are demanding that twenty three separate individual interview as part of this and I think it's a good thing was that being said I'd like to go quickly because it's unfair to him at this\nRally will hear of the early days on cooperative allegations of misconduct after I Am seven sixty rather the fact that judge Kavanaugh Dallas tried fair and breaking this\n[noise]\n\nRadio he is currently and I'm Gary ... six six Ninety run I we go to Alan in Dallas texas Alan welcome you're on what I Radio Welcome to the show\nGuys love your show love talking to you I just wanted to give something about recollection of memory about five years go million about six guys would go down to the coast of Texas on a fishing trip [noise]\nTo police officers twenty seven year bedrooms thirty year veterans two guys that wasn't even part of the group\nHad joined the group one guy were out on the boat talk and he remembered twenty seven years ago he put two and two together that I put him in jail for carrying a non law a weapon he could remember that he decided he needed to leave the group and come back home\nDemand remembered that because that was a defining moment in his life and all I'm trying to say is this woman\nIf that had been such a defining moment in her life she she can remember that that was Kavanaugh one hundred percent on top of her she could not tell us how she got to the party how she got home\nAnd\nYou know if it was such a defining moment in her life how did you get home where was this house that would be things you would think a person would remember if it's such a defining moment\nAnd now all of a sudden it's just last move the goalpost maybe she did maybe she didn't but this man has been nothing but exempt or his whole lives and for the presumption of innocence to be just thrown out the window by the Democrats are just crazy to me\nYeah I mean that's part of the the weakness as we said nobody is just credible or non credible let's see you have to take it you know based on the evidence that exists and their testimony and when the ... or in whether the testimony that they give especially when it comes to these witnesses notice they were there ... and when those witnesses were actors are asked and say\nSorry we weren't there don't know about it at all and even one of her friends at that point your credibility starts falling apart and we don't know the where the win or by how\nOf everything surrounding it yet you are a hundred percent sure of the per a adept at that point you have problems yes you do have credibility problems\nIn any case they might not just this case in any case\nYou would have complete and total credibility problems which is what the prosecutor\nSaid yes and this is what it comes down to is is uh can you put a chased together based on all the evidence and and it does again it's not a criminal case so it doesn't rise to those standards but it would be very different if there were a number of people let's say even two or three other people\nThat work at that party or had\nA first hand some kind of first hand knowledge of that event and their stories mimic what she was saying\nYou know the thing is when you make an allegation you have to be willing to provide all the evidence that you have used to cooperate yep you're allegation to begin which which is a lie detector test right if you don't and and nobody is above it I'm sure somebody's brought that up but\nThat has to be brought up because just like the fact that when you used in say these the witnesses these people witness it and they say no and then you say I took a polygraph a test will have you ever helped anybody else take a polygraph test you know and and you know trying to beat is what they're trying to say no I never did well when you get a sworn witness dating\nNope I Know she I I you know I Know she did well then you want all relevant notes because she is using them she is using the polygraph\nAs cooperation that there is credibility tour accusation therefore she should be willing to give everything over to the Senate Judiciary committee so they can verify that that the lie detector test was done in a legit way right\nAnd and and that's again part of the process because if you believe it was legit you're promoting it as legitimate\nThen you have no problem you're telling the truth right and the process that part of the process was done thoroughly thoughtfully\nAnd in order to get the results that it was always going to get because she was always telling the truth right\nHer attorneys on Tuesday implored the FBI to interview her and act on investigative leaves leads they have provided for its inquiry into sexual misconduct\nAllegations against Brett Kavanaugh quoted as inconceivable that the FBI would conduct a thorough investigation of Dr ... allegations without interviewing her\nJudge Kavanaugh or the witnesses we have identified in the letters to you attorneys are debris cats and Michael Brown which wrote to top FBI officials in our letter obtained by political uh\nAgain it's not an investigation no this is the whole point in and look I even said that the other day I said well now that they're doing this you know they'll probably talked with the end and also said well wait a minute when I saw the story yesterday said wait a minute no they won't they well they if they don't understand why they would not\nBecause it's not they're not investigating a crime they're doing a background check on Kavanaugh\nAnd so what they're doing is they're not going after they're not from they may not be going to her or Kavanaugh to get their statements because they have their statements by the way\nThere is they don't get to know the the the attorneys her attorneys don't get to know who the who the FBI interviews or who\nThey don't including people that they say they told the FBI they directed they say they directed the FBI to interview other people associated with is the FBI may be doing that but the FBI doesn't have to contact her lawyers and confirmed that they're doing that right that this is not about her\nThis is a background check on Capitol it's about her claim but\nShe is not this is not about getting her any kind of justice she does there there is a no there is no way for them to be a part of the process\nFor them to be included or directing the process I Know they think that because they were able to manipulate Capitol Hill into giving them their day in front of the camera but that's not how it works with a background check process\nYou may we may not ever know the American people may not know cabinet may not know who they talked to who they interview\nAnd and political here I'm renting from keeps using investigation it's not an investigation it's a background check as the timeframe for completion of the inquiry draws near Ford's attorney sought to call later Tuesday with beer officials to discuss the investigation\nYou don't get to do that now it's not an investigation it's a background check\nAnd it's not about her it's not about Dr Ford none of them about the claim but she does not there is no there is nothing they're going to deliver she's not going to get another day in court this this is not a criminal legal process\nShe doesn't get a copy of the background check it out\nOnly the senators do that's right and uh as well while McConnell Bob and only centers will be able to look at the FBI's final uh findings ... minority leader Chuck Schumer pressed for the public release\nThe redacted version of the report but Republicans are worried about breaking precedent by releasing such information they don't release information from a background write I write a which would be made public available to the Senate the before the Senate votes this week on Kavanaugh's nomination\nAccording to GOP leaders all one hundred senators will have access to the report in a secure studying for the FBI releases it as when he expects the report into multiple sexual misconduct claims against Kavanaugh to be completed he said I think it will be sooner than friday but I don't have\nA an exact date by the way we will find out what's in it because you'll have a Democrat Senator I'm almost positive\nRelease something or half\nWhore a partial part of the transcript that would be damning mhm uh you know to a to a cabin off in the context of not the complete paragraph or sentence or whatever right uh and then it would force the Republicans to ah you know released a holding released the entire thing so\nI'm\nToo [noise]\nYeah I think you're going to see likely are either because if the investigation as as the report came out late in the day on Tuesday but the investigation is winding down\nThen by the way ... yes [laughter] thank you well know but we know but my point is well I was there the records but investigations are technically I was correct but yes as as the reports came out and that's that's exactly how everyone is phrasing of yes\nAnd ... and it's a criminal investigation and it's not it's ... ... ... because that's what they wanted they wanted the criminal investigation that was never\nGoing to happen it was never going to happen but keep in mind there they are they they were given a clear directive and and scope\nAnd in terms of the timeline you've got to get it done in seven days so of course if it's done let's say the the interviews\nAre done for the report still has to be written so imagine that the that that the interviews are are winding down now and and maybe only a few more to do on Wednesday than the paperwork has to be done to submit the report\nAre winding down now and it may be only a few more to do on Wednesday and the paperwork has to be done to submit the report\nAnd that likely will take what I'm at least today than they were then we went we we've been told that they can get it on early as today later on today yeah\nWell if you have multiple people talking about it there would be one person one lead likely at the FBI\nThat we'd compile all of what the different ages found because it's not just one agent and it's not just in one town in fact that they're doing these interviews so it's it's all over the country depending on where those\nSubjects of those interviews are but the point being is that it it's likely one lead that's going to compile all those and it's likely a series of reports of the interviews and that's a pretty a it would probably just be transcripts of the interview\nAnd and then a summary on each other\nAnd then the the lead would be responsible for summarized in the entire report I guess I guess\nIf you want to get in lines are open now eight six six Ninety right I\nAgree with what I told him that he ... he wrote a [noise]\nJoin
