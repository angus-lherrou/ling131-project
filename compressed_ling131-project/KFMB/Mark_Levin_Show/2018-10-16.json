felt it was good evidence that that person may not be guilty of the crime\n[noise] ladies and gentlemen the chances of losing their job if not being put up on criminal charges yourself depending on the severity of the allegation\nAre significant it's becoming clear as day now\nThat the FBI according to multiple members of Congress you've seen this information had information that George Papadopoulos was completely innocent of this that this Russian collusion thing was a fairy tale is made up but the information they presented\nTo the Pfizer court was not that folks was not that it was only this stuff alleged basically in the ... and here\nSay based items that can never be verified now why is this important that there may be exculpatory evidence\nSupporting folks\nBecause of this whole entire case right now\nIs married to this latest narrative this is all they have if the entire reason for investigating the Trump team was based on a case where the FBI and information that guy they were targeting was not guilty at all this whole thing collapses the whole ... that's why this is so critical now what's the big question here\nThe big question is what is the exculpatory evidence and I want to put to potential theories out there for you\nWhat is the exculpatory evidence the evidence indicating Papadopoulos may not be guilty that these members of Congress are saying exist that's out there in the in the ether\nLet me make a suggestion the right if this meeting with down or in the ... bar Alexander down her and this so called ah you know exchange of of Russians may have dirt on Hillary in town over so suspicious hey buddy record that meeting do you find it even remotely\nInteresting that Papadopoulos himself who now that he is a he has taken a plea on this lying to federal agents charge you ever do you find that even remotely interesting that that Papadopoulos himself keeps bringing up the fact that he feels he was recorded\nBy does that matter [noise]\nLadies and gentlemen what if the recordings of this meeting with down her say nothing of the sword about Russian collusion or anything else\nOh that'd be a little bit of a problem now wouldn't that well but the problem that we have a little bit of an issue\nYou think maybe a ... a judge would want to know that there there may have been a recording of this\nI'm not sure there is I'm just saying that's out there it's out there that there may be something what if it's a recording of this conversation that's not exactly the way the FBI painted it oh [noise] yeah that one's things a little bit ah [noise]\nWe make another suggestion to you [noise]\nThe guy who supposedly gave Papadopoulos this information about the Russian dirt this guy miss it I call 'em the pusher he's pushes the information into the sphere according to multiple reports on this they interviewed message they interviewed him the FBI and February\nBoth for\n... for the last five years of renewal before the last\nPfizer renewal in front of a judge whether they swore to a five to ... to get all Papadopoulos paid we got to get these guys\n... good who allegedly push this information about Russian dirt into the Trump sphere that was pulled out later what if he wasn't working for the Russians at all\nWhat if he was working for Friendly's folks to the book lays out I think it pretty conclusive case that somebody has a lot of explaining to do about exactly who Joseph ... was is is\nPotentially exculpatory evidence that George Papadopoulos was set up the whole time he was the fall guy that he was going to be the one maybe they targeted a low level guy 'cause they thought it would be easy\nFolks this is this scandal the century and reckless interview agree to Maria bond aroma this ... is very telling it's telling for very per se\nFor very precise reasons he's indicating that the entire case the FBI's making right now was it George Papadopoulos started this thing while this potentially information out there in St George Papadopoulos maybe instead of the whole thing altogether\n\nOn believable unbelievable\nAll right I mean take some calls do you want to get to calls or if you want to give us

pled guilty to lying to the FBI have the Senate staffer who was leading to his girlfriend of New York times so my question to you is and I know you're talking about different things that are going on in the background yeah my question is\nIs there a grand jury is this guy will you know he only played out to lying you know he did more than live we know release that a felony iffy in front of a grand jury\nWell ... ... or ... here's here's what I find interesting about wolf\nWolf is a lawyer if you read back on some of the case documents waltz lawyer one point had um put out there that in wolf's defense because remember Wolff wasn't charged with leaking Wolfe was charged and food for folks for those\nThose guys they don't understand why this is James James with a Senate staffer on the intel committee that was handling this fight investigation he was arrested by federal agents for I'm lying about basically lying about leaking he wasn't arrested for leasing itself\nThat's fascinating because in his defense his attorney was basically threatening to call who in his defense this senators on the Senate intel committee why is that interesting and fascinating about the wolf case because of wolf is charged with lying about leaking\nAnd his lawyer saying no no he's not lying we're going to call the senators in his defense what does that tell you folks that maybe the senators on the intel committee may have had some role in the selective leaking of information from the committee to the media\nTo make Trump look bad that's why I find most case fascinating wolf's case on one more thing about it too\nPaul Wolff and the tax too is uh his girlfriend who was working in writing stories for a couple of media outlets there's a fascinating series of tax where he techs eighty two times\nTo his girlfriend the day they get a hold of the actual ... application what's fascinating about that\nThe five applications how many pages to\nEighty paying go brother eighty two pages meaning what meaning if significant pages were redacted which they are in the public document right\nHe didn't send her the rejections he may he may have center the on redacted finds application which means what means the media's had this thing the whole time they know this case is complete\nCrap they voted the whole time and there's still propagating this myth that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians even though they've had the ... the application and they know it's crap does that make several\nSo my question them take a little further um yeah we haven't been term coming up Trump held back releasing the redacted material the papers that the Congress the different Congress wanted released this is what ... what do you think and I know this is a kind of a it's not a fair question to you the endgame on this\nAll around Washington perfectly budget perfectly questioning\nMuller is winding down that's what they tell us anyway and Trump has all the all the bullets in his holster what's the endgame is there a grand jury are they're going\nTo I'm going to give you a difficult but true answer here is All right now about leverage Paul do view of the Mueller probe is a criminal

got some yesterday mark eyes for AOL dot com M. A. R. K.\nS. L. E. R. at AOL dot com and ah I'm spoiled on my network other networks show people are already calling me for say anything so feel free to do that you don't always have to wait [noise]\nLast night we talked about if you didn't hear it and we talked about the civil war we're now experiencing in this country between the left and the right\nIn my opinion for the soul of our country we also talked about how Justice Kennedy hearings were really not about his qualifications but a continuation of that battle when when you understand that\nIt puts it a little better perspective didn't matter who President Trump was going to nominate their against them in fact I don't know\nIf you remember the placards of the protesters I don't even think they had a name on it I don't know if they had an extra what they have but it didn't matter it was all about making sure that the president could no point in his choice let alone a conservative\nAnd the chief aim of that battle is removed President Trump from office\nThe left and the Democrats and the media\nThat's all the same as I've pointed out before never accepted as victory and they're doing everything possible to undermine that that seems pretty obvious so in this segment I Want to talk about what I said this last night what a great job President Trump has done\nDuring his time in office despite the best efforts of the left\nAnd I've set for months now I could care less about what he says and much more than what he does and in fact that's I guess it makes me behavior list that's what I feel about people you know they they may say awful things about you or to others but if they treat you well\nI think that's what counts now his tweets have not always helped and he's answered people shouldn't that seems obvious to me and engage with people beneath his position to his detriment I don't think he gets that that certain people that's what I Do and I think I'm right I Know people that aren't worth my time well what's the point you're not going to get anywhere anyway\nPoliticians typically talked our officers that's not a big deal to talk then you've talked to the Russians including a bomb and you remember Obama promising off Mike the things would be better when he got reelected that'd get you know make more stuff happened\nI've been a big supporter sessions when he was a senator but I'm disappointed in his jobs attorney general and disappointed his lack of oversight Rosenstein but more of that later\nSession should've made amends by fire Rosenstein especially if he threatened ... did you hear that he threatened them as they helped their bosses conduct oversight\nAnd just as disappointed by the way is the new FBI direct to almost nonchalant attitude about corruption and his agency that amazes me this is all gotten way out of hand and it is clear to many people by now that Mueller's investigation is a witch hunt in search of a crime\nIf anything there was a soft coup to get rid of President Trump perpetrated by the highest echelons of our government at the Justice Department and at the FBI and I'm not sure until all the dust settles and this is my prediction if we won't find President Obama's fingerprints all over the you wait and see\nWhere we're never supposed to find out about the subterfuge because Hillary was supposed to win right her champagne and our celebration I was a big boats the celebration is supposed to happen in New York City there were waiting for her match the\nOnly one thing it never happened Donald Trump crashed that party and they're never going to forgive him for that and all of it would have been swept under the rug but she didn't win and that's where this tyranny and this resistant\nDoes this than started if not sooner the swamp must be drained by President Trump and this must never be allowed to happen again\nIt's time to free President Trump from this distraction I Want to know you think it's time to free the American people from this distraction [noise]\nIt is time to free all the defendant smaller so far named in this which like Michael Flynn that never should have happened he didn't know he was being under investigation I don't think at the time it's all part of the resistance and it's got it and\nLet me tell ya and I I Want to go on but I Want to get your calls what I thought about President Obama we never did what these people did so let me know what you think eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six same thing nine o seven thirty three thirty nine it's mark gosh they're filling in on right on the radio [noise] George with ...\n... ... ...

Jake in Quantico, Virginia yeah you're on with mark\nHijack hey mark hey how ya doing real well how you do\nA good point I just wanted to make is that what you mentioned about all the good that a\nHundred and she was doing with I'm moving the embassy to Jerusalem are recognizing conservative values of a nation of laws with wanting to build the wall and all that despite of his personal shortcomings I think a lot of times we can see with the ah the recent\nInterview that he did when he was asked a lot of those hard questions along with the first lady\nThat we can overlook a lot of these things despite his personal shortcomings of infidelity and such like that he still is fighting for these conservative values appointees Supreme Court justice is like you were a note in about a horse searching you know\nKevin Oh what is something that uh you would think would be something that would be condemnation let's say a and twenty twenty the next election if something came out\nYou know fighting against someone like Hillary Clinton in the last election with a you know her\nHer personal server and breaking that sort of a security law in that regard being part of the deep state having someone or something that you see might come up to be the next battle that he's going to fight and or the upcoming election\nI'll tell you what's going to be the next battle I don't know if you heard last night we may very well I Hope we don't have the people were cheering me up last night and I tend to be an optimist that we might lose the house 'cause every race stands on his own and I know some reasons here in California that I never thought what happened like Dana Rohrabacher\nUnlike being her back or I mention his name and I know him and he's in trouble because they're spending millions of dollars so if the Democrats take back\nThe house Jake you're going to see hearing you're going to see subpoenas you want to see the attempt to impeach President Trump and cap it off and make these next two years worse than the hearings for judge Kavanaugh that's the biggest fear I have and we got to be very careful great call thanks so much Jake\nAnd now we go to your national forecast for cobra electronics\nWe've seen the past couple of nights some freezing rain in the area of western Oklahoma northern Texas north eastern New Mexico and south eastern Colorado but that will likely not be the case today because the moisture source providing that freezing rain\nHas moved off to the east and warmer weather for South Texas will see heavy showers today those will extend through the architects region down into New Orleans areas hard hit by hurricane Michael not necessarily going to be associated with any rain from this crowd but\nAnd I have to wonder that\nWell why are you talking about later probably well I'm very disappointed and Jeff Sessions he showed no guts no no for for us what am I thinking of you know he's been so weak in in this position\nHe I was for him when he was named them but I've been very disappointed in him and by the way just to your point about Hillary civility that even the very I was thinking about this when you were talking the secret service they treated horribly who who would give their life up for them or she is and what what you did that\nAnd then you take a look at Joe Biden you know swimming naked in the pool and and and so on and so forth\nThese people that they they're beyond the word despicable or Hillary puts it on a weed the horrible uh you know it it it it's you have to be totally blind\nOr just totally ignorant of the fact that you I mean just look at the facts and look up the scarp respond in eight years we had we had a leader previous so our presidents so called president take this country down and I believe you set the racial relations and in our country back fifty years\nI I don't know the number of years a pie but I agree with you totally I mean saying if I had a son the Trayvon Martin whenever he looked like me are always assuming that you know that and what was the guy's name in the other state I can you know hands up don't shoot all of a sudden that to be believed\nYeah Michael Michael and he sent it back and a lot of people voted for him because he was like thinking hey we're going to show we're not race and so on and yet he update you're right it's worse now the animosity this country's is worse than he was president\nAnd you know the the most disgusting part of the Michael Brown has an ... was a simple fact that if you look back and look at the history of as as the events happened as everything went down\nHe walked into as I recall that can be a convenience store you push the owner around as a store or the Senate and the store knocked the attendance down walked out with a bunch of goodies and then one on down the middle of the street looking for trouble the guy was wired for sound so\nI'm a minority and only a minority witnesses\nSaid it was the way the police officer said look look you are right on all counts or member Obama what was that I don't know how many days before the election said we're going to fundamentally change this country have a friend on radio sense measure if you send your wife when we got married I'm going to fundamentally change you\nKnow it's it's it's insane and this was a guy we ...\nAnd the president and at\nThe end of the day as far as the person is so that it didn't take very long for them to ... to ... to respond and I'm I'm Talking about a ... a Eric Holder and Jesse Jackson and\nAl Charlotte and it didn't take them what was it a matter of a day or two and they ran to Ferguson to to to to to stir up the eight and discontent as usual and you know the the amazing part of it was as they grow that Michael Brown and gone into the the officers patrol car to retrieve the officers gun just showed him\nNo matter\nSo so exactly but but so where so where are we as a country now the racial racial division in this country is a credible and it needs to stop but they kept talking and driving home all this crap as nothing more than a damn smokescreen to make us look\nTo make us look at the next issue that pops up and whether we like it or not the mainstream lame stream media is running this country\nAnd and Pete I Want to have said it it triggered a point that that I think is very good on your side the less just goes from crisis to crisis to crisis right and most of it is nothing right the the collusion with the Russians and what what do we waste two years on this stuff\nOr you name it and it's a crisis right now I don't want to get into the global warming there right now although uh it became climate change\nAlways from crisis to crisis in the world is falling apart but you as you said you've got a president now who's not letting him get away with this in fact my love what you said the minority community he said what do you have to think about what's been going on the last twenty thirty forty years\nAnd you know mark ... another thing I knew it was going to win that election and I'm going to tell you why and I hope people listening will agree with us maybe\nMaybe I have long been known to be wrong we all we're all human but the thing about it was a he ... his debate ... walk them all including Hillary smoked every one of them smoke them off the stage basically well and there's a\nBasic political affiliations he'd had never dealt in politics at all\nWell thanks Pete I appreciate your call very much yeah that's what I said in my opening monologue kind of the people\nThe respect the fact that finally you got somebody who didn't care about how he came across just said what are your thoughts over the top sometimes you know I Wish he didn't say some of the things on you know write songs on Twitter that he does\nAnd I wish he would I say that I Wish you wouldn't respond to a lot of people but he ... this guy you know you get the whole package\nAnd as part of the whole package I think he's done a great job I just listen to it gave a partial list and far better than George W. Bush\nAnd in certain ways they compete to one of my heroes Ronald Reagan because he's he's done so much he doesn't even get the credit for a lot of stuff he's done and as I said\nI don't care what he says I care what he does\nYou know ... I'm just thinking about a on a personal basis ... what kind of surge and do you want someone who does a great job for you or someone I you know has a great disposition ideally you want both but the the ties been terrific in office and I think he's grown into it even better than I expected\nUm and here's someone else who agrees but I go to disagree to Marcus in broad run Virginia you're on with mark\nOh yeah [noise] yeah I'm a or a fake it more and um [noise] I agree with your last caller and President Trump did not need this mess\nHe did not needed at all he was already a billionaire he was in a lead is he could have sat out there and and not worry about anything\nHe worried about the people of this country and the direction this country was going okay we're going down the socialist path they were going down where you are going down so long\nPath and he pulled us out he grabbed Josh holds us out and do a left is going crazy right and he is right\nWhen he goes to the uh [noise] you know campaign thing [noise] what he is talking is absolute truth look I grew up in\nA democratic [noise]\nHousehold a lifelong Democrat [noise] only time my mother ... which was where she voted for

God [laughter]\nOh I was just going to say I appreciate your call just because we got to go to the break but the ... you know I even love his style he sees President Trump is pretty funny says you're going to get tired of winning so much I mean who would say that yeah he goes over the top or as we said you know there's a Twitter his tweets I should say\nBought two would ever say some ... he's a character\nBut he's growing into the job and I think he's doing a great job I Can't wait for him to be reelected a a a ... although I shouldn't say that can you imagine their reaction I'm Talking about the left and the resistance\nCars and they're trying to get rid of them are I Know that's why the young men of called me at the beginning they are saying what do you expect there's going to be
