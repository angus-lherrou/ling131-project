my own research that research background\nI found out she was a cheerleader and high school and there was there was something on the Web that talked about when the cheerleaders quote unquote got air did enough it was party time so I'm Wondering is just like any other teenager she might have had so much to drink she didn't know\nWho while here's what I Do know that anybody asked that question exactly that was my point it did they ask those questions about Kavanaugh yes did they ask those questions about her no exactly and that's why she and her lawyers do never never ever want to see the inside of a courtroom\nRight but the other thing that I wanted to mention that to other things do I have time I'd been waiting a long time but it's not\nOkay for like um you might have covered this

you're telling me what's in Kavanaugh's mind you told me he's guilty that's about what it is in his mind that's more online in a matter of being in your mind it's a process if you honestly believe

want to say give me one okay here's one uh NBC News out today with a story a cabin on\nThursday said that he had never heard of the Yale allegations until the New Yorker story about Ronan Farrow injuring Meyer came out I mean she uses reporting that they have checks that Kavanaugh sent to his classmates for that story came out many\nHeard of it then contemporaneously how is that a line in\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nKillings are thinking right now he's I Hope I'm never asked these questions\nI Hope I'm never asked these questions\nWell then [noise]\nFriend of mine rights me that the Montgomery County chief of police the county state's attorney says\nUm that are under the laws that existed in Nineteen eighty two the express Mitt time or the allegations

that is the cat in our case given the history of the Hillary investigation\nWell people have asked me that question and I think we'll see a at the outcome I think what you're going to see\nIs the Democrats if they're unhappy with the outcome they're going to start attacking the FBI they're going to start attacking it as a a subtle Folsom investigation they're already doing not and not investing enough witnesses the president's looming so are these people and not to be taken seriously these people are to be seen rolled\nYeah so that's the best I can answer okay thank you All right you got a gym in New York City the great WABC go\nTaking my call them is the one you got it I Would hope that somebody could oh oh oh what a Republican colleagues to stop using ...

her claims and there was no room for movement provided that we'll we'll both over any nature ... what she said\nI'm not quite the contrary as the prosecutor points out there's a lot of serious questions to be raised and\nI think they were very very lucky and the Republicans very foolish with this five minute rule\nAnd cutting her off they were listening to some of the analysts on Fox and other other cable station saying she's not scoring\nShe if the people aren't paying attention to this uh I think the ... set it I'm not attacking I'm just making a point it was very frustrating for me at the time and I pointed it out last week they're dead wrong she scoring points quote unquote she's making points points that are very very crucial and we are understanding what she's saying\nI I agree with you ...\nYeah I Know but I was the only ones saying if the only guy on radio big radio the only guy on big t._v. well that's not true I didn't hear everybody so but but you understand\nI Do

claim you know for example for\nThe witnesses have she claims all say we don't know what she's talking about the changes completely what people think which means\nA significant portion of people have no idea that the witnesses that she has used\nHave not cooperated what she has said as soon as they do with it gets up to you know a a fifty fifty seven percent of people believe that he should be confirmed for that means roughly forty you know because I'm sure there was a few people that go on and so it means somewhere between thirty five and forty percent don't believe he should be\nConfirmed it of course that's roughly the number of Democrats practiced yeah so as we've always said in any of these\nUh in in any of that we talked about people that we're never going to convince every body\nRight just yeah so as we've always said in any of these uh in in any of that we talked about people that we're not going to convince everybody at some point your point is not to convince everybody your point is to convince\nThe majority of those independents and those people that are in the middle ... because if you ... have forty percent of America this Republican in forty percent that's Democrats it's the other twenty percent is that right at up to a hundred a ... you know that's what your those are the people that you are trying to move\nIn a particular direction and so when you uh fifty seven percent that means you have convinced enough\nTo get to where you need to get to where you know where you wish to get ... once the information is out there to the people so that's

listen and you all know\nWhat NBC did was a complete hack job that isn't journalism an allegation in it sells\nWithout anything else to cooperate it is not a story it's not a story that a major\nMajor newspaper or a major television networks should ever run it lacks completely on any type of journalism ethics\nAnd they know it has that been someone claiming that about Obama in two thousand eight that it never would have ... well you know it's coming out now\nIs the leaks are completely anonymous yeah right there was another one uh ... completely ... of anonymous people are just sending letters hey I was abused right and then that's being like oh there's another lettering from somebody else\nHave you paid attention to social media and you can make these people don't even use their real name on social media most often right I mean it's just and and it's\nTo me it it shows you\nKnow that NBC don't ever ever complain about President Trump\nUsing the term fake news and directing it at you right if you put out back kind of peace trash story yeah based on an allegation and you do an interview knowing going in there that this person is walking back everything\nThe allegation and you do an interview knowing going in there that this person is walking back everything that they say and you can't find anybody to cooperate if you don't go with that story it's the same thing\nAs I mentioned from my it was we talked about yesterday from Eric Brady at USA Today when\nHe wrote well should Brett Kavanaugh will be coaching girls' teams not until the investigation is done and then talked about in his original article a credible source\nBy the way just the note as I had set on yesterday show I I Know Eric Brady um was it used to knew him as a kid he was a really good friends with my neighbor across the street just\nSo people know that it's important see that's what you do in your blood people know that [noise] 'cause somebody might find out you know and I as I said last night I said you know I've I've uh since I knew him when he was young\nAnd you know we've kept in touch over the years just on Facebook a which is a space as Facebook balance to lead it but that was a piece of trash article that he wrote and said you know claim it as a news story not an opinion that credible evidence no one there is no credible evidence against Kavanaugh\nIt's a ... and and this is and that's why when you said that during the break it just it hit home with me\nThey're never going to get off\nThe break here no no this is and it won't end when Trump is no longer president this is not going to end no because in fact they'll feel more empowered Trump is the one who calls them out the next guy or gal likely won't\nAnd here's what's interesting too so NBC goes with the interview from sweating they admit they can't find anything to back up anybody else to back it up they go with the interview an interview\nA story on the ... this is the prosecutor brought in to do the questioning at the hearing and the memos released\nAnd on Monday\nNBC News decided that wasn't worth reporting now it if Mitchell had reported\nThat my finding is that judge Kavanaugh is not worthy of being seated on the highest court that would have been the lead headline in fact it would have been an NBC News by now if you're wondering NBC News why nightly news is that an all time low\nThat's it nobody believes you when they see right through you\n\nYour hats nothing more nothing less and it's shameful behavior yes oh stop feeling insulted when Trump says your fake news right you're not even worthy of his recognition frankly because\nYou're nothing if you're going to put somebody up there you admit you can't backup independently as a news organization anything the woman is about to say you put her on the memo which is part of the official process from the prosecutor gets zero time\nYes we don't feel that the president should stoop to your level right that'll really take them off well at that and and that's what ... that's ... and that by the way coming from a guy\nWho ... who has how many times we sat on this program there are times when somebody needs to just take the the his Twitter account way for a few minutes\nAnd and there are times when he doesn't speak effectively we're he says something that totally doesn't work the communications from this White House have been horrible but that's how bad it will NBC but it's all you don't or you shut it you have an earned the right in him\nBecause it's also what you get from the left that well because of this president's and there were changing the way that we do thing yeah\nWe have it no\nWe haven't shall we don't care less active communication when we we never we never change our standards of what we will do whether it's Obama\nWhether it's Bush whether it's Clinton while we were working together with Clinton [laughter] whether whether it's a a Trump we don't care no or certain ... and if the two idiots overnight can do it NBC you certainly have the ability to do it you don't want to do\nWe know they go out of their way to put somebody on do an actual interview with somebody and that they themselves as a news organization camp backup and one word she's saying but ignore part of the official process and that statement was part the Mitchell or a release the memo was part of the official process\nThey could take it and take it to another prosecutor and asked that prosecutor well what did you think did you watch it did you what do you think of Kavanaugh's and Dr Ford's claims and what'd you say the same thing the memo did\nNot even that they completely skirted the entire thing\nAnd then you're going to have all these guys and gals chomping on cigars in the boardroom at NBC News trying to see what's going wrong wire ratings go well what's what's what's the problem here\nWe're well it's interesting because one of the one of the other stories that came out during the day on Monday is that you have the founder of CNN Ted Turner that says the idea that it has become too political this coming from a guy who's clearly on the left\nAnd is the founder of the network and then you have a the the uh the the former show runner really at the Greenfield Jeff Greenfield yeah or who ran CNN for years comes out and says the people that work at CNN think that they're part of or act as if they're\nThe quote a they they count themselves as part of the anti Trump\nResistance ... we know this we see it it's it's very obvious but when you have other people that were you know bear before\nThat can look at it and say this is clear what's going on\nThese people are active it's they're not journalists they instead of opinion they're not even they won't even be a ... they they like cowards hide behind the word analysis that's the new word for opinion right opinion at the top\nYou have an opinion should be based on some well see I don't know why your\nHand analysis should be here's the situation but it's not it's here's my opinion so if you're going to have an opinion piece called opinion but you know what\nCats are already out of the bad people see right through these news organizations it's not tolerated anymore and you wonder why they're not trusted and you wonder why those CNN shows are at the bottom of the cable news and NBC's at the bottom of the network\nNews
