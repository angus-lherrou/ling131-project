you\nWe're going to continue our index conversation now with an international real estate expert last hour she talked with us about bringing foreign buyers to your open house and now how you can buy your dream home\nYou know far away ... joining us now is Patricia town real for an international sales director with the\nYour global agents team at Caldwell banker residential real estate in Sarasota, Florida Patricia thanks for being back with us all unrealistic today absolutely\nSo now let's change the conversation to Americans who want to buy either across the sea or over the border where are we looking for\nA lot of Americans are buying in late ... outside of our own country but we think people are going to ... ... ... ... ... feet long\nUm we see them going to tax hey that was like the Bahamas and some of the Caribbean or spring we have ... their their areas that we refer them to ... to ...\nSo what that process like Patricia what's the first step\nIt written on the situation generally if I'm wrong if they can't find you know they they know the area I'm not always but I Would say most people you know they work in an area that friend that has been on holiday on vacation there\nSo they know where they are looking around I I thought well what exactly are you looking forward based in in the eighties you Rob how long we're going to be living that during the year do you want to rent it when you know you there so you know a lot of people by federal vacation homes and want them to work for them while\nThey're not using them and that helps me understand what they're trying to a chain technically I gave a picture that international true life partner in the right location and the funny part is\nIt could be more than one location I had a British dental and recently who wants to buy something I learned that buddy there you know you want it to look at how long he gets a little bit Costa Rica so we tend to partners in both countries and he thought this particular jump when they find it on common law\nBut he felt confident with the introduction speak is getting so apartments in those countries getting don't really have to prove themselves as much as they would have done it just called freelance\nDo most Americans who buy in foreign countries do they also go all cash by say either taking equity out of their properties here or cashing out stock or something along those lines\nYes they do because it's very hard for Americans to qualify for a mortgage and other kinds of trade but usually they a cash fire but you're right and then the leveraging home equity line yeah or selling and we'll hear all that stuff don't spoil to buy it but they will typically the cash by it and the country\nBecause of the exchange rates and how they fluctuate if I put a contract to own a house for one million dollars in another country is it possible by the time I get to closing is going to be one million two hundred thousand\nIt could be one or two hundred thousand or they could be eight hundred [laughter] my my on my own with\nIt and the longest and vote when you when you buy in a foreign country or in a foreigner by yeah there we just talk shows but they're trying to actually own now failing purchase property but there's also the currency Trump auction and not because they're they're very carefully\nSo you need to understand what's happening in your father's car I think part of their heads\nAnd now special companies right now that you can work with\nTo help you with about farming situation so they look for a minute to the left someone here will educate ear about things that influenced the currency exchange rate rookie indicated that it can be published that might have an impact on the exchange and know how your quarter\nHow and when to change your money to that currently\nNo I understand there are companies that will lock in your\nExchange rate so for changes you won't get stuck at the settlement table is that real\nNo absolutely it's real and located occurrence the ex candidate for a period of time and all I Do like a pardon the status of trade in my own and not look thin actually walk in the exchange it for up to yeah\nSo it's something for customers to think about not just when buying or selling but also when they're looking at cost of ownership you know when the anger insurance premiums back home do face that property taxes\nIf they can go into a year or whether they know they're always going to achieve that particular currency right back very reassuring for that\nI see in the last question for Patricia is one of our listeners wants to buy a house overseas with all your experience what's the number one piece of advice they must know before they go forward with it\nThey use a local county\nLove love love that the tiny should not be in any way associated with all introduced by a builder developed from real estate and then all the sound of that property that need to find an independent but at the furniture work with\nGreat advice Patricia and thank you so much\nWell thank you and I think than I can help just let me know\nPatricia tan real chore and international sales director with the your global agents dean at Caldwell banker residential real estate in Sarasota, Florida\nComing up on real estate today\nWhy an AR he's deeply involved in a global real estate so we're really hoping to raise the bar on real estate of an industry across the globe that coming up on our special show going global\nBut first it's time for real knowledge\nSpecial segment on real estate today in which we talked to a real estate professionals economist journalist or an industry expert\nAnd ask them about things you need to know about in right now we've all heard the economy of the United states is chugging along strongly I mean after all the GDP is up\nEmployment is up and we all know the stock market is way up\nAnd that's apparently causing the Federal Reserve to look closely at whether they should continue to raise interest rates if they do and you're in the market to buy a house how can that affect you look back to professional\nJoining us now is more into the chief economist of the national association of real tours Lawrence welcome to real estate today\nI've always Stephen and as you alluded to a communist when quite terrific guy in terms of GDP Growth in terms of job gangs wages are only rising stock market is still way up there are so there are brought sign of deep very positive economic picture a yet home sales\nBecause of the limiting inventory is being held back compared to what it could be\nAnd of course Lawrence for all those positive reasons of the economy is so good the fed is raising interest rates do you think that's going to have any impact on buyers in the marketing the Mossad\nThe Federal Reserve raises interest rates first we have to understand they are raising short term\nInterest rates and not long term most consumers have thirty year fixed rate mortgage so uh the mortgage rate may not move direct relation with what the Federal Reserve maybe doing a less or some of the homeowners have the adjustable rate mortgages Danny could change buffets\nAnd it could change but fortunately over Ninety percent of Greeks shut homebuyers are taking on those long term thirty year\nFixed rate mortgage so they would not feel the pain of any rising interest rates but to consumers consumers who are looking to buy a maybe a mortgage rate will inch higher end up for all forecasts is that I expect your mortgage rate to be trending higher maybe five percent average\nSo we're really hoping to raise the bar on real estate industry across the globe which doesn't happen overnight but really focusing on history that we have the quality of relationship with the best professionals in place that make sure that those relationships a straw that vibrant will August the future\nWill call and I've got to tell you I think the international scene is so
