loss\nBecause if you acknowledge their coming here legally the argument might be quickly over if they are legal they're not allowed to be here and store in another caller said that white you know why is this going on it's pretty simple\nSo as an example if you own a home and someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in they wouldn't be able to say they want to draw home to go into your home but they just lack the proper documents\nSimilarly if someone walks in tears to your bank and wants to take the money out of your account right they would be asked to prove that it's their account\nIf they said it was their account but they just didn't have the documents to prove it the bank would not permit them access it's not obvious\nWhich is why you just so ludicrous for the left to use the phrase undocumented as this they can have your house and bank account if only they could find the misplaced documents for years now I've said the left is one of the argument over language\nBut how about they not be allowed to come or in the first place and we wouldn't need to care if they cooperate with authorities isn't that obvious how can you ever justify harboring\nTo not be allowed to come here in the first place and we wouldn't need to cooperate with orange isn't that obvious how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes that native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate watch this to the evil police officers at ice who have the audacity to arrest people commit crimes that they do these guys are really clever on the left\nSo the rest of us live with long lines at hospitals ... schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls their gated community so what's my solution\nYou take away the benefits like free health care and free schools to enforce strict penalties against businesses that hire illegals even sending some CEO to jail you stay in the first CEO to jail for hiring and illegal immigrant and will never happen again\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home\nRun he actually had a right to use the wrong language self deport there we go again language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there were no better I take it back not everybody a lot would leave and that's what's happened during the recession a lot we leave there are no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs legal\nWeight but I Would say that those who remain that's the point I Want to make I'd be willing to have a conversation about with them because they be staying for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake enough of the government's sending out the wrong message message with actions like the legal education classes I'm a teacher I Know or bilingual government documents\nA country is United by language and it's shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and our shared values our ancestors kiss the ground when they landed here at Ellis Island they were so happy to have landed\nAt the land of freedom so let's build that wall and do everything to end dilute legal immigration and take our country back tell me what you

your calls at eight six six Ninety ... we're talking\nAbout illegal immigration and let's see with Fred in Washington DC has to say about it for it [noise]\nHey Quil\nA language that you were talking about one of the biggest blaring saying that that you even do it yourself\nAre you a merry you say American what actually we are us citizens in America and the liberals not liberal that's called radicals they actually taking it\nAmerican would actually we are us citizens in America and the liberals are not liberal that's called radical sir they actually taken at work in a plot it to everyone on the side of this so when they\nWhen they walk in American you know we think that it's just sitting\nHere now they're thinking the other side of the world and immigration means nothing to do I mean this is just normal stuff we've said great wars when we say American then they they say American save brainwashed us to\nThink that we're saying citizens and ate and ate brainwash us to think that everybody uses American but when you look at your passport\nIf you have one it's as you said is that what we are\nAnd that's a huge difference we have to be so deliberate with what we say oh words have got to be delivered and that's that's got to be a main thing that we have to do even on the air because the radicals or taking those words and\nThat's what I say about\nWell I appreciate your call but I'm not going to give up that word to them I just refuse to do it\nI eat when I hear that word America or Americans in me you know all kinds of patriotism comes to my mind I'm not going to let them use or that and just because they think Americans ... you know north Americans or whatever they want to use it for not going to let them get away with that\nOh and and you know some of the songs right America the beautiful let that that's not there's I'm not conceding that to them as NATO chance I'm going to do that\nAgain I don't want to concede the language them at all that's why it's important and legal immigrants illegal aliens I Know people kept me on that\nUm but I don't I don't see anything to them\nAnd and if you do that and then you're kind of giving up a little bit no where Americans are best for the United states citizens great I get but there's something special about this country called America where the United states of America America usa whenever you want to call it\nAnd so appreciate your call that's my take on it and now you're national forecast for cobra electronics\nLake effect snow off Lake Ontario on portions of I Ninety will leave a light dusting of

little too warm in the region the mid west northeastern fact everyone east of the Mississippi today will be under high pressure and that means clear skies rain for Texas continues today\nYeah well we don't give aid to the Soviet Union I mean you might say well now Russia there are certain countries you know you might say we can have like the China you might say we give them a because they take in fair advantage of us All right\nBut there are a lot of countries are\nAre we going to have those endeavors actually they were\nActually the Russians are helping us more with the satellites right now that we may be helping them financially but that's not your point your point is a good one which is we ought to charge the country's um for their illegals coming here I I I kinda like that idea\nEven though\nNo no it's a it's an interesting idea\nOr ... them to monitor their own people at that point\nYou know and as you as you're kind of indicating this and they they love to send us they're poor right a lot of especially Mexico writes I send them send us the poor and is not our problem right now is your problem ...\nAnd ... and then you can also add on to the health care bill of health care bill um school it will go on forever but basically it will stop the oil and stuff and you know let me but\nI yeah there's nothing like the right and center and that's the point right now it's been the wrong and send you come here as I said I don't blame them and you get to go to school for free you get to have free hospital care right and you get to a drive in our roads you you know we pay for the roads and this was terrific you you know I I Would come here to that's why you sit\nThere and charge interest and we can make money off the interest than we know what\nYeah you should have given this idea that President Trump because that's the way they could be paying for all\nYou know any better than I Do only about selling [laughter] that's a great\nCall thing Steve appreciate it very much actually I I I I did apply\n[laughter] I don't think\nThat's a great call thing Steve appreciate it very much actually I I I I did apply um someone told me what to do I do know some people and I was thinking you know I'm a teacher too I Love to be a way up there in the department of education and bought a person I said to then I think eventually\nHe was didn't work with the president and I have a good friend who's a head of communications for I think the department of health\nUh and so yeah it does happen and you know some people but you know what a ... it's tough and and that's one of the news stories that the I think they were heading someone else's leaving the administration it's tough to work there especially\nIf you're conservative you don't care about the party's you don't you just want to do a good job you certainly it's not the connections you want it it's tough it's tough and a lot of your point that out yesterday that President Trump has given up a lot to become president and I say if you could say well it's an ego trip this power all that kind of stuff I don't think he needed that\nI think that was one of the enduring things who needed the abuse of his family right and and now you know if the Democrats getting power that's another thing I mentioned this last couple of days I think in power not only hearings and Spain is but you know they're going to go after taxes because they they're sure they're going to find something there\nThat though I'll probably with the Russians I guess right he made some kind of the all the Russians but even if they don't what business is it of there's\nWhat his tax returns are it's just not their business I Know certain presidents have done I I don't think they should\nIt's it's no one's business what you pay in taxes that that should be a private thing it's none of your business Democrats or Republicans I don't I wouldn't want them to know my I don't I pay what I'm supposed to pay do my share but it's not anybody else's business by the way after the Kavanaugh hearings and all this other stuff as they go after taxes\nWhy to good people exactly why to good people want to serve\n... especially people that say why and that leads me to another point I think we should consider Democrats loves serving in government of course for them they believe in much more government so here they get a chance to do that they get a chance to maybe be a bureaucrat and tell you how to live your life\nYeah there there was a party that loves to work in government we're the party that has to give something up I think it was Daniel Boone who served for a little while and Congress and you know he he was one of those that hey I Can't wait to get home\nIn the case of Republicans and conservatives I think they're much more likely to say I want to go back to my family into my life because they don't believe in this whole part and that's what illegals don't know\nWhat makes America special one of the big things he's limited government that government stays out of your lives and don't you find it ironic to say the least\nThat a lot of illegals who come to our country are escaping corruption in government and big government\nAnd what are they do when they get here they vote for exactly the same thing they left it's really bad so the you because it it takes a while like a lot of people said yesterday people don't know what's going on right when they do the those man on the street interviews woman on the street interviews and\nYou know they say who's the vice president United States they can't name that that's not so important what's important is that they know what makes this country special what makes this country exceptional\nThat we leave the citizens alone we let them live their lives so I teach my students I get and I don't try to indoctrinate them I'd given both sides I get why we need traffic lights if we don't have traffic lights your going to have energy\nBut on every issue you bring before me I Want the government out of my life as much as possible\nThat's why some people question is why I'm conservatives like a government when it comes to things they can't do themselves that would explain a strong military\nI Can't have a tank in my backyard or grenades or is let alone nuclear weapons so there are evil people in the world right that that's another thing that shows this debate in perspective with the illegal immigration they want to open borders on the other side because they think that most people are pretty good I I don't believe that\nI Believe people have a real tendency to be bad and they do awful things like a lynching right like the Germans were out of the strongest crime and the Eighteenth century and when asked why they did what they did this because we can I I don't trust humanity I I don't trust that\nAnd there was something special about this country where we didn't want to trust government and I didn't get into this so much last night's caller mentioned that\nWe have a system of checks and balances the founders were brilliant so there are laws the federal government does their laws right that the states are in charge of\nAnd the rest is left to the people they did that on purpose but even there right how do you pass a law you guys know this house has to pass the Senate has to concur and and the president has to agree if he doesn't agree he vetoes it and then the house and Senate could override it\nAnd then the Supreme Court could say you pass a law that's unconstitutional\nThey really were afraid of big government\nSo that's another big issue with illegal immigrants they don't understand what makes this country so special\nBut most you guys do and even if you're on the less I Want you to explain to me why I'm wrong about
