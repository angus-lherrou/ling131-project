Florida when I Lived in the Fort Walton Beach Pensacola area back in the eighties\nIt's like you arrive ... one of the reasons we would have trouble ever worked right in any administration\nIs because we have a we would have a problem promoting something that we didn't believe in right and there are there are people that and and again I have nothing against people who do that that's your job\nYour job is to ... what the administration wants you repeat what the administration wants to the world when you are you in a you know UN ambassador the problem with the human eyes we've been talk show hosts too long we just we could\nWe probably couldn't do that or we will get frustrated that are doing that even if the president was even if we thought the president was Ninety percent right we want to get our ten percent in well you can't do that when you're a UN ambassador you have to\nBe the national security advisor to be effective in that position I mean not only that that he that he talks to the public but he's an advisor as opposed to\nSomeone who is mimicking or or relaying a mess and and both inside the same thing you know because when when they asked him well you know a smile or a [laughter] heads on John Hope [laughter]\nJohn Button was asked that even though he's always as they said well look when when you were ...\nWhen you were a you know when you were whatever ah ...\nFive years ago you said this and now you're saying this and he said well this is what the president which do I was a private citizen back then the president believes that everything has changed at this point did I Do it but look\nI give the president advice the president I disagree right I get invited vice what he does like that is I I'm the national security adviser advisor they ended up ... white I tell him what should I tell them this is what I think you should do right he doesn't necessarily have to follow it and then when he says let's go and do it well then I tell you what the the plan is\nThat the the president and I sit there and I'm just want to pull my hair out saying why are we going through this because everybody knows that already\nWell but but do they in a nation where they can't name the three branches of\nGovernment well no you know I think the reporters do it because they want\nTo they they are trying to find anything to show that there is discord within the administration [noise] yes yes it is ... and they attempted to do that with Nikki Haley as you mentioned earlier\nAnd I I think to your point the earlier point you may as well on the list of a possible abilities and and the possible people who might take her\nHer spot I probably wouldn't have seen a Nikki Haley\nUh in that position as strong as she has been\nWhen she was governor I probably wouldn't have been able to say wow she's going to go to the un and she's really going to Iraq some noise you know I don't think glow point so anybody on those lists could be you know I just the strongest stronger as as she's been and I trust the president now or maybe not as first year so much but I trust the president now\n... and also trust the situation\nAnd we said this in his second year as he moved into a second year of a presidency we talked about how people who were going to work with him I either on staff or in the cabinet wouldn't know what they ran for\nAfter that first year and so anybody who accepts that role knows what they're in for which means they're up for that job as well from their perspective\nWe have a busy and great show ahead we do eight six six Ninety

meteorologist ham hill he will\nUh join us but uh you know you make a great point when you talk about the fact that\nWhen you're talking about going and I think both of us to me I made a fair point you made a great point up but you really don't know what you're going to get until you see somebody sitting in front of the un it's almost like a presidential spokesperson for I was making the analogy view is almost like an NFL quarterback wrapped in NFL quarterback\nYou have no idea how they're going to perform you'd have no idea right and all they got in to get on the field unions like oh they stink I really really good and\nAnd I really really good and we've uh I'd mentioned Sarah Huckabee Sanders that that you know most presidential spokes of people I don't like but if you would have told me when that and I probably made the comment I don't remember specifically making it but when she came aboard I probably went [noise]\nNo I just don't think she has it right away it was I wrong\nYou know and and and she has been very she doesn't even flinch anymore\nUh it it gives you look at the nature of the ridiculous questions thrown at her every single day now it's just it's more like a game\nAnd that's the way she plays a but at first it was not a game and it and it it's not an easy job it's not a job that anybody would want but she's been very good at it and you're right with few exceptions like a John ... and you know you pretty much know what you're going to get the John Bolton but\nOtherwise uh there are a lot of people on that list and and and we'll see but clearly again going in I think they know what they're in for a not only internationally and what we're dealing with at the un but of course\nA what the president expect\nA drivers for cobra electronics you should be aware that there are parts of ice Seventy five and also I tend there in the Florida Panhandle\nUh that are going to be affected by this storm a you as you can imagine specially everything pretty much east of mobile on I can is going to be affected uh\nKate at the same time it's wins wrapping around the giant wind field work causing storms and uh and tornados along the Carolinas and the Carolinas have got a\nPretty good chance of of multiple tornadoes associated with this and and you know anyone in this entire area of the big band and the panhandle uh are are going to basically relate to a cake\nWhich happened to be in Nineteen eighty five but this is going to blow Kate out all the water\nTom in terms of the the the danger coming ashore because I think a lot of people may be who are looking at\nYou know the I coming ashore but I mean the where the danger and the potentially life threatening situation start what is that timeline where is that window and and what should we expect during that time line\nOkay when it comes to the timeline on what you should expect 'em by tomorrow morning it's still should be off shore\nAnd it will be probably still a category three but darn close to a category for it I wouldn't be shocked if in the next ... in in the in one hour from now I may be upgraded but by Wednesday evening it should be on shore\nAnd so that would be in line with Tallahassee it would be coming across Tallahassee by Thursday evening it should be\nEntering the Carolina\nAnd cutting right across the middle of the Carolinas and so the eastern side of it will be the onshore winds and the rain and the storms so Charlotte and end up the coast and then they don't need any more\nUh destruction or anything now wins are going to be around forty five miles an hour or when it gets to the Carolinas and that's going to be Thursday morning but on Wednesday today or we're gonna have wins in Tallahassee tonight of at least eighty miles an hour\nAnd a and a probably sustained winds up to forty or fifty miles an hour going through Tallahassee um we're looking at wins that are going to be up to a hundred miles an hour or when we get to\nA coming onshore and the storm surges the other really bad situation ah from pretty much I don't want to include Panama City Panama City six to nine foot storm surge\nAnd that's in part because their shoreline faces a little more to the southwest and so when it comes in and if it comes in to the east the Windsor going to be backing so it will reduce that effect\nBut you get past that to saint Joe which is on the peninsula they're swinging around toward Appalachian coal ah we're looking at a storm surge that\nWill run all the way around through the entire big band that doesn't include cedar key um of nine to Thirteen\nFeet while yeah nine to Thirteen feet um obviously once your past three feet cars float ... yeah\nAnd and then so we're talking about a book again in\nTerms of that immediate threat really the greatest threat right now in those areas along the shoreline we're talking storm surge correct\nI the storm surges is clearly from the you know there's a storm surge warning in effect from Panama City past crystal river and\nAnd and so as an example um we're looking at Panama City tonight\nThey'll start seeing wins moving their way up to fifty miles an hour and all the way through an average fifty miles an hour through Wednesday night\nThey're going to have gosh Wednesday night or as this storm has kind of short of a hundred miles an hour and a storm surge of eight to twelve feet or excuse me rain I'm Sorry of eight to twelve inches a foot of rain\nSo inland and even on the coast flash flooding is going to be a common of that ...\nThat that rains got to go somewhere and ah and once you start to inundate the water starts to rise under a storm surge [noise] um\nThen from there then you start dealing with the rain on top of that and so we saw that in New Bern a newborn uh on friday night before the storm came in and the Carolinas the winds were coming out of the\nSoutheast and blowing up the Neuse River\nNew Bern is at the end of the Neuse River and they had a water rise of ten point two feet\nAnd and we had the um we had a a lieutenant I'm dropping his name but the lieutenant of the police department there the following day talking about the uh friday night rescues which were over three hundred and fifty boat rescues\nUm that night while while\nI'm a ... again uh the you know I there's this should go without saying but but certainly we want to repeat it as often as possible the people that are in the path of this storm need the heat all of the directors and warnings given by local officials do not hesitate\nA that this is this is going to be a a a life threatening storm it is already a life threatening storm and it is right now you have time to get out of the way of the storm\nA Tom ... in terms of uh the the rainfall you mentioned a that we're going to see in some places maybe eight to twelve inches of rain um the flooding potential though won't necessarily be like it was because of Florence because the storm is moving faster is that correct\nYeah to some degree that's correct but still I expect many areas to pick up anywhere from eight to twelve inches as we move inland through Tallahassee\nAnd then from there when we move across the border into Georgia we're still going to be looking at five inches of rain or more in many areas so I can pull up some maps and break that out um next time we taught by during the ... the fact of the matter is that it only takes\nYou know it doesn't take a lot of water if the ground saturated for run off to start flash flooding right\nAnd we all know the usual places where flash flooding takes place and well the difference here is that this storm liked the Carolinas along the coast are going to cause flooding in the places that are not the usual places and\nFired and ... and when when you expected to onshore\nExpect onshore between three and four o'clock\nOkay uh this afternoon fair alright alright\nMedia Ronald just Tom hale you're going to be with us throughout the morning thank you Tom tom and standing coverage for us as he mentioned with Hurricane Florence a and also uh last year with a Hurricane Irma in in Florida so uh we are we just want to make sure that\nUh everyone knows

service will bring those and we do have a another Fifteen minutes we will have the national Hurricane Center ... latest report that basically the\nCone yeah and you look look at what Tom was saying and he's expecting a that this could be they could upgrade the storm to a category for hurricane or with this next report that's coming out here and just a bit\nAnd we will go over that with Tom the next time we talk to them and we'll be doing that later in the in the program as well and again meteorologist John trout on board as well to give us a his latest a prospect of an update or in the next

fifty miles and our our first responders or police fire they're not going to be able to get to you so hopefully you've got enough water and food and stuff to take care of yourself\n[noise] ah that's mayor of Panama City Greg ... bread Nikki a yesterday evening we just got an update from the national Hurricane Center and from what we can see with the sustained winds of no a hundred and thirty miles an hour it's up to a category for in fact the national hurricane\nCenter is saying it is now a hurricane that category for a hundred and thirty miles an hour\nThey ah it again you could look at the strength of this storm and and the history of the storm over the weekend or the productions being anywhere from a one to two and then late in the weekend a more\nUh closer to a two and and pretty much everybody was calling that by Monday morning a change and they were saying that it has the potential of being a three and now it is up to officially a category for hurricane or a hurricane Michael\nA it is a set to come ashore uh sometime in the afternoon three or four pm there near Panama City\nAh Florida and officials again you just heard a one mayor and other officials have been basically saying the same thing throughout the day\nUh yesterday they were saying ah you should be aware that the first responders going to be limited and being able to get to you and in in many cases especially while the storm is at its strongest in that area will not be able to get to you so you may not have power you may be in a situation\nA that's a you will or not be able to again I get to any kind of a ... assistance or four hours and so uh it is best to get out of the way of this storm\nAs soon as possible uh get inland go somewhere where you will be safe and where you are with others especially if you have an underlying medical condition or anything else that might to warrant\nA that kind of a of a need so\nUh we'll see here a little while we're going to talk with meteorology if a John trout or get caught up on this latest update from the national Hurricane Center\nAre meteorologist Tom hale was with us about a half hour ago and we were talking about this in fact he predicted that it would become officially a category for hurricane but Michael or will be officially the strongest hurricane to ever hit\nAnd so we have uh the the latest uh in the Indiana Senate brown versus a a Donnelly a Donnelly not vote for a Kavanaugh\nAnd ... he was up by a by three at the end of August the Fox news poll nine twenty nine to ten to has Donnelly up by two well within the margin of error three point to a five percent\nOr and now they have there are three of a different candidates are in this race including them\nIncluding the libertarian yeah so uh but right now it's forty three forty one or a you know Donald with the lead but uh again excuse me a yes Donnelly with the the lead the Democrats in there but then again that really you look at that that is another a dead heat that exist out there and then we go to Missouri\nAnd uh the uh latest Fox News poll nine twenty nine to tend to and that is a dead tied up that is before the actual vote took place\nAnd before colon speech and everything else so that's the kind of thing that we're looking for the polls coming out of it may be here in the next couple of days or early next week and as we get closer\nTo see the effect of that that has had there there are a ton of these races that are a statistical tie with even in a statistical tie\nDemocrats maybe up a point or two and a and so this is something that I'm sure as being very carefully watched\nAnd again when you go into and I were not pollsters you know we're not pollsters we can read them but I mean the methodology\nOf of each and every poll has different nuances and it\nIt all depends on you know what the sample is do they interview more Democrats than actually are in a you know that normally vote in a particular race or not or did they over sample Republicans\nFight and and so you look at it but overall when you look at at the the generalized polls are a ton of the Senate races that are extremely close and so\nA lot of eyes are watching to see okay what's the excitement level of going to be the voter excitement level\nOut of the cabin on hearing which I Do believe will have an impact sure\nYeah and so there's a ... right now looking at some of the the the Senate races\nUp uh you you look at the the race with Rick Scott it's interesting dynamic and and and frankly hurricane\nMichael a and how it's handled will be part of that discussion and campaigning\nOn both sides uh uh you know for the next few weeks um it it may seem like an unfortunate situation to many but that's that's how politics runs in the ... the United states and it may it can make or break a candidate depending on how it's handled and while you know a senator or isn't going to have\nA control if he were to become a senator or over what's going on in that state necessarily\nUm ... like a governor ... during an emergency situation\nHow he handles it will be closely watched over the next few days because it's going to be it's going to be a very politically sensitive situation I'm sure a many from his capital tell you what were not focused on that right now nor should they be but people outside that a camp car focused on that\nAnd we'll be altered the reality is that if\nFlorence was handled properly by\nThe Trump Administration Democrats would be using ... yes ... and you'd end up being that is used in political races yes and and as you and I talked about from the very beginning and I watched a lot more of the of of Florence are coming in than I have so far of of this particular race\nBut when you watch the weather channel you came across with the great opinion of the federal government and how they were how they were handling it yes it'll be interesting to see if the same thing happens you know here because it will be used yes no

you've lost when you go oh why you [laughter]\nI mean conservatives or Republicans it is going to absolutely motivate them I was actually\nA on line and and I was seeing a number of people that we're talking about early voting you know here's where to find out where early where the when the early voting starts in your area\nThat means they're chomping at the bit now we don't make predictions but we know right now both sides are motivated the question is which side as motivated more and historically where's that greater turnout did did you see the NBC\nReporter went to college in California ... and there's like thirty people waiting for a bus at a college all young people and all of them sitting right there and he said is anybody voting yeah in the right term not one person raised their

the rational things in the Russian busted ah we don't even know what's going on we don't know tension of that stuff that out I mean it was it was ... it was really really interesting but\nI I guess the point I think about this now because Hillary now coming to board as we said with\nWith everything that went on the insanity from the mainstream of the Democratic party now that the mainstream the Democratic party thinks it's okay to say due process doesn't matter that Hillary can jump aboard and say a civility no it's gone too we take over ... not to be civil bogus civility when we get our way right right we're not we're not we're not going to be civil\nAnd and think about what it's about now you're not simple because you believe in what\nDue process and\nA presumption of innocence ... that you look at any case a political case a civil case or a criminal case and you judge it by what the evidence that exists\nBecause you believe that that's where it's all coalescing now it's ... it's it's getting right to that point now that you believe that you may never be treated civil again\nWill find you wherever you are you for that call already wind or wherever you are well stocked you wherever you are at your restaurant at your home nothing is off limits why because you believe in due process\nAnd you believe that's going to change people that believe and due process under the law

you're a budget and it didn't you believe that's going to change the opposition best it's going to do the exact opposite yours don't fit people for thinking that yes you are\nAnd by the way please keep it up and thank you Hillary who by the way her version of due process is to\nGive money to her lawyers Perkins ... so they can hire fusion GPS so they can hire Christopher Steele to go get salacious and ... verified information on her opposition her opponents in twenty sixteen and then have her friends in the Justice Department use it\nTo get a warrant on somebody in her opponent's campaign back due process for Hillary Clinton by the way how did that work out for her\nIt did there was always a twenty percent chance she was ...\nI mean that's that's really the thing that's come out of ... out of all this ... is the defense now I've been civility for those two to attack and go after those people to wherever where they are in their personal lives because they believe in due process under the law and that thoughts but in my head since last week thinking\nThey think there's going to be effective yeah but who whose mind I think they're going to change their not going to change the people watching the TV who see somebody eating dinner and you get in their face ...\nDon't want to leave 'em alone let let let them eat their you know the the average independent who you're trying to convince them to know that's that's a that's ridiculous Hillary calling for instability well we're only going to be civil if we get our way right [laughter] Yeah John McCain you hear this
