was China which oh by the way Jeff Bezos holy cow Jeff\nBezos step to the plate tell you about that in the moment per se I wanted to wipe lottery she's amazing number one she puts up with me and just

because it'd be much better for I don't know\nChina before mentioned there from Nikki Haley to step in and and filled that void I'm sure that would work out in our best interest of the long run\nJeff Bezos Jeff Bezos stepped up to the point today and said that we need American companies to be doing those fields and that will be much worse off if they're not\nA man Jeff Bezos finally said what ...

you you got some work to do in Jersey oh let's go to a liberal man in Arizona not happy with what's going on in North Dakota ailing\nOh I'm not liberal I have always been on both sides of the fence and on and play with the tenth and sounding egotistical you should have somebody called me back and let you let me tell you my entire story but in order to cut it short\nA very quickly I didn't vote for Obama I uh I'm I'm totally believe in gay rights I Believe in freedom of religion I fully believe that a woman's right to a woman's right to choose [noise]\nI'm I'm Down the line I but I have always then I never had come to what anybody tells me without my own thought process behind it good and so I Am the absolute I Am that moderate\nThat everybody wanted me over to the other side we can\nCome in you know I mean those are very social liberal values\nHowever I'm off on this malignant most of my adult life\nAnd I voted for something here because yeah you can do whatever you want to be I didn't have to pay for it\nTo them you're going on and and watching\nThe ... thing and yes I Am a pet that you're not making that bigger deal over that Heidi Heitkamp breaking campaign ad that just came out and in North Dakota because that is I ... I did I mention I'm also but I Am a true fact so if you take them with documentation ...\nOr how moderate that everybody wants to pull over\nUnfortunately at this point I'm going to tell you trade up\nIf my kid I don't care who called that fifty here all my kids have to hit on a table and get into a you know a book to stop abortion or God Forbid you have to round out than starting to get it again and put my friends in a camp\nI Am all for it and put that right ... ... right wing guy in there and do that\nBecause the point I feel that I have a better can converting them over to my crew value movie quicker everything we can go to get everything I guess bad because they were all Democratic Party\nAnd what they I mean he only had found them leaving there by may ... the way that makes me on hold and my idea my idea is that I Believe that\nThen you are you raise a number of interesting points and it sounds like you have been very much politically involved in the ... over a long window of time\nThat you're not a typical from a lot of likely Trump voters and even the ... is typical because I'm not sure the delineation between conservatives versus Republicans versus moderate it's really hard anymore with labels\nBut what I Will say and I see there's a lot with especially younger Republican ask voters\nWe're basically describing is that you are a social liberal but fiscally conservative and ultimately is how do you want your government to be run now and the grand scheme of things if we're talking about the values that you just represented as Donald Trump\nLikely to strip any of those potential\nThose potential rights ... from any of the the aforementioned now is Donald Trump going to be the guy to to try to to push for the elimination of of gay marriage no he's not\nA for that matter he is even told justice to stand down when it comes to marijuana enforcement there he's not the most conservative guy I mean take a look at his own personal life it tells us much so you do have a lot of fiscal conservatives are getting an idea you know I'm I'm a little bit of a quandary\nPolitically myself I you know don't generally talk about it quite this way but\nI personally am quite conservative and when it comes to social values I live my life as kind of like a half assed Catholic and I said I was a good Catholic wouldn't be throws all want to be honest so and I got to have as Catholic but I you know I it here too that that kind of value system for so for example\nYou know personally I'm pro life\nBut I Believe in a libertarian form of government so when it comes to social issues I Am more inclined to get the government the way for example I don't think the government should be involved at all in marriage why is it that the government dictates marriage why is it that the tax code has ever delineated\nBased upon one marital status we've created so many issues so many issues that way\nThey didn't have to be created because we've put government into the mix\nSo I Am inclined or you know it's like with marijuana a lot of people think that uh you know because I I Will rail against it like we have you know medical marijuana legalized in Florida which a lot of states do and you have the recreational use and several more said oh rail against it and and people are just anti marijuana what no I'm not\nI don't care it's about your crap as long as you keep it away from me and don't hurt anybody my issue is that it's not legal you know I I Believe again and the premise and so in the case of something like marijuana well\nIt needs to be either legalize whereas a minimum decriminalize by the federal government otherwise all we're doing and all these states\nLike mine is diamond our nose at the United States Constitution it doesn't work that way and that's the reason that we get all this kind of horse craft stuff going on where you can't use the financial system and it creates a whole host of problems under that and you have doctors that will go\nYou know given like a wink and a not because you can't actually is you a prescription because oh by the way you're trying to issue guidance\nOn a schedule one drug so again that is I I think where you're coming from\nMore of a position that is prevalent within a Trump supporter but even maybe even a young younger\nUh is the Republican ask again voters for the lack of a better label and certainly I think people who are constitutional as so anyway ah my my heart goes out to you for having been a victim best to you and your family a endemic God Bless\nAnd by the way for Heitkamp in North Dakota\nI mean come on even the high camp in North Dakota ... you're you're talking about a state that Trump won by thirty six points and her she's voted with Donald Trump approximately forty percent of the time and I mean ... ... exactly line up with the north Dakota values\nI mean I I don't know what Taylor Swift per se but just like\nI'm mud in for the great one\nHave you ever thought about the word education will it mean to to lead forth the word fourth raises another question which way is fourth how do you know you're going in the right direction easy

the better later on even though I thought they were asked me when we'd get rid of a Trump\nAnd minority leader Pelosi said it's not a priority now unless something else comes forward\nBut of course

I'm very that by that\nBrain marina among our side you may not you may not know this but Ronald Reagan would never go to White House I mean the oval office without a jacket and tie on so you and I are in sync who's your choice did you say ready who your choice was for dinner and you don't do\nIt gave me Joe fighting but what about that Kennedy boy I like that little Kennedy boy he spoke will well um I don't know what he's\nSaying wait wait sounds so nice I I get a challenge you aren't you I you don't know there's been a few years ago on national radio I say let's make a deal no more Kennedy's ... bushes that we have over three hundred thirty million people can't we find someone whose name is not kosher Kennedy so would you give me that I don't want the Kennedys were done [laughter]\nGive

[laughter]\nYeah but you're not wait you're not running for president [laughter] so ah a dollar Brian ... you're a list and Brian if you listen to me enough\nI think I could move over to my side a

you shouldn't go to the ... office like Kanye West in you know you don't talk to prison for ten minutes this guy's got values more values and kind of a kind of us did obviously yeah I agree with that and of course we\nWe know some of the stuff that's gone on in the oval office that's why I mentioned President Reagan wouldn't walk in there without his suit and tie and I've learned on not always great at his though I ... in much as you guys who are Democrats can't stand a Donald Trump or George Bush for that matter I felt the same way about a bomb but I Know I've learned\nIf he walked in the room you give credit to the office of the president United States and you stand up to like him\nAnd I didn't I couldn't wait for him to get out of office but that's part of the respect\nNow here's the next call I we have time though yeah we have time let's go to a gym in Dallas Jim you're on with mark\nMartin\nWell oh\nOkay yeah I mean I live in a I'd like to throw out this idea I'm not because they have a chance of winning but just because if they really fun during the debates that'd be Michael Moore\n[laughter] he's a character though [laughter] I Know that he and he\nAnd Trump would just go out of the Arab guy and I thought they would be great that you and pain or I'm worth anything but I just I I like the vice we'll be right\nYou you may not have heard this story that this is true he's on tape and we had him on tape on my or the other show I work on a they sent him one day okay you don't like capitalism also what system would you replace it with any I'm paraphrasing he said something like when we haven't found yet found yet\nHe just knows half as there was no good buddy yeah what do you mean you have valley yeah you got to replace something was you know nothing [laughter] I I like you know now you're getting in the spirit some you guys getting the spirit a when you suggest luckily I\nGot one more thing real quick sure yeah [noise] uh if\nIf we're going to investigate a president Shaw whatever is a Saudi Arabia why can't why don't we go in and look at all those mysterious deaths of the associates of Hillary Clinton I don't really like to find out is that just go watch this or is there something more to it\nWhat's his name and I have a friend who writes about this all the time you know I mean the guy in the Clinton Administration that supposedly Vince Foster\nA he writes this guy no uh he writes all the time there's a lot of Mr stuff that went on with Vince Foster of course an ad by the way life is funny did you guys know the Kavanaugh was a part of that investigation some way\nOr do you know his life funny how it works the you know the the circle gets filled or whatever you want to say\nWell it's just it's not just best officer I say a list of dozens of people that were so it's a the Clintons especially Hillary's and just was seriously or ... or their demise\n... these are the bill Hillary have cared there's a lot of stuff happened in our so you are right now that I'm being serious about it a people met their unfortunate demise and these people would step over any but I heard the story I had him on my TV show I had a television show and I think I remember his name Laurie Patterson\nHe was one of the state troopers that guarded or Bill Clinton all and he said well and he said that when he would be in the car with Bill Clinton and someone would be in the back seat and they'd say you know a governor really want that to be like a commissioner in your in ministry and do it said in that will cost you fifty thousand dollars\nAnd he said to me ... that many weeks or months later someone else would ask the same commission and so that'll be fifty thousand dollars these guys were out for power and money it ... it was something that oh yeah\nUh yeah Clinton Foundation\nJust to do I mean they just they write the catalyst millions and that but\nYou are you kidding me they did it because she's such a great speaker and Chelsea's agreed speaker was found an old half a million dollars to speak I think I Would take a little bit less [laughter] people that I Do print out but I don't get anywhere near that I'm quitting their job and I work for the Clinton Foundation [laughter]\nIt was just a ... that's all that was yeah that was a Jim thanks for the call appreciate it very much ... appreciate it but\nI kinda liked that Michael Moore can you measure Michael Moore and Donald Trump well that's part of the problem and I'm going to get to your calls that there are a lot of people who are running or water run\nBut there's no one outstanding now yeah Biden's got the name and if Hillary around again of course she has the name\nWhat does no one else standing now you could say well neither was Donald Trump right none of us expected it I Can't say none of us I certainly didn't expect him to get the nomination let alone when I thought he was down at the bottom that the I said a case it was worse than him I couldn't stand John Case but\nI I liked what he said my son is in the way this guy could win so you never know could get some unexpected let me know what you think eight six six Ninety rent that's eight six six nine
