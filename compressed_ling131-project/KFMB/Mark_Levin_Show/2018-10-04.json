I think you have a realization from a lot of people that don't like Trump yeah\nAnd don't like where the Republican Party is going where they've realized\nA we've got to come home for a while because those people are insane I Know a case you're Cortez yesterday said\nThe writers insane or we'll go through whether she actually had any substance to that but when we talked about the many things out there when you see what what are the left is doing to Kavanaugh when you see the presumption of innocence is\nInnocence is is gone when an allegation itself is enough to destroy someone's life this goes beyond a political issue it goes to what one Trump the election it is\nBut it is the culture war but it's also ... and and I say a culture where because it's a war on it it's it's about it's about fairness it's about the belief in the constitution look\nWe don't we were never tremors we've criticized Trump but we were you know we were never on that never never got about ... we voted for ... you and I don't practice political high dollar tree we don't worship anybody you're\nNot going to see us at rallies going ra ra ra whatever my candidate does we will tell you who was the ... well you know who has the best idea on what particular issue and why\nAnd we ended up voting for the person who most reflects what we believe not everything that we believe because that would be impossible as and as adults will see that with ... [laughter] I mean we don't really go for air as I read\nRick Perry and one of his was one of his first interviews after dropping out of the elections when he was like seeing you know well uh you know I guess he wasn't your first choice they told the interviewer will know my first choice was me [laughter]\nAnd and so I I think when when you see that\nThat ... it it's just been it's been brought back to many of these number Trump or is going on and many of them who started making alliances with people on the west to you know trying to build these emotional as I saw on social media from some of the people but I Know that are number Trump hers but all of a sudden the brakes have been put ongoing whoa you'd really do this\nI mean you really ... this is what you really we wow\nWhat will you know we thought you know this is an almost like the McCain funeral well we thought that there were actually people out there in the Democrats' side but I don't want it to come together to find the common ground that we have and now the realization is no they don't and I think a lot of people this is a wakeup call\nLook the party isn't perfect if you listen to the show you know when we talk about the Republican Party or a or listen to the pocket from yesterday show [laughter] but the the the party isn't perfect but again everything's\nWhen you get to this point to the actual election it's a binary choice mhm it's a choice between this group in that group neither perfect so what do you do you look for the best one and I think that's what a lot of\nUh never Trump or looking at right now saying\nWhoa ... know who you know when when um oh who was it a try to think of the the the the person oh yeah yeah it was ... was Glenn Beck who said he couldn't vote for Trump rather vote for Hillary correct yeah ah\nI thought this would because I I I saw that a a Shapiro interviewed him or he interviewed Shapiro or something like that and I saw it on social media and a lotta people furious St excuse me he said don't vote for Trump vote for Hillary and and that kind of you know that kind of thought process doesn't exist right now well except for Bill Kristol\nA and and those that are Jonathan as a ... there at a music on Fox News on the\nOn the the the money block and I think Fox businesses as well he was one of those\nOtherwise conservatives that what came out with the I'm

close races and there's no one you're talking about a blue wave in the Senate so you have to assume that McConnell still going to be in place\nUh in the new year but the point being a Democrat doesn't want to go out and blatantly violate\nThat rule ah because they know internally that's going to create a lot of problems for them going forward\nI'm not saying they won't do it but but uh there's a huge disincentive for them to to to do that\nBut you probably could see them saying look\n... and it it's going to be that it's already this from the liberal media or NBC News on on Wednesday\nWell there are dozens of people dozens of people I think they said over forty people\nThat have said that that that have ah have information at potentially they could be witnesses that's one of the words they use potentially and their story or that that could help substantiate all these claims and blah blah blah\nThat's not how this works they don't get to control that but the but nonetheless that will be the narrative and you'll probably see a couple of senators or during the day on Thursday or friday more likely on friday as they try and hold up an elevator doors open\nThey're going to try and and block they're saying this was not enough the the we need of a greater background check they did an interview enough people uh they didn't talk to Ford or\nThere's new allegations that are coming out yeah uh that are uncorroborated too so we need to investigate them since there is no cooperation we need to find the ...\nMean it's going to go down to the ... but I I I Do believe that because the uh Republicans most likely want to abide by the rule that Democrats will do everything they can\nTo claim for example is Adam Schiff has done all along and Adam Schiff ... not on this but Adam ships as we will be talking about\nUh the whole of Russian collusion investigation coming up in the bomb shell\nOr out of a of out of DC uh yesterday about the James Baker ... uh uh apparently telling the house or the house uh uh I don't know which paddling was but uh in in test closed door testimony yesterday telling them he talked to the Democrats\nSo the Democrat the Democratic national committee's lawyers right before they got the warrant right and and and James Baker top FBI if they show a at that time which without question shows the politics played apart and he talked to them about\nWhat was going on me talk to the DNC lawyers about the Trump Russia collusion investigation that was going on which is at some loop Lee the wrong thing to do right now you cannot nobody can defend that\nIn an investigation so it's getting to where you and I asked questions over a year and a half ago\nIs this where this is going and we ... you know what I'm saying is every question that we asked about where this where what might have happened here and what they might be investigating every single thing that we asked the question on\nHas come true it is it's all come out in a in a series of reports\nYou know if you look at it if it were well at least it's it's there has been people the media has looked into those questions I guess we could say right um that well first of all one of the first questions the big question really was there a potentially is there\nAre we looking at possibly a gross abuse of power under the previous administration\nThat that uh a person or persons knowingly used false information to which is a the Giuliani pointed out\nYou know there's a there you have it there's your your your perjury um but they they in soliciting for that or Pfizer court warrant\nAnd we'll get to that coming up following of the top of the hour my point that Adam shifted So Adam Schiff\nHas claimed for the longest time that there is collusion their ... and since we can see it he's able to claim that there's collusion and other feeling the Democrats do the same thing here claim that there is evidence yeah you know in this because the Republicans won't release it so they won't release or do they know the Republicans won't release of because Republicans\nYou know or if you are in the in the Senate want to keep\nA this ruling affect that hey we can't be ... every background check we do have every jot ... of every judge we're not going to do that\nAnd so I Believe they'll use it to their advantage and may force the Republicans to release it here\nAnd the next couple of days I Believe that will be one of the tactics that we will see tomorrow I Wish you and I could finish the show here\nIn the next twenty minutes and we could just repeat the ... the first two hours the rest of the show go home get some sleep and then wake up at seven AM [laughter] so we can be up all day tomorrow because I really don't want to miss any of what's going to be going on but in the ... I really think that\nYou may see that let's head right do you go to mark his in Virginia Marcus welcome you're on run I Radio Welcome to the show Hi\nHow're you doing [laughter] hey I just short you are saying Adam Schiff should be investigated I think he's been a leak in the old time he may into [noise]\nThat I Know yes I mean well I don't know if you ask for it right we all believe yes I mean I grew up in a a whole family a Democrat my whole life and even even my father lifelong Democrat my sister my brother and all everybody [noise]\nThey're they're like totally disgusted with what has happened with the Democrat Party there I mean I don't think it's going to last I mean they they uh overplay their hand well they went off the rails said\nThey did but keep in mind Marcus and and and thank you for the call we all share some\nBig big old there hey my I got two kids say college fake socialism should greatest thing in the world\nOh sure and and that's what's going to keep the insanity alive that's why it's not really there I don't see them coming back from where they are a because this is now the mainstream the mainstream has to follow look [laughter] uh it doesn't matter uh who was a protester is or what the causes\nThe party the protestors the far left now leads the party they lead the media they're very active in the media [laughter] they're part of the media you know that's what the ah you\nKnow they were saying former CNN officials or or or management including Ted Turner are saying they become a CNN's become too\nPolitical and Jeff Greenfield coming out saying who used to run CNN coming out saying you know it's these the people at CNN believe they are part of the anti Trump resistance their activists as we've we've known for a while but\nThis is not going to change it's not going to end they're not going to they may have overplay their hand here but what they'll tell you is we didn't do enough\nBut they'll tell you is we didn't ramp up\nEnough and even if he's confirmed this weekend and we move on from this don't believe that they're empowered\nBecause they at least got the delay got they got they got the supplemental background check done and all of that they put the pressure on Trump and and they were able to manipulate Trump and the Republicans although it's Jeff Flake and that's that's going to\nBe around it but on the or the other side they're going to know or that they're in they're in trouble because you because at the Supreme Court at this point then you have\nA a five four maybe not on everything that would be viewed as originalist store construction as doors they call it conservative which would I think is mislabeled and all that but they will uh are you know it's going to it they know\nThat if Trump is reelected in twenty twenty that's why I think they're going to go up up the insanity\nOr whether they win or lose any seats or whether they take over the house yeah or whatever there is going to be pure insanity from now till twenty twenty because they know that if there's it between now and twenty twenty if there is a Supreme Court a seat that opens\nI we've seen how insane it's been now where they're promoting the fact that there is no presumption of innocence right huh why I mean this is where they are right now so far where they go\nWho knows but they don't they get I Can't I don't think they can imagine Trump being president until twenty twenty four because then there's a possibility of more Supreme Court seats that was your civil they moderate their message in order to maybe be able to win or will they just up the insanity for the next two\nYears yeah the uh the Trojan Horse or a\nTactic oh we'll just moved to the middle a little bit in order to gain power right what does what they used to do\nThat's what I said they pretend to move to a middle [laughter] exactly you paid six six nine the right I [noise]\nA book read are ready to do with a record ... tomorrow [noise]\nYou have driven over one million preventable accident free miles than registered to joined the million mile club on line that red eye radio show dot com read I read it", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "04"}
