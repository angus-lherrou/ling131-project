are crossing our border illegally and demanding to stay here it has nothing to do with path to citizenship for people who are already here it has nothing to do with visas it has nothing to do with comprehensive anything\nAnd if you and if your solution for these people who are crossing our country illegally and want to stay here in demand to be in our country\nIf your solution is tied to all

defamation lawsuit this week\nSuing the DNC and ... with this law firm for defamation now think about this from it [noise] Carter Page is either\nAn agent with the Russian government and basically participated in a subversive if not outright treasonous acts against our nation\nDuring the twenty sixteen presidential election or he is an innocent American citizen who has been signed and slandered into famed and used as a tool for political purposes not just by the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign but ultimately by the Justice Department and the Obama administration [noise]\nHe's got to be one of the other right\nThere is no in between here there's no if an or certainly no but I mean if there was a button hero it'd be a car Daschle and proportions [noise]\nCarter Page is either as stool a a a sorry a stew age of the pollutant Kremlin\nFor he is completely innocent and and you know I don't know if you know a lot about Carter Page I guess it hasn't done a lot of a media he's a Naval Academy graduate\nHe was a navy officer as all Naval Academy graduates are unless they're you know pro athletes [noise]\nHe was in intelligence in the navy and an officer in the intelligence division which you know usually you've got some hurdles that you have to cross to get into\nMilitary intelligence in the United States Navy as an officer [noise] um and after serving his time well beyond his obligated time as an officer after he got his a Naval Academy education\nHe then went into private business and did went into the energy sector he got his doctorate by the way he is about ... noticed that you can't say Christine Blasey Ford's name without saying Dr Ford but one of the last time they said Dr Carter Page he's a doctor he got his doctorate [noise]\nAnd he didn't do dealings with energy sectors out of Russia you can argue with that if you want but understand most of his dealings were in the house in days when Hillary Clinton had a reset button when Bill Clinton was pulling down six figures for giving a speech in Moscow\nAnd when a rock Obama was promising his counterpart there that he'd have more flexibility after he got rid of this ah this Mitt Romney guy and won reelection\nSo it was a different time it was a different era it was okay to do business with Moscow now he's still thinks it's a good idea to do business with Moscow he actually doesn't think the government is as bad as everyone says\nThat's what that's not a legal he he can do that in fact it's not illegal for a business to do business with Moscow as right now as we speak\nYou know sanctions and in a in a huge way against that government their individual sanctions against individuals but uh businesses can still do but we\nWe still do business with Moscow\nYou may disagree but guess what he has the right to do that that doesn't make them a spy it doesn't make him a Russian agent now he could be don't misunderstand my point here Carter Page\nCould very well be an agent of the Russian government as the FBI maintained based on the Russian dot CA paid for by the DNC and this law firm that Carter Page is now suing but ask yourself something as you evaluate the story as you use your cognitive skills\nYour reasoning the brain that the good lord gave you\nAs you evaluate this story that has presented to you that the FBI and the Obama administration said Carter Page was an agent of the Russian government and has been for years and worked on behalf of the Kremlin and Vladimir prudent to colluded with Donald Trump to meddle in the twenties sixteen presidential election as they say that\n[noise] understand to facts number one\nTo this day no one has charged Carter Page with anything not James Comey not Loretta Lynch\nNot Jeff Sessions not Rod Rosenstein\nNo one at the federal level no one at the local level now one of the state level Carter Page has not\nBeen charged with a crime of any kind and they have sort of veiled every inch of his whole life\nFor almost two years they've got everything on him no charges number one so so think about that for a minute and then think about this if you're Carter Page\nAnd you are an age into the Russian government and you did commit near treason effects\nBy colluding with the Trump campaign and let him or pollutants Kremlin to alter our presidential election and twenty sixteen if if that\nWere true why would you file a lawsuit why would you file a defamation\nLawsuit against the DNC because you see the perfect is that the DNC can defend themselves and get out of this lawsuit\nWith one very simple strategy it's only defamation if it isn't true so\nAll they got to do is proof that Carter Page is in fact an agent of the Russian government and if you're Carter Page why would you invite that why would you open yourself up to discovery why would you open yourself up to a full court well funded\nAnd you know there's going to be a lot of money funding their defense all well funded investigation\nThe first

a great time talking with you the last couple of days and I look forward to the next two days and Jerry and Eric is actually the Sunday night Monday morning\nI could easily get used to filling in for them especially because you've been so gracious to me and you're kind comments about my work and you can keep in touch with me and see where I Am on the air next on my Web page to Mark I'm slow show dot com where you can email me following me on Facebook or Twitter or leave me a message with a question or comment that I can respond to\nAfter this week I'll next beyond October twenty ninth on another show but again check that out on my Web page there are a number of topics I said I Would get to tonight's I Want to keep my word first I Want to talk to you about illegal immigration\nI've been talking about this for over ten years now in the air doesn't mean I didn't think about this Twenty years ago and so on but I never wavered in my position the issue and you guys were bringing up the last few days so I thought I Would focus on on the first segment at least and see your response\nThe issue is really not that difficult if you'd knowledge the simple fact that people who cross the border illegally have come here legally which is why those on the other side do not want to call\nThem illegal immigrants let alone it illegal aliens one of the college last night said you know markets illegal aliens forget it\nSo you have the term occupation an undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents as if they miss place them somewhere or loss\nBecause if you acknowledge their coming here legally the argument might be quickly over if they are legal they're not allowed to be here and store in another caller said that why you know why is this going on it's pretty simple\nSo as an example if you own a home and someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in they wouldn't be able to say they wanted your home to go into your home but they just lack the proper documents\nSimilarly if someone walks in tears to your bank and wants to take the money out of your account right\nThey would be asked to prove that it's their account\nIf they said it was their accounts they just tend to have the documents to prove in the bank would not permit them access it's not obvious\nWhich is why it's so ludicrous for the left to use the phrase undocumented is is that can have your house and bank account if only they could find the misplaced documents for years now I've said the left is one of the argument over language\nBut how about they not be allowed to come or in the first place and we wouldn't need to care if they cooperated with authorities isn't that obvious how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes that native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate watch this to the evil police officers at ice who have the audacity to arrest people commit crimes that said these guys are really clever on the left so the rest of us live with long lines at hospitals through reading schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities\nWith long lines at hospitals ... schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities so what's my solution\nYou take away the benefits like free health care and free schools to enforce strict penalties against businesses that hire illegals even sending some CEO to jail you say the first CEO to jail for hiring an illegal immigrant and it'll never happen again\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home\nRun he actually had a right to use the wrong language suffer when we go again would language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I wouldn't say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there are no bad if I take it back not everybody a lot would leave and that's what's happened during the recession a lot we leave there are no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs leave\nWe but I Would say that those who remain that's the point I Want to make I'd be willing to have a conversation about with them because they'd be saying for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake enough for the government sending out the wrong message message with actions like legal education classes I'm a teacher I Know or bilingual government documents\nA country is United by language and it's shared
