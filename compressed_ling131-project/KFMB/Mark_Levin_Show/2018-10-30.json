an intellectual discussion you know days like yesterday\n\nI Will admit it at times I have to [laughter] hold back on the frustration as to where the narrative is going because I Know what you and I

give people a reason to vote for you not a reason just to vote against someone else\nDemocrats think they have a good chance of retaking the house majority despite problems given the fact that they're voting base is fired up or to send a message to Trump polls tightened however and there is recognition that Trump has started to fire up his own base the narrow path\nThe Democrats won software that Senate majority has largely disappeared ... in terms of the Democratic party having even a semblance of a message it's just not there and that's the reason this election is going to be unpredictable

time it is the failure of the Republican Party mhm\nUh also coming up we will get to ... and by the way to repay there is a Republican Party because it's what the Republican\nRank and file want ... they don't care about the debt the voter the Republican voter right doesn't care about the debt anymore that's why the Republicans have done this but we'll get to that plus we'll hear from the rabbi of the Pittsburgh send a God the tree of life the synagogue was on CNN last night\nAnd you'll see how Ellison camera to try to steer him in the direction because what they're hoping forced to get him to blame Trump right why not blame the the the Democrats and their associates with Barrett God ...\nAround the president of the United states has always flotsam I'm\nI'm a citizen he's my president he's certainly welcome\n\nIt only we talked about this yesterday by the way the could or any of these anchors to find their definition of hate\nRight you know that's what it comes down to is that um the as as if it's one sided ... when they call the president you know a hateful\nAnd they talk about the divisiveness or in the moments we mean moments after such a tragedy\nThey themselves are being divisive\nIn in a while I don't know I don't I I think a lot of them are driven by by their debt own definition of hey that's what I mean\nThere that's on full display is it not\nI guess define hate for me\nOr you just hate all the time somebody defined because I don't know what we're number we change the definition of boards all the time mhm so I don't know what the definition of the word hate is now from the the mainstream media\nWhat's what's what's the definition mhm [laughter] well and I think that that right now it's it is clear attempt to position time and time again\nThis president or Republicans are and they've been doing it for I don't know how many years now as people who are evil and and film was hey\n\nI did it from from from day one with this president you know if we can't get\nThrough with the uh ... with the Russian collusion\nThing will just move on to just hey el wake advantage of ... in order to do when when you when you accuse of of a president\nOf in you know committing a treasonous act of colluding with the Russians to hack the election for two years and then you drop it without an apology\nWhat does that based on\nDefinition and paid for Merriam Webster and intense hostility and a version usually driving from pure anger or sense of injury\nExtreme dislike or discussed\nOr a systematic and especially politically exploited expression of hatred\nWhat about evil\nThe rent I talked about evil ... to the mainstream media to talk about evil does evil exist does good exist because now we're getting into the arena of religion and God\n\nAre they religious people do they believe in it define a hate defy the I here's I guess here's my point I Believe that a lot of the mainstream media\nOr come from this at a sick from a secular point of view mhm you notice when they talked to somebody like the rabbi oh that's a very good thing that there is no debate going on and I wouldn't even want to have this discussion about black to them I Believe it's blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah but when you invite the president right it's like you're not giving me the answer I Want you know well\nWhat what about the president but as a president invited the will of course the president ... ... why would you even ask that question\nSteve because the problem is is that the liberal media and and liberals in general it doesn't help them to separate\nThe two the rabbi making the point that this is not political right that that this kind of hatred is is\nIn all of us so the point being is that it can be there can be a number of different motives and it it's not about the American political landscape it's not it's about somebody\nWho has evil in their heart that wants to take the lives of others we're not talking about someone who is\nJust shouting at people we're not talking about someone who just decided that they were going to show up on the on the steps of the synagogue and and protest\nAgainst people of the Jewish faith\nThis person decided to go in and take multiple lied\nTrump's fault must be Trump's fault\nIt to me it's so disgraceful I think about\nThe family and that better than than leaving right now and then then the point and will play Sanders coming up a little bit Jim Acosta no see you're calling us take this we didn't say that he's directly responsible for it\n[laughter] because because this is them not going to fool measure wanting you to the\nBreak it's long like he was ... but then stepping back on uh we didn't do that we ... we didn't say he committed or he's directly responsible what are you saying that\nRight\nBecause if you're if you're trying to make the point that anything that Trump has said and I don't know what Trump is set about Jews that would be viewed as negative all I Know is that when it comes\nTo the Jewish faith tell me a bigger supporter of Israel than Donald Trump I haven't gosh how far do we have to go back and looms oppressive look when you when you go to the un I'll play the audio kept coming up here I'll find it didn't get a chest plate yesterday but\nI'm from Alan Dershowitz it goes right after the Democrats for having such a cozy relationship with Louis Farrakhan right and that's okay that's just come rightfully league glossed over from ... exactly it's from from from Obama Clinton and as if it doesn't exist and that's why I brought up earlier\nThat if you're going to bring politics into it you got you cannot\nWithout being biased and and this is where\nOr when we look at the media we say you want to see the bias there it is right there how come they're not asking a former President Obama\nShould stay away from Pittsburgh why shouldn't that being said\nWell because he look listen to the description\nOr adjust real simple from ... both Farrah Khan formerly known as Louis acts as an American religious leader black nationalist activist and social commentator that's how he's described\n\nYou're black nationalist activist and social commentator that's how he's described\n\nThey'll tell you that he's a an activist that's the word\nThey use have you're listening to the things he said\nHe doesn't have hate in his heart\nAnd and I know that fine meeting with Farrah Khan is fine Trump is the proper hairs are again\nOne of the most well known or a\nJewish attorneys in America Alan Dershowitz there can't be any tolerance we have to zero tolerance President Obama meets with Derek ... shame on him President Clinton since at the same platform ... Khan shame on him Keith Ellison joins with ferret cod\nValid Farrah Khan is one of the greatest purveyor of anti Semitic eight just because he's black doesn't give them a pass an anti Semitism and any liberal who has any positive association with Farrah Khan is part of the problem not part of the solution right\nThat is completely lost and CNN\nBut you're going to say\nBecause if you got to what has what has Trump said the tent I somebody\nWho is Trump met with on a higher level who is anti Semitic\nWell some people that that that's crap some people there are some people that listen to the show that I guarantee I don't agree with their philosophy\n\nBecause some people support you because some people listen to you does not mean that you have universal agreement on them or doesn't mean\nThat you can't find ... ... as it happened to you you find somebody who comes up and says I listen to your short really love it and they start talking you're like why do you listen to me ... I Love the show and everything else that I agree with you on so much\nAnd you find out they're completely don't have the ... you know and you tell them to their ... look [laughter]\nDon't associate with me\nSo that to a few people in my career Dona you're not me I have no idea where you ever got you know that you point\nBut the fact is you're talking about one of the leaders of anti Semitism in the United states with Farrah Khan and high echelon Democrats have had no problem\nMeeting with him over the last few decades no no problem at all no if CNN can't see it that's where\nWhen Trump looks at by the way she used to it yesterday or the way I said his Trump said\nI said fake news as the enemy of the people ... it was I didn't I Know that all news isn't the enemy of the people but all", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "30"}
