it's interesting because I've been questioning the methodology\nA and I mean just not that I doubt the methodology I'd just have some questions about the methodology and what's going on with the way the but five thirty eight dot com is putting together they're basically a composition type poll based on all the polls\nAh in all the districts are for the house seats it's interesting to look at it but I'm not so sure that I buy that well as of right now it's roughly Seventy five percent chance that the Democrats take the house\nUm that may be the case I'm just asking about I have\nActual questions about the methodology and how they're applying it to this big scale I'm very smart people at five thirty eight dot com\nOr so but I Do wonder about again the polls they're using I'm a

in other news of this from the hill dot com this was breaking news yesterday afternoon and uh yesterday evening congressional investigators have confirmed but a top FBI official this is from the hill and John Solomon congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election and right before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign mhm\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met\nDuring the twenty six teams season with at least one attorney from Perkins Kuwait the Democratic National Committee private law firms\nThat suffer amused by the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign to secretly pay the research firm fusion GPS who then paid the former British spy Christopher Steele compiled the dusty a\nOf an cooperated man whenever we talked about the left it's always on cooperating cooperated raw intelligence alleging Trump\nAnd Moscow were colluding to hijack\nThe presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed a bite testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation of Republicans on the house just jury and government oversight committee the sources told a John Solomon\nOr the other thing is the Baker was interviewed just yesterday by lawmakers behind closed doors Wednesday and sources declined to divulge the testimony other other than to say it confirmed\nOther evidence about the contact between Perkins ... law firm\nAnd the FBI the sources also said bakers interview broke new ground above the FBI's use of news media\nIn twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen to further the Trump case and about deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein ... conversations in spring of twenty Seventeen regarding possible use of the body while you're to record Trump\nThe interview was one of the most productive\nWe've had and it opened up many new investigative leads one source said\nAnother said Baker could not answer some questions the FBI about at the media contacts citing ongoing investigation\nBy the Justice Department inspector general into alleged illegal leaks during and after the election about the Trump collusion probe and other matters these revelations illustrate\nA new how much the FBI and Justice Department have withheld from the public about their collaboration in collusion with clearly part is some elements of the Clinton campaign that dance the fusion GPS and steel that we're trying to defeat Trump\nAnd so that is you know breaking news because what you have there you have you had the first person from\nThe last administration the Obama administration that worked in the FBI you have them now on the record yeah according to John Solomon test to find the time when we were ... there's no reason\nIf you're investigating Donald Trump to be talking to the ... lawyers private lawyers\nJust before you got the secured worn right Internet your investigation going on and he apparently that's what the sources say he said they talked to they talk to ... the lawyer specifically about the allegations of Trump and collusion\nWhy why would that be why would that be\nSo that she was breaking news other news and we'll talk more about that I'm sure in the upcoming days other news want to get in Saudi Arabia has increased crude production significantly to an air record level amid intense pressure from US President Donald Trump to reduce prices this from Bloomberg now\nOh pets largest producer is currently pumping about ten point seven million barrels a day the energy minister told reporters on Wednesday that just shy of the records set in November of twenty sixteen before the kingdom and allies including Russia agreed to cut production to boost prices were meeting every single demand per barrel\nTwenty six team before the kingdom and allies including Russia agreed to cut production to boost prices were meeting every single demand per barrel she said we've increased production quite significantly we just have to be responsive to demand because some would say that the market is currently over supplied he said\nAre the key insights from Bloomberg their analysis Saudi Arabia appears to be borrowing again to pressure from Trump\nNow we've talked about this because we got we we got a couple of messages when we said that the United states now we know we now are the leading producer of oil in the war yep we beat started we'd be that every other country and somebody called up and they said well banal ... prices aren't really really low\nBecause there are other factors involved and there's been a ... a there's a sanctions against a a a a you know a Iran there has been a growing economy so prices haven't gone to record lows we didn't expect them to go to record lows the whole point is\nThat when you producer on oil here and we become a record producer of oil that's money that stays here\nWell and and you look at the again the mass of wealth expansion that we're seeing you had the fed chairman making the comments that the economy the future right now looks very very bright and in fact almost unbelievably\nGood at some levels well that comes from an expansion as you look at the number one I'm On the GDP and you look at the growth and everything else was always the the number one category leading its mining which includes drilling\nAnd that oil export exploration and and energy exploration and and and production\nIs key you don't have to have a you don't have to be working in the oil fields to benefit from that and that's the whole point\nWe've been saying this for years that once we realized that the regulations only the regulations were holding us back\nThat we would start seeing a wealth expansion I'm convinced that's exactly what will start seeing more and more than I'd\nGive I'd give credit here to President Trump or he communicated the message to Saudi Arabia ... excuse me\nWe're there for you right we're there for you all you know are we why are we funding of your military where we're there for you all the time mhm\nUh and whoever thought that the United states would be the leading producer of oil and could convince an OPEC member Saudi Arabia OPEC member I deal pact member [laughter] very you know back in the field next member right Saudi Arabia or\nTo produce more oil if you don't think look we've criticized Trump in in in in ways\nBut we talked about when he does extremely good things we talked about the fact that no other\nThere was no other Democrat courses nor the Democrat there is no other Republican that could have gotten the cut in taxes that he got especially the Twenty one percent corporate tax ... no one he deserves full credit for that and he deserves full credit\nFor that right there now one other point I just wanted to make real quickly because we've talked about the new NAFTA agreement and um whatever wealth starts to be called NAFTA you know the new trade agreement ... and we said look we said this a long time ago we said one of the reasons that we're concerned [laughter] and we're ... babies\nAre one of the original chair of the original tear ... [laughter] you know one of one of the reasons that we were concerned who said look\nEventually when this agreement comes out it's not really going to be different\nThan the agreement that that we have now ...\nOr ... who is leading economists for the wall Street Journal the exact same thing yet in the end the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement looks like\nA lot like the old NAFTA mhm\nMexico's only significant concession was on automobiles and parts rules requiring more production in North America highway higher wages for workers\nAnd potential terrorists if its exports to the U.S exceed two point six million vehicle that even though there is a cat because her way below that now\nA yet these auto rules may have little practical significance\nThey talk to judge Schuster of a a A L L M C automotive\nSaid some lower price models now assembled by Volkswagen miles to in a few other manufacturers in Mexico may no longer qualify for duty free entry but they're not going to shift to the U.S production they may simply pay the the two point five percent tariffs will hurt us consumers especially low income consumers in the United states\nAnd so we have said and they said the cap on exports may discourage manufacturers from sending expanding capacity in Mexico but it won't affect current shipments a they basically said it's exactly the kind of thing that we did with\nSouth Korea ... that we set these limits but we're not even reaching the limits were not close to them now and that costs limits announce it really doesn't make a difference but he said really there's not much difference in the old NAFTA as there is the new NAFTA and you build a name has been changed right and as we said all along\nA we there's been a lot of us you know industry that has suffered because of this and you wouldn't have if you wind up basically with the same deal or things that you claim are great things that can't be enforced or as we say the auto things that hurt the economy and will hurt lower income people will then was it all worthwhile\nIllnesses become severe leading to hospitalization and disability the driver then may lose their CDL and become unable to work this creates a downward spiral that leads to extreme financial hardship and possible unemployment\nGo to truckers fund dot org today and learn more about how you can contribute if you are someone inside the trucking industry may be a need learn how SDF can help we encourage you to educate yourself in tears under state Christopher truckers fun today donate if you can you never know when you may need some help to that\nTrucker spawn dot org let's band together for a better tomorrow\nAmericans find Seventy five years to the um seven than be San Diego's talk radio\nShows\nMe the news on the hour presented by liberty mutual insurance\nIs long term photo among political bitterness and anger over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination ended Saturday Night with his swearing in as a justice of the Supreme Court replaced by more political bitter to sort of anger about a month the head of mid term elections President Trump held a political rally in Kansas\nAll over the past few weeks every American has now seen the profound stakes in the upcoming election you see it we have been energized ground\nDemocrats opposed to both the president and car but also they are to CBS News congressional corresponded Nancy quarters\nProtestors on both sides to Supreme Court [noise]\nSergeant at arm's will restore order in the gallery\nOfficiated on this vote the eyes or fifty the Naser forty eight\nDays after\nKavanaugh was hit with sexual misconduct allegations dating back to high school and college\nHaiti which is no stranger to major earthquakes was hit by another one Saturday Night\nEarlier reports indicate at least eleven faith ... some damage as the magnitude five point nine quake knocked down buildings in the north of that impoverished country this is half a world away the death toll is now more than sixteen hundred following a devastating quake and tsunami in Indonesia\nIn this country it has been three weeks since Hurricane Florence here about a thousand Carolina residents are still staying in shelters CBS News correspondent Jim ...\nDozens of Hurricane Florence evacuations bounced from a shelter to shelter in South Carolina has become an extended family they've learned to lean on what another Amanda ...\nEverybody needs them on the way they are very thin and help out when I was like a monetary\nAn estimated one thousand displaced people were made in shelters in the Carolinas more than three weeks after Hurricane Florence hit ... news ...

I Hope I got a cute I read your\nTrial the fall asleep [laughter]\nOh no question the rain [noise]\nAnd we should not move on to another candidate\nThat was senator Spartacus in New Jersey [laughter]\nHuh Tucker Carlson\n... and that was senator ... yeah well I I just don't I was I was doing the ... over Cory Booker what\nOh that's where he said doesn't matter whether he's innocent or not there's been enough questions raised that he should drop out now so if you just raise just throw up the allegation yeah and and there was quite away the germs were later on and said he goes yeah I I Know what I said what do you think about it 'cause we've been through this already now editor McCarthy\n... you're not a communist right\nExactly that's exactly what the same thing that liberals were outraged about is not what they endorse exactly for on the tracks user forecast an unusually\nPersistent weather pattern is going to bring some snow to the higher elevation to the Rockies rain snow into the great lakes basin possible and into the northern plains\nSevere thunderstorms possible over parts of the country today in New York will see Seventy eight degrees with some sunshine today Detroit under thirty percent chance of showers high Seventy three Chicago near sixty eight chance of thunderstorms both today and tomorrow\nWhether frontal boundary lingering around the mid west we can certainly see the difference in temperatures in Chicago from today's high sixty eight\nTo Monday eighty one degrees and there you have the chance for thunderstorms with a pretty good difference in temperature along that front Atlanta eighty six today Dallas eighty four with a chance of thunderstorms Denver around fifty three degrees overnight low going into Monday thirty six\nI found very very few of them for example today seven hundred law professors signed a letter they asked me to sign it I refused I wrote a dissent\nSaying he now no longer has the judicial temperament well can you imagine if this were a liberal who had been appointed by liberal president who had been accused and it would act similarly I don't think a single one of those professors would have signed that letter they will fail the shoe on the other foot test\nSenator Booker why I like it no it's just dead wrong this is all about partisanship defeat opposite was happening and if it was the Democrats who are putting up candidate everybody would behaving the opposite way and so it is part isn't ship\nAnd I think the framers of our constitution never intended the confirmation process to look anything like hey great\nYeah I ... and and that's it I mean we we talk about the process\nYou know if it's telling that we're at this point and still at this point in fact heightened your you'll likely see the chaos heightened today and tomorrow up until the main vote on so late Saturday or early Sunday Morning whenever it happens\nBut we're at this point but it is all this chaos\nBefore the actual vote and what is it that that matters it's only about the vote\nI mean this is further proof that this was only about the delay delay it as long as you can in hopes an outside hope I guess that Kavanaugh would pull his own confirmation and withdraw his own confirmation and for the president would do it\nUm that wasn't going to happen uh the wants wants to let got loud that wasn't going to happen but this president and and now we know very clearly it certainly isn't going to happen by the nominee himself but\nYou look at this entire process and it has been distorted greatly there is no guarantee here the the cabinet we will be confirmed with the actual legitimate process of all of this and place well\nYou know when you when you hear Dershowitz a talk about you know McCarthyism ... and and what happened at that time when\nYou know you someone who accuse you of being a communist and so you'd get enraged and they say well sorry you don't have the temperament the allegation itself meant you were blacklisted right the the the fact that you lost it at anything was used an a you know against you\nAre and I thought there's which you know really when he said he said so you are but a director forty years and now you're losing control because somebody's calling you a combination of the temperament for the job so you're on your blacklisted from the the ... you know from the industry and it's something that liberals used to have in their mind and\nI think the important thing is and it's obvious because you and I have been having this discussion a back and forth because it is the left\nIt is you know ... ... we call it the supposed to be anti fascist yet what are they promote what is their actual mindset it's authoritarianism and its fascism it's a you must live the life that that that we that that we wish you to live\nAnd what you see here what you see here from the Democrats the mindset that they're promoting everybody that you see Michael Moore and Amy Schumer and whatever whatever Hollywood people are down there screaming and yelling about you know a Brett Brett Kavanaugh and believe me if she used her that the the\nThe the the defendant has no rights at all the defendant does automatically guilty that\nIs the mindset of a fascist yes that's not the mindset of somebody who believes in the American constitution and the spirit of America in the spirit of due process in\nThe spirit of the bill of rights of the United states it is the mindset of a fascist\nWell and and what we call somebody when we say they have the mindset of the fascist we back it up with specifics not just oh he talks mean therefore he's a fascist no wonder is exact words and what does he actually wish to implement that we talked about\nPresident Trump and you know they started on that uh and now they\nMoved on and this is a very very important thing for people to understand that I think that's what this is what maybe you're not in the Republican Party it started with Trump\nAnd enough people hated Trump where it's stuck for a while\nAnd then they decided to move on from Trump and they moved on to Kavanaugh and all of a sudden the realization as we said all along it was a bogus argument completely bogus and allies against Trump to begin with but then they moved to somebody else\nWho more people look at and say well this is somebody who really really like this is somebody who we really would like in that position as much as we don't like Trump this was a great great great great pick and\nThen you see the same tactics used against Trump that might have been okay for some people because they despised him so much somehow hit somebody they like and then they realized\nOh no if it can hit him that it can hit him\nOh my God they can come after me next thing go after anybody and that's what you learn with the fascists mindset they'll pick out an attractive target to get people you know motivated behind them even people of you know well of goodwill\nAnd all of a sudden those people have good will wake up one day and say and sometimes they wake up in a society and it's too late\nIt's not too late here in the United states and it's not too late in this instance and it looks like that because people have fought back\nAre you now have you know created this unity in the Republican Party\nBut remember it only goes so far because people of good will buy into it at times yes because it fits their political narrative but it is the mind what you're seeing is the mindset of a fascist\nAnd the fascist in this case is not the Republicans it is the Democrats and it's not debatable\nWell I mean it's very simple when you look at the group that says they're anti fascist and their name in fact this condensed down to those condensed from those two words\nThere the group that's willing to go out and hurt people use violence against people they disagree with\nPunish people for thought they're the ones who are acting on it they're the ones in California who create laws that if you don't talk the way we want you to talk we can send you to jail\nIn New York we can find your business to the extent that you will be out of business tell me that's not fascist\nYou you don't create the ours that somebody wishes you to create we will destroy your business\nYou wear a hat you go to a restaurant and try and have a peaceful dinner we will come on to that private property and we will shout you out\nYou'd think like us you behave like us you reject the bill of rights and if you don't we will destroy your life\n\nRepublicans are finally coming around and you're not in ... oh my God\nThat's what that party has become and it's not the fringe this is the important thing a bit of this is not the fringe this is the mainstream yeah this is the Senate Judiciary committee it's mainstream power of the republic or some of the Democratic party\nAnd you have a back seat waters who doesn't get any grief from the left for saying this is what we need you to do this is what we want you to do go out and get in their face every chance you get\nAnd all of a sudden you've got pushed back yeah\nRight because the average American will put up or for a while until all of a sudden it's like whoa okay the lines been crossed and I believe many people believe now that this line has been cross I Hope they do let me put it this way I'm not going to make the prediction that they have yet it seems that they have\nBut my hope is that the American people have had enough\nAnd that more people will start rejecting the the mindset of fascism that is being promoted by the mainstream of the Democratic party yeah as you're always say tell us where we're wrong you can't eight six six Ninety ...\nHow much do you know about synthetic oil heavy duty trucks have been running on traditional mineral oil for the last one hundred years but\nToday's technology brings us other options to consider it's better quality\nUnlike mineral oils synthetic oils have consistent molecular restructure giving them the ability to support pressures from iron horse power engines especially at lower rpm it also allows oil to reduce friction in an engine controlling temperatures and improving fuel economy\nThere cleaner synthetic pickup fewer contaminants as they do their job of lubrication they also have better oxidation stability resulting in an overall cleaner
