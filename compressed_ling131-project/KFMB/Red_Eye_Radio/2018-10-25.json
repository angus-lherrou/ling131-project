I Will know it when I see because of political science will be all over the place right right yeah and they were\nThe only thing is they\nDidn't have any parking if you came in to vote it was all student parking at a college uh yeah yeah which and I just thought to myself because that was one of the reasons I wasn't going to go there I was going to go to a courthouse right uh where you know

said yeah the reins affecting the today because it's been pretty crowded and then just you know one right up there were three or four machines that were open and went in and voted and it was done now

today or or maybe next week if that has to happen\nBut you can bet they are watching this and a lot of it has to do with trade and tariffs so the material costs especially with steel and aluminum

it's not moving along at all and you wouldn't hire totally asking\nWhy is it going so slowly that labor is a material I'd never seen a building built so slow and this is a major mhm apartment

the south\nA exist that being said the care of them currently moving from uh the Mexico Guatemala border towards the United states gets Trump's and the Republicans a chance to double down on immigration and issue the Democrats themselves remained vulnerable on\nWhy are the Democrats vulnerable on immigration because they have not just about the attack that they are for open borders and go\nWe've been saying for years\nAnd this is what we said pretty much throughout the show yesterday and and the earlier this week as well they have to be positioned very clearly the question has to be asked where do you stand on the border\nThey must be\nForced to say it because it's very clear to most people but but they're going to have to answer the question what level of border enforcement do you support\nWhat don't use the word comprehensive\nExactly what do you support we know you don't want the wall that's a given what do you support we know what you don't want what do you want [noise]\nHe said again I've argued elsewhere the party should have embraced an immigration compromise where the wall would be built\nIn exchange for a pathway to citizenship for the eleven to twelve million immigrants not here legally remember he's a lifelong\nUh uh you know a Democrat and former Democratic pollster just you understand but that's really a lot of what we have said that we have ... as we said yesterday and I believe the day before on on the whole caravan thing this is a perfect opportunity for the Republicans and the president\nTo back them into a corner\nAnd go after the Democratic leadership and state what do you want because I still hear it from Democrats what we need to have a comprehensive immigration reform and nobody ever asked them what that means right what does that mean specifically what do you want\nAnd he talks about it here are I Would you be for the would you be for a pathway to citizenship for the immigrants that are here and then a wall is to be built and anybody who comes here in the future must go back and\n\nAre you for that but you can't we have said it's impossible to have a debate right now and has been for the last Thirteen Years yeah because when you when I came on this show together the issue we had to go back and look at this yesterday in the history of our show the first thing that we really discuss\nWas a was a a a Kennedy a McCain McCain Kennedy mhm\nWhich was the amnesty that was two thousand five just if they they made the decisions a couple of weeks after you and I started working together right\nAnd so for Thirteen Years the Democrats have not had to tell the American public where they stand on illegal immigration what\nWould they do what was their plan be\nThinking about this and that by the way that the Republican failure mhm because of Republican should be demanding every ... every time they talk about illegal immigration it shouldn't be the Democrats ... ... it should be as we've said\nYou make the accusation Democrats won open borders and when they cry you our line fine then you tell me specifically what kind of deal you wouldn't want done\nIssued them the challenge and that's what it was shown as saying here that again they haven't had to answer\nThey haven't had to they don't they some of them don't agree with the open borders but they don't denounce it either and he also talked about the elimination of ice how you had that and there wasn't a massive response from Democrats saying well that's ridiculous you don't get rid of ice you don't get rid of border enforcement in this country\nThat's ridiculous that the American public and even Democrats a significant portion of Democrats one border security they may have compassion for people that are here\n\nAnd want to have compassion when it comes to even legal immigration but as we and brought it to your attention\nMe demographics that want the least legal immigration into this country are blacks and Hispanics ... when you look at the polling as to the number of when you go the demographics and you see that the numbers\nOf of\nMinorities in this country who want the lowest level of legal immigration that even from has never talked about mhm it's minorities the vast majority of them the huge vast majority of them who vote Democrat\nMhm [noise] no the American people stand with the president on border enforcement they do he's winning that politically but the other side of it is is that the ...\nIs winning that politically but the other side of it is is that the Democrats have not been forced to choose say what they want at all you know the president wants you know what the Republicans\nWon and and I think that in the entire first off you have to go and you have to be you have to go after the Democrats and say\nAnd you have to you have to force them and backed them into a corner and and as I said uh get in their face yesterday rhetorically is what I said I don't mean physically but rhetorically and make them answer back them against the wall so they have no choice\nTo either you made your point that they're for open borders or they have to respond and give you the specifics that they do not\nThe second thing is sort of what Trump is doing already when he's talking about the care of and saying we'll pull well we're going to pull aid from you mhm but look if you improve your country and you become more capitalistic will be the first ones here to help you write\nSo we can't take in the entire world but this is where you need to start focusing on those governments in those countries and saying we're here to help you help your own people from\nThat\nMuch you need to embrace free markets you need\nTo you need to do something yes by the way also we when we talk about the imagery you know the the one picture that came out with the hunter and flag ... and all that and so people start question why do you want to come here right do you want to come here to become citizens or is it just to work and then\nYou know go back and then we have to have that discussion\nTo well what do we want from people who come over here as citizens but first before you even get to any of those other things that I'm Talking about you have to find out what the other major party actually once when it comes to\nIllegal immigration and border enforcement we're not even to that point no how can you have a discussion when only one side has said it has put forth plans of what they want and the other side\nWon't go after they're part of the party than endorses open borders and just keeps quiet on it well silences your consent yes silence is your consent saying get rid of ice is your consent we're not going to get rid of border enforcement in the United states\nSo why are you preaching that now that stuck with shown whose looks like to me as the longtime Democrat who are about to use Claire McCaskill's verbiage\nA isn't a crazy Democrat or\nA says of course the rank and file Democrats the average person who votes Democrat and they want border control sure\nIn fact the constituency the boats most Democrat most the time actually to get out of illegal immigration in the legal immigration is a demographic that once the least legal immigration into this country look\nYou have a sanctuary city policies sanctuary state policy sanctuary county policy by Democrats have been promoting it for a long long time\nAnd now you have the you know abolish ice protest\n\nThey they're saying it but they're not forced to say the words open borders they should say they should be forced to say it because that's what they are promoting\nAnd if they're not where's the pushback if they're promoting border enforcement at any level tell me who and I mean the from the party\nThat is actually saying that in promoting it is Chuck Schumer promoting that Nancy Pelosi or they promoting that may be a Joe Manchin we haven't heard him but we have you know there might be one or two maybe clear [laughter] you know she's not one of those crazy Democrats\nBut where's the party saying this is what we want because that's the official\nPolitical battle how can we have ... how can we have a debate on illegal immigration and border enforcement when the other side won't officially tell us what they would ... what they want right except for those that are in the party that promote open borders and the elimination advice they won't even have the debate why right\nAnd that's what Republicans we Republicans have a Thirteen Years to pound on Democrats for it and they failed miserably in them in that

[noise] here\nOn the events from yesterday the FBI said last evening that it has identified seven suspicious packages\nAddressed to prominence liberal and democratic political figures over the previous three days that contained quote potentially destructive devices and to quote\nThe bureau initially said it had recovered five packages that were similar and appearance and bore the return address of an office for representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida the packages were address to George Soros Hillary Clinton\nA former president Brock Obama former CIA director John Brennan a care of CNN and former attorney general Eric Holder the FBI said it was possible\nThat additional packages were mailed to other locations\nOr this investigation is of the highest priority for the FBI Director Christopher Wray set in a statement we have committed the full strength of the FBI's resources and together with our partners on the joint terrorism task forces\nWe will continue to work to identify an arrest whoever's responsible for sending these packages we ask anyone who may have information to contact the FBI do not hesitate to call no piece of information is too small to help us with this investigation law enforcement officials involved\nIn the investigation told Fox News at the similarity between the packages has led them to believe that a single individual or group could be responsible\nIn addition to the five packages identified by the FBI US Capitol police were investigating a suspicious package address to representative Maxine Waters of California\nAt the Capitol Hill screening facility and Marilyn water set in a statement\nThe Capitol police have told her that her Washington DC office was the target a suspicious package that has been referred to the FBI late Wednesday the Los Angeles central mail facility was evacuated after employees found a suspicious package which the Associated Press reported was\nAddressed to waters the FBI later confirmed that it had recovered two packages addressed to waters that were similar to the five and a reference and its earlier statement the LA police department tweeted that his bomb squad had rendered the package\nAt the male facility safe and investigation will be turned over to the FBI so that's the latest that we\nUh have a right now a again a the one\nThing that is a bit I've I think uh\nThey're saying the

Missouri a Claire McCaskill the Democratic incumbent who's running against her opponent misery attorney general Josh Hawley yeah out two weeks out we see the latest poll Missouri scout has Holly up by one and and that was ten Seventeen and ten Eighteen right guy\nA buy a buy one um we see the last\nOne two three four five out of the last five polls once but I guess he's been up and three and she's been up in one a three of those were taken in September of the two taken in\nA ... October was Fox News we're ... was a tie a than the Missouri scout that has all the up by one in that end\nA ... October was Fox News we're ... was a tie a than the Missouri scout that has holy up by one in that and build a dead heat yeah it is it is is a dead heat and so the fascinating thing about uh this radio ad\nIs what is said in it where there's you'll hear two men talking\nAnd they're talking about you know a Josh Hawley and the problems with him that\nUh the claim as he gets wind and works out during work hours which we found really interesting per cent of race to be the main accusation in an ad that clearly is a\nDesperation at yeah they were just why not but he\nDrinks ready when he purchased wind purchased wind and went to work out right uh and when you're an attorney general which probably your hours\nYou're probably a salaried workers we didn't have a salaried employee yes yeah uh but but I Am thinking that that that's it but so do we know we'll we'll play coming up on after\nOne of those it's it's it's a horrible attempt I hate to contrived to well gee you Bob what are you thinking in terms of your vote\nIt's you can use real real people but that's not what they did here they're trying to portray real people with the sentiment of people um and they probably couldn't find it to be\nWhat am I I Will send it at all I mean with if you look at the the issues that they were concerned about most in that at a uh it was terrorists yes and we talked about the mid west it was something that we talked about yesterday that the the the the the farmer\nThat is some of the backbone of the Trump support Democrats are going directly at because of their loss of business because of the the the terrorists mostly due to the Chinese so it is something that we uh we ... we were you brought that up in the last couple of days when we talk about okay what might affect the Democrats\nTo help them win or what might affect the Republicans to help them win what is the strategy that they're using but in that ad\nIt was terrorists twice\nHere's the ... interesting question outside of farmers that that was targeted to in Missouri\nIf you went up to the average person on the street and said what do you think about terrorists do you think that have any idea what they were in a nation we're Seventy five percent of the American public cannot tell you what the three branches of government are\nYeah um you know it's it it really is about the president's I guess in the state of the industry or the particular industry right and and and that is the case in in huge farm states it\nEven if you're not a farmer um you know what to do ... yeah right now you know like you know to you know the effect on the farmers and they were in very vocal about it if you're in that state even if you're not a former ah you know again depending on the impacts that they they felt it was worth\nUh making that point ah which\nYou know I Will see if if that point works or if if any of this works here within two weeks\nIt's\nA I think the most notable point is the word crazy yeah because it is it that positioning was I'm not going the way of of others in my party because keep in mind she she's not trying to position this and this is her\nYou heard her say she approves this message\nThis is her campaign that she's not saying the people that are protesters\nShe's referring to her ... her party and we have to point out that we've pointed out you know over the last several weeks these are the main stream high ranking members of the party that she's referring to here\nIn terms of the word crazy\nThat's what that's what they're trying to that's how they're trying to do the positioning hear that word is very important because it likely came back and research\nAnd we made the point earlier that it wasn't she didn't use the word I'm not with the extreme part of my party or she didn't say I don't always agree\nYou know ... you know with my my party in it knows approach or are you writing again it wasn't it ... the men having the conversation didn't say well she doesn't always agree with her party and there's some extreme as you know in there that she doesn't she's it was the term\nAs you brought up and so rightly\nIt was the term they felt the term crazy\nNo she doesn't she's it was the term as you brought up and so rightly it was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat and ... that she rejects the crazy Democrats you had to be put in to that ad right\nWhere the momentum they believe might be moving towards Holly and not her that's a desperate tactic because they're looking at the ... and remember this would be in the undecided voters more independent undecided voters\nWho they are looking to sway one way and it's it's a desperate ... it's a Hail Mary throw Eric is what it is yes I got to let these people know I'm not part of the crazy Democrats right yeah being outside the what they're thinking that's one of the things that's coming back and they are polling is the independents that\nThey're they're they're they're looking at holy because they think you're part of the crazy Democrats might not part of the crazy Democrats but it's using that term crazy Democrats specifically and not\nA you know not radical not yet a extreme cause extreme if something is is a term that Democrats have used a lot\nAnd it's almost right and it's almost a mainstream if you will term word right\nAh but this is this is also something we pointed out weeks ago during the Kavanaugh thing is that it doesn't matter that you're not a Cory Booker it doesn't matter that\nYoure not a ...\nA lizard with war and or just you know pick a number of them that are in the Senate or that are Democrats that can be you know I guess people are describing clearly as crazy Democrats I think we have a couple of times\nIt's because their actions\nAnd and we said this a few weeks ago their actions go outside of their state in terms of the race right they will uh taint the races and other states but especially of course those that are\nNeck and neck and and I don't know I mean there's or maybe one or two but this this race is probably one of the closest in the Senate if not the closest according to the polls right now\nSo that the effect is that combat one Harris or or Elizabeth Warren or any of them\nThey whatever they do is going to affect those races those other races and those\nPeople in the state of Missouri maybe looking at this going what or may not have anything against Claire McCaskill but I don't want her party having that control because she might vote with\nAt some point a Kamala Harris or you know as side with as you're crazy Democrats she as she just did as having just [laughter] and which is the perfect example and that's the thing\nThat endorsement in fact you point out something that is key here that is likely that action yes one action we talked about it before the vote up and\nWhere does she go on this well she made a choice to go because she didn't want to lose those Democrats in her state that did support the no vote but it's not those Democrats and and it's you know it's it's that scale the tips\nYou know the the water balloon you squeeze it on one side he goes to the other if she loses Democrats\nThan it doesn't matter of the people in the middle are going to be with her and if she can't get them right now she acted as one of the crazy Democrats whip that no vote she condones that behavioral Lenny we saw it during the cop Kevin I'm ... and and that's\nWhy I'm Wondering what the effect would be again on an undecided independent and we've been getting ourselves into trouble because people have when we've been talking about\nYou know how you're trying to win an election people think we're talking about how we think and how they should think and we're not we're talking about probably people who don't listen to our show mhm we're talking about the election strategy we're talking about the undecided independents right here in undecided independent\nWho's looked at the cabinet thing and said they're crazy I mean they're ... they're really crazy and I can't vote for care\nYou know a Claire McCaskill and that's and then that's what the feedback coming back mhm that ad may be received by these people to say you're just lying to me right you are one of the crazy Democrats but you're willing to call your entire party crazy that you're that you belong with because you just want my vote right\nYou actually don't believe that they're crazy right you don't believe they're crazy you actually agree with them this just shows you the length of what you will go you will call your own party crazy in order to get the vote and then you'll be trained me when you get into office\nYou'll vote with the crazy Democrat and with that vote on Kavanaugh that was also condoning their behavior is not you know all of that that's you know that's the evidence to back up their opinion yup coming to that conclusion just have it all just prove that eight six six Ninety right I\nWas

following the bottom of your house that we do live it's ... it's a political ad that if you haven't heard it you want to hear\nClaire McCaskill's ad that radio ad that she started running and misery the Democrat and the Democrats calling other Democrats crazy Democrats mhm not one of the crazy Democrats yeah Albert in Texas Albert welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show high Albert\nHey good morning Eric uh Gary first time caller I was calling to let you know that the FBI is doing a very thorough investigation air and so it won't become a boot political issue they'll let us know after the November elections\nWere real or not [laughter] yeah I think an oversight committee and get your mathematically that won't happen so [laughter] yeah I Will have to declassify it uh yeah well they now have you know that the banks\nAnd yeah thanks that's we just we we saw what you're going to say we we knew where you were ... we were going with\nA ... it's a it is fascinating because it is something look it isn't that the number one question that you would want to ask is a reporter mhm that report them I'm sure they're gonna have a press conference today part is going to ask because the was are where the bombs Leiber not\nRight where they you know we're we're could they have been a detonated by opening the package because the concern is not just a you know about you know the message being sent or the intent of the person or persons responsible\nBut also about the threat that is still or might still be out there in in the system because let's say that they were going or are going through stages where they are reaching out to these individuals' first and then there are others on their list\nWell the concern would be by you know the the package handlers and people that might even be walking on up up up to a porch\nAnd and they see something worth these devices ready to go off because they have been detonated a rapidly either remotely or by opening\nA package I think that's information that needs to be made a available to the public as soon as possible you know without impeding the investigation itself if possible [noise] ah\nJust we got to bring this up quickly I I haven't checked the overnight markets you know I haven't I haven't checked but six hundred down down yesterday and ah the doubt as he also down ... down I think was it four point four percent yesterday\nYeah yeah uh the uh\nThe Dow down over six hundred and and a lot of that had to do with earnings and and we're hearing more and more\nUh companies come out and say that the earnings are suffering as a result of what's going on uh the chairs from retaliatory tariffs by trade partners is having an impact on on\nOut overnight is ... ... is up and which I which you might expect uh all the Asian markets are down one percent three the three percent for the Japanese market down three percent a Shanghai up a little bit above ... percent there\nA you're a mixture of over in Europe so we'll see whether it's just a correction whether there's really worry\nWith others in the housing market and we know for\nOr send their uh Europe a mixture of over in Europe so we'll see whether it's just a correction whether there's really worry with others in the housing market and we know for example about you know Ford coming down and and saying look thanks for all the thanks for all the help with the tax cuts but the terrorists are killing us\nAnd and there's something like what happened yesterday on the news playing out makes a lot of people nervous and and of course than the markets because one possibility you have to consider is that it was a foreign enemy a that was that was involved are responsible\nFor these suspicious packages and and the the concern that it might not be over or something else might happen we it was a lot of uncertainty yesterday\nSo some of that is built in to that drop I mean you often see that if there is something that that is happening or as as big of a news story as as you saw yesterday uh that does make the the market's very nervous so uh we'll see where it\nWell and that's something that was you know was was brought up yesterday by you know some of the experts say look you know there's there's three things that could be it could be somebody in their right it could be somebody in their lap it could also be a foreign entity\nRight you know just to disrupt the American you know of electoral above a process or it could be just terrorists now who have decided to do it again which is that's that's why we find it surprising that a so late into this because it's been three days since the ...\nA bomb initially that nobody has stated whether these were active lie bombs that would have gone off right if if somebody would have touched it in a different way right apparently they were handled it didn't go off\nWell because I Would think that if there was a threat of these devices going off whether they could be set off a remotely or by the handling the package itself that we would see that warning come out by authorities would we not\nYeah because if we learned that that was the case and they didn't warn the public and there was still a possibility of such devices being in the mail system or being out there in in the public and it's still being a threat to the public beyond that the intended recipient recipients over the past few days\nThat they would want to get that message out and and we would be hearing that\nI Would think that and if we hear that that you know that they were armed and and they didn't say at the most someone's going to have to answer them for honor attracts usual forecast\nThose heavy showers in southern Texas will continue to slowly moves eastward throughout the evening\nAnd into the day on Thursday we'll see that area of low pressure hug the Gulf Coast and provide heavy rains from Houston over to New Orleans so I can certainly you only the windshield wipers on through a good portion of the south as this system continues to move eastward\nFiguring out Missouri 'cause I don't know what Missouri's problems are when you're inside Missouri when you're inside of a time limit of town you know more of what their their or state you know more what their challenges some problems are especially if you've been there a long time\nBut it was interesting too so I understand uh the the the fact of of using the pre existing conditions because all Democrats are using that Schumer said we've got to go and we've got to hit that so you knew that was going to be the messaging\nOr not you're not surprised or shocked but very interested in the fact that the biggest issue was mentioned twice was the terrorists\nNow I don't know why you take valuable time because if if you believe as a Democrat\nThat the terrorists that are on products that are hurting farmers in the mid west\nAnd you believe in and you you've you've mentioned it you know white okay because you believe it's important you also know or you believe is we we instead this way back when in springtime\nOr you know we've said this when when the weight before that we said this one the Republicans passed the health care bill we said don't be surprised if it comes back and it's a negative against you not a positive anymore but as used against you in in the mid term elections and it has been mhm\nSo you've got bad and you've got the terrorists that you believe you mentioned at the white in there because you believe that there's a significant number of people who might be attracted to that anti terror of message that Trump has been so louder ...\nWhy are you throwing it in wasting any valuable time commercial about when he's on the job he went apparently the claim is he went and bought wine and went to the gym and\nTime in a commercial about when he's on the job he went apparently the claim is he went and bought wine and went to the gym anybody knows that when you're an attorney general here ... you don't work hourly you know you're you're you're\nYou're really you're on your ever on the work you're never audit\nFor all right so if you're sitting there and say oh okay I'm going wrong or the stop by and and get a bottle of wine or something like that or I go to the gym during the day because that's a lot of the day when best time to go or you know but but that's it they didn't\n... there was no real focus honestly they would have been better to leave that out completely and she'll go straight onto the crazy Democrat well maybe they maybe they should have mentioned the crazy Democrat twice and\nBy the way I was just thinking the law and order ... uh uh you know didn't didn't ah I Can't think of his name and then he ended up running for da\nJak yeah jak ran for Diego he was he became ... should never use the fact that they they ring ring or are in their office the whole time that\nWe've all starting to weight loss named him on TV I mean I drink drink up after application win or lose trying to run their drinking at the end of the day and they're often not wine like our heavy lift all it was hard liquor they're always drinking [laughter] we thought\nAnd so when I heard that when I'm On a hey come on if they're\nIf they're prosecutors they all drink a [laughter] but but yet when we had ... getting back to the ad and you would said there certainly are on the show that because we focused in on using the term crazy Democrat instead of using the term\nExtremists Democrat yes ... leadership of the Democrat rise right\nThere's the verbiage is clearly some kind of response that they got verbatim they were hearing that repeatedly that phrase crazy Democrats by people in their collapse the in their internal is we're showing that this was a day you know this was a way a hot button\nOr that they could connect to some of those undecideds right now those independents who were leaning right at that moment and the concern they had was the crazy Democrats the ... that's that's why that was used it was used\nAnd directly came from a likely from that that kind of call out research response that you get\nThe because there's there's no other way to do there's no other reason\nTo put that in and that that becomes what the Hail Mary Ann is really neck and neck dead heat race in Missouri it is I mean it's out of all of them I think it's probably\nA if it's not the closest it's prick pretty close to the closest Senate race right now uh so I think it's it's um\nClear that they want him to connect with those people that are leaning right that her independence that are winning right might otherwise vote for him the castle the problem in that is for her actions as specifically with with capital because in siding with her party Kavanaugh\nYou were condoning that kind of behavior right and you can come out and say no I just wasn't sure and I need to be short when we see that doesn't sorry perception is reality especially\nAnd and and this kind of situation that is that is going to and could well that issue decide and many of these races the uh the outcome of the the Kavanaugh situation\nAnd and when you look at the polling there in in Missouri to begin with a ... if you look at the September of polling\nAh you know as the CNN a McCaskill was up by by by three ... with a with likely voters and you get to the Fox news poll which was\nUp until I was nine twenty nine to ten to and it was a tie and then you know through that whole time the cabin all thing and moves Missouri scout a huge sample of of over twelve hundred likely voters\nAnd holy up one still margin of error is to point seven right uh and still nobody has said the fifty percent mark\nSo there's still a ton of undecided there the using that term crazy Democrats a Democrat using that in an ad\nBy the way apparently ticked off other Democrats in Missouri I was reading an article on that earlier a but using that term means that the undecideds are talking about it\nThe undecided that's part of their mindset\nYeah you know the Democrats are crazy these are crazy Democrats now that had to come directly from cabinet yeah because for that to be to do it for that to go to the level of\nUh from fringe to extremists\nToo I just read my leadership too crazy Democrats mean that exact term they're not stir crazy that is the mindset that they view when a significant portion\nOf undecided independents in Missouri that she's trying to get aboard I'm not part of the Democrats I'm not part of the crazy Democrats I I I I think for myself I'll go to the middle I Will compromise between smart you'll compromise with Republicans\nAnd yeah you know it's\nIt's a ... this is why you have this race that you have here it's not because her opponent is is is this big great strong opponent\nIt's because there's weakness across the board and [laughter]\nIt is bipartisan week in nature I mean she's getting she's ... of course they're they're Republicans in that state that would never vote for a ... you know that that that's a given\nBut those people in the middle and this is what we've been talking about for a long long time those are the ones that may vote one way or the other insurance for one party or the other\nAnd they're the ones you have to convince\nThey're the ones that get you over the top and right now she has too many weaknesses that that are that really don't serve her well with either side and I think that comes directly or certainly her vote on Kavanaugh was an indication of that weakness if if it didn't help create\nOr you know there's it's it's one thing you know you you can uh the ... the uh\nInsults the ah the accusations against Donald Trump being crazy being not you know everything that you remember the whole mental health thing that has sort of disappeared hasn't it\nYet but he's mentally ill and all that right you know you can look at that and you say okay that's that's an attack that's always thrown at at one person the president always gets that yeah but we're talking about a political party as a whole\nWe've been talking about the the the Democrats from twenty six team where they said look we've got to go and figure out what the people the heartland does\nAre going and we said back then we said yeah but they're they're talking crazy stuff\nThey're talking you know the whole transgender saying look\nHave compassion for everybody but if you think your if you think you're a man and you're a woman doesn't make you a man and it doesn't make a man and shouldn't make you a man legally and you shouldn't as a man be able to compete against a woman ... past majority of Americans believe that\nThe trans racial thing that they started adopting President Obama before he left office and talking about the fact that he's come to know that race is they\nShe'll thing that they started adopting President Obama before he left office talking about the fact that he's come to know that race is they social construct no it's not right and and so we talked about that craziness well it's gotten to the point\nIf it's no longer the Democrats in order for Claire McCaskill put that in the concern is no longer the Democrats aren't relating to the average person it's at the average person who's now the Democrats as crazy ... and the capital of thing I Believe is what put them over the top\nYeah and and and bad behavior by the way as we pointed out not from protesters from from the high ranking officials and and and members of the party on those committees Claire McCaskill's\nNow as a Democrat believe she's fighting against
