I mean you we added one point two trillion to the debt\nSo that didn't happen you know that's oh wait a minute no no no no no if this is Obama's economy it also has to be Obama's debt right now [laughter] ... [laughter]\nWell I guess I can say we're all end up and there's a big part to get on that [laughter] [noise]\nWell I mean do you think about it if if the Republicans are because remember the it's the it's the deficit this year that's going to skyrocket through the roof yes to over a trillion dollars in one year if and we're not at war now it's not that and it's the Republicans and we're not into recession throwing seven hundred\nA ... million dollars at at the banks or\nAny of that it's it's the Republicans spending I asked this question in all seriousness if Democrats were able to take over both or the Senate and the house and what would there\nNever will move the president's budget B that he would hand them and what would the Democrats want\n\nIf they're Republicans and I don't want to use a drunken sailor analogy because I I think it's unfair to to drunk and sailors and but at least a drunken sailor is ... how could they drink yeah but and they were out of high school and they were drinking fender they throw out ice on anybody\nGot it all relates doesn't it uh\nBut how much would Democrats ... Republicans are are spending this much and and the fact is I look I don't blame the Republican Party and I don't blame the president why the American people don't care can people don't care if there is no political pressure this will continue\nAs I said this is this is my uh twenty ninth anniversary or this week of doing talk radio or the first issue that we hit which was back in eighty nine was the whole clean sweep that Congress was spending too much money\nAnd it's time for a clean sweep and monitor forget the protests all over the country people in front of congressional offices saying we need to cut back I think the deficit at that time was four trillion or less ...\n\nMaybe even three ... don't even remember what it was at that point right but it was nothing and people were upset about it they were actually marching in the streets about the debt [noise] yeah like today some of them are marching in areas where do you guys marching for the debt\nWho's that national debt oh\nBy the debt for every working American by the way every working American uh uh went into debt eighty I think it's eighty one hundred dollar\nGift year from the federal every working American the the debts that basically has its if split up on every working American that adds eighty one hundred on your behalf but remember\nIn the tax bill last year mhm the only the only kind of people that are actually paying more for the debt paying more in taxes are people like Eric and myself who's taxes actually went up yes\nBecause working norm is Lee wealthy exactly that's why we're as the one caller said a couple of years ago billion billionaire yes which was a surprise to all of us just keep it up [noise] I'll tell you this if I was a billionaire mhm I'd get rid of the my Fifteen year old vehicle\nHas two hundred and ten thousand miles\nDidn't ten thousand model oh yeah yeah yeah no I put that out with the trash [laughter] that would be gone my butler would I Would just\nBut because of certain business ... we both share a we can't take them anymore and therefore our our businesses did matter [laughter] no nobody cares about oh we're not upset that we are actually looked at the tax by the tax thing was right thing to do is we've all the state of before\nA irrespective of the unfairness towards us other problems 'til the spending a and\nAnd that's what it comes down to ... because the the the fiscal policy\nUh you know you you look at the the monetary policy of this this nation and and while all over the place\nEspecially in recent years but like over the last Twenty years especially but beyond that the fiscal policy become something very different because and this is it once you start creeping in once you get the foot in the door it as the government provides is provides this provides this\nWill start talking about making cuts start walking into the neighborhoods of America and start saying well in order to get our national debt in order we're going to start cutting back on ah this program this federal program in yours your child's school\nNo they'll\nStart taking things away that's when people start getting motivated that's when they start paying attention now they wouldn't they still wouldn't be able to tell you the majority of them are they still wouldn't be able to name the three branches of government but they would tell you to get out\nAnd you are not welcome in that kind of policy is not walk there is because this is what it comes down to for a Obamacare spending\nAnd a number of issues that conservatives are watching and have been watching for ever enter important because they've always been important but this is it an end Obamacare as one of those\nYou know on the way to getting to what the single payer system but the idea that you're going to get something and somebody else is going to pay for it well then the liberals like that one couple in California well we'd like to Obamacare we voted for Obama we didn't know we were going to have to pay for\nThat's why even though you have when you have Jake Tapper of CNN and and even Chris Cuomo\nQuestioning a case you're Cortez daddy and got them and ... and and and Gillum about the you know the ... of Medicare for all right they understand what we're spending right now how do you think we're already going to be a trillion dollars in debt audiotape you can't pay for all ... and pay or what we're paying for it today it's\nImpossible so the only thing you can do is put massive debt\nOn the uh on the American people the other thing that isn't being talked about either as the because interest rates are going up and how much of a bigger bite that's taking in how much in interest payments the American taxpayer it's growing exponentially yeah every single year now and we've talked about that over the last year but a\nA until it actually starts affecting people and that may be you know you know too late it could be ten years from now Twenty years from now I'm Thirty years from now odds are are you and I will both be dead when it happens but as we've said it's immoral and nobody wants to hear it but it's absolute immoral and unethical\nTo be putting what we want today on the backs of future generations we have is we have stated before\nWe found a loophole of taxation without representation we found the loophole\nYour tax the future they didn't vote for it they had no representation they had no say in it they're completely innocent and all of this and we found the most moral way and we just hide our heads in the stands sand\nLet's put it on them and because I said that I expect to get\nThe emails today which I always get whenever I said that oh you're exaggerated the debt really isn't bad it's all in controlling debt is all part of it\nBad the ... ...\nI Hope that sues you're guilty conscience by writing those emails well\nBecause it effectively when it gets to the point that you can't even service the interest on the debt as a nation\nThe massive hit to the economy when our global trade partners can no longer trust\nThe U.S it will be catastrophic in nature to say well we can just write it off on paper and start over\nNo no you can't because no one is going to trust doing business with you any longer and with that happens then are great show great grandchildren and their children and great grandchildren\nWill not

cold drinks oh I was thinking about the immigration and Customs Enforcement or ... but I just I said you gotta be kidding me and it's just gotten to the point of just\nYou know where will they go next because everything the icing won't be talked about today that's gone up so there's gotta be something new today every every day but it's got to be something new and then it's digested for a little bit and then expelled\nYeah ... when we have when we confront somebody of the opposite opinion I mean we do spend a lot of time you know ourselves doing it but when we confront somebody who was a different opinion with us\nThe vast majority of the time is spent\nTelling them no you don't even know what's going on here right right you don't know the truth\nYou're ignorant of how this works yeah ignorance to me especially from the left it does exist on the right but I think in most cases it exists on the left and it exists\nIn the cabin off thing big time and as you and I said it exists\nA good we had we had brought this up for a few times the whole Colin Kaepernick thing mhm every single person who I've talked to said I didn't understand why\nYou know you would not watch NFL among Catholics just as free speech but not a free speech explain it to him they go home to know that an digital cap and for the\nPig Sachs wasn't about individuals you know that individual cases in solving them he was indicting all cops oh didn't know that you know the last year the catalyst was Michael Bennett who accused the Las Vegas police of line oh I didn't know that and it's amazing it's like well then you don't really\nBut you don't really know anything about this entire case\nYou've just heard bits and pieces and you formed you to your opinion on it I Can't tell you how many people I meet that are like that and to me it's the majority of people that I mean and and and the guy that just that disagree with our opinion right\nAnd it's one thing to issue an opinion on social media you know and you and you've done so with not knowing the facts it's something very different way and it starts again affecting the polls in a in a political race\nWe're going to start seeing the polls that include Thursday and beyond last Thursday the day of the hearings\nWere going to start seeing those polls roll out this week\nWill the Democrats and the situation if they start seeing those polls working against them especially in those tight races\n\nThey start seeing the very real risk of losing another few seats\nIn the Senate and say to themselves\nWe can't do this we're going to quietly

the way also when the news this really happened during the show we know a lot of people are waking up but we actually did get a call from an anti Kevin ... anti Trump person said and we're not making this up it really got the call\nReally got the call ... who ah said ah that the Supreme Court is a lifetime appointment and we if we have to we should go all the way back to the wound to ensure that the nominee is qualified\n[noise]\nYeah [noise] I figured I figured they would started junior high school then maybe elementary school and then kindergarten in preschool went on to the womb\nWell you

the severe weather and heavy showers yesterday on the upper Midwest is moving off to the east we saw those heavy showers in Iowa portions of Wisconsin northern Illinois\n... we're like we understand that the the ... the people work out there and that's why we're here and we get to do it I'll tell you this though we don't have the privilege of getting most information most of the information that we get Ninety nine percent of information any citizen can find on the Internet it's not like it used to be where you might have to do extra research\nIt's all there and the ignorance we talk about ignorance of the issues that is one thing and that's why people ... it's it's forming opinions not knowing what the facts are or just because you have a particular narrative this is what I find more than anything\nAh where I Know that when I was in my twenties I didn't say much forget minutes opinions because I wasn't sure what all the details worse why hesitated to do it it is the ...\nShe is the is the confidence well no there is a confidence today that exists of promoting your opinion and being being um and and passionate about it and after about ten seconds you go\nYou really don't know the issue at all here do you not talking about you Robert I'm Talking about\nOther people that exist out they're mainly on the left I see it but the ignorance is even greater than just the news to it I I was when I was a when I was a bill collector in college I understood with the three branches of government where\nI went to twelve years I went to twelve years of school everybody wants to twelve years some of the vast majority of the population went to twelve years of school now joined eighth\nGrade and um you with the three branches of government were\nSeventy five Seventy five percent of the people in the United states do not they can't name one they can't name what is it all branches of the federal government right if you can't name all ... there's three of them we all know but if you can't name all three of them then you don't understand the separation of powers\nThe majority of people Seventy five percent of people could not named the freedoms and the first amendment to the constitution of the United states the majority couldn't name ... uh you know of of more than one freedom which was no dubbed the majority could name one freedom ...\nWhich is freedom of speech they couldn't even they couldn't even name that\nThat's more we understand how people may not know what the story when that we understand is why we exist and we understand that a lot of people call and say we learn stuff about it and so therefore we can go out and we can form our opinions and that's the way that you should do it but it goes more than just the news stories it's that after ... years among\nThe multiple stores are far more for my own opinion\nAbsolutely that's what we always say don't believe us go do your own research ship\nBut as far as the computer goes well I'm sixty years old I have been killed three of them so I'm not really that good with\nHim [laughter] I said wait a minute is that what it is that\nWhere do you know saving up for a new computer now 'cause it just died\nBut is that the Internet is that the Internet's fall during the fall [laughter] one of those [laughter] those little\n... about sixty dollars for a ...\nWhite by a computer dry cleaning I took it to professional repair person and they said they could fix it costs more than the bar on the computer [laughter]\nWow wow I'm not going to buy a ... with a standalone computer go they're cheaper little\nYeah Robert thank you so much for your call but I think you know when when I used to when I used to work or six days a week working twelve hours a day at the the steel mill\nUh uh I I remember that ah I I remember it because a lot of my work third shift remember listening to Larry King of the radio wasn't listen to music as well as in Larry King ah there really wasn't much other talk radio at that time\nBut you know gas or whatever else and you know paying attention to news reading books reading the newspaper\nI wanted to know what was going on but it isn't the fact just to let you do Robert we understand that people are busy I Know some of my really good friends part of the reason I'm good friends with them\nIs they never listen to me they really don't know a ... they're so busy in their career where they really don't know them a new show what's going on like a lot of our audience does because you're really into whether you're passionate about it for many of you as a hobby which is I think it's a great hobby to have\nA but the fact is they're not out there promoting and opinion that's to me the problem the confidence of the arrogance or or you have a particular narrative in your head of what's right so you pick up bits and pieces\nAnd you pro claim that you have absolute authority on a particular topic when after five seconds anybody in the know will tell you you don't know what you're talking about right and that's it's the air is not having the lack of knowledge on a particular area\nThere's too many things for people to know there's things on on topics that I have no clue of and I'm not going to try to be us my way through it I'm not going to go into the mechanic today\nAt one time I was able to tear apart an engine and put it back together again I couldn't even adept that today and if I went in and started pointing out tubes and started saying well this does that and that does this and this does that\nA modern day mechanic would look at me and say you're full of it you have no idea what's going on and that's the problem that I see people that are so confident or maybe it's arrogant\nTo believe that they know exactly what's going on and after five seconds anybody that with any critical thinking skills will say I don't have a clue well where does that come from\nThere it's it's it's the citizen has greatly empowered by enact a or acting on\nInformation real information but\nThere's great risk to this country by people acting on lack of information that's the difference are being ignored for whatever reason whether you just choose not to follow the news or you're too busy or whatever it is is one thing\nActing regardless of how ignorant ignorant you are on the topic is the difference in today's world it's not just\nIssuing an opinion anymore on social media remember we saw last friday is why we're still talking about cabinet all it is to get in your face or what they call the direct approach\nAnd the media is helping the media\nAs NBC and all of them are helping spread the lives just by giving them a forum\n[noise] you're you're there's two problems so there are people that are ignorant and willfully ignorant and wanting to form opinions based on their ignorance and then there's those in the media that understand the ignorance and understand if we lie to them and as we've said before and we talked about this last week blind by omission\nWere newspaper articles will say we didn't lie it there's not an untruth in here you have a ... threat which gives a completely different slant to the story and leads people in a different direction from the truth that is a lie that line by omission right\n\nAnd they understand as we said Jonathan Gruber set it we can lie to these people I'm sure we can lie to the stupid\nAmerican public will remember buzzfeed politic claim or a disclaimer on that story they knew they couldn't verify we have no way to verify any of this we're ... we're going with it anyway back to centrally what NBC did yesterday\nWith the the third accuser as she's being called they gave her an interview when they admit it as a news organization they could not corroborate any of that and as her own story was falling apart yes and she backed out of her own story\n\nAnd then NBC nightly news decides not to run an an actual official part of the proceeding and that is a woman who was brought in\nThe prosecutor was brought in to do the questioning\nIssued a member NBC ignores what's real and put on display in front of all of\nAmerica or the few people still watching something that is that they themselves say we're not able to corroborate any of this the New York times\nInterviewed dozens of individual individual people and could not\nFind anyone with first hand knowledge of her claim and she's now walking back her own claim that doesn't matter [noise]\nAh we don't tend to go to a call but Mike in Indiana wanted to say the Feinstein ... she wants the presumption of innocence and the letter leak my that's beautiful yeah because there's more evidence there there is why I circumstantial evidence and a presumption of wait a minute\nSomebody one of the Democrats most likely leaked it no I Want the presumption of innocence mhm that's a great point ... yep eight six six tiny red eye\nIt's engine report is brought to you by Detroit\n...
