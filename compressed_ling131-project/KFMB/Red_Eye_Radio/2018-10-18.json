Hi Mark I'm [noise]\nFlorida and Texas those two states are the two you get all that the Democrats would really like to add to their progressive crown and I have to say\nThat I Am very concerned about the race when governor and senator and Florida and the rates that senator in Texas and I really haven't heard very much about it but um I get the feeling that it's not going to well in Florida I don't know about Texas but\nI don't know if you have any insight to what's going on there I Know that I'm a several hundred thousand people have migrated from Puerto Rico to Florida\nAfter that terrible hurricane last year and the Democrats were in a very big hurry to get them registered to vote because\nThey can vote or an ... in Florida I don't know what insight you have you heard about those two states\nAnd I had to live in Florida\nAnd I really can't have with them because they're they just do not want to talk about politics\nYeah and that's another topic I have down for tonight I don't know if we'll get to it about what your relatives and friends think of you if you're on the conservative side of you still get to keep them\nBut I Do have inside in Texas I I think Cruz is going to win and I don't think there's any doubt about that the numbers seem to be showing that he's pulling away I think that's their fool's gold like he was for Republicans in Pennsylvania for the longest time although we finally won at\nFlorida as more problematic you're correct I handed the numbers the numbers I saw a little while ago showed that\nUh we could be were behind in the governor's race I think the senatorial race is is also easy so that will depend on who turns out you're absolutely right and how many are illegal votes they can get from people outside of the country on the Democrats' side\nBut you know I think we're starting to come back to the Senate I'm more worried about the house than I Am about the Senate\nI think I've got friends individual yeah go ahead\nNo I was going to say I'm concerned about to have to I don't know what the ... congressional\nUm situation there too and I'm In you know Florida or Texas but um I don't understand you know I also don't understand why\nThe ... when you look at the politicians and they they talk why don't they appeal to the Democrats\nWho live in those states I mean the Democrats are doing very well in those states and you don't they understand that they're going to have a ten percent tax\nIf the governor's race take one by the Democrats in Florida\nAnd he wants to do a lot of radical things and you got that gentleman a couple of callers ago that you know the states are\nThey can do a lot of things they can do I'm a single payer\nHealth care they can do a lot of things on their own um as an individual state and I don't understand why Democrats don't\nYou don't understand that for their own their own them being down there I just don't understand it and why are not the politicians including Democrat to invest and and you know be trying to appeal to them\nYou mean Republicans well the answer is people just don't follow it that much and they don't understand it as I've been saying tonight is it's very hard to explain the conservative and Republican position\nEspecially when the Democrats is much more emotional you know hope and change 'em a woman's right to choose whatever phrase they use live livable wage these things are on the surface if you don't explored\nThey oh that sounds like a pretty good idea yeah or equal pay for women have they have no idea the background that they're talking about a term but the same job necessarily\nA and that would make sense for business too if they could get paying women less why they wouldn't have all women so a lot of leftist and liberal positions are defeated will but it takes a while to explain and you have to understand more so the answer your question is\nWhy do people vote to pay more taxes themselves many times they don't understand and the Democrats love hiding that anyway\nJust like now they they don't want to talk about that they really want to impeach the president Nancy Pelosi even said oh we're not going to talk about that now because they know that I think the overwhelming majority of American people did not want to go for impeachment again I was wrong I was for it with Bill Clinton and what happened you won reelection\nUm people's ... people basically don't want to go through that and that's where the Democrats by the way overplay their hand with Kevin Oh I think even people who are not conservatives looked at that hearing and saying wait a second that was really ugly that was really unfortunate what they did the gentleman whether she was telling the truth or not in terms of what she believes leaves leaving that aside\nThey treated him some badly the American people tend to be very fair and and so they are the Democrats have to hide that they want to raise taxes when Dukakis by the way of announcing that he didn't want to raise taxes the last big time\nSo let me know what you think at uh eight six six Ninety red eye and we'll take your calls on legal immigration or anything else that you want to talk about but right now is your national forecast for video roadblock\nLake effect snow off Lake Ontario on portions of I Ninety will leave a light dusting of snow near Syracuse Rochester buffalo slick roads not expecting a lot of snow with a system\nOn Lake Erie now from Erie PA oh to Cleveland, Ohio on I. eighty over to Toledo not expecting snow a little too warm in the region the mid west northeastern fact everyone east of the Mississippi today will be under high pressure and that means clear skies rain for Texas continues today we're\nSo you you mean well and you pass something and then people figure out how to take advantage oh I Would do the same thing by lived a say in Asia\nAnd the thing I could get my kids have American citizenship if they're just born here well I'm going to time my trip so that I have a baby yeah of course they could go wrong if the baby's late I guess very late but they figure out how to take advantage of your dumb laws that that happens a lot let's go to a\nJeremiah Wright speaking of fraud Jeremiah in Nashville or Jeremiah\nOwners mark Yes sir hey I'm your on your mark they don't well\nGreat I'm well I'm I recently had a had a relationship um she got pregnant three weeks into the marriage um she's an illegal immigrant um she got pregnant um well\nI wanted to make sure that everything was okay we got married uh got married and then\nShe ... she left she's gone and it's the fast track to a green card now the way they have you ever heard of the way they act and I'm just\nNot touching up from what the previous a previous speaker was talking about\nUm you know people don't know about this a whole lot um they don't know about the fact that you can come here illegally have a have a\nYou know get pregnant and then just totally disregard everything and then live off the government um you can't get deported you can um you know all that I don't\nKnow if you've ever no I don't know if you've ever heard about anything like that but I just wanted to I wanted to share with the people 'cause this this is an issue I mean people come here all the time they they want to get married they want to get pregnant and then they want to\nJust stay here and and uh it it's an amazing thing I'll I'm going my life has been turned upside down it's it's been an amazing experience I'm I'm having to live with it you know with a lawyer\n... everything that I guess you don't ... you don't see your child then [noise] no\nNo um they do restraining orders I'm under the way the actors it's the women against violence I'm at I'm\nSo if you come here and you charge somebody with with anything um you are here it's the fast track to a green card and\n... and you know um I I Would probably I'll run out of time this week but I was going to have someone on top of my father's rights and what happens is the court system and and the family court so that just a total disaster let's go to George in Huntsville, Alabama Georgia Iran with mark\nMoran Mart\nI keep hearing these wonderful term thrown around that I think our mainstream media has created and every once in a latch don't do\nBut I think it's also a misnomer we do not have illegal immigration we haven't in Beijing going on these are not undocumented immigrants they're invaders from foreign countries and we're being invaded by the failures of the other act [noise]\n[noise] no you're right no argument there yeah there was\nAny if it was their military doing it we would be returning fire why are we sitting here so complacent late allowing this to happen this is absurd\nIt is absurd and it happens because there are people on the other side of have an agenda they don't believe in borders they don't believe there's anything special about the United states of America Says the United states they just see it differently than we do and they they want to fulfill their agenda that's what you're up against the\nPresident Trump was smart enough to make that his top issues not at least one of his top issues and the American people responded and I think they did it correctly let's go to the swimming could calls here and let's go to Stan in wire loosing Pennsylvania I'd probably miss that ups than Iran with mark\n[laughter] Oh thank you mark or Greek call you know you're got a great program there are really appreciate it I'm actually a Jersey in who's visiting here and so I'm a escaped your enemy territory for a while\nHopefully we can get ... out of their\nUh God but um I was calling basically uh uh I guess illegal voting I Know where he heard something on the or the radio a while back about Clinton and the DNC and how they were taking busloads of\nPeople [noise] illegals not only voting but bringing them into other states to vote in other states\nAnd it was like really absurd and I was sick and I'm happy to stop that\nInto other states to vote in other states\nAnd it was like really absurd and are sick and I'm\nHappy to stop that [noise] and if you remember like during the uh what we were sitting up governments here in Afghanistan or Iraq after the war is [noise] they were taking a people who are voting and dying their ... their thumb purple\nYou know they couldn't vote more than once\nAnd I'd say like if we can do that overseas why couldn't we do that here so we wouldn't have known not only illegals but people voting more than once in a you know disenfranchising other people's vote and uh\nBut you you you know the whole controversy over for a voter id at the other side made money doesn't want any part of voter id like that's the big crime to ask someone to yeah you are it let me see if you are who you say you are\nSo you're not committing voter fraud or voting illegal but yeah the oh or being races were made in this you know how can you do that yet I by the way my position is different than most people I don't want people to vote unless they care enough to put some for some effort I'm worried about the people who voted don't know that much or or get to vote on the same day voting right and all that kind of stuff\nThat that was the other thing I think it's also about uh you said the voter id they make such a big gripe about how difficult it is\nAnd I'm saying you know well how about on election day when somebody goes in to vote and you know you have to sign if you voted before you know they compare your signature and everything like that and while you're there voting where they just take your picture\nAnd start the process of creating a voter id then you're already there it's not like you had to go someplace to you know to get a voter\nId you're already there so they take a picture of a person\nAnd say you a digital camera feed it into facial recognition say in a in a tri-state area and see if that per person pops up\nIn another war or district or state on the same day and you know you said a digital camera you could chicken chicken safe they voted\nPreviously on that day and age but at the same time he could be starting of voter id form you know they sign that you got the picture you do that you have their address\nAnd you know we have to fill out the card and a week or so you know or you go back and you bring to the id to them mail it to them [noise] and uh but at least should be able to compare because you have a photo of and\nTo see if they're voting in more than one place if they're registered and more than one place and well\nThere are two problems okay first the other side does it they want voted for ... ... I Know that do but there's another point that that you didn't think\nI don't know that your state but in California have you ever seen the people who work the polls I don't think they can handle something as complicated as taking pictures\nOr they can't even find my name is the top five Pennsylvania yes or no I didn't know originally you know I'm right right so you're going to people who are you oh my God that you go over to that table you're in the wrong place if they can't even figure it out\nAnd if I ever won the ... provisional ballot yeah it is scary so if you had it also gives them cameras to take the picture I don't think so but you have stand you have a selected ideas have put in that kind of work I have a great evening\nOr tell you one one thing I did have a winning to vote one time it was a primary and uh I had a I asked them if I can have you know a write in ballot right\nAnd uh and he said oh yeah yeah you you can never write in doubt I walked in there and it wouldn't take it\nFor and it was like\nTotally amazing or you know what's going on you know and he said well uh [noise]\nOh oh you know you're a you're wanted vote Republican goes uh or or Democrat I couldn't vote or they wouldn't let me do or writing ballot and I says well you said I could ... says oh no you have to tell us before you go into the booth whether you want to write in ballots are not\nRight yeah I\nI thought it was I thought it was gonna be worse than I thought it was gonna say you can only a write in on the Democrats like you can't run if you're a Republican hey why my laughing voter

corporate income taxes when we took our individual rights down and did very well economic quite a lot of Eastern European countries after they left the Soviet Union their individual rights like Fifteen Percent Hungary it's business tax nine percent\nWere very ... we had the highest business taxes in the world and then we sat around Greg how come we can't compete you know with China and Germany and stuff like that and Ireland to Ireland's business taxes twelve and a half percent a\nWeek what thirty thirty five plus an average of ... percent by state and local governments so really thirty nine ... on average and uh the Republicans took that down to Twenty one\nAnd it made us more competitive on the tax ... than most of the country's law\nYeah average European has about twice what attempt voice better than what we used to be you know we were thirty five they were twenty five and they would beat it was somebody to take a million dollars I was in Brazil invested ... million dollars what do I put it\nShe invested I take those jokes thirty five percent of everything I if I put it in Germany at all sure are and we shipped to that yeah we have seen a ... a diversion of foreign direct investment [noise] out of your\nIt did I get a for starters there was a a five hundred billion dollars half a trillion dollars last six months which was earnings by American companies over shapes and we used to have a lot until the Republican tax reform\nWhich was arranged by American companies over seats and we used to have a lot until\nThe Republican tax reform punished you if you brought laid back that states elected overseas as maybe three trillion dollars that the leftovers shapes um partly because largely because our tax policy said we will hurt you it's going to bring the money back and if you don't bring it back that's okay\nA show ... trillion stuck overseas because our tax policy and we said you know we're not doing that anymore if you earn money and I'd stay to attach it but if your money in print French people takes time\nAnd then we have to bring up the whole the America good ... no penalty for bringing back a bit about that and that\nWe've seen a tremendous again half a trillion dollars by it and come back last six months and an apple\nThey said look we have two hundred and Ninety billion dollars or earnings overseas save ... billion right back and said you know what because it's no longer had allies to boot buddy from London to New York or Texas um\nWe've read all back now it's all coming back but right now where they live in London back because it doesn't matter in terms of our access to capital whether it's in London or in Arkansas are whereas before it ...\nShow the money might as well already be back but we've seen a half to try and come back and we'll see more as a as we move forward\nAdded that guy's overseas you know German and French people and a Brazilian making decisions are shelling that money to the United states rather than the receipts this really irritating your tips because we're much more competitive than we used to be and it's been a big help\n[noise] yeah I Know I can see why is it just seems so obvious to all these things seem so obvious to me I have a couple of more questions and we're going to get some of the callers questions for you also but right now we're going to take her get our national forecast for um detracts\nLake effect snow off Lake Ontario on portions of I Ninety will leave a light dusting of snow near Syracuse Rochester buffalo slick roads not expecting a lot of snow with the system\nOn Lake Erie now from Erie PA oh to Cleveland, Ohio on eighty over to Toledo not expecting snow a little too warm in the region the mid west northeastern fact everyone Easter the Mississippi today will be under high pressure and that means clear skies rain for Texas continues today\nI not only agree with that I wrote that in the paper like freshman year at Harvard and they like to me that they said you know this has come from a conversation I had with the IRS I called the by phone\nAnd said if they did if he didn't hold taxes out of every paycheck every\nTwo weeks looks dead when somebody who said send the check like electric bill and Melinda or on April fifteenth said send the check the whole year and the ... the IRS pushed I was talking to I interviewed for the cars right he said there'd be a revolution it [laughter]\nOut there well I think if someone had to ride you know check five has little ten twenty whatever there would be you'd have a new Tea Party right\nOr any of these days with Barry yeah it make it clear actually packed New Mexico I promised a color to mark in Albuquerque New Mexico you're on with mark and with Grover Norquist [noise]\nThank you I appreciate it up to what you just two words right out of my mouth and here's what I've always thought flat tax and it's seven percent or\nClose to port it don't matter whether you're right a Warren Buffett or whether you're the guy work down there McDonalds seven percent limit they every deep Doug seem that there is\nAs far as a a with tech fuel eliminate all federal tax is whether it's the\nField tax that we pay or whether Social Security income tax you name but the federal tax it no longer exists you will limit the sixteenth and bad\nSecurity income tax you name but the federal tax it no longer exists you will eliminate the six teams that bad but and then in order to\nRaise taxes if you're going to do it as Congress that means you have to have a super majority of both the house in the Senate to foot the bill on the president's desk for him to sign up\nFor it be for it to become a ballot\nOr the election of on every two years if that's what they're going to do and it requires a super majority of all register voters in order for the taxes to be re and I think\nYou know and as you just mentioned it does it come out of your pay check you write the check\nEvery month or every quarter\nAnd believe me when people realized how much they're paying out and taxis they would\nThey would there would be a revolution in this country like you would not believe 'cause I was self employed and I had to write that check every quarter I couldn't believe how much I was helping to pay taxes [noise]\nInteresting groove or what do you think of that to his idea\nI think he's right and a number of the ideas you put out there are in state constitutions uh in California and Nevada or if you if the government wants to raise taxes state but wants to raise taxes\nIt's a two thirds voted legislature because taxes are about as permanent as constitutional amendments which you take two thirds\nOr to impose on people\nAnd if you say it takes two thirds to raise taxes\nIt really slows the tax and spend down doesn't stop completely but it really slows down it has to be a really good idea\nIt has to have broad support a to an act and it I think a flat tax with a super majority to raise taxes uh would dramatically change our policy carry [noise]\nWhat do you think about some people propose the sales tax consumption tax so what's your response to that\nIn Europe they have a value added tax which is a sales tax at every\nStep of production if you're going to have a twenty percent sales tax is on the opinion countries do you really have to you can't just collect it at the supermarket\n'cause everybody would buy their stuff going down the street from the supermarket out the back of a truck a so they put that twenty percent at every level of production the farmer pays that the guy who\nTrucks goods into town pays a twenty percent on his value added to get ... percent tax but little amounts and there's no one place we can avoid it or the difference between the United states and Europe is Europe\nAnd has a sales tax of a national sales tax a value added tax which gets every level of a production [noise] ah it's why they have higher taxes than we do they have to put it on taxes and high income taxes but you can only get so much money out of an income tax\nPeople will quit working out work around it hide money um when you add to that the difference between the United States Europe is that we don't have that and they do we don't have a sales tax they do tend to say no no no we want to\nSweat reading the income tax and have a national sales tax tax in staff but it's kind of what they promised to your hands on the Japanese and the Asians and and the Africans when they put that send overseas\nOr it will be in addition to it will not be instead of and if we could and I'm for\nGranted income tax down towards Sarah I'm what you want to do is we just spend it not just turn it into a different tax what who cares if you've got right the income tax and took the exact same amount of money out of ... how would that change anything it's the same amount of money out of your pocket or it\nIt makes you feel better somebody else's writing the check but everything you buy from your house cheer car cheer cheer food your clothes would cost more that that the taxes would be hidden in that so um\nI think going into a single rate tax income tax or and reducing spending is to go to that if you got\nTaxes down enough that you could shift from a ten percent income tax too you know a Fifteen Percent sales tax it's got it's got to be a plot or a bad yeah I I wouldn't mind that but you got to get the government to half its presence size before you could\nCome back and you really have kept protections\nHow do we know we're not going to end up with both an income tax and the sales tax\nTrue many countries have had been hit with that\nAnd there's no incentive and the politicians because they get their money campaign contributions right here as part of this hey you know give me this donation someone on a lower your taxes this they don't want to think solved eventually right that would reduce their campaign contributions from Port on my part [noise]\nHaving taxes that are complicated allows politicians to raise money ah to protect people bit by bit where everyone's you're paying a one percent in the same percentage less ... less opportunities to make money for politicians\nAnd lawyers and counts maybe my final question for you will maybe I've got two more what about the midterm how do you know what do you know if if the Democrats ... take the house what do you think about what's going to have X. situation [noise]\nIf the Democrats take the house there'll be no tax cuts for the next two years or they will be pushing for tax increases that while at least a trillion dollars in higher taxes Hillary ran on raising taxes by a trillion dollars over decades at least to try and I'm\nFrom where we were we cut taxes uh trading and a half ... they want to raise them I Try and from what we were so that is true and a half trillion dollars in taxes\nPer decade that they wanted to increase taxes they'll be pushing for that I I think with both Trump and the Republican Senate that they will get a tax increase but they'll sit there and say\nHey if you want the military to get pay will only do that ... only passed a budget ...\nAh the soldiers and airmen and Tim and buy it if you get any tax increase\nThey ... they will spend two years trying to get a tax increase [noise] um I Hope they will fail that is what I Will be working on 'em by Democrats on the tax issue like teenage boys\nOn a Sunday they keep asking for the same thing in different ways they just again and again and again that keep coming back I Want one thing going higher taxes are and they will ask that question\nTwenty different ways of the green taxes it will save the planet that will be\nPaying the taxes that only paid the other people\nAnd they will ask that question twenty different ways of going taxes it will save the planet that would be\nThe taxes that only paid the other people a day while we pack into the same tax increase and Daschle ways\nMay maybe a new Supreme Court tax to pack the court who knows they can come up with anything\nIs going to talk about fairly I didn't hear that yeah yeah I hear\nA lot of us want to get out of it and they want to re of Britain proposed a tax for at bourbon or course prison Americans for tax reform that people get in touch with you\nAt our website it's H. E. R. dot org ah and we have ... all of the companies that have ways to pay raise benefits um the tax cuts kind of a chair dot org and like I I I ...
