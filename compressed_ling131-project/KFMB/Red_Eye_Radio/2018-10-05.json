Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh according to the summary released by the Republican committee majority\nFBI agents interviewed ten people in reached out to eleven focusing only on witnesses with potential first and knowledge\nOf alleged sexual misconduct by cabinet and\nThe FBI provided to the Senate twelve detailed thrilled to reports summarizing their interviews with the witnesses\nAs well as supporting materials cited by the witnesses during their interviews among those question where mark judge PJ Smith Leland Kaiser the three individuals Christine Ford claimed were president when Capitol allegedly through or on the bed and sexually assaulted her some time in the Nineteen eighties\nUh all all three of those individuals had already provided statements to the Judiciary Committee under penalty of federal bell of a felony denied any knowledge of the alleged assault ties were Ford's lifelong best friend or denied ever knowing Kavanaugh when questioned about ... statement\nAt last Thursday's hearing Ford suggested Kaiser was having serious medical issues and had apologized for her denial\nA judge was also questioned extensively about other allegations\nOf besides for the FBI also interviewed to individuals' names in Kavanaugh's calendar entry which some observers said could have described the gathering where she was purportedly attack\nThose individuals where his longtime friend Christopher Garrett and Timothy got debt whose house cabinet went to for beers according to his calendar an attorney for one of those witnesses was also interviewed finally the FBI interviewed ... mirrors the woman who claimed\nIn an explosive New Yorker piece of Kavanaugh had exposed himself\nTo her ... party the FBI also interviewed to alleged eye witnesses identified ... mirrors and tried to interview a third but that individual refused to cooperate agents also interviewed one of ... close friends from college the supplemental background check investigation confirms\nWhat the Senate Judiciary committee concluded efforts investigation there is no cooperation of the allegations made by Dr Ford or Mrs Ramirez the district committee Republicans wrote\n\nVery ... and they went after people I remember ... forty different people for them to talk to her twenty would ever was ... and the FBI said don't only people that you claim were their first hand knowledge you're say doesn't count right\nSo tell us you know tell us who was there who you claim was there ever will interview those people that had first hand you claim have first hand knowledge we're going with your claims you tell us what they did\nDallas right they did know cooperation right for either ... or or for it so interesting to know that that's what that is what it has come out in the summary well\nWhat's interesting here is that it was likely going to happen anyway but you mentioned this uh believe it was yesterday or the program and and we were we were wondering in this process because of the rule the Senate rule that keeps the details in those three oh two reports a secret\nAnd can be viewed only by a hundred people\nThe there is going to be inevitably there is going to be a a summary overall to tell us essentially gay or nay if there is something new there or something more to this investigation in other words something to substantiate the claims by Dr Ford and were mirrors\nAnd\nThat summary of you if you look at it by the the Judiciary Committee is basically I think in part works to the effect\nOf as you mentioned yesterday would they be trying to give some of this information out so the Democrats don't have the claim that this wasn't a thorough background check the facts of the matter is\nYou're not going to you're only going to interview people with first hand knowledge or people that were said to have had first hand knowledge anyone else isn't going to be included in that process the point being\nThe leftist screaming all day long on Thursday which was predictable and we said it was going to happen this is something that you know that that uh this was a cover up\nThat that's the words they were using its a cover up no it's not\n\nBecause Dr

ACLU or any organization or protester right now that is chanting the same thing\nThen wait for it because at some point one of you will be falsely accused [noise]\nYou know when they say believe the survivor at that particular point mhm\nJust alone believe the you don't believe the survivor which means believe the person making the obligation right well actually believe the survivor actually means believe that people make believe the person making the allegation if they're if they are in favor of the political issue the the the actual\nA background political issue that we're really dealing here as long as\nIt's someone on our side that's making the accusation yes we all know that's what we all know is what it really means what to say believe the survivor means you believe the person making the allegation irrespective of any other evidence that exist right\nBecause you can't say believe the survivor and ended up that no you can't you can't that's on American to say that that's an American that not believing in the constitution it's not believe in an individual rights\nIt's everything that the ACLU used to stand for that now they reject completely and Tucker Carlson

opening ten people\nAnd found no just just came out late last night no cooperation of the allegations made by a two of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's accuser is according to an executive summary\nUh released a in fact it was early this morning it was released actually wasn't late last night according to this report\nThe request was torn investigation into the uh current credible allegations\nAgainst justice Kavanaugh read the report released by Chuck Grassley the summary stage that the FBI investigators reached out this is from the Washington Examiner by the way the summary states at the FBI investigators reached out to all witnesses\nWith potential first hand knowledge of the allegation so there it is the FBI investigators reached out to all witnesses with potential first hand knowledge of the allegations we've heard from\nA the ... lawyer said well no she had twenty people she wanted them to talk to them all they cared about was anybody that potentially had first hand knowledge not hearsay right where are you there right can you back up before we go any further investigation can you backup that this actually happened\nInvestigator spoke with six people in an effort to cooperate the allegations against capping off\nBy California professor ah Christine Blasey Ford who testified in front of the committee that Kavanaugh had held her down put his hand over her mouth and tried to remove her clothes at a party in Maryland while the two were in high school in eighty two those witnesses include mark judge ... ties are PJ a Smith\nA Timothy God debt and Christopher Garrett the FBI investigators also spoke with\nA another attorney for one of the witnesses mark judge a close friend of Kavanaugh's\nWas allegedly in the room when Ford was assaulted in

and a close college friend Vermeer as a third suppose that I witnessed refused to speak to investigators\nParticipation in FBI background check interviews is voluntary the supplemental background investigation was ordered by uh the White House at the request of the uh a committee\nOr forty six page report is what it was and uh as we now know none of those witnesses that supposedly had and they went through all the witnesses at that potentially had first hand knowledge mhm and no cooperation to get\nYeah right and and that's again the [noise] when when you look at it\nThere was nothing was going to change here nothing was going to change this gets back to the one thing they wanted to do all of a long delayed delayed divide with\nThe outside hope of having either Kavanaugh himself or the president would draw the nomination and that wasn't going to happen I mean the the the the louder the less got\nThe the greater or I guess the stronger a foot hold got by the president and of course the nominee himself\nThis was a tactic by the left to delays is nothing more nothing less put this off\nAnd hope that you can appeal to either one party or the other other along the way uh whether it's Grassley or flake or anybody that will help you delayed even further\nAnd that's over it is over\nI don't know what the vote looked like on Saturday Night or early Sunday Morning but it's going to happen\nCenter gains from South Dakota said and and called a cabinet and said he will be there for the vote yet he will vote a no matter what it takes for him to get back from his daughter's

[laughter] it's about as close as you can get her for conservatives go from all over the world to hang out together you know there's I think it was like because you don't get what he said he's not welcome snow Dershowitz said he's not welcome on Martha's Vineyard I actually asked this question in my mind\nUh because a friend a well I actually someone in the house was watching something where there was um there was this area and it was clear in this area it was all liberals they were it was part of reality t._v. show\nBut the the based on the things that people were saying and show it was clearly a liberal and I kinda thought thought of Martha's Vineyard because it kind of had that appeal looked like that right and I thought to myself\nThere isn't a conservative place like that [laughter] and there really isn't I mean because I don't know I mean you don't I well we don't look for safe spaces\n[laughter] a number on it by water is such a safe [laughter] you really have to make an effort to get their Martha's Vineyard the safe space for the elite liberal well there's the thing too it's only about the rich liberal so rich that ridge elite liberal you're right\nAll right

I ... I Hope I got a cute I read your\nTrial for false and Italy\nQuestions we ...\nWe should not move on to another candidate\nThat was senator Spartacus in New Jersey [noise]\n[noise] huh Tucker Carlson that was the senators Bartlett yeah when I was I was doing the ...\nOver Cory Booker\nWhat oh that's where he still doesn't matter whether is innocent or not there's been enough questions raised that he should drop out yeah [laughter] so if you just raise just are all the allegations yeah and and there's quite a weight loss theirs was later on and said he goes yeah I I Know what I said what do you think about it because we've been through this already McCarthy\n... you're not a communist right exactly\nThat's exactly what the same thing that liberals were outraged about yet now would they endorse exactly\nFour on attracts user forecast\nThe desert southwest back under dry conditions after what was hurricane Rosa has moved north where it will the stretches of by ten mainly clear today with the exception of far western Texas there is a moderate to risk of excessive rainfall however from eastern Iowa\nInto far northwestern Illinois and south western Wisconsin\nWith a larger risk area extending back into the central plains so you can look to use the wipers for a good portion of the day today on sections of by eighty in Illinois and Iowa and from I thirty five\nI found very very few of them for example today seven hundred law professors signed a letter they asked me to sign I refused I wrote a dissent saying he now no longer has the judicial temperament well can you imagine if this were a liberal who had been appointed by liberal president who had been accused and it would act and similarly\nI don't think a single one of those professors would have signed that letter they will fail the shoe on the other foot test\nSenator Booker why I like it no it's just dead wrong this is all about partisanship defeat opposite was happening and if it was the Democrats who are putting up candidate everybody would behaving the opposite way and so it is partisanship\nAnd I think the framers of our constitution never intended the confirmation process to look anything like I agree\nYeah I ... and and that's it I mean we we talk about the process you know it's it's telling that we're at this point instill at this point in fact heightened your you'll likely see the chaos heightened today and tomorrow up until the main vote on so late Saturday or\nEarly Sunday Morning whenever it happens but we're at this point but it is all of this chaos\nBefore the actual vote and what is it that that matters it's only about the vote I mean this is further proof that this was only about the delay delay it as long as you can in hopes\nAn outside hope I guess that Kavanaugh would pull his own confirmation and withdraw his own confirmation and or the president would do it\nUm that wasn't going to happen or the once once the left got loud that wasn't going to happen but this president and and now we know very clearly it certainly isn't going to happen by the nominee himself but\nYou look at this entire process and it has been distorted greatly there is no guarantee here the the cabinet we will be confirmed with the actual legitimate process of all of this and place well\nYou know when you when you hear Dershowitz or talk about you know McCarthyism ... and and what happened at that time when\nYou know you someone who accuse you of being a communist and so you'd get enraged and they'd say well sorry you don't have the temperament the allegation itself meant you were blacklisted right the the the fact that you lost it at anything was used an a you know against you\nAre and I thought there's which you know really when he said you said so you've been a director forty years and now you're losing control because somebody's calling you a combination of the temperament for the job so you're on your blacklisted from the the ... you know from the industry\nAnd it's something that liberals used to have in their mind and\nI think the important thing is and it's obvious because you and I have been having this discussion a back and forth because it is the left\nIt is you know ... we call it the supposed to be anti fascist yet what are they promote what is their actual mindset it's authoritarianism and his fascism is it you must live the life that that that we that that we wish you to live\nAnd what you see here what you see here from the Democrats the mindset that they're promoting everybody that you see Michael Moore and Amy Schumer and whatever whatever Hollywood people are down there screaming and yelling about you know a Brett Brett Kavanaugh and believe me it's user that\nUser that the the the defendant has no rights at all the defendant is automatically guilty\nThat is the mindset of a fascist yes that's not the mindset of somebody who believes in the American constitution and the spirit of America and the spirit of due process in the spirit of the bill of rights of the United states it is the mindset of a fashion\nWell and and what we call somebody when we say they have the mindset of the fascist we back it up with specifics\nNot just oh he talks mean therefore he's a fascist no\nWinners exact words and what does he actually wish to implement we talked about President Trump\nAnd you know they started on that uh and now they\nMoved on and this is a very very important thing for people to understand that I think that's what this is what maybe you're not in the Republican Party it started with Trump\nAnd enough people hate the Trump where it's stuck for a while\nAnd then they decided to move on from Trump and they moved on to Kavanaugh and all of a sudden the realization as we said all along it was a bogus argument completely bogus and allies against Trump to begin with but then they moved to somebody else\nWho more people look at and say when all this is somebody who we really really like\nThis is somebody who we really would like in that position as much if you don't like Trump this was a great great great great pick and then you see the same tactics used against Trump that might have been okay for some people because they despised him so much somehow hit somebody they like and then they realized oh no if it can hit him that it can hit him\nOh my God they can come after me next thing go after anybody and that's what you learn with the fascists mindset they'll pick out an attractive target to get people you know motivated behind them even people of you know well of goodwill\nAnd all of a sudden those people have good will wake up one day and say and sometimes they wake up in a society and it's too late it's not too late here in the United states and it's not too late in this instance\nAnd it looks like that because people have fought back\nAre you now have you know created this unity in the Republican Party but remember it only goes so far because people of good will buy into it at times yes because it fits their political narrative but it is the mind what you're seeing is the mindset of a fascist\nAnd the fascist in this case is not the Republicans eight is the Democrats and it's not debatable\nWell I mean it's very simple when you look at the group that says they're anti fascist and their name in fact this condensed down to those condensed from those two words\n\nThere is a group that's willing to go out and hurt people use violence against people they disagree with\nPunish people\nFor thought they're the ones who are acting on it they're the ones in California who create laws that if you don't talk the way we want you to talk\nWe can send you to jail in New York we can find your business to the extent that you will be out of this tell me that's\nNot fascist you you don't create the ours\nThat somebody wishes you to create we will destroy your business\nYou wear a hat you go to a restaurant and try and have a peaceful dinner we will come on to that private property and we will shout you out\nYou think like us you behave like us you reject the bill of rights and if you don't we will destroy your life\n\nRepublicans are finally coming around and uniting realizing oh my God\nThat's what that party has become and it's not the fringe this is the important thing a bit of this is not the fringe this is the mainstream yeah this is the Senate Judiciary committee it's the mainstream power of the republic or some of the Democratic party\nAnd you have\nA vaccine waters who doesn't get any grief from the left for saying this is what we need you to do this is what we want you to do go out and get in their face\nEvery chance you get\nAnd all of a sudden you've got pushed back yeah right because the average American will put up or for a while until all of a sudden it's like whoa okay\nThe lines been crossed and I believe many people believe now that this line has been crossed I Hope they do let me put it this way I'm not going to make the prediction that they have yet it seems that they have\nBut my hope is that the American people have had enough yeah and that more people will start rejecting\nThe the mindset of fascism that is being promoted by the mainstream of the Democratic party yeah as we're always say tell us where we're wrong\nYou can't eight six six Ninety red eye\nHow much do you know about synthetic oil

synthetic oils have a ... system molecular restructure giving them the ability to support pressures from iron horse power engines especially at lower rpm ... it also allows oil to reduce friction in an engine controlling temperatures and improving fuel economy\nVery cleaner synthetic pickup fewer contaminants as they do their job of lubrication they also have better oxidation stability\nResulting
