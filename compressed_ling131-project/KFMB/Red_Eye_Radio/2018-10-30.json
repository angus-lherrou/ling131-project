believe that overheated political rhetoric causes mass murder compare their opponents to Nazis and ISIS without hesitation yeah [noise]\nThink about it but the ones that that are trying to make that point are the ones without the most out right just accusations\nAgainst their opponents the ultimate bean that an incoming president colluded with the Russians to hack the election mhm and they hounded that year in and year out\nYou know it's uh when when you look at it we just said you know talked about you know the whole law corrupting with Hillary Clinton and how the Democrats have jumped on that same see how in civil he is this is how radical they are they're saying lock her up lock her ... and we'd just explain why\nBut we had right earlier to\nHave the analysis of the Democrats running on health care increase wages and getting rid of government corruption ... wait a minute they only what's the what is the only government corruption that we know of\nWhat is the the the biggest ally looked into the living room of government corruption many people believe it's that Hillary absolutely broke the law and was not prosecuted because of it\nIt's ... it's the entire Russian collusion as we're learning more it's the allegation from the Democrats over and over again that this president ... go you know a a as in their own words\nAre committed treason because he colluded with the Russians to hack\nThe election but it was changed the outcome of the election and what have we learned in that time\nIn that time we ... we have learned it is the opposite that it was the Democrats and the Hillary campaign\nThat actually paid money to a law firm that funneled that money to an opposition research firm which funneled that money to a former British spy who got on verified information that he claims unverified still to this day on true I think it's safe now\nSince there's never been any evidence in uh over two and a half years of investigation\nA of a false information from people close to the Kremlin that Donald Trump did all these heinous things that they used to try they wanted to destroy\nHis campaign when they couldn't do it they try to destroy the legitimacy of a presidential election in twenty sixteen\nThey also took that information and used it to get a secret warned against the opposition parties campaign you want corrupt possible corruption that's corruption yeah\nAs absolute ... how do you debate something like that I think ... debate those facts which documented for video road dog here's your forecast\nMultiple periods of rain and high

California and the great basin elevated fire concerns mainly along the Sierra front\nShe she made this comparison to ISIS and made this absurd statement because she believes she's bright not because she's trying to get attention not because of anything else she believes it was the right thing to say and that\nPeople agree with her on it that it's responsible to say that she believes in fact it's hurt responsibility to point out what is clearly blatantly falls but she thinks it's right\nOr looking here at some of the polling from Rasmussen which might affect the election next week more voters now commend President Trump for his economic leadership butter less impressed by his performance when it comes to foreign affairs that's good news though for Republicans facing election with voters said Trump and\nThe economy are the big issues the latest rash some reports national television and online survey finds of fifty one percent of likely us voters give the president good or excellent marks for handling the economy thirty three percent still rate his performance in this area as poor\nTrump's economic positive to continue to rise from thirty nine percent in August of last year now to a a fifty one percent forty nine percent gave his economic ... gave his economic of a performance good or excellent marks for months ago\nWhen it comes to foreign policy forty five percent of voters said Trump is doing a good or excellent job down slightly from forty seven percent in June\nForty four percent consider his performance poor but\nThe cab you out here just six percent rate national security as our top voting issue right so it's really not an issue but it's a point that I was going to make our said as long as\nWe're not we're as long as we're not in a war you know new a new war people don't care right or the we see a a survey this is what does this year the president's job approval rating\nHas been in the high forties or for most days in recent months speaking at a high end fifty one percent two weeks ago Trump's approval is tracking higher than President Obama's at this stage in the presidency on the Rasmussen poll\nPredictably eighty eight percent of Republicans think Trump is doing a good or excellent job of handling the economy but only Nineteen percent of Democrats agree well eighty percent of the GOP voters give positive remarks the president\nAnd his handling of foreign policy Seventy seven percent a of the Democrats say he is doing a poor job\nAmong voters not affiliated with either major party fifty one percent said Trump is doing a good or excellent job\nOn the economy but only forty three percent feel that way on a foreign policy the older the voter the more strongly they approve\nOf the president's job performance when it comes to both the economy and foreign policy while black unemployment is that a historic low blacks were much more critical of the president's economic performance than whites and other minority voters blacks are similarly unimpressed by the handling of his foreign policy\nEconomic and consumer confidence already is at near record highs is moving up again in the latest Rasmussen consumer spending an update now that's interesting to say that when it comes to economic things because I saw Rasmussen uh that uh he released a few hours ago the president's latest job approval rating\nAnd here's what he writes Trump approvals today back at fifty percent black voter approval at record high\nWhile we were talking about the economic can inform but overall they say Trump's black approval right now at a record high\nYeah well and and I I think right now you're seeing again everyday people this this is the question as it is with every election what is what is what are the American people thinking right\nBut but but really we're not talking about real things we're not talking about\nI mean in part on the positive side as the last caller pointed out you know he focuses on the winning which which I I Would assume we didn't get to ask him but I Would assume it would include the economy things that are going on the positive things that are going on with the economy\nBut but really it's it's not about that what drives the election right now if you think about it\nBecause there were conservatives before Kavanaugh there were conservatives that clearly recognized the positives and the economy but\nThey're still never ... they're still right now maybe going to sit on the sidelines for a while a number of them can't quantify it but let's just I think it's safe to say there were a number of them right\nSo there's that that part of the Republican Party that after Kavanaugh looked at it and said I'm OK the game has changed\nNow it really is about building this wall around the constitution as I've been saying it is\nIt's changed now it really is about building this wall around the constitution as I've been saying\nIt is about protecting the things that are very real and we can have our inhouse discussions on what to do here what to do their terror of no terrorists by the way we're the original tariffs babies\nAll of that can be discussed internally no problem we can have those very real debates on very real issues with no issues going forward because right now\nThe the the game has to be the end game must be protecting the constitution because the process is being ... it was it was all but shredded in terms of the confirmation process uh Brett Kavanaugh\nAh they were given way too much leeway but guess what ultimately it works\nI think to the benefit I don't know if that will actually showed that in the house of if it will mean a win for the Republicans in the house but it showed enough to bring the Republican Party together like I've never seen it\nIn a one thing I just wanted to bring up here 'cause we're talking about the different uh you know challenges out there you're talking about you know never Trump ... whatever you know maybe staying at home and I was thinking of a local story here you heard that the Dallas Morning news indoors a better or ... and they claim you know you hear the conservative\nThe conservative Dallas Morning news a conservative Dallas Morning news and the conservative Dallas Morning news yeah there's no way that you can be a conservative\nAnd support paid or not protect curves up no you're not a conservative and I started thinking when I saw that story to begin with\nHow many think about this in the media there seems to be what Jennifer Rubin for example I'm a Republican conservative no you're not sure not Republican conservative she's she's a liberal or a Max Boot who is the the former impact could talk to former conservative columnist to see the picture of him with stormy\nDaniels and the other day yeah like it's like wait a minute [laughter]\nYeah nice conserve your Stormy Daniels and he posted a picture of a him with Stormy Daniels like proudly on on uh on on a a a Twitter ... but it's just like it was most bizarre thing in the world and and you look at other you know you look at a a a um a Bill Kristol mhm ah who just has lost it you see John Case it\nOr who just you know completely have shown that they're not conservatives but you've got in in the media you have a ... a lot of different people who are claiming that there are conservatives and they're speaking for the conservative movement but they're not conservatives anymore and I don't mean because they're not supporting Trump\nOr I'm Talking about there any allergy has actually changed who they support actually changes ... you can sit there and say maybe I don't like Donald ... I don't like the uh Donald Trump but I don't like the fact that Cruz now is with Donald Trump and so I'm not going to vote for it to say you're voting for ... because\nBecause the ... the Ted Cruz and conservativism has failed you is the most bizarre thing on the planet you couldn't possibly say it makes no critical thinking sense at all\nYou're not a conservative why\nBecause as a conservative ... what is the most important thing and let's go to the late Andrew Breitbart who before he died was on our show and we asked him you know why should people vote for Romney back in twenty twelve ... Supreme Court\nYou know if Trump was done if Trump was done today I'd be happy\nI was I said that to a friend over the weekend or because they were like okay but but but the ... not even he's not able to get work done because then I said no he's he's got a lot done I said but but imagine even the tax cuts didn't get done\nI'd like to imagine that 'cause now I'm paying more in taxes let me let me imagine that would you please [laughter] um [laughter]\nBut I imagine that the you know there were a number of things and and imagine even though the economy more weren't growing as fast\nA ... and again we'll be happy ... there are a number of things here and again we don't it's not the we never share the endgame you and I are ... the races never finished because there are so many things to do\nBut it's what we're looking at right now\nGorsuch and capital\nI I can I can sleep go back I couldn't sleep at night while I can sleep during the day well I don't usually sleep but I'll go back to

read I was just looking at a Fox News article from Newt Gingrich\nA ... and remember the contract with America that that he had come up with a he's talking about the fact that they should have come up with because he's talking about all proposed Republican pledge on on on healthcare you and I talked about this long time ago that the Republicans\nIf they lose and remember health care is one of the leading issues out there right underneath the economy if they lose part of it as their fault for not solving the problem of health care and not going in with a plan right and he talks about you know a a a pledge that you know that that they that they should take\nA and there's ten different points to the the pledge and then what would they do\nAnd they should have had this a long time ago I Believe you when I talk about this a long time ago when they pat you know they they got rid of the individual mandate passed a little bit but we said look the premiums and everything else is going to come back to haunt them right if they don't do something this could cause them the house we'd stay to this over a year ago\nYou know including eliminating the Obamacare individual mandate\nAh the ah ah six billion new to fight opioid epidemic the past the right to try legislation passes stored VA mission\nOr the Trump Administration providing more affordable health care options for Americans through association health care plans and short term limited duration plans so they go through that there's ten different ones there then they say the Republican promises for additional improvements\nIf the American people reelect Republicans will majority in the house and Senate we pledge to enact a series of practical in specific changes based on what works in the public and private sectors to build a better healthcare system the system will keep people healthy\nProvide effective treatments and economic security for those who gets sick these legislative changes will and they go to the pre existing condition which really goes back to the block grant right we do we do so by committing the resources necessary for states to try new approaches like high risk pools\nReinsurance so everyone regardless of medical history has access to affordable insurance but again it goes to the states the states make a decision as to what they wish to do right and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs by

tax\nReducing Washington's mandates that limited choices the drive up costs for insurance strengthen Medicare by protecting Medicare part D patients from excessive out of pocket costs maximized medical innovation they go through that but basically go through all the things that they should that they should actually do this has been a failure the Republican Party completely\nThere is something that probably Ryan should should have been talking about on a consistent basis there should have been a marketing plan for this with massive television ads leading up to the election that if you will like this ... this is our plan this is our contract ... and Newt Gingrich bringing it up and this is two days ago it's too late\nOh yeah yeah it sounds like it's not going to work uh now we're inside of the week first of all it's because a Newt Gingrich is is only going to ... no one is going to uh pay attention to Newt except for the choir\nUm because that's who he's preaching to but you're right with a Paul Ryan at the beginning of this year we talked about and twenty sixteen all of the we're going to do away with was Obamacare we're going to do away with Obamacare we will\nDo away with Obamacare and then by the time they got there the sentiment by the rank and file a changed and it was like okay well we'll do away with the\nSome of the Obama Care and then they finally got to\nThe individual mandate which of course then under the funding mechanism\nAnd then forced them eventually will force them to pay for it in another way premiums going up all of the ... which is exactly what we're saying and we we talked about that disconnect between twenty six team\nAnd the end of last year\nNow you have this this whole new cycle and and whole new opportunity to essentially launch the new plan based on what you know about the public sentiment and they do know what then\nWhy wouldn't you do that to say if you give us if if if if we are in charge this is what we want to do and go and it points\nIf you give us if if if if we are in charge this is what we want to do and go at a point by point as Newt Gingrich to\nAn end it should've been it should've been Ryan and the president yeah this is what we're going to do look it isn't done yet and you promote the daylights out of it get by because it's one of the top issues than Americans care of\nAll because here's what I Would say too is that there's nothing wrong with saying look the the set of it by the American people is shifting on health care in this uh this is where the center of it of the American people is right now this is what they're telling us this is what they want this is the plan we believe will work\nYou don't necessarily have to go back and apologize for not getting it done because the American people don't care that you didn't get it done but what you do have to do what you are charged with now is because you know you break it you pay for it\nWhat you're going to have to do now is put together a plan a very realistic plan and put it in front of the American people but that's that's not happening I mean Newt Gingrich is one thing the party didn't have well any desire to\nDo the Newt Gingrich wrote it because you saw this was a failure of the Republican I and we said this by the way and we got criticism ... we are criticism we got criticism when we sat there not repealing Obamacare I stop saying it we ... we got criticism and guess what we were right they weren't repealing Obamacare but they were just they were what were they were doing was or what\nThe mandate but the actual benefits state which means somebody has to pay for it which was taxpayer money through the back and an increase in premiums but you didn't solve any of the problems right and so you should have focused on solving the problems immediately that should've been the president and and and this is why we\nHave said that we know that people loved the rhetoric but it's about the winning and it's about getting things\nIt's about getting things done more to the way that we wish to get things done so we don't end up with a Medicare for all so we don't have a monopoly running our health care system\nOf government monopoly running our health care system and this is what the Republicans were supposed to be fighting for\nAnd they did not do this they did not do it and we criticized President Trump and the very beginning for not taking a stand on repealing Obamacare but just saying well just sent me whatever and I'll sign right\nBecause the president has shown that when he sticks by something\nLike the corporate and individual tax cuts and he keeps promoting it any keeps fighting\nYou know a lot of people have been told us the last couple of weeks it was like about the president that he's fight fight fight fight fight fight fight the fight has to be more than just rhetorical mhm you've got to take the hard issues\nAnd one of the hardest issues out there is health care\nWell in in ... I I've heard the point made by pundits that well you know there are things that that that he clearly understands that are within his wheelhouse like taxes because he's a businessman\nBut you can not that you want to oversimplify healthcare but one of the main concerns the number one thing that this president did as candidate was to what ... knowledge well acknowledged the problem right I mean overall yeah but I Do but\nThat's one of the problems deregulation uh no uh Donald jing what the problem is with health care regulations part of the ... well yes regulation is the is the problem you have the right now the burden on employers\nAnd hospitals that's the problem\nYou have I mean how many different items but you don't even have to get that involved\nThis president easily could point at it and say there are too many the cost of health care going up as a result of I don't know an aging society or something like that is one thing that's not something the government is necessarily going to be able to curb\nWhat they can do is get in front of the regulation and that regulation right now is choking in hospitals it's choking employers\nAnd as a result who was it that pays the American people in premiums and so you\n... and ... and ... and when he got out and and payments for the insurance company if I was\n... and and the the president pointing that out house that's not too difficult you know I've seen those pundits make that case before that well that really wasn't and his wheel house so he was leaving that up to other people know recognizing\nThe the unnecessary skyrocketing costs of health care is well within this will happen\nUntil unless in his mind he believes in Medicare for\nAll right well and then that case is going to have to start talking about it yeah because otherwise you're not going to get anything done\nBecause if that's what you thought then you should have brought that up already mhm\nBut this is just this is a failure of Republicans on the administration for not you know if if they if they lose the house that's one of the reasons oh yeah no doubt it because they ... they said okay let's just ignore held let's pretend we got rid of Obamacare when we really did mhm 'cause that was the cry and then the president finally had to admit that will not we did\nGet rid of all of Obamacare\nBut I mean but that's ... by the way that's part of the the you know you're not talking about people not wanting bait that's part of the problem that we had with the right we said look he didn't get rid of Obamacare yes I just you know we didn't know and people would argue with this why because they just wanted to believe what they wanted to believe in the facts didn't matter in that\nBecause the heavy costs is coming from the regulation that is still in place the hospitals and employers and by what you know those those policies and plans have to cover and who pays that we do\nWe're still paying the costs yeah H ... and we consider to

parity a new sites are just there's some other headlines are just tremendous yeah they're they're just they're just tremendous and this one from the Babylon be\nReport lots of yelling at each other expected to fix things any day now [laughter] I Love it yeah that's great well\nTrained Babylon be and the onion ... a very talented\nWriters just hilarious law allowed yelling really is the answer

front\nBut out there seems like a low number to me maybe I've been firing to the wrong lawyer [laughter]\nI've been paying too much you know forget about health care we need to do we we do we need to regulate lawyer feed these yeah\nUm I ... I uh I'm kidding I cannot I cannot\nWrap my brain around just forget it even about being the president just how how many lawsuits\nCome your way or when you're on you know when you're rich and famous and you're having the businesses as the president involved in or was involved in this business is connected to\nThere's there's gotta be a ... there's got to be a lawsuit right now pending lawsuit for basically all of those branches of his business I'm guessing there's some kind of legal action in lights are out of body going after him not not based on politics I'm just\nTalking about the every day back and forth of business at that level\nWell would be an interesting figure that when the president and finally says okay I'm retired mhm\nYou know when he says I'm retiring from well he's not going to but hypothetically that he's going to go from being he's he's going to go from being president right back into business again oh yeah yeah yeah it's going to be right they're not going to be so weird it's not going to be OK I'm going to retire and make some speeches right I'm going to make ... because\nIt's ... it's not going to be like Arnold who went from making you know fairly cool movies you know and big movies box office movies to becoming governor and then making really not growing movies he's going to the president or go back to you know building resorts like you did before\nBut it would be interesting let's say and I say I keep thinking what does he Seventy two now ... to me seems younger yeah you know and and\nI was thinking of in my mind was like well maybe when he's eighty I go no it's just a few years from now but I think what he's a Sudanese Ninety he says I'm I'm going to retire and just I Would love to see somebody like him even take out the presidency because that you have lawsuits all the time part\nAnd just I Would love to see somebody like him even take out the presidency because that you have lawsuits all the time fired or you know a filed against you as a president that let's get it but just take the business law suits but I Would also like to see what it is\nWhen you talk about the any president's personal lawyers\nAnd how much they have to spend over the period of the presidency just on lawyer if he's All right just their personal lawyers non White House or do not want no yeah personally step\nBy love to see that number yeah it's that's why you and who went more\nWhen when when people said oh but you guys ever run for office nope\nNo no it doesn't\n[laughter] doesn't pay enough for the possible lawsuits filed\nI Would I Would rather serves the volunteer a you know to the nonprofit organization which which I Do I but I I Would rather do things other things and terminals serving\nHim in a society that will serve you have it I don't I don't want to be a volunteer for a presidential campaign because now even being a volunteer oh no no presidential campaign will get you huge lawyer fees as George Papadopoulos yeah at at Carter Page and these were unpaid yeah\nCampaign people I Wonder what their lawyer FISA bed right\nKept amazing I have a feeling Papadopoulos is going to write a book on this if it's true what he said in\nAnd yesterday you had to leave a little early to go to a conference center and we talked about this the Papadopoulos you know coming on the ... the the tweet saying by the way Congress knows who's a spy was in the campaign so do I can't can't tell you yet but he's also said that he made he may reverse his play\n\nFrom what he learned in okay\nProbably as we are in the question about are about the whole Michael Flynn thing now again we're talking about you know who those are separate charges\nBut\nAnd and this this whole thing if there is the the basis of a ... if the very basis of all of it was\nAbout the uh the spy on the campaign the uh the the\nIll gotten possibly Pfizer warrant and all of that if everything stem from that ... of what we're looking at with Papadopoulos\nA Michael Flynn if if the if the fact of the matter is is that they were on to Michael Flynn because of of that we don't know we have no idea but if that were the case which means there would be no basis for those investigators to be talking to Michael Flynn which means\nThey shouldn't have been there and the charges would be dropped now we we have no idea because he's his hearing a sentencing hearing is coming up here and I'm In a matter of weeks now so what five or six weeks away\nWell but the question is why was delayed by the special prosecutor why did why did Mohler agree to delayed not once but multiple times the sentencing hearing for Michael Flynn then you add to it Papadopoulos and then add to it\nAt the White House handed to inspector general's office at the department of justice\n\nAll of that from the Pfizer warrant a situation and turned it over to here's Laura was knowing and and we have been pointing this nobody's been asking this question ... outside of us that I Know of\nWhy would you send it to the inspector general because you believe something internally was what was some kind of wrongdoing ... at the department of justice and here's the way to find that out is through a proper I'd investigate noble\nWhat I'm what I'm thinking of is Papadopoulos the reason he said that\nAnd and he said first off that you know I I I may take away that guilty plea you know for a long line mhm like women if you live your life will possibly get you out of that how could it and he said not necessary to get it reverse but just to bring forth what happened\nAnd I started thinking okay and then he started talking about the spy the only thing I could think of is\nThe spy was somebody who actually was not an operative for the Democrats but somebody from law enforcement who was put there because it all relates to the Carter page warrant for it which was illegally dot ... across the board\nAnd not only we could have possibly affect the Michael Flynn case because if\nThe warrant was illegally gotten than anything that comes from it mhm is tainted every ... every single ... everything and that's what I'm thinking so they got the warns in part of the war was\nOnce they justified the warranted law enforcement push right somebody in law enforcement that kind of in a ... or an informant that were maybe not an FBI person but an informant ... than the FBI put in there\nYou know that just to to look at Papadopoulos and it was all based on the information that they had gotten from the ... and the war and and everything is interconnected with the buys a war\nAnd so everything around it as tainted and that's what she feels can possibly get him off on that\nOr at least ... what was going on towards the prosecution eventually just says okay the the you know that you're guilty plea is is waived or whatever because it looks so bad for the FBI and the department of justice look something's going on here when when the president said\nWell a lot of the top secret in our allies would rather not released it so I'm going to give it to the inspector general to review you and I both said it doesn't make\nAny sense that doesn't make any sense at all because you're not looking you that that's not what you do you're not talking about the national security advisor you're not talking about the uh the the uh the secretary of state\nYou're talking about the I. G. of the department of justice and the entire role the entire reason that the IGA exists is to investigate wrong to wrongdoing and inside the department of justice\nAnd corruption yes and the only thing we can think of as they believe that after they declassified it and those emails back and forth and text messages\nBetween the FBI in the department of justice what they found was the corruption that they believe will take down the entire case I Can't think of anything else what else could it possibly be\nThe inspector general does not care he does not review top secret material to find out whether it should be released or not he only looks for corruption yep\n\nThat's [noise] and knowing that the idea would have access to anything and everything that he wanted to access inside the department of justice\nYou actually have a better investigative tools and\nBut we got the idea would have access to anything and everything that he wanted to access inside the department of justice\nYou actually have a better investigative tools in Congress just eight six six Ninety red eye\nEngine report is brought you by\nDetroit ...
