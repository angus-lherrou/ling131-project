calls in common is coming up on the bottom of the hour a here we are just eight days away and just looking at the some of the polling\nAre out there by the way the the best call I got was this past weekend we're independent Bob called me and said I'll come Valdez or the Democrat candidate running against governor Abbott here in Texas I haven't seen any commercials that are explained to him that you don't run many commercials you're not going to going to get major backing for many major political party when you're down by twenty\nPoints yeah so it's it becomes really hard to raise money when no ... no one's backing you I I did read that the Republicans think they may have a shot New Jersey\nAnd ah with the with the uh Bob Hugin against or Rob yeah there's I don't know about that a last minute\nShows are just as ten sixteen minutes is up by five margin of error for point or ... excuse me Bob Menendez a by five margin of error five point one Menendez so over the fifty percent mark which is usually a a great indicator that you're going to win but uh they claim they believe that they had the chance\nSo I don't know yeah I I don't know why they think that I'd like to see why and and and unless you could say you've seen the polls closing because ... was up by nine the middle of\nA you know just a right two weeks ago ... and a couple of days later okay he was only up by five okay there was just a day difference ... really not a lot you're talking about a couple of days difference there was momentum there hasn't been a poll since the sixteenth so I don't know if they see something that ... right in there and turtles right we haven't seen yet\nYeah I'd love to know what they're saying though that that would be very interesting that would be very interesting uh some very close races though right now in the Senate I think you know you you look at those and and you would get down to election day is going to be really tight on about\nFor at least three or four of those races for video road log here's your forecast\nIf you missed a chance this weekend to be in a part of the country to get out and take a drive and see some of the beautiful fall foliage you're actually passed the peak season for many locations around the country the upper Great Lakes including northern Wisconsin in northern Minnesota\nMost Pennsylvania New York and the New England states are past week this week we're seeing the ... conditions throughout the Appalachians right through central Ohio and Indiana and to northern Illinois\nI mean we we can debate the number of some other time but let's say that's absolutely true that nobody deported more than President Obama then why is Trump being demonized for believing the same thing that Iraq Obama believed\nIf things are high ... has\nA little bit less than ... than Obama did when it comes to his ...\nHis way over and you talked about the way he talks about it not what he not he what he wants to do not ... he's all art against what he wants to do is that what you're trying to say\nOh I'm trying to say is that the campaigns to me a as someone who is your brother is your fellow American citizen and I love you don't have a ton of conservative friends Republican friends we're all brothers we're all brothers\nWhat I'm saying is that\nIt seems to me the trunk and the way he characterizes people who are\nIn need and if you were in their position if you were in the same position you want the best for your family you want you wouldn't want the best for your friends you would you would want the best for yourself you want the best life it seems to me that\nImage and and okay but a lot is not the ... after that where gestures guilty okay well let me we're shares we're using language to characterize right right well here's ... erosion and here's the point is ugly right now that people are dying in my opinion I'm Sorry okay or evil or dying but the result\nOf hatred and partisanship coming from both sides and I will tell you that the left is just as guilty\nOkay here here's the saints here's the point that I Want to get too because you this is very important 'cause one of the things that that really\nGets to conservatives because conservatives have compassion and I believe and I believe that and I believe that that the the yanks when we are we've got some interference or I I Believe the Trump is compassionate\nI Believe Trump's rhetoric at times goes over the top ... example [laughter] you know the example I'm going to give\n... keeping the conspiracy going the cruise Ted Cruz's father was part of the Kennedy assassination so to me that was the high level anything since then has actually taken down a little bit because that's one heck of an allegation mhm so we understand that when it comes to hyperbole he can go over the\nTop but don't you care about the substance is it only the\nHyperbole then is that what you're claiming Democrats are Democrats only care\nAbout how you say it's not what you say\nAnd you also have to understand when it comes to the theory that exist in America by a lot of people including Trump when you see that Democrats wish to protect illegal immigrant criminals this is not ultra partisan\nTo get people angry it is the reality of what exists today\nDating reality is not hate talk\nBut when you have the Democrats who prefer their preference is the safety and security of illegal\nImmigrant criminals over American citizens yeah you're going to get people angry including the president\nMhm yep what's gonna happen um look and by the way the whole thing with the remember the presence of the rapist\nThing and you know it's it's you know you and I for example we've said you could take quotes that we have said\nAnd and you know in the context of not knowing other things you could take it out of context as soon as that was said he goes no I mean the the bad people not the good ones and he said we know there are good people tried to come across the border we can't do it so we clarified that a long long time ago in fact he clarified that right after it happened\nYes but again it was or what they did was they took it and they ran with it at all or rapists and now you said all\nHe said rape is well and he didn't say they were all rapist won't him across the ... and ... changed making the point the very simple point that we have to that every single person that comes in this country that was the point he was making yes because does the most hardened criminals are the ones you don't want to hear\nVery simple or something I'd like to go point by point with our last caller to find out just how liberal you are\nBecause you have to understand where liberalism ... or you know again\nAnd you can tell at least he can see that he was conceding some\nPoints a by\nThe way I did see over the weekend we need a third political party everything here proves that that would stand for what\n\n... what are you going to do that are going to vote for the third political party stand for well where's the center where's the center yeah who's really a moderate right now\nI don't know what a moderate is right now you know we've been you know over the past few years especially over the past twenty four months we've been trying to define what a conservative is\nYou know we've been you know over the past few years especially over the past twenty four months we've been trying to define what a conservative as\nA I think we all know what liberalism there are varying degrees of liberalism\nBut it starts pretty much on the far left and then goes to the extreme far left well tell me what a moderate is forget about conservative or liberal tell me what a moderate is one of the stand for what are they promote an out of the vote\nAnd I've talked about how I uh talked to a a relative by marriage who was a college professor and he was a liberal I mean I really never got into the conversation and did the shirt our family reunion and even though he was a liberal he rejects what's coming from the Democrats completely and he said about Trump said\nThose look my dad loved Trump Trump look his rhetoric is over the top but not racist he stopped him said come on\nIs a New York city deals with everybody and this guy's a liberal professor who says I Can't stand being on the liberal campus as he said because we're not liberal anymore now

to now lean it's not a close to ... Republican ... uh but Greg Abbott absolutely dominating in the polls I mean there was one you can go back a couple of months you can't find one that's not double digits\nSo you've got a ton of people because if he only get six or seven wins by six seven eight points Ted Cruz\nAnd have it once by twenty huge number of people would have voted for Greg Abbott voted for better or voted for Greg Abbott and would not vote for Cruz why would be my question\nWell you know we have to point out and I don't know if this is a part of it or if this would be in and the you know part of the answer that uh that you would get if you were to learn that\nBut we we talk about two years ago Ted Cruz being the Damon oh I yeah I agree with you know and and you know I mean back when banner was was speaker of the house and and you know ah there were people in the Republican Party we know that in the Senate and in the house\nThat hated cruise but I mean if you had any question you look at what happened at the our and see if the convention in the summer of twenty sixteen\nYeah but without the but now he's beautiful Ted yes right while because now he's useful but if we decided to challenge the president managing and twenty twenty but isn't that politics\nThat's right well because now is useful but if you decided to challenge the president in twenty twenty but isn't that politics though yeah of course a stranger and I'm Better find was that it actually deal to me yeah that's and and it's nothing new but\nIt it is the same\nThing is is that okay well but in that setting it was about his lack of endorsement and now it's I think you could probably point to a number of people that say that still stuck with me even though the president is with him and Houston I'm not\nI mean I I think you would probably again which some I Can't even measure that but I Know there are people that support the president right now support governor Abbott\nAnd are not going to support Ted Cruz for one reason or the other and it's it's likely because I'm I'm guessing a handful of them at least are saying it's because he did not get on board and twenty sixty I Would\nLove to see those votes how many votes for Abbott but don't vote for Cruz at or battle just don't vote for Senate\nMhm yeah no there or you know if you if you look at that there there could be a number of them that aren't voting in the Senate or how many of them\nYou know are looking at the governor's race and and you know going well yeah that's it that's all great wonderful but Lupe Valdez is not our ... there were a number of things that came up and her history as a share of that the left is considered that in fact have been more vocal about\nUh of course in the in the past few months that they're concerned with her actions as an and policy of the basically the Dallas County sheriff's department\nUnder her leadership so you look at that and the and and those that probably has some to do with it again you know you could put some of those answers in that category but\nWe'll see what we're comes together I guess on election day and and how many people actually did vote for Abbott ... wouldn't vote for Ted Cruz that's an interesting question and point eight six six Ninety red eye\nIn addition to being required by law pre and post trip inspections are vital to the safety of professional drivers conducting thorough pre prep inspections allows you to catch any problems before heading out on the road post trip inspections give the shop time to react to any problems that were identified during her next pre or post trip inspection\nCheck to make sure your fifth wheel securely attached ten free of any excess of where\nThe turn of the king pin must be watched properly and the jaws of the fifth wheel also check to make sure your safety chains are attached properly\nTh truck service understands the importance of these inspections if you find any issues during your own pre or post tripping inspection stopped by a location near you have your vehicle looked at by one of our expert technicians\nThis maintenance tip is the surface of the aid truck service road squad if you break down we show up called eight hundred nine two four shop [noise]\nBug you read a radio with a record ...

they're hanging on James ... and more will get your calls and comments coming up a following the bottom of the hour and really we went from it from our point of view why we see the political divide you know what is it about what issues are are are worried about you know we talk about the about I mean the over the weekend it was like all er everybody's enraged and they're angry\nWell why are they what is it about is all the anger just pure emotional ranges and he'd be based on anything that's good well of course did it\nBut definitely this guy is really Hitler but that's the that's the moment the lab they really want to\nCome out and and make you believe that this guy or whoever it is the most recent with Iraq the current threat is the one that is is is the biggest threat to you right now the only way they can get away with that or they think they can get away with that is by creating a monster and the person\nYou know a James I saw the a young black Leadership Conference that the President Trump spoke to the other day and I saw one of the young people that was interviewed that said\nI'm finally off the plantation and when he said that I went wow that's going to drive liberals just crazy but to me and I'm not black but to me when he said that what it was was I I'm I'm Out of the ... out of the mindset of groupthink\nThat it ... it I'm involved in group think find being told that I must think this way because of the color of my skin and then my mind is still in the plantation [noise]\nAnd that and that's what I tried some other ... you're you're you're pointing the finger at a a Republican plantation what I'm saying what what ... are you are on right now that one I allow you to think as you really think\nBecause when when you talk to the right folks about the the homosexual thing and the marriage thing or whatever if you talk to the mission by issue as they lined up with\nMore of a conservative mindset but because of their best so brave brainwashed and ... of racism racism racism racism you know ... their their their their judgment\nYou know I I Wonder because you know we talked about the identity politics with a with the ... with the Democrats and and the identity politics that are really I think come to the forefront because they're so radical is you know number one the transgender movement where if you're\nA a man you can be a woman and the the country in law's must\nAh recognize you that way and then what we've got into now is trans racial that if you're black you can be white and if you're white you can be black legally and when I started thinking about that and wonder\nHow many 'cause we said that we said what the transgender it seemed that there was more acceptance and when they jumped to the trans racial\nI said I think you're going to get a lot of blowback from a lot of black leaders out there stating wait a minute so you can be whatever race you want whenever you want to be it and I thought that was really interesting I Wonder if people thought that that was just a ... a lot of minorities might have seen that and said okay\nMaybe this is time for me to get on a different mindset as to where the Democrats are going\nTo the extent that challenges so what is the fight band for a way yeah was it all in vain\nYeah right\nNo that's I I think that's the question that that many of us have been asking for a long time I mean when you think of the mindset from the the the the left right now that\nYou can be whatever you wish to be now that includes gender or race so there because there's transgender as there is also trans racial is them and they want you to believe well if you'd that's how you identify will hold on a second\nBecause if if you look at a you know the the the civil rights at the protected groups\nSecond because if if you look at a you know the the the civil rights at\nThe protected groups created under the civil rights that if there if you can belong if anyone can belong to any protected group\nThen there are just by saying so then there are no protected groups send the civil rights of their own is done it's it's over ...\nI mean the the the civil rights act but everything that\nThe civil rights era that happened\nThere all that entire battle it's we're not [noise]\nAnd not only that you know the uh the civil war was for nothing and wouldn't you know fight against other oppressive a governmental systems\nThere are no why did we fight you know just to say about that we should have done that uh we're we're on another different paths now so I'm like no\nWe are Americans this with America we're not saying that we're at individual better that ended by or any other country where say I did it was better than everybody else is or in other countries\nYes and ... and and and the goal would be to everybody to adapt the actual ideas in in in the constitution where they\nThey don't always do so and the other thing is too I mean there's also this thing that the left throws at the conservatives enough to write that you don't you want to acknowledge racism come on and we all know what are they how horrendous racism and slavery and Jim Crow was\nAnd I don't know any conservative but which is to go back to that\nAnd my belief is the Democrats and I think about my grandfather my grandfather was the ... the Democratic chairman of the town\nThat we grew up in and he was because he emigrated from Canada and he came to town and they were all Republican and he just said well you got to have two parties you can have a system with but he was he was much much more conservative but he left the Democrats that well I I Believe\nMy father never had the official conversation with somebody and he died before I got to ask him\nBut I said with ... be a Democrat today and he said no abortion abortion changed him a lot of the liberal politics or changed him but when you think of what they what the Republican but the Democrats used\nTo claim in the seventies and eighties they cared about and then the identity politics where everything is about race everything is about gender and the whole cabinet thing where you saw that you must believe the woman well that's ridiculous if you must believe the woman will it used to be it must leave the white man over the black\nYou know over over the black person in a criminal justice in the black person you don't believe in the white person you believe you know you go by evidence and what I find in credit is what I find a credible is the bigotry and intolerance and the actual racism and sexism seems not to be coming\nFrom the Democrats\nWill go up to black made about a ... that situation um they fully understand that the uh 'cause I remember there was a little while later it was several years ago\nShe ran away and uh she blamed it on to black males as so every\nBlackmail that within the city and okay look under scrutiny and they came out that she just wanted to run away or you know so\nSo I'm like no you have to understand that that if you go to that system would be fully aware of that what you're trying to fight against come true for which\nFriday aims a thank you so much ... some reshape writes thought for ... and uh yeah I mean you're not the first person who was called the show and said look I'm black ... me and my conservative and live my life\nWell you know what's interesting too is that you go

level and I just I just wonder I haven't asked him yet 'cause I haven't had a chance to talk to him he's a black conservative and I haven't had a chance to ask him\nHas anybody ever tried to steal your science I mean not that they would know he's black and and that that would even matter to anybody on the left but you see the things on social media\nAs anyone ever tried to steal your signs you know from your guard because he has some right there on the on the side where the big street is and so\nI don't know I I Would love to to know that if if anyone's ever attempted that he's he's always
