can call and an eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine of seven thirty three thirty nine and we go to John in Seattle John you're on with mark\nHey mark how are you there have here a okay a life or is it John Cage sick I Believe he ran for president as a Democrat and I don't know if I have a public and yeah\nShe did oh boy [laughter] well balanced the budget\nAnd you know whoever can balance a budget that should they should run against Trump or you know ever since two thousand eight we've had quantitative easing\nWe had just government spending that's gone on and on and on with no end in sight and some well you know the somebody's got to pay the piper on that sooner or later and I think if somebody could make a case to show that they really know how to balance a budget\nThat would be who probably would stand a chance against Trump although I probably wouldn't vote for him on pretty much of traditional values\nConserve you know it's to me a word that is consistent with conservative and you know if it works but it ain't broke don't fix it you know something that works it's a good thing\nOr you have no idea who it is Nikki Haley I Believe she has\nAn elected as a global perspective that I have a degree in anthropology\nAnd I would really like to sit down and talk to her about where she thinks waste and and the family of nations on this smaller and smaller planet but we have to learn to get along with each other and so those are my thoughts what do you think are\nWell first of all mentioned Nikki Haley as his ... amazing because the lady and surprised me I I thought she was okay as governor of South Carolina but she's been a phenomenal or ambassador to the United nations really letting them have it in a very courageous not being afraid to save like it is\nShe's a very impressive lady I think she's going to run for president maybe you know obviously not this time but in the future\nYeah yeah yeah I mean you have someone\nWith a very large perspective on who we are as a nation and clearly we can be a good a good companion a good name for a good partner in a global perspective I think that's very important\nSo thanks for I guess I guess ...\nHold on one second 'cause I'm going to ask you your ... your answer sheriff question but I don't like John Case if there's something about the guy uh they didn't come across well he did run as a Republican last time\nSheriff question but I don't like John Case if there's something about the guy\nOr they didn't come across well he did run as a Republican last time against Trump and the others there's something about him that irritates me something I mean I I don't agree with him on everything is a little too liberal for me and that that's fine investing neither here nor there but something personally about him\nI think he's arrogant I think he comes across that when I've heard some things about him I had a former a producer my TV show who said something about women or something like that that was years ago so that's not fair that is a rumor or something about that guy that rubs me the wrong way but you don't feel that way you'd like\nTo bail us budget I mean\nWe we can't go on with a kind of spending I mean I Love this country and we have a lot of good programs like agriculture and you know we need to defend ourselves and\nYou know we we just can't keep going on every time somebody as another hobby is that they don't want something that you just get it because they have enough money for the next campaign\nI mean that's both sides of the oil you know and it's just been going on and on and on and they can't go on forever I mean when you get to the point where the debt\nIs bigger the gross national product you know theoretically that's bankruptcy\nAnd where we got to find a way you know we've got to find a way to to to have a better reasonable expectation about what the ... we can have in this country\nOne of the things I always say is people do not understand that the government\nHas no money of its own you'd be surprised maybe how many people think oh you remember the woman or during the Obama campaign in the first one said a hit Obama's going to pay for a mortgage and pay for gas and they said where are you going where's he going to be a stash ever stash same out\nOf his staff ... he was going to personally paid\nSo people don't know that they said that the government has no money of its own\nA thank you very much for your call very well said and\nI appreciate it very much and we'll take the rest of your calls at eight six six Ninety red eye or right now\nYou're in national forecast for how many trucks\nNo was climate Prediction Center has issued the winter outlook you will be warmer in the west with no change in the chances for snow\nAccording to the national weather service in the Northern Rockies it will be drier and warmer the great lakes region is expected to be drier the southern quarter of the U.S is expected to be wetter than normal\nBut no parts of the country are expected to see a colder than normal winter\nNow NOAA warns the forecasts should not be interpreted to mean that period of prolonged cold or heavy snows won't happen most of the country will be dry today with the exception of a place where we don't need any more rain and that's in Texas\nI hear here we are or at least I Am being unfair maybe he really felt that way would have always voted that way or there was no cooperation all that kinda stuff\nWhat their own senators lie or what's the name of ... Heidi Heitkamp whatever her name is ah she's in big trouble and in fact the way out is the whole ... Kevin a fiasco was helped the Republicans\nJust the Democrats were always a ... they were always ready to go out there and\nDo anything they could to go against Trump but now you've got Republicans motivated and in fact of having a hadn't won I think they would have been so demoralized would have been worse but our problems are in the house the house representatives because it is quite possible that the Democrats could take back the\nHouse and as I've said for the last few nights if they take back the house you're in the Capitol hearing will pale in comparison to what they'll do trying to impeach Kevin I'm trying to teach Trump with hearings with subpoena powers a with calling for their impeachment he's not going to be fun\n[noise] no\nIt's I think it's going to get ugly I personally but that that happens I think that uh nothing good will come out of that I promise you that\n[noise] that would be crazy\nI mean I I honestly didn't leave anything forward said to me I didn't read any of that but it didn't die down credible to me um [noise] I mean I did a lot of background I have it all and he just seemed like the most on it\nI used to know what the what the best judges that are on there as of right now in my opinion [noise]\nI mean he got old yet and we had er\nWhat what the best judges that are on there as of right now in my opinion [noise]\nI mean he got old yet and we had our we've got [noise]\nNo I was going to say they it seems like a decent guy and you as you started say over three hundred opinions or whatever but the fact is in her case I just think that we're using her as long as we're talking about\nWho should run for president a Democrat side uh Spartacus Booker in I call them that has his own name [laughter] Kamala Harris\nThey they were just using that woman maybe maybe she imagined that if someone didn't do that assault on her all those things are possible but they use their for their own purposes it was disgusting to watch\nA little difficulty with\nHorrible who was really what was he was yeah that's what\nLindsey Graham was so good when he came out and said I'm not going to put up with this stuff you guys are doing this for power you yeah you know now to be ashamed of yourself what you're willing to do and but that's what they are they ought to be [noise] yeah well thank you so much for the [noise]\nAbsolutely all all that because back again\nWell thanks so much time and uh yeah Jo measure would be a good picky seems like a decent guy uh like I said I don't it's not fair for me to take away some of his courage uh when he seems so nice and and reasonable and I think he is going to win but someone who is less than decent I said I mentioned this\nIs Hillary I'd love to see Hillary run again a for selfish reasons I think she is going to run again because these guys\nMeaning Hillary and bill they can't keep away from power that's what the what is an aphrodisiac people say so and the Democrats even have figured that out they don't even want her to enter the fray she's viewed as the kiss of death for democratic candidates in the upcoming midterm election\nForcing the former presidential candidate to stay low and campaign only behind closed doors by the way that makes sense because I sit on the air for many months now you know she's still looking to see a why she lost\nLike she's going to come out I suggested she'll come out with a book a hundred and one reasons why I lost in none of them will be her I have nothing to do with her\nAnd I said she could join OJ Simpson as he looks for the killer to figure out who killed his wife but few Democrats are willing to embrace Clinton on the campaign trail despite the party's near universal support for just two years ago\nWith many concern that a high profile Clinton presidents would only dampen the party's prospects of retaking control of Washington from Republicans yeah they're worried about her throughout the mid term elections Clinton is rarely rally together with other candidates appearing mostly at low key fundraisers and low key pitch you can't get many people to show up\nShe's the kiss of death won a party official said yeah telling the Washington Examiner Democrats don't want her to campaign for them because everywhere she goes she carries the stench of death while it's worse than I thought\nAnd it's the only political figure in America that has less popular than Donald Trump stretches that that's a real testament to her\nDemocrats were relieved that the bill and Hillary Clinton announced that there international Thirteen city speaking tour wouldn't began until after November and now that\nThat was a clever move I think they're measuring how they can have the best positive impact and have kind of decided to wait until after the election and that's what Dick Durbin of Illinois said a house Democrats segment of that thing when I think the people who have been part of our pushed to retake the house\nI just don't think of them at all I think it's a very good thing that they're not being visible it wouldn't help our cans age\nBoy one minute you're the nominee for the Democratic party and the next minute they don't want to see anymore maybe that's part of the problem these guys don't know when to get off the stage\nActually but I liked that Hillary can in twenty twenty I liked the sound of it and I like our possibility that she could run up you know like our stamps she could run forever right but don't we have forever stamps forever bill and Hillary could run you never get rid of them actually\nI can take them a lot better than Brock Obama right most presidents when they leave office they they're quiet and give credit to George W. Bush\nBut not for Iraq Obama he's in there he can't sit still he can't keep quiet\nSo maybe Hillary and bill they do have some redeeming value for those of us on our side because if they run again like if she runs again\nI think she's kind of lose I think we got to get something going on our side Hillary for president in twenty twenty tell me what you think eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine or ... same number thirty three thirty nine mark gosh they're filling in on red eye radio\nHow much do you know about synthetic oil heavy duty trucks have been running on traditional mineral oil for the last one hundred years but today's technology brings us other options to consider it's better quality\nUnlike mineral oils synthetic oils have consistent molecular restructure giving it the ability to support pressures from iron horse power engines especially at lower rpm ... it also allows oil to reduce friction in an engine controlling temperatures and improving fuel economy\nVery clean or synthetic pick up fewer contaminants as they do their job of lubrication they also have better oxidation stability resulting in an overall cleaner engine synthetic and some I synthetic oil may be a bigger investment up front but the benefits of its high quality composition will pay off in the long run\nThis report is a service of shell wrote ...\nBooks with what I told ... ...
