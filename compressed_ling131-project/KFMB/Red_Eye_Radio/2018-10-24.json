prove anything but it backs other circumstantial evidence or or\nA support other hard evidence while in the case and then the question is you know do you what would be needed to get that data and the

well congratulations what does that person going or group of people going through right now they know talk about freak out mode\nOh well congratulations what does that person going or group of people going through right now if they know\nTalk about freak out mode there there's someone wrote the story again you know because they they did the series on a on cable I Know our little stories of people one of the lottery and ... just ended horribly\nI'm at someone did a story here's why you know it would be a here's why it's a good thing if you don't win and they pointed out those cases that was a that were in those specials\nOr you know people just I just well first of all do you can't tell anyone you tell you and your family word gets out even if you don't go public\nAt at when you claim the prize the word gets out when people know that you're you're rich but even more so that you won the money this way you didn't earn it\nThen people come at you believing you didn't earn it so it feels mine for\nAnd they disconnected their phone the next day and left\nAnd\nYou know because it it I'm sure it became crazy with\nRelatives you didn't know you had and the whole thing um and and that's the real you know that's the real risk of it because that's like we said the psychology is different because people look at it as well you didn't earn that money and it's a jealousy thing and they were\nTrying to win the money and their little dream in their mind of them winning the money and you got it and\nYou're there relative a wait a minute I Want or or just somebody that that you know and sometimes it's not not even people view you know\nSome of those stories about the just the you know and then God Bless all the non profits but nonprofits non stop knocking at your door you know and\nYou want to give back I'm sure most people would but you can you can give you know I mean you could pretty much give all of that away if you fulfilled every request\nThere would've been much more exciting when I was younger me winning the lottery in these days would be like what a hassle [laughter] well\nI said okay okay so I thought about it would change my life too much I I thought about that kind of money\nBecause after taxes or it's going to be somewhere around what five if you want the one time payout it's somewhere around the third or thirty five percent\nYou know of the overall price a one point six billion so pair that down to about a ... you know somewhere around five hundred and fifty sixty or or six hundred million dollars\nThat's a ton of money you're richer than Mitt Romney already\nYou went to bed poorer\nThan than a Joe Biden and you woke up richer [laughter]\n\nGo story always goes you was one of the least rich guys and the Senate um and and you woke up richer than a Mitt Romney and and the whole thing is is that\nYou you ... what do you do\nI've always said like those really expensive cars really expensive sports cars you know if if I were you know the billionaire and I had that kind of money but still knowing myself where in the world would I drive that car I wouldn't be able to stop and parking\nAnywhere you know what I mean I mean where\nAre you going to take that ... I wouldn't mind taking it out to Eddie gossip just place of Texas anyway and putting it on the track a couple of times but I mean what are you going to do with the money I'm at the point is is that I Would be so paranoid all the time\nWith six hundred I mean instantly having six hundred million in the bank\nIt would it would a high end there would be a bit disturbed there's yeah there's nothing I'm I'm not saying I wouldn't want you know I [laughter] and I have to be clear it would it would be a huge\nHassle mhm I like my life ... I don't want to change mhm I and I don't care what anybody says that kinda money changes your life I have a a set of changes the reaction that everybody has towards you as your life\nI have a a friend who uh a friend or family member who a bat at one time was working for a a multibillion\nUm and it is you know how we talk about the president sleeps four hours a day mhm and my family member told me that this person was the exact same way only because there's not enough time of the day\nWe're talking about this with our own schedule and sleep the other day and how my schedule is very busy\nWay only because there's not enough time and today we're talking about this with our own schedule and sleep the other day and how my schedule was very busy [laughter] not a multi billionaire although won't at least one listener thinks we are\nUm but but the point was is there so much going on now this person earn their money they didn't win their money they earn their money um but but still you've got so much going on managing your wealth\nIs more than ... and I also have a fulltime job yes uh you know you hire somebody else to do it but there's the other problem I Can't trust anybody else though\nTo know I couldn't trust anyone else to do that that would be the thing because you know people ... what would you do and I said ... I don't know I probably would I'd want to distance myself from the money in ... set up some kind of foundation ... you know and would I be able to do this because odds are if you win that kind of money you're not going to be able to keep your name private\nSo this ... it would be it would be hard to demand that you can you can do that legally and\nIn terms of you know claiming the prize but if you've got that kind of it's six hundred if all of a sudden you're worth six hundred million dollars someone's going to notice eventually\n... exactly the the word your life your life is going to change managing the money mhm 'cause I said you know I'd probably want to come up with some type of ... what I Do I don't even know what the foundation but that means you got to run the foundation so this jobs gone well I don't want to run my in laws there are laws about\nReceiving the money away their laws about giving money to your it let's just say you wanted to take it you claim the prize but you want to take this and you want to go give that to your family members well there are tax laws if you just write them a check and you got to pay the gift tax the giver has to pay the gift\nRight well my I guess my point would be it would be a full time job for great out what to do even if they're going to give it away that's what I mean they're going to be a full time job is going to be a huge hassle yeah and it's like oh this life I have is gone my life is life five right I don't know if like you said if I was in my twenties or thirties I'd probably be going yeah\nAll right let's say let's have a grand old time but all of a sudden you get a little bit older you're like well like what I'm doing yeah I don't want to change my life I like my life\nWell yeah but you're you're not as secure as you could be well that's part of why I like my life yeah I I don't do I get to do challenging I get to do challenging things and I you know I I like everything that I get to do and so\nI'm I'm not saying that there wouldn't be a part of me that wouldn't be greatly excited about that mhm oh yeah 'cause I don't know I Would love to you know I think about it here's one of the worst one thing I think about that if I miss it this is one dumped off it goes through\nMy mind but it's still a thought oh we're talking about is is that if I Want one point six billion mhm\nBecause every day I mean I ... the average person out there and I still consider myself sort of average I don't you and I think alike it's not like we don't even think we're on the radio we do a radio job but it's like no it's just like any other taught allow we've we've ever done ... really I mean it's not I never think that\nOutside of being and doing this I never really think I'm On the radio some when somebody comes up and little did a a little shocked we work in an older warehouse for those that don't know where you're I mean we really are it's almost like we come to work in a warehouse that we just had the edge of the show we grab our lunch pals and go home and do it that's what the\nFeeling is is like that in the last time I work third shift this is the only time I work third shift\nOutside of being a machinist [laughter] so the mentality sort of the same friends so I but the the the thought is and so there are still you know challenges that I think of every day and what to do here and there and\nYou know a a just and financial decisions and everything else that become a part of your life everything that you're doing in your business and personal life well you've one point six billion all that goes away and I always think to myself I don't know if I Want to get to the point where the only thing\nThat now is it in my way because I have on one point six billion the only thing I'm thinking about his death [laughter] right but I got all these other things but I can think about it basically keep that the thinking of debt at a distance well all those challenges the problems are taken away and all of a sudden I'm going to get all this money death [laughter]\nI was a you know I talked to one time about this uh there was a a guy and I I'm I'm blanking out on his name but he he developed the game and he sold it ah I I I don't know\nOf five to look it up but anyway the guy sold his game or the company that you know that surrounded the game for two billion dollars and his take of that was a you know roughly\nLike one point eight so he became a billionaire you know overnight I obviously he was earning before that but then he talked about one night he went on it wasn't a rent just a series of tweets and he was talking about it was that this party\nAnd it was the first time I was in a room with other billionaires and I was talking\nTo people that I had nothing in common with\nBut I did but then I talked to this girl who was there and she wasn't a billionaire so we talked to one girl who was a billionaire he's a single guy\nAnd he had nothing in common with her but here's the problem he talked with a girl who you know worked you know for a living had a job and was not a billionaire far from it he had nothing in common with her\nAnd it was ... I'm not trying to cry I'm just I'm just saying it's a weird I'm pleased to be in because I'm ... you know I'm not from money\nI'm new money but I don't fit in with these people and I don't fit in now with the people because you don't know what the motive is here's here's the problem with being famously\nWealth or like the the the person in my family member works for you've got to put up I mean your security surrounding you all the time yeah that's the other than your famously wealthy so you have security detail we talked about this with the president the president has hedged security detail that\nIs is parallel to you know the types of security detail for you know maybe not necessarily the president in terms of the training but you know up in that level you know what I mean and so you're going to have to be very careful because there are people there are threats against you all the\nThe unfortunate result of these circumstances is that drivers are often unable to get treatment and the early stages of disease\nMinor illnesses become severe leading to hospitalization and disability the driver then may lose their CDL and become unable to work this creates a downward spiral that leads to extreme financial hardship and possible unemployment\nGo to truckers fund dot org today and learn more about how you can contribute if you are someone inside the trucking industry may be a need\nBurnt how STDs can help we encourage you to educate yourself in tears on the sink Christopher truckers fun today donate if you can you never know when you may need some help too that's truck respond dot org let's band together for a better tomorrow [noise]\nFind Seventy five years this is the um seven Seventy San Diego's talk radio\n\nThe news on the hour sponsored by their works relief I beat her king the winning mega millions numbers have been out there for a few hours\nWhen the numbers are twenty eight Seventy five sixty sixty five and the goal make about aside ... billion dollar at at\nLeast one ticket is matched all the numbers for the record one point six billion dollar jackpot bought somewhere in South Carolina WCBS TVs alley bound to\nHave you actually win the jackpot and gaining officials that vice versa assigned the back of your ticket and it doesn't matter who paid for it and whoever signs and they get the prize\nWas hurricane will lead is now a tropical storm but it's raining hard in Mexico and it's headed for Texas Hurricane Center specialist ac steward what\nPeople across northern Mexico and also in the central and southern Texas areas to be aware that more of your right it's got to be coming your way so expect additional flooding\nIt hasn't been shut down by the New Jersey rehab center isn't admit again to new patients ... viral outbreak that killed six children and made a dozen other sick CBS is Hillary lane is in ...

guarantee the American public please be public and tell me we are willing to keep the door open are you willing to talk or is it\nLike we all believe that your party is the party of open borders and if you are the party of open borders have the guts\nTo sell that to the American people or attempt to sell back to the American people that's what I think the president should say if he's\nHave the guts to sell that\nTo the American people or attempt to sell back to the American people that's what I think the president should say if he's already halfway there with this\nYep you're now and and by the way you can you can get him you can get fined signed on many oh yeah hello seat right that sounds really over the last Twenty years at some exactly like Donald Trump does on illegal immigration right exactly why he does make the comparison\nHit them hard you've got the bully pulpit as you know the press pays attention to everything that you say hey is depressed fact checking to make sure that Obama really said\nThat or are they just laying low challenged the press go after the media right so this is what they why aren't you questioned them about why they think what they think now what they thought then why don't you why why don't you asked them if\nThey want to open border it's the same kind of positioning by the way I Would do this during a debate of course the president's not going to be debating only went for a couple of years but I Would do this if I'm a candidate I Would do this on a debate stage\nWith my opponent if I'm a Republican candidate I Would be doing this with uh with with any of them I Would be I Would say you don't want to I was into the moderator I'll you'll my time if I could just ask ask my opponent what they believe the level of enforcement of the borders should be\nTelling me what level of enforcement do you believe in closing the borders altogether sealing the borders\nAnd only letting a limited number of people end up basically what we have now I mean it's not field we have porous borders but do you believe we should enforce the borders or not because there is no\nHalf measure in my opinion there is no half measure so either you believe in open borders or you know been forced right\nAnd it's about time after Thirteen Years\nThirteen Years we were talking about a McCain Kennedy\nWhen that went down to defeat Thirteen Years ago and the Republicans still have not been able to back the Democrats into the corner to make them feel so uncomfortable to challenge him to dare them to tell the American people and don't stop it do you have the potential over the next week I Know the early voting is happening but there's still a lot of votes to still be counted\nTo make immigration illegal immigration the number one issue again\nYep [noise] for on the trucks here's your forecast\nMoisture tied to hurricane ... in the Eastern Pacific will shift some of those reins into western Texas today we have a marginal risk of flash flooding in severe weather in place for the region another whether maker will be a surface low near the southern tip of Texas\nSo a couple of systems moving in rain and thunderstorms certainly possible along the Gulf Coast today with marginal risks of flash flooding in effect and the below normal temperatures will continue for the southern plains Fifteen to twenty five degrees below average\nI Believe it's a Saturday just got the invitation today right so that's why I'm asking these questions do you go are you going\nAh I I don't know I I I I Want to make that if I go by I really don't like to spend a lot of times I may go as one of the most scariest things that society knows\n... a conservative radio talk show host mhm\nI'm big enough I just show up like that and everybody's in costume you
