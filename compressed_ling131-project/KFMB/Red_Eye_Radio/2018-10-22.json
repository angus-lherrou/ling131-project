I still believe that it wouldn't have back then because in taxes remembering twenty sixteen in the primary he won the state he won Texas\nOr he also won Iowa or but but there may be may be could have been something where a Ted Cruz was the last two or ... or work\nOr back there and and again we don't make predictions would just look at the polls right now and and Ted Cruz has a fairly comfortable lead and is over fifty\nIn the most recent polls and worked what two weeks in a day out so something would have to happen between now and then change those falls not saying it couldn't\nThis is a bummer thought\n'cause that's what the Democrats will try or just a bunch of others out there\nOh Trump loves America we love America\nOne of me and I love America to actually if you don't believe in the constitution you don't love America you may love the concept of what you as a group all think America should be\nBut you don't love America the way that it exists under the current constitution and the rules and regulations that we have you and I've talked about it when you talk about\nThe fact now there's they're talking about well the president needs remembered the presidency is no longer effective or that needs to go yeah the the the electoral college needs to go in the Senate needs to go and what they don't understand it those are key words that you don't believe in individual liberty\nBecause we are not a direct democracy we are a constitutional republic and the reason we are as to protect the rights of the minority yes\nTo protect the individual rights and the rights of the minority exactly what they claim that they believe the Democrats claimed that they they think about\nSo we look at all that and that's all part of loving America so when you hear when I say that I've always got responsible that's above a thing that he loves American we don't know based on\nThe actual specifics of what the Democratic Party is promoting ... what we're calling for which is anti constitutional mindset and an anti constitution oh yeah and we can make that point and you and I said for the longest time\nBut it's still left that doesn't believe in the first amendment oh for them yeah mhm but for others they don't and we have broken that down before they don't believe in the second amendment and now they don't believe in due process under the law when it's inconvenient for them there was not a presumption of innocence that mindset is wrong\nAnd we've talked about that you know the support of the judges when the judge has become activist judges\nAnd how that is an American and unconstitutional and how they promote that mhm and so the average person I think sees that and Trump is anything they look at Trump and I look at Trump and you look at Trump is anything but an authoritarian and a fascist\nEven at times though his words we like it don't say that\nYeah I when you look at what he actually doesn't what he promotes in the long run it's\nAll constitutional yes it's all part of the process\nThat was put in place hundreds of years ago I mean it it's but this is this is what we have to this is\nWhat it has to come down to if we're not going to win the Senate we need to get rid of it that we're not going to win the electoral college vote then you can really get rid of it we need to get rid of the constitution when it doesn't but it doesn't run me when we don't win the White House we need to get rid of the president's that's anti American yes\nNo it's not well what America for ... it's not America we don't like the constitution if we don't have

currently and I'm Mary McNamara we'll get to more of your calls and comments coming up following the bottom of the hour up but the I I thought it was important\nTo bring that up because that's more of the the emotion of what drives an election but I and I don't think I I don't think we should discount how important that is in the ... election debt reason the Trump is drawing the crowds that he is is drawing\nA especially from a Republican Party to you'd think two years afterwards that he's going in and doing these rallies and he is drawing these people and we had mentioned the the uh the the story that came out over the weekend that Tibet O'Rourke a small little theater\nHe couldn't fill that here in the state of Texas just a couple of weeks out is was reported over the weekend\nThat the real rock star even though we hate that term for politicians to begin with but the real rockstar still is Trump and why because there is an emotional attachment to him that is based on the substance of what he's doing\nAnd that's what it is but that's what it comes down to it also how the left is behaving in reaction to how the left is behaving in and the type of threat that that poses if you think of the what happened during the Kavanaugh confirmation process\nYou know so that's that's what it comes down to what's the greater motivator on each side and we'll see and a couple of weeks for video road logging here's your forecast\nTexas set to receive more rain today there's a couple of systems that will be providing moisture to the region in the Gulf of Mexico there's a low pressure systems and in the Pacific there's a low pressure area both\nOf those systems funneling moisture right into southern Texas and the four corners region\nAnd if you get up into the higher reaches of

another conservative on the committee or or Republican on the committed to get up and do what ... you know after the committee vote get up and storm out\nThat wasn't the point\nYou know way way but then again you can't make the case he was trying to make the case that it was the same and I'm like no it was unprecedented what happened right mhm are you you're going to get Justice Thomas you know that goes back you know twenty five\nOr ... that goes back twenty five years ago and and uh you know he those hearings were held and then but then but then he was he was you know confirmed and I believe some Democrats even cross the line and voted for him yes they did I Believe that yes they did well I Believe that was a Democrat said it at the\nTime [noise] yeah\nUh so yeah so you know they they ... but this was unprecedented\nNothing nothing we've ever seen a it in our lifetime or in modern times has has been like this so to even question that\nTo me uh shows ignorance and that doesn't mean stupidity of means a lack of knowledge ah on on history and that's why we brought up and said that didn't happen was sort of minor and that didn't happen with Kagan there were people that disagree with that because we we believe\nThat sort of my or and Kagan many times not all the time\nOn the with\nThe cell tower right to cell tower\nCase of the cell tower that they agreed with ... they you know the ah they use the in their writings they used 'em\nA prior judgment or by opinion written by ... majority opinion written by Scalia is ... exactly that was the press and the right to use\nBut in many of their many of their answers and many of their their decisions we believe they legislate\nWhich is not their role which is why we were against their nomination but it was based on traditionally what they would do\nNot by what we want each and every day mhm mhm ... what the job of the judges and that's the difference and that's something that we brought up with the whole Kavanaugh hearings that we said look ... you know conservatism Republican stopped have to stop arguing\nThe same premise that Democrats are arguing right Republicans keep arguing most conservative versus liberal justice no it's not ... I'm not voting for a conservative judge\nI'm voting for a construction is an originalist I'm voting for a judge irrespective of what they wish the government to beat each and every day understand\nThat their role is not to make law either left or right\nThere their job under the constitution is to interpret what the law says\nYou know it's interesting to see that as we got to the uh the closer to the the ultimate vote on on a cabin on you know I made the point that even the liberal\nJustices respect the process in my opinion based on experience and I think one thing you can look at one judgment you can look at from SCOTUS\nWas recess appointments which was the anonymous yeah against all by against Obama yeah because if you look at that that really was something that very clear on what the process yes and so\nRespect thing not only the process of how you know the confirmation process of of of how that's done but also again the process\nAt the highest court I Do believe and you know you can say what you will about the opinions written by a Ginsburg or or whether they're descending or majority opinion you can we can tear them apart and say well they're wrong about this or the wrong about that or we disagree with this or that but in terms of the process I think\nAh by and large\nI have seen them display consistently respect for the actual process and I can point to that one example but there are others\nA recess appointments was ... that unanimous decision where ... you can't do that and and and that is\nThat is the difference when the left no longer respects the process when you don't respect the process what is left\nBecause what is left is shouting people out of restaurants do away with the Senate do away with this do away with the president say do away with the electoral college do away with parts of the constitution\nThat's what's left to the point there is no process and we'll shout you down just to get our way which means we'll get control of

Smith once you want to paint this picture of the audience to the audience that this was some kind of trial it was not it was it was a hearing to get to the truth\nShe would never have been prosecuted there was never even anybody calling for her to be prosecuted or on the lies and thank God\nBut it was about finding the truth we found the truth and what happened it was not just one publication but there were two or three Hillary had a great week her best week ever\nSo you take all of those and you'd throw on top and the fact that the price of court review the Obama administration for violating the rights of Americans in the secret buys a court process and you have to ask yourself and then we looked at the we we we\nFor violating the rights of Americans in the secret Pfizer court process and and you have to ask yourself and then we look at the we we we look at the um on masking we still haven't gotten to the bottom of that and you have to ask the question\nJust what was the culture of the permissiveness of lawlessness within the Obama administration right how far did it go\nYeah do you want to get in we have a wide open eight six six Ninety red eye\nIn addition to being required by law pre and post trip inspections are vital to the safety of professional drivers conducting thorough pre trip inspections allows you to judge Jimmy problems before heading out on the road post trip inspections gift shop time to react to any problems that were identified\nDuring your next pre or post tripping inspection be sure to pay close attention to your vehicle service and parking breaks check rarely leaks ... worn outlined names and make sure that compressor is operating properly all break components must be in place and functioning correctly\nPA truck service understands the importance of these inspections if you find any issues during your own pre or post trip inspection stopped by a location near you have your vehicle looked at by one of our expert technicians\nThis maintenance tip is the surface of PA truck service road squad if you break down we show up ... eight hundred nine two four shock\nWas guilty and recorded radio [noise]\nCheck out all the latest news event tracking information jobs and pod cast at red eye radio show dot com that's red eye radio show dot com\nI drank how do you like your calming we've\nGot it the way you like at highland bangs hang my home Marr piping hot with great he's going to pass on the local events and proof trash every dollar\n... he could wind wonder it's called the ... and you want and we got a pilot ... download that my time and asked for happy endings and more [noise]\nThis summer take your music with you anywhere you go from the job site to the campsite\nWith a tough job site rugged wireless speaker available exclusively for a limited time at all Sam's Club locations great sound rugged and waterproof\nThe ... even has a built in flashlight and power bank to keep your phone charged on the go heat the music playing this summer with the job site Bluetooth speaker from tough test it available at all Sam's Club locations talk just to ask for it by name\nAs a leader and the heavy duty engine oil category the makers of ... have learned that what matters most is what's inside and most of them they feel that all of those are the same sometimes it's just not true\nIn a recent tests to sample the mobile delta ...

maybe maybe two years ago you could have two years in six months ago that this would ever happen where President Trump is coming to Texas\n[laughter] the campaign and rally were for Ted Cruz for for for Ted Cruz yeah right and the vote your conscience Ted Cruz\n[laughter] that our point\nOf the other twenty filthy we're remembering their member and and this this is why again a lot of times what happens\nIn her party between a a you know a couple of candidates means nothing right right right and when you think about it broke her memory remember what Trump was you know Trump was promoting the conspiracy theory remember that that Cruz's father was part of the Kennedy assassination\nThe whole vote your conscience well that's that's\nWhat we said anything anything since then it said was minor it's like well don't you did you hear what he said well now did you hear what he said that two years in six months ago or your\nWas part of the plot that led to the assassinate ... assassination of a president\nIt was part of the plot that led to the assassinate assassination of a president that's not a small claim you know like your father was once a Democrat\n[laughter] he killed Kennedy\nAnd you know and today there will be a really yeah you're right now and and I had one big earthquake they weren't as far as we were bigger place now the campaign is claiming Trump's twenty twenty campaign boasting a hundred thousand people plus interested in attending\nOkay so Washington Examiner a late Sunday evening posted some supporters are lining up for blocks one day before the big Trump cruise rally in Houston so they were lining up a as early as Sunday\nThe the the story here but it's so much tougher to tell 'em those house seats I just I I Wonder that if we're going to gain in the in the in the Senate mhm and so that's you know that's looking at a populations across the state in right here or that\nYou know I just wonder how they extrapolated out to so many of these races where if they're using the public polls out there there are so few of them\nSo few and far between how they use those ... if you're going to the internal polling polling which I'm sure is being done by the campaigns you would have the better you know a better guess at that\nRight yeah again here\nIt is a a a Dems midterm advantage narrows among registered voters yeah my new national poll a few weeks before the midterm election shows the chances of a blue wave are far from a slam dunk for the Democrats the NBC Wall Street Journal poll released a Sunday shows forty eight percent of registered voters\nWould prefer having Democrats in control of Congress compared to forty one percent supporting the GOP these seven point gap is narrowing from a ... point gap the Democrats had in September I don't know if that tells you anything though\nWell and and again I mean registered voters ... we've got to talk of likely voters and then again what the motivation is on election day this we've been talking about this it has changed since the Kavanaugh's confirmation leading up to and since I don't know which extent\nI Can't tell you it's motivated the left or the right more we do know there's no doubt the rights is motivated Republicans are motivated right now are they more motivated than Democrats I Can't tell you that\nNow I I Want you to the Mike called before we started talking about you know the the whole Russian collusion at the top of the hour and I say that because Mike was not driven to call based on what we had said\nAnd therefore he you know became passionate about giving his point of view across my called with that passion about the Russian collusion investigation and his anger and his feeling that this could possibly changed the election you know and and moving to the Republicans before we ever started talking about I think that's important\nBecause I don't find many people like Mike mhm I don't think honestly\nNow we covered everything when it comes to the whole Russian collusion from day one and we've asked every question known to ban kind of we do think that we have looked at more\nOr as investigators in partisans\nAnd we believe that hey that with everything going on and with the Pfizer warranted and and everything there that we are going to find out\nThat probably the Democrats were up to a lot more hijackings than the Republicans ever dreamed of actually doing as we know already the only evidence of clothing with the Russians in any way directly or indirectly would be the DNC and the Hillary campaign to\nGiving the money to uh Perkins gave it to a fusion GPS and gave it to the former spy Christopher Steele who said he got his information his salacious unbearable fight information\nOr I or against Donald Trump from people close to the Kremlin ... so the only people that colluded it any way with the Russians were the Democrats from the information that we have\nAt this particular point but I don't think right now that's driving anybody to go to the polls\nNo it really isn't um it it could it is it an underlying\nThat's driving anybody to go to the polls\nNo it really isn't um\nIt it could it is it an underlying factor as a part of the larger I guess scenario with Republicans or conservatives are based on following you know the work of of many really great reporters who who really brought to light so many things in this thing if you really followed it\nBut [noise] I mean could it be there again is that underlying motivator that's I don't think that's the big push right now I don't think that's the big emotion nothing right now um I Do think there's something to the the the fact that\nThey've been alleging all this since you know a after the election and since certainly who's become president\nUh and they never showed anything for it and and it's really been this media circus and it's really based on nothing I think that's a motivator but it's not what I don't think it's the here and now I don't I I just don't see it\nI look I I think that there are some people that have looked over the last couple of years and what the Democrats have done and they have included a ... and it's in the context the whole Russian collusion thinking how unfair they believe it is and maybe that's partly what's driving them to the polls but the difference that we've seen over the last month\nIn the energy level or what are they called the excitement level of Republican voters to come out\nWhich would make the difference\nIn keeping the house and increasing the number in the Senate none of that has to do with Russian collusion\nRight or the mall or investigation at all or not and see I don't\nKnow what a a a more report does the if the if the report from last week is true that says the that Mahler would would uh issue the core of his report after the midterm right after the mid term\nI I don't know what that does politically because first of all how can it be inaccurate report without including the fact\nThat of how all this information was obtained and what you just spelled out not us that direct line that we know\nThat no one has disputed between the DNC and the Hillary campaign and ultimately Christopher Steele\nYou can't you can't debate you and you can't you can't let out a report I don't think they do it's it's been completely what I Know the report right now it's not going to even talk about that in in that that Seoul point it's like a ... but it's not even going to talk about the possibility of drunk looting with the Russians\nI I just because where where would be the evidence if there's not going to be in a movement on indict if it is just to report a chrysalis over at CNN\nA former Washington Post I write it you know where he said you know I think it's a it's ultimately going to be just a just a report he's been saying that for a while it's it's ultimately just going to be a report it's really not going to be any more indictments unless maybe there's a you know lying to investigators charge somewhere else along the lines\nAnd and we've got what are the Michael Flynn hearing ... most\nOf us probably will never see this ... right because in and that will be a complete does that it'll just happened and right it's it's something I noticed the ... done the last two years of accusations don't just his owner\nExcept for the fact that you have the I. G. working on some information of what was going on at the department of justice during that time based on what the president and the White House sent to Mr Horwitz and we've been asking this where I still haven't seen anybody else\nAsked what what we asked why would the White House said it to the inspector general but we're talking about the\n... that is the most interesting mystery that exist right now in Washington DC and nobody is talking is asking the question what do you start out by the way on vacation I owed everywhere nobody is talking about talking about and we said it when it happened we said wise you send it into the I G the only reason you some of the ideas because\nYou suspect corruption why are there no leaks on this is nothing coming out on the story at All right\nWhen ... and people have just a refresher when rubber when President Trump said he's going to declassify\n... the Pfizer application and other emails that were sent between the FBI and the department of justice but it was a Twenty one different pages right ah and then it came out well he\nUh uh we have some allies or don't want us to ah you know release it there it might be some sensitive information so we're going to send it to the inspector general\nTo look at it and expedite whatever that are in Port yeah expedite a report out of and we said well why would you give it to the I. G. I. G. is nothing to do with whether you should release it\nOh corruption and how how to our allies know what would be a\nHow our allies know what's in it and what's not in it how could they object either way because they don't so why are you studying the I. G. because one reason you started the id is that you believe you because you declassified it has spotted a criminal event and\nYou know that as they the role of the I. G. and because of the power that they have\nThe gene can go in and get the documents that even oversight committees haven't been able to get\nWithin the department of justice and the White House wouldn't be able to get it I mean that would be a political move right and it's also takes it out of the political realm you give it to the idea you go to war which and see what Horwitz can find and forwards has access to every corner notes and cranny\nAnd the deal Jay and and since that happened what almost three weeks ago McGregor maybe yeah you and I said what are we missing here is that what what are we missing\nBut he also talking about this are we missing something completely in it right at eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nOver ...

benefited or not from that claim it's the fact that you tried to benefit from that claim and I think it bothers a lot of other people and it's something you haven't been able to put to rest since the twenty twelve campaign when she first mentioned having\nNative American heritage that led president Donald Trump to start start mocking her ... he had it I don't care what percentage she claims to be Native American I just care that I'm One hundred percent for Massachusetts and will be working for the people that state and but still it was bizarre that she decided to do that you and I were on vacation but I really sat there and what\nReally really\nI mean and it was it was southern proactive and deliberate and then the result she thought beyond that just ... they're not just checking it out but then taking the results and proving something with it\n[laughter] I'm a corrections throughout the morning while the Boston Globe I'm like yeah this is bizarre bizarre things are just thinking about this is the the really the three things that that uh the social justice warriors\nThat was driving them crazy first is cultural appropriation what operating my culture yeah\nWhich you know what ... what do you mean\nWell the yeah the Cherokee Nation came out and said look we you know we can't stand by her claims based on the test because this DNA tests doesn't assigned you know doesn't\nTell us which nation you may have belong to an end the ... the the other one was the accusation of that's the ultimate and white privilege breaking a fraction like that and\nClaiming that that you are non Native American that you're at minority right well that's the ultimate an ego and white privilege ego yes and arrogance I saw that one that a burst out laughing\nAnd the other one was wait a minute we
