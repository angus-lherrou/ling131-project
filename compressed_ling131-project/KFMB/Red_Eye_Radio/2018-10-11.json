McNamara eight six six Ninety a run I coming up on the bottom of the hour we will talk to me they're all just\nA a Tom hale in case you're just tuning in right now are waking up a hurricane Michael is now a tropical storm a latest update was so about an hour and a half ago from the national Hurricane Center and a sixty mile an hour winds tropical storm now sixty mile with our sustained winds and heading toward South Carolina\nYeah we'll hear from Tom uh his take on on uh the the this historic storm as it came ashore but also what to expect in the coming days or as the people of Georgia right now are feeling the wrath of\nTropical storm Michael all the entire state basically covered by that storm massive massive footprint\nAlso coming up and say about uh apparently the or the FBI getting that man who was going to build a bomb for election day mhm and detonated in Washington it looks like they went to his house and found two hundred pounds you know found some kind of explosive device or was like two hundred pounds you know uh you\nYou go back a day or two and listen to a Senator Rand Paul\nTalking about where the left is going and of course after his attack he knows all too well uh what people will do when they're politically motivated but talks about the greater potential love and and he said his concern that there will be on the SAT there might be an assassination or into another attempted assassination\nOr we go back to the um uh the the the ball field shooting of ...\nAnd how that was as we pointed out yesterday a multiple assassination attempt that shooter was out to get as many members of Congress as he could on that day so it's a real threat here is your national forecast brought you buy video roadblock\nWe will see the devastating effects of what hurricane Michael brought to when the sun comes up today but the system is still moving throughout the forecast area of southwest Georgia\nMost of South Carolina and below country of North Carolina today as well as portions of the tide water and Delmarva Peninsula will experience rain over the next twenty four hours or so\nOnly about two to four inches of rain however\nAs a system continues to move in London lose that Gulf moisture source\nAnd reaches Ireland yay yay [laughter] walk so [laughter]\nYeah well uh to our friends in Europe uh you know um you can have and we hope you does does that does that apply the water is warm enough that far north in the Atlantic to keep it going then\nYes okay yeah while I did\nI just assume by the time he got ... probably be cool down so I was surprised to hear that but there are still warming up [noise] yeah well and\nAnd and that's why we're having these storms and the you know the the normal hurricane season ends at the beginning of November right and so at this point there's a reason to that extent this is the fourth major hurricane\nThat we've had in the month of October period and so yeah that's a that's simply a and it was unusual to have a major hurricane to begin with in October when you consider that there's been four of them total\nAnd and so and it'll last night something that just sticks in my mind was and I can't remember which one of you said\nIt well is it going to kind of lose some power as it comes into shore and\nAnd I and my immediate reaction was no no [laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah and you were right 'cause I\nI'd asked that question which brings me to another question that is just a just personal interest to me\nAnd and that is when you get it from ... you know ... or tornadoes hurricanes get their energy from the warm water right yes All right so do does that mean\nThat a hurricane like this doesn't then does it as a result but it's taking the energy from the water does the water actually cool down\nA yeah actually it does because what it does this causes up boiling a which by the way is a very bad thing if you like\nVery bad thing if you like oysters Mm\nI've [laughter] I've just letting you know [laughter]\nNot a good or Easter season right\nI hate that came in in Nineteen eighty five was the last storm that hit this area of Florida and and and cake came in hold onto your hat\nAt Mexico beach wow the same place wow and for that entire year and I and I'm not sure it might have been longer than that it devastated the oyster crop of the Appalachian bay um you know ... right area\nWhile while in terms of the life of Michael you know from the time that it was officially a tropical storm too you know looking at the forecast as you mentioned a back out over water and the Atlantic\nOr is this going to be one of the longest living storms in terms of the the life the span of time that Michael is acting\nUm no I don't think so you've you've stumped me on that one because we've got some that don't even make it here but for some reason they just spin around in the mid Atlantic right we're in the western Atlantic and so I've never I've never looked into that yeah\nYeah um it it just seems that a ... and you mentioned this earlier talking about you know we always often we'll talk about a storm the remnants of the remnants of and as you mentioned\nWe this we're not going to get to that point in terms of it being overland here we're not going to talk about the remnants of Michael it will be still tropical storm Michael overland\nYes it is to Charlotte to rally in Norfolk\nYeah and that's where I'm concerned about a lot when it goes you know for that whole area up there the Hampton\nRoads area you know that area just floods [laughter] yeah and and so I mean we didn't talk about it a lot with Florence but it was flooding in Florence it was nothing compared to the flooding that was going on in in in central\nNorth Carolina right and so it never really picked up any news [noise] but\nWhen this goes over there I think we're going to hear a lot more about the Virginia beach Norfolk and Hampton Roads area as it probably exits somewhere right in that area and heads out into the end of the ocean and you know we haven't even touched on power outages right\nA power outages there is a is a huge swath that's going to be\nFrom power outage outages from Columbia pretty much all the way up to the uh uh Virginia border to at least to pass Wilmington and and just where you start to get into the outer banks violence\nUm this is widespread power outages and then we also throw in here the tornadoes now the tornadoes are kind of different they are\nNormally super cells so where you see the large cluster of thunderstorms which currently are moving their way across interstate twenty a heading toward Colombia and going through Augusta well that's not the likely place where you've got the heavy rain it's where\nThe feeder bands that are probably fifty to a hundred miles further out where there's individual cells and as we start to get into the morning hours where we'll have an an up tick in the\nUm what's called the low level jet stream and wins and we get a little sunshine we're going to see some um some\nSome possible super cells develop along in those ... and I'm a John Trump touchdown and he said when you get the friction of the land and you get this massive fast rotating storm\nAnd it hits the land or it kind of dragged to the bottom it creates wind shear and so the the the tornadoes are typically week they're F zeroes an F ones and um and they're they're shallow they're short lived and um\nAnd they're commonly in the north east quadrant of the storm so if you cut the storm in four pieces you've got your your northeast your southeast you've got your south west northwest well the the the one that is closest to the ocean\nAnd the further north than the quadrant where we see these individual cells and feed her band stringing their way and and so\nThat's the other area where we're going to be watching now yesterday we had a three tornadoes reported two in Georgia one in Florida\nI'm a long and near highway Seventy five as as the storm was moving its way through Panama City and northward\nToward Tallahassee inland and the main peninsula Florida that's where we saw those feeder bans coming in and we picked up the\nThe the tornado activity but says is this entire system moves forward we've got these threats one or the winds are going to topple trees\nTrees are going to topple power lines a power lines means widespread power outages over the central sections of the Carolinas\nAnd possibly into a southern Virginia then we have flooding and that flooding is going to be a along and through Fayetteville to the west as we get up into the hill country I call it\nA rally and so forth that area is is is is perfect for flash flooding because there's all kinds of ... and so forth hollers and that all\nCreates its own issues the flash flooding and it doesn't take a lot of rain considering all the soaking it has had [noise] and and then beyond the tree toppling the power outages and the tornados that that we have with this thing [noise] um you know it's a it's a pretty complete storm\nAnd it it has enough energy to maintain itself as a tropical storm until it gets out of here leaving Virginia Beach and heading for the are heading for the other side of the pond\nWow wow just incredible energy behind the storm and of course uh just unbelievable devastation in the wake of Michael ... and a much of that will still have to be assessed as the sun starts rise or in what is now that that path that the that Michael took\nA and I were just looking at at one website uh and and the power outages here reporting in the hundreds of thousands of course of several hundred yeah uh being affected here and they they said it for some of them it could be weeks\nOr a yeah I remember my ah my brother being affected they got to higher ground from their storm there on the Gulf Coast of Texas a and they went in they went inland but uh they couldn't go home for her it was a couple of weeks just for them and that storm was into the size and intensity that Michael was\nAnd so it could be weeks and weeks before some of these customers have power again right coming up here and just a little while we're going to get back with your time\nYou're in just a little while we're going to get back with you Tom we appreciate your time and we'll talk more about what to expect from tropical storm Michael at the bottom of

entering the uh South Carolina and will through the day go move up a true north Carolina and parts of uh southeastern Virginia before it heads off\nA in the Atlantic but uh as Tom and both the John ... told us a earlier a ... and and they predicted this was a storm that was going to stay together wasn't going to disperse and it looks like as we talk to Tom last hour he said all the way to Ireland\nOr it's going to it's going to remain a that there's enough heat even in\nThe uh uh I guess central northern part of the Atlantic and there's still enough heat to keep that together all the way across the big pond which by the way it'll it'll reach you know when you're Ireland and Great Britain Sunday yeah about that's a fast moving storm so\nWe'll have the latest update coming up here

start the morning we'll start that will start down\nA variety of different things\nUh it was interesting because I was thinking to myself I'm not really surprised by this\nAnd has written the wall Street Journal and said investors really weren't surprised by this and I'm thinking okay well I don't put myself in their category\nBut just looking at everything that's that that has been going on things you know little signs out there that you and I've talked about when you see the bond yields and you see what\nYou know treasury bills we just happen to be talking about that last night right and and we were looking at that at how the the interest rates on treasury bills for the most part has doubled in a year that's just in a year\nIt has doubled that you know\nThat means there's more money that the government has to pay out\nJust a four in ... she got the fed now are wanting to uh raise rates the story was out said did we do this on the air off the air about uh that uh because uh ... what we did it on their mortgages were going up and spend a lot of time on it\nSo you have these these loans out there that were set to balloon and mature and as they were the rates were going up which meant when it jumped to that ultimate rate it was going to be much higher than expected\nWell when you had delinquency rates are as as they started to creep up and up the forecast for that sky rocketed because of the rise in interest rates that was ultimately going to doom those homeowners it was clear well if they can't keep up right now\nWell then what it balloons out with even a higher rate to a higher rate than uh than they had expected and plan for well all bets are off it's just not going to happen and that's that's part of that was part of the dynamics in place\nWell what you have here is you know uh the basically the fed going in and the the point Kramer was making is that\nIt was not Jim Kramer at CNBC in the street dot com was that he wants a more regimented and he wants them to do the homework on the economy he feels that the fed is not doing their homework and they should review the data because to his point\nWhat do we know about the fallout from terrorists what do we know about\nA long term effect uh you know you have a few genes saying you know part of the the um the demand for from China has softened greatly and so part of their problem was not just the the the cost of materials and freight well oil\nBut that that's an admission from the administration that the economy isn't expanding as quickly as they fight as they're selling and therefore we can't raise the interest rates in a way that's politically that's an admission that it's not going as good as it should\nRight because if you are saying that you're raising interest rates um and it it is regimented and and really has a you know a ... ... if your point is a ... ... ... have been ... that they should wait\nYou know Jim Kramer saying it is one thing but at the point is being made that the the feds don't need to raise rates right now well you are\nYou are admitting you're saying that our policy is also affecting you have to admit that any policy by any governing entity is is affecting negatively\nRight terrorists or whatever it might be right ... regulation and taxes because that's what a tariff it doesn't matter whether you call it a terror for an income tax whatever if your tax if you're raising the cost of doing business it's always going to hurt well and\nAnd that will see in the coming days where where the market rebounds if they believe this is long lived if they if they're going to be long lived if if they believe that the administration is going to do an about face on terrorism and and the tears even in the situation with China because it's ... it's affecting negatively way too many producers here in the U.S\nA than than the market will adjust accordingly but if we start seeing that uh that fear become the reality in the economic numbers then the market will also ... and the way of\nOr if you see positive news coming out of leadership in Congress or we want to get this NAFTA thing done right yeah but I've heard nothing not yet nothing right

down as much as three hundred points to start off the day now right right and you know so you're you're talking about eleven twelve hundred points\nUh and and who knows what would happen the rest of the you know the the day you never know because a ... ... people might try to buy whatever but it's it's the fact that it was as you said when you look at it it was the worry\nFrom the tech companies and a lot of that has to do with regulation ... it's about trade and as you mentioned the one company as a pie BJ PG ... right and and the caterpillar a company is a deal\nPillar uh companies a deal in international trade their stocks were down right where did people put their money and utilities what does that mean you put it in utilities when you think there's going to be if there's a possibility of a downturn in the economy ... or say he probably going to be using electricity they're going to be using gas that you have a market\nThat is in all likelihood going to crash in any way mhm so uh you know we've got trade you've got interest rates and the bonds you've got the fed any interest rates you got regulation worries uh in in the tech sector and trade and tariffs\nAnd that number is going to grow as it gets into the Carolinas and I think the next big numbers for power outages are going to be in the Carolinas during Florence\nBetween the Carolinas they had over seven hundred and fifty thousand power outages and I think this is capable of of if not repeating it at least bringing in another four to five hundred thousand customers\nNow and so we're going to get a will get over the two million mark on on people affected without any kind of power\nAnd then you have the question they were staging people for power\nIn Pensacola and just draw circle around from Pensacola around this whole area a thousands of power of of trucks utility trucks right\nThey're going to go into the areas they can get into first so maybe the Carolinas and George and so forth they are going to have a better shot at getting power even though they did stage I Believe the number was up to Nineteen hundred power trucks uh\nAround the uh Pensacola area and around the panhandle\nAnd so you know they're going to be working as hard as they possibly can but just the physical flooding an inundation and the damage and the debris is going to limit the time that it's going to take for them to get their power back so I still believe that\nThe landfall area the pan handle the took the greatest brunt is going to have the longest period of time to restore power I mean [noise]\nFace it there's a lot of places they don't have to restore power to anymore but they still have to be able to address the power lines that went there\nSure yeah the infrastructure itself has to be restored and and as you mentioned there may not be a a customer are there any longer unfortunately but\nStill is a a a a an infrastructure because down that line of course there are other customers that that has to have to be\nA half to get that power and have it to restore the the if you look at uh the uh the impact there as it came ashore a hurricane Michael again one for the record books you and I I was asking you the question kind of put you on the spot last hour but you\nYou actually answered it on the spot very well and and were corrected generally speaking talking about the longest lasting\nA hurricane and and I found a little data their weather dot com about ah this would be a hurricane John back in Nineteen Ninety four which had a a thirty day run a this thing traveled nearly eighty two hundred miles and all out in the Pacific\nEffect of Hawaii but then kept going and but ah roughly a thirty day run but I mean if you look at and you mentioned this earlier and it it has something to remind folks that are still in the path of Michael that\nTypically and very often we see a that a storm or or hurricane starts to fall apart over land and then we we hear words like the remnants of but there are no remnants and again this is a well formed tropical storm a that is traveling uh right now headed for the Carolinas and wreaking havoc\nOn on Georgia and uh and then we'll go back out over the ocean or we also\nWant to go where you name it extra tropical once it goes out over the ocean ... okay and and write\nIs it's it's no longer in the it's no longer a tropical storm in the tropical zones or so forth and it's going to lose power to forty miles an hour and then it'll regained power and that regained power is considered extra tropical but it's\n... you're right in in nailing it here the it it may not be the thirty days storm that meanders out there and\nBecause it's making good time but it's definitely covering a lot of terrain\nWhile it really is traveling in the end and speaking of traveling up for those professional drivers out there\nAnd the high profile trucks I Know that are\nThat are Jon Traub mentioned this earlier it bears repeating for those truck drivers that are and they know if they're seizing driver they know a that those those are the those sustained wins a the ... whether it's hurricane force even tropical storm force\nCan turn one of those trucks over that can happen very easily and we're not even talking about the gusts or as you mentioned\nSo as far as you mentioned the the threat of the tornadoes there those sustained winds at forty forty five miles an hour or can wreak havoc on those high profile vehicles there along Ninety five\nAnd as you mentioned we're going to see kind of that route over the next day or so uh with with Michael it will kind of hug I guess a Ninety five in a way a so those traveling along Ninety five need to be aware of that uh because that as a main quarter of course between Florida and New York well and and then we'll go ahead\nTo some ... some degree they're going to have this stuff that they're back the wins and so that the the probably my biggest concern would be three eighty five and a twenty uh although right now it's moving across twenty with very heavy rain in Augusta\nAnd but there are a number of those roads forty as another one going up and the Raleigh Durham right Seventy four that comes out of Wilmington heads to Charlotte every one of those crossroads the ... I don't have a number four but the one from Wilmington that that goes into Seventy seven through Florence\nAll of those east west roads are going to have cross wins\nRight yes Tom where does this go on the record books\nAh it goes in the record books as the number three a storm to hit the United states while a and it it and it goes in the record both primarily because of intensity or low pressure at at\nNine Nineteen Miller bars um just beyond that position number four in the record book happens to be Katrina\nSurprisingly enough and then behind that cat five Andrew is number five in the record book but what I found really intriguing and we talked about this yesterday about a continuing to grow as it moved its way in short mhm\nAtmosphere was perfect not in the last hour drive from nine twenty two to nine Nineteen\nIt was deep and in an intensifying even as it was starting to come on shore wow I haven't seen that that I haven't seen that much of a change to begin with a three meal a bar drop 'em\nAnd at the same time it went from one hundred and fifty\nAnd a ... and that's what I found when I when I woke up from my nap after the the morning show [laughter]\nHigher up that I [laughter] hundred and fifty yeah why\nAnd then it jumped to a hundred and fifty five yeah now the ten I'm as Kendall Airforce base yes right and\nA ten dollar has a radar and that radar was queer read as it was coming ashore at um I Believe it was clear he'd at five thousand feet or four thousand feet wind speed wind speed there a hundred and Seventy seven miles now\nNow that doesn't translate to the surface but it obviously um\nThere were probably there were easily guess over a hundred and thirty miles an hour in this particular storm that made it down to the surface\nBut that's just to give you an idea how\nPowerful this thing is and again I have to thank all the people who ... went out there and report it and covered this I'm ... and and I saw a much more professional manner of them covering it this time you know you may have noticed everybody in the weather channel that was out there\nHad had their hand held Anna monitors this time yes they're down here and right yeah they didn't want to have anybody walking behind them with a grocery cart\n[laughter] yeah right exactly yeah the\nKind of ruined the drama if you will because you know and and that's you know if you look at this ... a storm\nEight carried on it carried all of its drama Michael game with his own drama uh it was there was plenty of it you didn't have to go\n[noise] I make anything of it it was a storm that\nJoke for itself and its intensity or I or coming up or we will ah ah the we will ... will let you go back and get a nap after we talked [laughter] bottom of mess our time and and we'd greatly appreciate your work on this and and really putting everything into perspective\nOr as we a lot of people will still be doing in the in the coming days and weeks and I think you're probably included in that group civil we'll talk with you Tom and at the bottom of next out ... yeah I learned a lot I definitely ...\nOur will do timing and flash flooding\nYeah wow yeah maybe Ronald just Tom hill thank you and we'll talk to you at the bottom of the next hour eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nOver your goals six six months he wrote are on the radio [noise]\nIf you have driven over one million preventable accidents three miles than registered and joined the million mile club on line and red eye radio show dot com red eye radio in our sponsors support your safety on the highway\nThere's not much point in driving a fuel efficient truck if you have to give up everything that makes driving a truck great\nSo step up to the extreme efficiency of the western dark fifty seven hundred ... and get your top back the fifty seven hundred X e combines western stars extreme heritage with dinosaurs advanced engineering to significantly improve the efficiency dependability in profitability\nMinor illnesses become severe leading to hospitalization and disability the driver then may lose their CDL and become unable to work this creates a downward spiral that leads to extreme financial hardship and possible unemployment\nGo to truckers fund up or today and learn more about how you can contribute if you are someone inside the trucking industry may be a need\nBurnout SDF can help we encourage you to educate yourself and here's another thing Christopher truckers fun today donate if you can you never know when you may need some help too that's\nTruckers fund dot org let's band together for a better tomorrow [noise]\nMarriages find Seventy five years the seven of empty San Diego's talk radio news\n\nYou've CBS News on the hour sponsored by their works relief\n...

listed along with uh the the materials cost oil and freight costs rising again that that goes against earnings\nSo all of this is the the market assessing a what is happening there are there are things that are an adjustment as as an expansion\nOf well by the way that the the cost of oil whether you agree with that or or or not right and it's also based on on the government policy of ... of foreign policy of saying yeah OK we need to put the sanctions against Iran which does what means there's\nLess soil and again this isn't a judgment on whether you agree with it or not it's just the reality of supply and demand right of regulation of making things more expensive for whatever reason will hurt in an economy\nWell and and and I think the president was right to call out Saudi Arabia and and talk yeah I Know what they have been able to because they basically are now that I mean they and they have been for a long time they are OPEC if you if you talk about the you know the controller inside the OPEC member nations it's Saudis and so\nThey're talking about them increasing you know and and ah or in ...\nThe ... or in their cage they have been up to now decreasing their output 'em and they do that because they know the rising a production rate here in the U.S\nIs threatening to them and so they want to ah basically slow production to control the cost they do that and the global cross start to rise by\nThe way another benefit to greater domestic production because when when we get to the point that we are producing as much as we consume every day as a nation than\nYou ... you will what the dynamics of a market and the Saudis and Iran and anyone else but I don't have that behind it but it's a story we brought you last week because of of President Trump mhm uh they're opening up the spigot yes exactly in Saudi Arabia and which is what he wanted them to do and and and that's you know for right\nNow because the way what we're producing and how much we're producing a we're not at that rate of Eighteen to Nineteen million barrels a day in production when we get there that's another case to be made for wrapping up that production and\nMore on our way

today but the system is still moving throughout the forecast area of southwest Georgia most\nOf South Carolina and below country of North Carolina today as well as portions of the tide water and Delmarva Peninsula will experience rain over the next twenty four hours or so only about two to four inches of rain however as a system continues to move in London lose that Gulf moisture source\nAnd we have a frontal boundary coming in\nI'm not sure I didn't check that I heard that but I\nDid not follow up on that someone had said that it it it makes it worse than it was in that that it was high tide at that at that point but I I don't know about that timing it that held that was kind of early in the day and and I don't know I I'm not sure if that was the ...\nMy thought was that it was coming off high tide and ... that had been and and if you if you noticed in the last\nTwo hours everything got real intense in the last hour yeah yeah actually the very last one hour like we've talked about right everything just one boy it's getting bad fast yeah I'm I noticed that a Stephanie Abrams a shout out to one great meteorologist I'm\nStephanie was staying in a port St John and that's where her crew and our team was and and each one of the\nReporters is responsible for as cheap as the met over the team is responsible for their safety [noise] but she would apparently they weren't staying at a hotel they were staying with some kind of family or maybe a bed and breakfast or something like that\nAnd they couldn't get them to evacuate\nWow and so and so you mentioned you mentioned it earlier in the beginning of the show that that\nYou know a ten tore made the suggestion you don't get the heck out of here and ready to get where\nBecause we know where this is going to land\nAnd you also mentioned that the guidance showed five days out that [noise] wow it it nailed it\nYeah yeah for half right yeah yeah the path that half\nOf where it was going to where it was possibly going ahead at five days out and Florence was two miles off the target at five days out [noise]\nHas done heard of\nYet yeah Florence and and and all of us meteorologist got goose bumps when they heard this yeah why and\nBut there's there's there's some things that are going on in giant data processing\nWhen it comes to our models and our satellite imagery which has changed the way we forecast hurricanes water vapor imagery which allows us to see the exact point where the center is of rotation and be able to see the wind flow at different levels\nAnd we have some computer models in the mid west that forecast\nOver in Eighteen hour period of time\nWhere there are going to be outbreaks of severe thunderstorms and potentially knowing the conditions we can tell if it's just going to be a thunderstorm if we have all the conditions favorable for tornadoes and and these models will pinpoint some things and I recall\nMay ninth two thousand sixteen pinpointed\nA little area I'm up near Duncan, Oklahoma and sure enough that was five or six hours out\nA thunderstorm developed right in that little area continue to grow and turned into what was a became what was called the winning would tornado or that came rolling across interstate thirty five right a south appalls valley um and so the accuracy justice down to me\nIs getting and like ... like over the last the accuracy now compared to ten or Fifteen Years ago\nSeven ... seven all over the last ... last Seventy or soccer\nOr the H H triple our model is what we call it that was an experimental model and that was experimental seven years ago even five years ago but as we started to use it because they put it out and let all of his shoes it we realized and grew incompetence of that model being crushing only accurate\nAnd and so you see a lot of TV stations with a\nWeather models that are called future cast and so forth misses a handful of private companies IBM included the owns a the weather company\nOr not the weather channel they actually have their own proprietary model accuweather has its own proprietary model\nEnterprise ah barons has its own proprietary models and then of course is the government models and and I don't know how much they they they steal from each other's\nData information to hone it down to where it's at but we're getting ... very very accurate and being able to forecast little world tools and the atmosphere which creates circulation lift and the potential for storms up\nThat's always an odd thing and and just amazing to watch it happened but again we go back to you know the basis of of why people do what they do and and wind meteorologist or\nA ... like you mentioned earlier and yesterday on talking about the you know the the idea of being able to warn people and if we can learn and the technology gets better than obviously in future storms there is a greater warning which means a greater survive ability of those storms so Tom we just want to\nThank you thank you and you answered all my questions that so many so many things you are a yeah yeah it's all about us we had really you know but if you knew that coming into this one [laughter] they told you that [laughter] but uh you know hurricane\nFlorence and Irma and uh and and everything you've done for re read I Am and the listeners out there really\nAre working for the public in and getting the word out and and really breaking down what these storms Maine and the\nDanger behind such storms or it has definitely been a pleasure and I will just say this I Hope we don't talk to you for a long long time ago but I I Know I Know we will and uh and and we definitely will put your back to work here at red eye radio or any chance we get because we know the great value\nOf the mind and experience a meteorologist Tom hale Tom thank you thank you\nNo thank you guys are at eight six six Ninety run I\nHow much do you know about synthetic oil\nHeavy duty trucks have been running on traditional mineral oil for the last one hundred years but today's technology brings us other options to consider it's better quality unlike mineral oils\nSynthetic oils consistent molecular restructure giving it the ability to support pressures from iron horse power engines especially at lower rpm Z then also allows oil to reduce friction in an engine controlling temperatures and improving fuel economy there cleaner", "show_name":
