Montana governor Steve bullock a you know the obvious ones from Pocahontas apt to Joe Biden to a Spartacus Booker\nTo Kamala Harris probably leaving I'll call them all I'm leaving some people out who would you like who's nice who do you have a Bernie Sanders right in the same 'cause that that's what I suggested to a caller\nI think I could sit down with Bernie I have a coke or something like that with him and there's nothing we would agree on me seems like a nice guy but the caller was talking to was in a nod never could sit down with him\nUm so that's the second question is there anybody in the other side no matter what side right could you sit down with Donald Trump I actually heard he's a nice guy that he's got a different persona I don't get mad at me I'm not saying he's not a nice guy that I don't support his views but it comes across pretty bombastic and right\nSo there's lots of things that maybe some of us wish you wouldn't say but they seem very soft spoken in in in a private he's really nice I Know people I met him and he sounds different so no matter which side you're on could you sit down and be friendly the way a mentioned last night that Ronald Reagan did with the former speaker of the house Tip O'Neill\nThey would have drinks on a friday night or whatever and Reagan was surprised that they would you Tip O'Neill would be so ... of viciously against him during the daytime and two of us they time but it's gotten so bad now that we can acknowledge that maybe someone on the other side is okay I made if if um [laughter]\nThey appear to me Cory Booker I

guess if you're on the Democrats' side because\nThey Trump or pants I guess or someone is administration will allow that in the rules and speaking of ah who you'd like let's go and see who felt likes in Cleveland fill up your on with mark\nMark relieving the oh I Want to first of all say something ... refer some English said while ago about you know for a\nTrump or out and dance game vice president that the speaker of the house because my friend and that is not the way it works speaker of the house is second in line to the President's Day after the uh the vice presidential\n... he's thirty right after last person you may not hurting me I corrected that in the last hour just didn't want to get robbed him at the time I live near al\n... and which also would would would scare me a little bit if Nancy Pelosi was speaker of the house that would really be a scary thing that happened but uh you know we talk about the Democratic nominee you know a Joe Biden\nHe had a copy the speech of new ... a British\nThat uh yeah I imagine they plagiarized ... yeah I Believe in\nAlmost word for word there I'll tell you who I who I Would yeah I'm a conservative but I Do I Would think would would be a good person to run on the Democratic side would be a\n\nDeep we lose and he's a former secretary\nThe navy ... wrote a book in ... and uh but\nWho is that we didn't we didn't catch you you you you got cut off or was that\nWas Jim Webb Jim when I was a former governor and he's a former\nUs secretary of the night and uh I just I I don't think he would have a chance a isn't that much chance last time so that the Democrat Party so\nMoved away from men like him Sam Nunn was the former senator that I could have voted or looked at seriously as a presidential candidate even though I'm I'm a not a Democrat but look up but\nHe he wouldn't even be acceptable to the Democratic party but I Am someone I Would like CNN or even whipped he's he's a good man as\nHas good instincts and is able to work across the aisle sincerely and to do things he worked for a Republican president as sex or the night\nOf the people who announced could you pick one of them to sit down and have a cup of

I Would enjoy\nYou were I Would enjoy that I wouldn't enjoy he would if he would let me call and if he was listening in\nAnd not you know not just a demagogue everything on him his personality I don't know what they believed him but the\nIt would be a ... call do you know what Lindsey Graham said about you know what Lindsey Graham said about Bernie Sanders a little I always have\nThese stories of Bernie Sanders got married in a Soviet Union and some people think he never came back\n[laughter] ... so it is\nBut I thought you know I was like hey Philip thanks for your call appreciate it\nEarmarked new program\nLike there's so much I buy oh and here's someone is going to lie I think is going to ask me right away de in Las Vegas drawn with mark\n... I think the one I Would want to have coffee with is Dina Titus now she ran for governor hearing loss only two hundred vote to show [noise] and she was a schoolteacher in the sense of a woman\nAnd I I really do think that in the tightest could approve of all the dirty tricks and terrible thing to Democrats are doing there's just no way and I predict she's going to switch party affiliations shouldn't his election stuff is over\nBecause I'm sure she kisses uphold is a lot of those\nCars that it's just not acceptable and she was raised better than that I Know [noise] so yeah that was going to have coffee with swimming beat Dina 'cause there's just no way in the world she could have proof of any of this okay\n... ... ... except for one thing the I appreciate your call didn't follow the rules the game was you had to pick someone running for president not that I Know her and I do know some of the other candidates running I certainly didn't know them well\nBut the the game was you had to pick someone who's running for president and say who you would sit down and have coffee with an eye on the other gentleman agreed me Bernie Sanders I\nThat's I think he's a head right now so we got to hear your votes let us know what you think an eight six six Ninety red eye or right now you have your national forecast or video road block\nWhether highlights around the nation today persistent rain is expected for the next few days over Texas where excessive rain as possible in the central part of the state where three precipitation over the higher elevations of Arizona and New Mexico is expected to spread northward into the central Rockies\nTemperatures twenty to forty degrees below normal from the southern plains\nInto the southern Rockies under persistent clouds and ...

country a ... he's a he's a Republican correct so yeah you know I I I I Would think that ideally he'd make a great pie minimum at minimum you'd make or break the\nUh as opposed to a ... you know I mean look at Trump Trump is already wise you chose a as\nAs the tea and it's it's great insurance ... behind you sew anything ever gosh forbid goes dramatically raunchy cameras all you've got it you've got a man who could step into your shoes and probably do just as well as you get\nOn the run your very articulate and you are blind challenge do for a Republican you did very well so I appreciate your call and you have a great night thanks so much and let's go to ... ah yeah we have time right you can in these that Hammond, Indiana\n[laughter] yeah I wanted to speak to the question of of prosecuting Hillary Clinton [noise] um ... you don't win much world or if you lose an election you out one or two choices you to leave the country or you go to jail or worse\nRight I mean one of the reasons we're a stable democracy is because there are certain political norms that we don't\nLie awake all remember a set aside the ... the possibilities Democrats going through ten years of Donald Trump's tax returns after he leaves office a think back to the Bush administration a lot of people both at the enhanced interrogation was unlawful\nRight so so we don't I don't think we want to get into a pattern where the incoming administration prosecute the leader leaders will go\nLeader the leaders of the ... the former nutritional leaders of the other party because our our politics have become too hostile as it is we need to take a step back\nAnd understand that there are certain traditions that are critical to our are having a stable democracy that we have and rule of law is only one of the\n... well that's an interesting point because it you know a lot of people and the other side I think she shouldn't be above the law\nBut as you point out that she has a unique position of also having been the opposing candidate which of course doesn't explain what the what what was the what wait a second what the FBI and the Justice Department did with a soft coup trying to get rid of the incoming president\nSo this is a very complicated situation and she ... the\nJustice Department go but I'll give you one for girls very few marquee after the civil war right the Confederate Sam committed treason could obviously committed treason year we did not try to walk them up because it was more important than the rule of law that we come back to get\nGood at what point can I say you know I said you may not hurt me I said whoever talked me last night in quite say that but that's what I was thinking\nOn this issue with Hillary a you made a good point and that that's a great point with the civil war I appreciate you could you have coffee with on the other side or would\nWould probably I Would probably lead toward a Ben Sasse\nUh-huh and he's a bright guy now he's have things things are good you did you pass the test you did very well thanks so much\nHere I Am I Can't stay with Tucker process that have you ever watch Fox News got these people answering questions in the news that's kinda dumb but this is interesting because\nWho'd you get along with people the way it used to be with Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan you get along with people of the opposing party and and get away from the politics for a little while because you would least respected them speaking of respecting let's go to live in Pittsburgh Lynn you're on was mark\nWell you know I had a rude awakening this morning I uh I woke up and my radio was still on and I heard right just Joe and\nHas a dissertation on how I'm basically he can shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and and why you should be able to get away with it um\nBut as Hillary is concerned um I kind of signed on to the previous caller just might be for me um if she really had broken the law and been found guilty\nThen certainly she should be locked up [noise] um but right just Joe that sounded like a polluted twisted demonic rant\nAnd it when I hear people like him talking it makes me wish that the Native Americans in this country had bars\nOn the shores of this country to keep his nasty lazy hateful ancestors out of this country\nAnd I would like to have coffee and wait on on the other side I'm\nEven though I disagree with most of her politics um as a progressive myself that would be a Lisa Murkowski\nBecause that woman she says she's a strong woman she's she's an example to to to women on my side ah\nNow that's a woman with some integrity and character and strength and she's a bad ass\nWould you have said that if she voted for Kavanaugh's nomination\nNo I'm thinking about some of her actions over a period of time I remember when when uh there was a little sprayed with Trump and I'm a she says she wasn't going to live in fear of a tweet\nWow that really knocked me back I was really impressed with that so she showed that she's a she's a woman up strength\nAnd character and she's not going to be bullied by anybody on on either side so\nBefore I let you go who's your choice who is your choice of the Democratic nomination\nWell I haven't decided yet I Would like for some of the old you know the old timers to just step aside\nA here in my a state that we've we we have someone that a lot of people were liking ah his name is Conor Lamb and I really like for you know you know what like for more people like him the rides\nAnd I don't want to see Joe Biden run again um I think that he's had a history of saying some stupid things and and uh\nIt I I Would not like to see him run again a he's a good guy but um you know some of these people just need to step out of the way\nAnd a lot of new crop of progressive uh come through\nYeah great point Lynn I appreciate your call a especially on the other side [laughter] by the way saying talking about stepping aside so you got Nancy Pelosi in her seventies\nCliburn I think his third in line Sonny ... in his seventies their own there's nothing wrong with that except for ah she was saying a lot of people would like there was an article about I don't know some times where it was about people stepping aside for the younger generation problem is in the house if you serve in the house\nAnd you don't share a committee you're just like if it's not a very\nUh what can I say a interesting life to leave you know I mean is that I'd love to be a congressman viewpoint to me tomorrow that's not what I'm saying but compared to the other physicians there\nBut the Democrats have a problem to\nLet me know what your things or asking to questions who is your choice to run against a President Trump and who could just sit down and have a cup of coffee

he's accomplished in with their hands tied behind his back already he's killing it was because he owns nobody\nAnything this state problem was only I think going to be solved by making people accountable leader and FBI when the CIA and the justice system but we can do\nIt that makes us in third world country I mean here's a laundry list of things that Hillary Clinton could go to prison for as long as your husband as well as their daughter\nAnd starting with block Obama and down to the lowly is person working in the White House right now under this administration they need to be held accountable and by that I Need they need to go to jail and they need to give up their money\nMoney is what gives them the power\nAnd and and with all the money and without the power there nothing and we need to start taking this seriously my God we ... the main Joe who called a ages ago a doubt yeah what are we teaching our children I stand on the top one night next to him everything he said twice\nBecause my tax dollars are paying are going to these college isn't getting these communist candy or they're teaching our children to hate our country to hate America\nAnd and now we wonder why the countries the way it is because nobody's been taught civics nobody knows how the government works they've done them down\nThat's like the way they like something these kids need to be sent that sort of being sent to terrorists you know uh to to do their um say in college and give you sent to Cuba doesn't get killed off or to Venezuela and see how that works out for them that socialist

just aren't educated\nYou know what I mentioned Bruce person in the last night one of the things he said on my show years ago was every generation has to learn what makes America exceptional\nOver and over again because certainly if the schools aren't doing it and ... knew that if they can and documenting the kids get them early enough they'd have future generations of voters but you're absolutely right they except for people like me they never hear the other side I get both sides they don't even know what party I mean\nBut they never hear when I was going to run\nFor office the president on his face the man is a pure communist [laughter] I mean and what's your name Hillary Clinton is as solid landscape personified I mean it's just so was ... ... why do we want these people to turn this country into what one is the way it is\nRight why\nBecause your eye on her side to it\nWell people don't understand they don't how evil communism\nIs was they don't know I remember I quoted Michael Moore that when they do in our capital planning on let me just finish wait hold on hold on one second I called him you know it's okay I quoted Michael Moore when they said to him he said he doesn't want capitals and they said to him so what would you replace it with and he said we haven't found yet\nSo even there are some people are proud of don't even yeah that's what he said\nUh you're but you're absolutely right because they've never heard the other side and they think the young people thing today that socialism is wonderful but I have no clue because\nThey've been taught that ... I mean it's I I'm sure you've taught civics in school to you're taught how the government work three branches we had to learn that we had to run a court case these kids today they they don't they don't mean man in the street and they ask people these questions and\nThey don't have a clue not a clue and the building and the next election\nI mean it may be going to be certain criteria for being able to that maybe you need to be a landowner\nHave to have a have a stake in this you know have a dog in that race and you know in order to that I mean ... it come to my country I Want you to speak our language I Want you to assimilate how you can have your culture delighted to have your culture but this is America\nAs if you want to be here assimilate\nLearn our language don't mean you learn your is\nYeah but the government's made it to have to they don't have to learn our language you are good thank you very much and the hang in there because you know we can turn it around and certainly Donald Trump is is come at the right time let me tell you that because of Hillary gotten elected taught help yeah states of America thanks very much\nAnd uh we'll take the rest of your calls let me know what you're thinking eight six six Ninety red eye where decide you know you helping us choose who should be on the Democratic side for president\nAnd maybe I didn't ask for I think there's a little too angry I don't think she would have me buddy uh but uh who you might have coffee with and sit down and even though he didn't agree with him\nIt's like six as I said nine o seven thirty three thirty nine mark I serve on red eye radio\nWith ... ... ... ...

nations really letting them have it in a very courageous not being afraid to say like it is\nShe's a very impressive lady she going to run for president maybe you know obviously not this time but in the future\nYeah yeah yeah I mean you have someone\nWith a very large perspective on our nation and clearly we can be a good a good companion a good name for a good partner in a global perspective I think that's very important to\nSo thanks for I guess I guess we'll let\nYou hold on one second 'cause I'm going to ask you your ... your answer ... question but I don't like John Case there's something about the guy uh they didn't come across well he did run as a Republican last time against Trump and the other\nWashington but I don't like John Case if there's something about the guy\nOr they didn't come across well he did run as a Republican last on against Trump and the others there's something about him that irritates me something I mean I I don't agree with him on everything is a little too liberal for me that that's fine is that's neither here nor there but something personally about him\nI I think he's arrogant I think he comes across that when I've heard some things about him I had a former a producer my TV show who said something about women or something like that that was years ago so that's not fair that is a rumor or something about that guy and rubs me the wrong way but you don't feel that way you'd like\nTo bail us budget I mean we we can go on with the kind of spending I mean I Love this country and we have a lot of good programs like agriculture and you know we need to defend ourselves and\nYou know we we just can't keep going on every time somebody as another hobby is that it was something that you just get it because they know enough money for the next campaign\nI mean that's both sides of the aisle it all and it's just been going on and on and on and they can't go on forever I mean when you get to the point where the debt as the gross national product you know theoretically that's bankruptcy\nAnd we're we've got to find a way you know we've got to find a way to to to have a better reasonable expectation about what kind of government spending we we can have in this country\nOne of the things I always say is people do not understand that the government\nHas no money of its own you'd be surprised maybe how many people think oh you remember that a woman or during the Obama campaign the first ones that are Obama's going to pay for a mortgage and pay for gas and they said where are you gonna where's he going to get out of his stash stash you know same out\nOf his staff ... he was going to personally pain so people don't know that they said that the government has no money of its own\nI thank you very much for your call very well said and I appreciate it very much and we'll take the rest of your calls at eight six six Ninety red eye or right now\nYou're a national forecast for how many trucks\nWhether highlights around the nation today persistent rain is expected for the next few days over Texas where excessive rain as possible and the central part of the state where three precipitation over the higher elevations of Arizona and New Mexico is expected to spread northward into the central Rockies\nTemperatures twenty to forty degrees below normal from the southern plains\nInto the southern Rockies under persistent clouds and precept Santa Ana winds in Southern California over the next several days should gradually abate around the horn we've got New York city checking in with sunshine for later today and sixty the high\nOr there was no cooperation all that kinda stuff\nBut there are other senators like uh what's the name of ... Heidi Heitkamp whatever name is ah she's in big trouble and in fact the way out is the the whole ... Kevin a fiasco is help the Republicans just the Democrats were always be there are always ready to go out there and\nDo anything they could to go against Trump but now you've got Republicans motivated and in fact of Kevin I hadn't won I think they would have been so demoralized would have been worse\nBut our problems are in the house the house representatives because it is quite possible that the Democrats could take back the house and as I've said for the last few nights they take back the house\nYou're in the Capitol hearing will pale in comparison to what they'll do trying to impeach Kevin I'm trying to impeach Trump\nWith hearings with subpoena powers a with calling for their impeachment he's not going to be fun\n[noise] no it's I think it's going to get ugly I personally but that that happens I think that uh nothing good will come out of that I promise you that\n[noise] that would be\nCrazy I mean I I honestly didn't leave anything\nFor that to me I didn't really do any of that but it didn't die down critical to me um [noise] I mean I did a lot of background I have it all and he just seemed like the most honest\nI'd probably be what the what the best judges that are on there as of right now in my opinion [noise]\nI mean he got old yet and we had our we've got [noise]\nWhat what are the best judges that are on there as of right now in my opinion [noise]\nI mean he\nGot old yet and we had heard we've got [noise] [noise]\nNo I was going to say they he seems like a decent guy and you as you started to say over three hundred opinions or whatever but the fact is in her case I just think that we're using her as long as we're talking about who should run for president a Democrat side\nA smart against both her and I call them that 'cause his own name [laughter] Kamala Harris they they were just using that woman maybe maybe she imagined it if someone didn't do that assault on her\nAll those things are possible but they use their for their own purposes it was disgusting to watch\nUh [noise] it was difficult it was\nHorrible it was really what was he was [noise] yeah that's what Lindsey\nGraham was so good when he came out and said that I'm not going to put up with this stuff you guys are doing this for power you yeah you know now to be ashamed of yourself what you're willing to do and but that's where they are they ought to be yeah well thank you so much for the [noise]\nAbsolutely all all that because that but yeah\nWell thanks so much time and uh yeah Jo measure would be that picky seems like a decent guy uh like I said I don't it's not fair for me to take away some of his courage a winning seems so nice and and reasonable I think he is going to win but someone who is less than ... and I said I mentioned this\nIs Hillary I'd love to see Hillary run again a for selfish reasons I think she is going to run again because the skies\nMeaning Hillary and bill they can't keep away from power that's what the what is an aphrodisiac people say so and the Democrats even have figured that out they don't even want her to enter the fray she's viewed as the kiss of death for democratic candidates in the upcoming midterm election\nForcing the former presidential candidate to stay low and campaign only behind closed doors by the way that makes sense because I sit on the air for many months now you know she's still looking to see a why she lost\nLike she's going to come out I suggested she'll come out with a book a hundred and one reasons why I lost in none of them will be her I have nothing to do with her\nAnd I said she could join the OJ Simpson as he looks for the killer to figure out who killed his wife but few Democrats are willing to embrace Clinton on the campaign trail despite the party's near universal support for just two years ago\nWith many concerns out of high profile Clinton presence but only dampen the party's prospects of retaking control of Washington from Republicans yeah and they're worried about her throughout the mid term elections Clinton is rarely rally together with other candidates appearing mostly at low key fundraisers and low key 'cause she can't get many people to show up\nShe's the kiss of death won a party official said yeah telling the Washington Examiner Democrats don't want her to campaign for them because everywhere she goes she carries the stench of death well it's worse than I thought\nAnd it's the only political figure in America that has less popular than Donald Trump stretches that that's a real testament to her\nDemocrats were relieved that the bill and Hillary Clinton announced that there international Thirteen city speaking tour wouldn't began until after November now that\nThat was clever move I think they're measuring how they can have the best person impact and have kind of decided to wait until after the election and that's what Dick Durbin of Illinois said\nA house Democrats segment of that saying when I think the people who have been part of our pushed to retake the house I just don't think of them at all I think it's a very good thing that they're not being visible it wouldn't help our cans age\nBoy one minute you're the nominee for the Democratic party and the next minute they don't want to see anymore maybe that's part of the problem these guys don't know when to get off the stage\nActually but I like the Hillary can in twenty twenty I liked the sound of it and I liked our possibility that she could run up you know like our stamps she could run forever right but don't we have forever Sam's forever bill and Hillary could run you never get rid of them actually\nI can take them a lot better than Brock Obama right most presidents when they leave office they they're quiet and give credit to George W. Bush\nBut not for Iraq Obama he's in there he can't sit still he can't keep quiet\nSo maybe he'll rebuild they do have some redeeming value for those of us on our side because if they run a game night she runs again\nI think she's kind of lose I think we got to get something going on our side Hillary for president in twenty twenty tell me what you think age six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine or ... the same number thirty three thirty nine march gosh they're filling in on right out of radio\nHow much do you know about synthetic oil heavy duty trucks have been running on traditional mineral oil for the last one hundred years but today's technology brings us other options to consider it a better quality\nUnlike mineral oils synthetic oils have consistent molecular restructure giving it the ability to support pressures from iron horse power engines especially at lower rpm it also allows oil to reduce friction in an engine controlling temperatures and improving fuel economy\nVery clean or synthetic pick up fewer contaminants as they do their job of lubrication they also have better oxidation stability\nResulting in an overall cleaner engine synthetic and somebody synthetic oil may be a bigger investment up front but the benefits of its high quality composition will pay off in the long run this report is the surface\nOf shell wrote ... books with what I told ... ...
