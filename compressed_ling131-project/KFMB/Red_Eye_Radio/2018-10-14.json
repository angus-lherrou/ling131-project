currently I'm Gary McNamara eight six six Ninety right on let's go to Roger in Texas Roger you're on running running a welcome to the show\nI guess the second time to time caller thanks\nA lot about the capital spectacle what I've been calling at ... at all costs relations spectacle\nRegarding the moderate Republicans the heads of the standard um go along to get along they have woken up and ah I'm Wondering if this is er an analogy I don't know how do they apply for it but uh in the same way that\nThe u._s. was not aware that they were under attack by a Islamic extremism terrorists until nine eleven you know they had the ... bombing they had the uh\nThe Trade Center in Ninety three they weren't really woke up in aware until nine eleven happened and the same way I don't like the the moderate Republicans were aware that there that that\nExtreme left wing extremism is at war with conservatives until last week\nOr not what I mean the sort of al ... not only conservatism just anybody who is opposite them even a of a pope politically it yeah not necessarily any logically but no it's I don't think it's inflammatory what you said because remember in the nine eleven commission\nWhich was put together a bipartisan they said the problem with the United states was they were at war with us and we weren't at war with them right uh and that was added like an ad like so that came from the nine eleven commission so there's nothing inflammatory about that\nAnd and I think we're your analogy I I think if you look at that I think also which I think it's correct that the Republicans many of them in the center now are clearly no\nI mean when you have to think about this when you have a Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins\nBeing the ones who were the the that really carried if it does not so much with columns but certainly Lindsey Graham during the conservative torch\nThat's when you see definitely\nThat awareness is is is in full play now and that's where you also see Lindsey Graham saying well I'm going to campaign anywhere and everywhere I can a purple states and and everywhere else\nI think you have to include Susan Collins in in that well I knew she wouldn't dare to that will be remembered though was gone for ... in terms of their mark\nOn this event no doubt her speech for the most part no doubt um she didn't carry she didn't carry the way I got Lindsey Graham riot but yeah I Would uh she would do that\nI wouldn't have seen coming I could've seen\nIf you were to ask me maybe weeks out and told me of the situation coming\nI could've still seen as a Collins going well no I'm going to vote no and then a a hike camp voting yes right mhm so I mean that that would have been or somebody if you would have told me that's what's going to happen I was like oh okay I see it\nWhile he can't do it all because you have I don't know\nI don't know what the even what the numbers in terms of overall numbers of sellers on Amazon\nThe point being is that there are things coming from all over the world that are sold on Amazon and so it would be impossible for although those has done other things [laughter] that people didn't see coming uh I don't think any time soon he will have he will control completely his own his own ...\nUh but he is doing that more and more and that was to shut out more and more the the the um FedEx and UPS\nDelivery that was costing him more and more the costing the consumer more and more and he said this is not about shutting out the little guy if in fact is about creating more opportunity for the little guy and now they they you can go out and get your own local delivery\nUh buy your own local delivery a set up for a for Amazon and by the vans and everything else\nAnd be a part of that and and there's opportunity there it was about creating a a ... basically the ... the ability or more and more to control pricing say keep prices low on Amazon according to\nThese ... he's the U. S. P. S. thing if prices get too expensive and it's costing you know the uh the company to raise prices on Amazon they do one or two things\nGet rid of that agreement and go and move away from it or\nThey pass it along to the consumer ... plain and simple\nOr this news item the co founder of the opposition research from behind the Steele dossier ... for those of you that her brand new listeners\nWill do it very quickly because we we can do it very quickly an update you so you understand completely what we're talking about\nUh the Democrats accused the Trump a campaign of colluding with the Russians to hack and or change the outcome of the election ... the evidence we have found out is it's just the opposite the DNC and the Hillary campaign\nPaid a law firm\n... who paid and opposition research from\nA ... a fusion GPS who paid the former British spy Christopher Steele who got a information he says from the Russians close to the Kremlin in order\nTo change the outcome of the election by getting on verified salacious allegations against Donald Trump\nThat they were going to use to\nKill his campaign and when they couldn't do that they wanted to use in order to destroy the legitimacy of the twenty sixteen election they also use that information\nAs a basis to get a secret warned against the Trump campaign while the campaign was actually going so you know you see fusion GPS was a part of it well\nThe co founder of the opposition research from Glen Simpson will invoke his first and Fifth Amendment privileges to avoid testifying before Congress next week his lawyer has told Congress\nAccording to the hill Simpsons attorney told house a judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte that Simpson will not appear for a deposition because the congressional investigation is not designed to discover the truth\nI don't really know the average Virginia\nRepublican subpoenaed Simpson on September twenty nine\nOr after the lawyer said his client would not appear voluntarily for an interview before members of the house judiciary and the house oversight and Government Reform committees\nSimpsons from a fusion GPS was hired during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign bottle law firm that represented the DNC and the Clinton campaign ... fusion GPS hired former British spy Christopher Steele\nTo conduct an investigation into Donald Trump's possible links to Russia the result of the probe was eight thirty five page report alleging collusion between the Trump campaign\nAnd the Kremlin Republican lawmakers are interested in the ...\nLargely because the FBI reportedly relied on the unverified documents to obtain surveillance warns against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page so of course a lawyer is going to say you're not trying to get to the truth\n\nWell then what does the lawyers say they're trying to find\nHere's I I think are they going to ask are they going to ask him about his personal taxes I don't think that's all right are are they going to ask him about a a who he believes is the best running back ever and the national football league if you're listening earlier to the show you understand why I brought that up\nOr I don't think so what are they going to ask him up on me I was I going to ask him about Kanye West [laughter] probably not they're probably going to ask him about fusion GPS and their role\nOr in the uh entire flow chart of the Democrats and the Hillary campaign colluding with the Russians to change the outcome of the election\nSo here's my question thinking a of a fusion GPS Bruce or his wife was employed at fusion GPS yes the\nInspector general's office of the department of justice where Bruce or was employed as the and an associate deputy attorney general\nUh\nThe inspector general would have then access to any communications that they're still there between Bruce or and his wife if there were any to begin with and if they're still they're inspector general gets them for the asking\nA does he oh he but he yes from the department of\nJustice yeah well yes because because they were done internally yesterday right on right on an official yes device from the department and I and then again if those are the ... that's a number of it right away from the point being is that\nYou look at all the in this case basically it's a it's a block because your GPS doesn't want to cough up the truth they have no interest in doing that\nBut\nAh so how how would you find it otherwise well part I Would think part of that would be looking into Bruce or his involvement with a you know a professionally\nPossibly with his wife and if there were any communications I think the number one thing you would do the first thing you you would do\nAs you would look to see if there were any communications during that time and if they were on a those devices if they're still presented\nAnyway we we know you have the you know you have the right to claim fifth mhm you have to incriminate yourself yes and\nWe understand ... what I Would wonder is a blend Simpsons lawyer mhm what is he worried about if they aren't let let's take him at his word mhm that the house Judiciary Committee\nAnd the house oversight committee aren't trying to get to the truth right that I Would ask his lawyer then\nWhat do you think they are going after right if they're not well look I ... ... is is part of what they hypothetically as part of what they are concerned with\nIs the same thing as a mall or investigation the Mueller investigation has had nothing to do with actual Russian collusion with the Trump campaign right so that would be the question are you worried because of where the Mueller investigation is going is at the same thing might happen to you\nThat there was nothing wrong that you did nothing wrong and I don't know I don't I don't know what I don't see any crime from what I Know\nOf of fusion GPS committing any crime\nI don't know what I don't know whether there's any evidence of that you would uh concerning you know get gathering the information and getting the money for ... they're an opposition research firm that just on the level is because that's what you do you get hurt on the other\nParty's candidate or whatever you you do opposite well the what they do opposition research is self explanatory so what does he worried about\nWhat would they be what possible crimes is Glenn Simpsons lawyer worried about\nWell and then finding the time it was interesting look I say this because Donald Trump junior I'll justify I'll go under I'll I'll do there are plenty of people that go under oh mhm so what is the crime that he is ... ... what is the charge\nThat Glenn Simpsons lawyer if you talk to him privately would be concerned about even if he believes his client did not commit a crime where does he think they're going to try to prove that Glenn Simpson committed a crime and why would they be going after Glenn Simpson\n\nOr is there someone else their fusion GPS he's worried about and by talking forget about incriminating himself he's been criminalizing\nIs from yes\nThose are the questions that they ... those are questions any investigator would have run into their ... yes that's all we're not indicting anybody yet [laughter]\nHey I'm just I was that out loud at the bottom [laughter] sorry [laughter] the microbes on six six Ninety read I\nIf you or someone

Senate race there and and writers on well some of the cold sudden that ... a good news is a Dow futures up ... of the president's state in yesterday that\nThat uh the plans are meeting with China again yeah and uh hopefully that's what this is helping the bounce back up because we looked at the bad news over the last couple of days with the fed dropping Thirteen hundred and you said there's nothing you can do that'd be the president\nPresident can do to stop what the Fed's going to do ... you're not going to stop at nothing he can do to stop the borrowing or the interest on the bonds ... there's a ... on the regulation of tack that's more of a Congress thing what\nCan the president do the president can give optimism that we're going to get a deal done with China and he said we're gonna you know meet a yesterday and hopefully that's one of the reasons that the stock market is tempered today is the hope that a a deal is going to be done yep yep\nYeah 'cause you see a sell off like you saw in the past couple of days and that's about people losing confidence in those companies that are issuing concerns over those raw materials especially but terrorists overall we'll see what happens with China for on the trucks here's your forecast\nThere's been a big drop to the south of where we've seen snow so far this year we're now talking about Colorado Nebraska portions of even western Oklahoma and north Texas where a snow rain line is set up for the early morning hours and we will see rain pushed to the east\nWe could describe the snow area as being between I Seventy to the north\nI forty to the south\nThirty five to the east and a twenty five in the west snow mixed precept and then all rain as you move closer to Texas a small band of snow will be moving out of North Dakota\n\nYou know in a time she focused in on the Republicans but at the time she did not when she ... short so assume she because she's probably\nGoing to say well Republicans are crazy but she from that\nThat might be how she defends himself which by the way well she does well that would hurt her because she is trying to position herself as somebody who was by ... so just assume that\nOkay because we can you can hear it already she was just talking about the crazy Republicans\nWell not for somebody who says they're going to be a moderate and work with both parties\nBecause keep in mind I mean this is a the Jeff Flake seat but it's also the state that was represented a by the late John McCain and the left hailed him after after he passed for being someone who essentially rose about politics and work with both sides actually that was\nNot the case in the end and they weren't describing it his behavior in the Senate correctly he moved to the left\nThey didn't move to the right to be clear but a bit on that on on that point\nShe is trying to position herself and appeal to the people that might have supported the John McCain right\nYeah I looked up Cuomo\nCan get away with saying conservatives are welcome in New York right yes even the ones that are there because we know that right and and just being on you get ...\nYou can get away with that New York yeah yeah you can get away with probably saying it in California right and you can be a Democrat say look I Know all of people are nuts\nEverybody here's crazy we're not right and still get elected as long as you promote democratic values might be a little bit different in Arizona\nThat's that's where the differences because you had essentially to a historically speaking and soft Republicans\nI remember he said he'd rather than an extreme conservatives in a who oppose abortion and support gun rights have no place in this state yeah that's a huge number of people in New York state\nDeath either by the way um you know this and this is that's that that terminology thing and I I Know I'm splitting hairs and preaching to the choir in terms of our audience ... gun rights it's my rights\nAh yeah the guy doesn't advertising doesn't that doesn't have any right by the gun has no right to gun doesn't have any rights\nI assume all of the the guns rights when I put it in my cold live fingers\nIt's the people's right yes a very interesting I just want to get to this topic because you happen to bring this up and I didn't know about ... employees on the Las Vegas strip fear being replaced by robots and you were telling me there is actually these and I'm looking at it right now that they've come up with these drink robots that will make bartenders obsolete\nYes and you can come as the big design I've seen I don't know if this is in place in Vegas just yet\nBut the design I've seen also includes you walk up to the kiosk or the kiosk is even embedded into the counter like they do the are they actually have like a a if you go up to a bar and a gambling city ah for those who don't gamble or never been\nWhen you sit at a bar you can get your drinks actually for free if you're gambling and they'll put the right there\nAt the seat there is a video poker thing\nYou can play mhm right by the way the drinks not free [laughter] it'll cost you whatever you lose and video [laughter] to be clear you mean they're not giving yeah anything free now\nThat are that are just that they don't deserve to buy a bunch of alcohol and lose money on it\nNo I'm the those are the [laughter] getting back to the robot thing I'm a\nI'm not sure what the strippers will look like\nI ... but but for the bar is they'll move away from ...\nOh man oh no no no no right now bartenders robot brothels yeah I I guess by the way we never really talked about yeah we didn't talk about Houston didn't we didn't talk about and we did\nLast week of well I mean you know if you think about remember the old and I guess they still have them the coffee vending machine where would make you cough yes yes I was go back to the Terminator two the security guard making or it\nWas a cop actually ... that went to make a a cup of coffee didn't work out too well no it didn't as\nTea to walk up behind them and then became him which was weird but\nYou think about robotics in serving food that's been around for a while but it will be different in a bar like this where you go up and you basically uh order it\nYou know and you know the type it in a you're going to insert your credit card and then all of a sudden the drink is going to be made and even delivered to you depending on the set up on the counter\nBy automation\nYou know I think John ... a guy who has a pretty good uh business uh or has over the years in Las Vegas and also from uh the the bar rescue\nYou're never going to see a well first of all there's no way to steal from the till I'm not blaming bartenders from for that I'm not condemning all bartenders but that does happen in the business and you know tappers\nCaught it where they were you know skimming or whatever from from the register but even to a greater extent pouring way too heavy right ... robots not going to do that well either one\nBut I here's the other point because I was thinking the same thing I'd ask John tap for how far can you go with the robot bartender ... kind of regular Barbie all robots right\nJust a person walking around or do you have there is is there a 'cause he talks about the science of a bar mhm and the science of the bar is about people and interaction\nAnd wrote a a a robot can't be pleasant trust me I Know a few of them\nWell a robot also can't be angry either right and be an angry bartender right\nOr can't can't be a drunk bartender [laughter] wow that's that but how how far do you do with the science of it you mean I I can see this working totally in a place like Vegas where the focus is gambling not not communicating with the bartender or not walking into your corner bar\nSo my wife and I uh recently went to a place that had\nA robot roulette wheel now we walked by it several times we didn't we didn't look at it\nBecause it was often like they have a a a a what would you say it it's there's there's there's poker and blackjack were you walk up and the screen has you know a dealer but it's it's animated right and so that you know the the whole tables animated the cards or animated\nWell on this roulette that's what I thought I was ... that I thought it was all animated it's actually it's it's an actual wheel in the center\nAnd you don't you're not close to every one it's not crowded like a real roulette table\nAnd so we thought okay let's see how this works and it was interesting we played it for a few minutes and it was interesting because I said you know that's that's not the animation thing is still gives you the view of a real roulette wheel right and that's important for a lot of people they don't trust right animation records that well\nIn in the case of a a a Vegas in in a in a bar setting there's a couple of settings you're going to be a nightclub kind of setting and nightclubs are huge in in Vegas um where they don't care they just want to drink\nIt's not your pub writing where is that where the bartender right things to be pleasant needs to be a companion for and carried maybe a little bit of a conversation on with you in Vegas that's not that\nIt's not that for the most part it's either the gamblers or uh like I said the nightclubs and no one cares anything except about the alcohol when it comes to the bar is all about the alcohol or it'd be interesting to see how far this goes\nI Want to be alive when they come out with the home version of the robot bartender\nAh yea going you walk into your house and they basically you've got bottles that you in search vodka whatever I mean right from ten different types of alcohol that you put in their right and the mixer and everything else and then you just walk into your house and\nYou say Alexa give me a screwdriver\nThere you go oh and then she hands you affiliates\n[laughter] no life so [laughter] I got out alive now God [laughter] and then its eyes I profile alcohol Alexa drinking alcohol [laughter] hey I Want to get drunk [laughter]\nHey six eggs I Do read I this engine report is brought to you by Detroit
