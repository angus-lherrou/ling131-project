I was going to measure we didn't get it yet you know Stormy Daniels a loss and he's he's a lawyer and he brought out though sweating ... if that's her name\nAnd she thought she accused him of a you know they were part of this gang rape or at least that they were there and it was soaked postures they actually hurt the case\nThen the other ... case for its case against a judge Kavanaugh because if you start getting ridiculous accusations so\nUh that's how it ended in ... for those who didn't hear it and the answer is you you can't in this country you're innocent until proven guilty and you there was no car operating evidence against the judge\nAnd that's that's the way it goes sometimes you you know you don't have a perfect society but it did start out with her say I can't understand how you guys like President Trump and they're trying to narrow down and find out what you didn't like about him and it looked like she did believe that there was Russian collusion but there's been no evidence of that\nAnd I'm going to predict now a mall is not going to come up with anything on inclusion the only thing left now is obstruction of justice and even that doesn't seem likely unless you you know she mentioned the thing I Wish I had her on to you know but I think I'm expressing it pretty well\nThat of all the people around him that we're a guilty and something to do with clues and but they weren't they had nothing to do with collusion\nOr whether it's Michael slam horror Manafort they lose all their stuff in this case isn't really agree just because\nOf the FBI interviews him he doesn't even have a lawyer with him and they get them on line to the FBI which is a great point I Would never\nGo through an interview with the FBI anymore ... yeah and you don't have to uh in in most
