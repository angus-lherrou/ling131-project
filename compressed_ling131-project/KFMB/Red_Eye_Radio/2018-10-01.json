upon the FBI investigation allegations against having a more than I mean here's just momentarily other stories out there must have got a slap on the hand\nYeah you know this was um interesting the way this thing went down because as a the developments on Thursday came out essentially the Iran must and his lawyers early in the day had reached an agreement\nWith the SEC saying and and and apparently that whatever the agreement was was going to happen and then by the end of the day there were pulling out of the agreement and he was willing to fight it\nOut of this all stems from him saying basically that he was going to take the company private\nAnd that he had access to fund a he had done that some time ago and as a publicly traded company the chairman of the board and CEO you can't say that because you're essentially by that statement especially if it's on true\nAnd that was the whole point is is that did he actually have the funding was it was a secured had it had been promised to him a any evidence that that he had access to funding to take a private\n[noise] that started this whole thing into okay and then of course the or some other things that he has done on social media that question his ability to run the company but this is special because you're manipulating the stock price or the cost\nThat question his ability to run the company but this is special because you're manipulating the stock price or the company uh it had a jump when he announced that stock price at a jump\nBecause it was you know people investors if it were true might have been able to make good on something like that ah and do well if they drop the stock up because he would have to buy out all of that existing stock\nThen it came out on friday which was interesting actually late ah Thursday and friday morning the investigation\nShowed that because he came up with this price of\nFour hundred and twenty dollars per share\nAnd according to investigators\nHe actually used for twenty

to learn it because they can Google it if they need it well they're not even willing to do that but when you know the basics of how government works or how ... works then you could have the debate on the ideas regardless of who's reporting what regardless of who takes what position\nYou can have the debate on the ideas because it's not about the people it's always been about the ideas and the one

Florida Mario welcome you're on the Radio Welcome to the show\nWell thank you yeah my my uh my thoughts on that or a judge Kavanaugh or that they all bullshit like Dianne Feinstein Chuck Schumer even at ...\nOr they're going to continue to attack him a even after he's confirmed as as a Supreme Court\nJustice I'm sure the ... and I have another question\nOr they they they made but it's not going to go anywhere and no one no one just once it's done I mean I I think the focus elsewhere because once you get on the Supreme Court this whole thing about threatening to impeach him I've stopped going to happen\nNo no that's not as effective as early there's nothing that's going to happen ... the the the uh the lip service will continue Mario no doubt\nRight but I but I think a move I I I think they'll move on to other things where they can have more control\nI I say what you mean yeah the the lip service at the at the time is it the lip service and I think that they'll continue to attack and that\nThat but that that's the norm they call that Tuesday right [laughter] right they'll they'll attack him when they were to say Supreme Court decision that I don't like that where you live on their door to get in on something right on funny because Mario or a Gary and I were talking during the break\nAbout the the question by George Stephanopoulos asking one democratic lawmaker over the weekend or do you think judge Kavanaugh should recused himself\nFrom any case involving if he ceded any case involving\nA democratic lawmakers and the lawmaker comes back and says well yes I think that would be the\nWell isn't that thing I can I can make the case that\nIf you're a male you should not be you should recuse yourself from any case involving a female and if you're a female the same the same place and then beyond that\nIf you are a in a ... a heterosexual marriage you should recuse yourself from any decision involving gay marriage or a or vice versa or I'll take it to the most extreme level if you are not the person in the\nCase [laughter]\nYou should ... lives yourself because you couldn't possibly understand if you're not the defender's edge of your game you're not a person to make you complain you have no standing or one of the interest in Congress ... place one of the interesting conversations that got\nI got an over the weekend with a with a few other people which was\nWell how come it's only only one of the fifty three genders ... have to be believed right only the allegation from one gender what about the other fifty whether it's at fifty three fifty four Mm genders uh the the that are out there\nAnd then we just got into the bizarre conversations of of why don't you believe the other genders and going through the specific other genders and why they should or shouldn't be believed it was an interesting conversation about\nFor video robot here's your forecast\nWe're gonna pick up a lot of moisture for Southern California and western Arizona as the remnants of hurricane Rosa come ashore through the early part of the week there's a low in the Pacific that's combining with the system that will create some unsettled weather\nMost likely as far as Los Angeles where the chance of showers today we'll continue to see the chance of rain along the Gulf Coast from South Texas over to Florida you'll note we've already seen some snow and the higher elevations or the mountain regions of some of the northern tier states Idaho Montana and north and South Dakota\n\nAnd so everything along the line of [laughter] who paid for the the ... you know a ... lie detector or the the suggestion of a law firm and everything that has gone and then you get to the point\nWhere they leak or name and you know they they they link her name the people that were supposed to protect her\nAnd that has to drive somebody like Lindsey Graham just out of his mind as it as it did he feels he has been completely betrayed our point is you're just learning that now\nWell it's like Jeff Flake you know I I'm I'm guessing he thought at some point he was going to make friends with a lot of people on the left remember he was doing the whole to buy a thing when he announced he wasn't going to run\nYou know this isn't this isn't a the way it should be uh the politics has gotten so ugly but on friday she was being cold out\nAnd even after he decided to go to the White House basically and asked the administration request demand really but he was not going to vote on the floor\nHe would in committee but not on the floor for the confirmation\nThen as soon as that came out there were others basically on the left coming out and calling them out still because they if they believe in this to my approach\nIs never about working with the other side or coming together the two sides coming together it's Republicans coming over to the left\nThey don't hail Joe Manchin is somebody who is bipartisan while technically he is but he's not getting them he's not\nGetting any points with his own party no he doesn't get any praised for no no McCain did all the media doesn't praise them no McCain did I mean after McCain was Hitler after he ran for president right and then went away and was no longer a threat\nYou know and then and then after his passing he was praised by the left but it's always someone on the right who goes left it's not the other way around let's go to Peter in New York City Peter you're on right on Radio Welcome to the show\nBut I Do very good with say for the flower bloody and brought in ... I certainly have to find out a little more about this stock that high school college so\nHeard have oh you mean expand the investigation on her shawl to okay upset about earth\nFishes so hey this is this better just as bad as just shoot it Vegas they didn't know about it it's not you know nothing about her\nWell you know here's I guess this'll be my my point on on Ford we just found out who she was of course you're going to know more about cabinet and you're going to know about Ford but it's a it's it's coming out\nMhm\n[laughter] well if there's a number of things that that I think as a as a part of the investigation if they're doing it the way that I Believe they would be doing it I remember if a background check so the I guess the the the players that have been named in this so far [noise]\nMight not be what the FBI limits themselves too and and discussing it with foreigners according to her attorneys as of late Sunday she it's still not yet been interview\nWell my question is you're going to start with Kavanaugh likely because it's a background check on him you start with Kavanaugh but then you're going to go into all these\nClaims you're going to try and find separately separate from the testimony you're likely going to go and and interview maybe even\nFamily members somebody who could\nBack it up because what you're trying to do the idea\nIs to see if there's anything at all at the White House or the Senate committee should question in his background and you have to substantiate those claims\nSo there could be a number of people here that we're not even thinking of that can be interviewed during this process and that might not be good news for Dr Ford or her attorneys\nOr the guy I mean apparently are going to interview the guy from Gail who said no he he drank\nMore ... right it's like I don't know where that goes well how can you quantify it and how can you prove no and that's that's the ... and plus it has nothing to do with this it's got nothing to do with the original case so it's it's it's a basically there's this old classmate from Yale claiming that he perjured himself right\nSo we'll see where that goes how do you perjure yourself on the amount that you drank did you see 'cause I didn't want to buy it right now there was there was no ... and there's no proof\nRight\nHasn't been asked about that specific incident right so it's there it's it's not perjury\nUnless you get to that point to ask him about a specific\nHas it been asked about that specific incident right\nSo it's there it's it's not perjury unless you get to that point asked him about a specific incident and you of evidence that he lied but the the consumption of alcohol and what's amount you talk and your judgment of it compared to somebody else's judgment\nThirty five years ago that would be an interesting perjury case\nRight [laughter] so I don't\nWell because then you would need a somebody in the house to start that that case against him and that that's not going to happen now and they'll they'll see they'll they will interview this person like they'll interview everyone\nAnd they'll determine whether or not anything was by that person's claim can be corroborated not just what Dr Ford claims\nBut what any other person related to the situation claims they're going to look to have those claims backed up by somebody else\nMarty in Saint Augustine Florida Marty welcome you're on the radio I'm already\nYes I'm a first time caller here and I think personally from Daytona Beach but uh\nI ...

it ... the Democrats as as well as the Republicans was giving the doctor so much for age and\nTo me it was\nIt was there was no competition to me she said she was just totally full orbit or education [noise]\nUm she didn't come off his ... to ... uh for one thing [noise]\nI myself and this was the theory that I'll be ... ... talk or you talk about it but I'm sick and she was a lot from the get go I mean even I think cabinet all was just happened to be the one\nI said she was on the on the road getting ready to run with federal ... what's that which would you nominate\nA guy [noise] um [noise] it's just that she goes to march ... when she used to shoot believe a hundred per se but it was traveling All right then and there I mean\nWell I well I I I Will tell you this I mean when when they say that she's credible as I said the reason she isn't credible is because you only remembers one thing\nYou're credible because there's a consistency to your testimony that's why when anybody and I would love to have never happened but I Would love to interview one of these Democrats who say she was credible oh forget about the fact that her own witnesses use ... there is no forensic evidence and no witnesses even the ones that she names that\nHer story but the fact is what she says herself if you just came and you'd say well look how couldn't remember this is so close\nLook how couldn't remember this so clearly but you don't remember this you don't remember this you don't remember this you don't remember this her\nTestimony alone irrespective of the other ... evidence or lack of evidence her testimony itself\nWas not credible mhm yeah I mean that's the that's what essentially was at play here whether or not she was to be believed because remember what they were calling for first\nShe needs to be heard she needs to be heard she needs to be hurt well then she was heard well that's not enough wait a minute what if you believe her testimony to be credible then that is enough her speaking in front of the American people we don't get the the FBI questioning her on TV\n\nBut I don't even try handed a ... point and there there have with it yeah it's a great point they're just like during the question or are we now a ... he did say Lindsey Graham did say they're going to do an investigation on a big us well getting he called for an investigation of we call them or one yes yep let us\nGo to Lee in Chapel Hill North Carolina Lee welcome you're on Radio Welcome highly\nCare which you and you're listening to thanks I or so left in the stroller they call a Ford last week says she could member where all happened what he or she said she couldn't remember what year it off or if I stay cold right\nNow she got there actually I don't get that cold or\nI Need to take a little ... a ... kilowatt she had all of that the way\nOf honor for e yeah ... you have that you and we'll have to wait located lawyer would act like you would have\nTo ask the Democrats that question I Can't answer for the Democrats are as I as I said very easily\nThat's why she's not ... that that's why that alone she's not a credible witness unless there were people to bakar up when they say she's credible on like based on what and this is a legal safe and this is a personal statement against her right I don't know what she went through\nBut when you say I'm a hundred percent somebody did it\nWhere I don't know when I don't know how did you get there I don't know how did you get home I don't know\nAll you know as he did it but any information surrounding it and then the witnesses that you give give contradicting testimony that you gave its not credible right\nThe ... and that's why I said I don't know if somebody is asked the Democrats that specific question but again as you see for example George Stephanopoulos less a question when they don't answer it just moves on it's like okay give me an answer\nYou want to look something that bothers me more than even even the the the ... which we call the fake news ... is the lack of guts of journalists to say I'm not leaving this question until you answer it\nRight because of the important that there's an expectation\nYep [laughter] remember\nWho ... who who was it who has to Obama the follow up question where was that was that ... that was here in uh in the course that wasn't oh no yeah yeah well there's a problem separatists okay\nOr one where you have a local reporter here\nAh from W F a a TV in Dallas but no the one you're referring to was Chris Wallace and then they came back and said well we weren't told there would be fall of\n... that is that if you asked a question didn't make sense to be a follow up question right that that there's actually an and this is something that has to stop this ... this kind of buzz sorrow world respect\nThat we have for politicians when I'm a journalist and I ask you a question if you don't answer it I'm going to ask the question again and then I'm going to come down right to it and say you're not answering my question\nWell I don't feel it's important oh so you won't answer my question I Want you on record that you don't have the guts to answer my question I phrased it that way which of course is not permitted because there was some kind of bizarre real world respect\nBut a journalist is supposed to give\nA a politician who won't answer a question on an issue that is the reason that you brought them on the air with you ... don't waste my time if you're going to be come on the show had the guts to answer my question but if you're going to be gutless go away\nI feel like I'm Talking to somebody right now and yelling at them but if you're yelling at all of them in any you know that's\nBut that's that they get away with it drives me up for you know because people like well\nStephanopoulos when everybody else allows them to get away with it [noise]\nThe the person especially a public servant who's being interviewed does not dictate the question I\nKnow I Know what would they do when they don't ask the question\nThey do when they don't ask the question they do when when when they don't answer the question they are dictating the question\nSome well and that's just they need to it it's very clear to us but it's just said we're going to help this person to build a narrative here so let's talk to them\nLet's help them build their own narrative\nYeah we'll forget journalism right\nOh I'm Sorry then my question isn't the one I should be asking oh my focus should be elsewhere you're saying well okay\nAnd and the easy thing to do is the challenge her own owes answer\nAs soon as she gave that non answer I Would have said okay so you're saying the Democrats did\nYou get\nYour your your or\nNon answer their tells me that you're basically admitting the Democrats did\nLike this\nYou can respond to that statement if you'd like to yes or no true or false\n[laughter] [noise]\nBut this is why people read it at least frustrate the daylights out of ... this is why people hate it nobody's going on with Tim Russert because they knew it didn't matter which side they run they knew they were going to face tough questions\nOr remember for two weeks on the road and none of the Democrats from the Senate Judiciary committee would come out with Chris Wallace for what they do is is if you do that you become black balled yeah they won't come on your show any more because you demand that they\nThat they answer the question everybody knows what the questions are going to be [noise] yeah when you come in with look when you're at a senator and you come in to talk or you're the president or whatever you're somebody the White House when\nYou go on a show you know why you're going on the show ... they'll tell you we want to talk about this\nAnd so you know what the general questions are going to be and your goal is okay oh look I Need to get my step around here we need to figure out how to way not to answer any of the questions out of white filibuster we the every journalist knows everybody on ABC CBS NBC\nAnd Fox knows that which is CNN they all know what's gonna happen mhm they all know they're going to do that one is somebody gonna finally say a you're not answering my question would you answer the question\nAnd at that point what happens is you're not going to get the major you're not going to get the major personalities anymore think about this we live in a society\nWhere the media believes we need to get the major personalities on the major political personalities who run and dry this country it's important that we get them on the air so they won't answer the questions that we asked them\nYeah that's it\nFace the nation no as face the other way [laughter] meet the press I felt was pressed the meat we're going to do a handshake\nThat's the way it's going to we were just going to go out there and pat each other on the back unless you're a Republican and this week is weak this mhm where there [laughter]\n[laughter] your mom [laughter]\nI might as well be giving that answer to every question here mom [laughter] what do you think that you're a mom [laughter]\n\n[laughter] yeah [laughter] ... because that's the ridiculous nature of this why not just make it why not just make it I I Would have a group of buddies I went to grade school with and we play this game of\nGrade school Scrabble ridiculous Scrabble the words ... you got to make up a word nothing can be a real war word\nAnd you've got to use it in a sentence when you put it on the board\nAnd as long as you use it [laughter] okay so that's what I Would just make it a game [laughter] because that's all it is exactly nobody's taking a the their constituents are seriously in the case of a Jeff Flake he didn't care\n... ... you know how she could answer it I don't know I don't know who leaked it yeah I don't know like\nYou're asking me a question I Can't answer right why didn't we but why didn't we get the I don't know that's a great ...\n[laughter] this is an old man [laughter] ah\nBecause very as they're not or a very observant yeah yes and it's not Democrats you might think Mr Coons and all of you may think that Jeff Flake is a hero I'll say what I said earlier\nFriday is a long ways away Trump\nJust got back into the game that can often be very dangerous for Democrats eight six six Ninety

now\nDue to sell honestly the song do students they\nFive for water it's on sale now at seven fifty dot com [noise]\nHe's running radio he's our country and I'm Gary McNamara the FBI background check the supplemental background check on a justice Kavanaugh will talk about that coming up on the bottom of the hour you and I just looking at some of the video from uh Indonesia absolutely horrified from their own building where you can see I mean there's a wrote in front of them near the beach and\nCars are going up and down and you can see in the distance you can see the soon army yeah wave coming at them yeah the video being taken by a man who was\nPeople on the grounds you get up there they're on top of a building a looks to be like a rooftop parking lot\nOr is there some vehicles are surrounding these people that are that are up there and this Saddam it comes and it was roughly ten feet a ten foot wave that comes through and whites these houses moves them like they're nothing uh so far the update this morning eight hundred and forty four dead\nSome of those dead many of those dead being buried in mass graves there uh in Indonesia after this earthquake happened on friday and then the and then of course after the earthquake\nAnd then of course after the earthquake the Saddam me hit and a part of the city is a really kind of the center point uh for for much of this activity and you're seeing a ton of this\nAgain these ... this footage that's coming out and most of it from citizens there and people that that were there on the ground but a while and then you look at the pictures\nCame out on Saturday and Sunday uh the aftermath and it it it\nIt just looks horrific yeah just horrifying watch that video because the guy screaming for the kids that are running up and that got off the road and got up there but it was just at the rose you people going down the road back you know just driving down and you just knowing about ten seconds is going to be wiped out and it was yeah as terrifying just to see for on the tracks here's your forecast\nWe're going to pick up a lot of moisture for Southern California and western Arizona as the remnants of hurricane Rosa come ashore through the early part of the week there's a low in the Pacific that's combining with the system that will create some unsettled weather\nMost likely as far as Los Angeles where the chance of showers today will continue to see the chance of right along the Gulf Coast from South Texas over to Florida you'll note we've already seen some snow and the higher elevations the mountain regions of some of the northern tier states Idaho Montana and north and South Dakota\nNo no John let me talk to you about that when I talk to your listeners about your views about that\nThere is a well established process of confidentiality on the committee\nDianne Feinstein could've showed that letter to Chuck Grassley and the two of them as the leaders of that committee could have shared it with the FBI who could have discreetly conducted\nThis great in July and August without betraying misfortune confidence it and they have betrayed her they pointed her to lawyers Who Lied to her and did not tell her that the committee staff was willing to go to California to interview her all that now all that water under the bridge\nThose lawyers gonna have to face a D.C bar investigation and miss their misconduct time Feinstein and her staff is going to face an investigation for why they leak that all this could have been done discreetly happens hundreds of taught hundreds of times every year\nAnd there's this year it's made it doesn't have a rather than having hundreds of times with the with the issues that are the sensitive issues that are ... you're not going to get a chance to talk about\nYeah so there you go ...\nI Want to move away from that because that doesn't look good for the narrative are yeah\nWell no because those those are huge points that he may yeah I mean those are those are huge\nPoints first about the lawyers we asked that question\nWe'd have that we'd ask that question early on was she made it seem like Ford made it seemed like I never knew that the committee wish to talk to me will the committee talked to the lawyers and that's what we had asked that question we said that hasn't been that hasn't been resolved and Tom Cotton coming out over the weekend insane her lawyers didn't tell her\n\nAnd they need to visit and and as you said for lawyers will face a Washington DC bar investigation for allegedly not informing heard that the Senate Judiciary committee staffers were willing to travel to California to interviewer well why wouldn't say\nAll right\nI mean who's working for your pro bono are you\nYou're not working in the best interest of your client if you're not giving them the option that is the charge have caught and is making there which is huge because that shows why\nThat's why wouldn't you were lawyers be working for the best interest of you because they're working for the best interest of someone else yeah well how much you're paying them as a client I'm not paying them\nOh\nSo are they actually working for you and that's where you and I talked about this Friday and cotton is making the allegation\nThat you know they'll be facing the Washington DC bar investigation for not informing her when you asked a question why didn't they inform her if she didn't know why did it and will those questions be asked by the F ... uh\nWell I mean you would you you're looking to through the FBI looking to vet the process all over again right\nBecause it is a serious allegation it's just\nAs much to prove her wrong as it is to prove him wrong or liar\nIt is just as much about finding out well in fact the entire purpose is finding out the true\nIt is not necessarily to find out which one is lying because one of them as lying it's about finding out the truth which means it's equally as much about the person making the allegation as it is the accused\nIt ... and the other point is we're Feinstein and the Democrats and the media we're always trying to make the point will Feinstein did her best each one won't know she didn't\nAnd as we subtle along if you listen to the show we said look there\nIs a process and I'm Glad that Tom Cotton pointed out the process and and he and he said they do this hundreds of times you an and decker ... he doesn't know it's not as sensitive because no justice sensitive on other issues but things that are highly\nSecretive that we don't want people to know about\nBecause we're doing you know in in different investigations and so this has actually done where\nShe should have when she got the letter\nShe ... the protocol is your daughter Grassley you're the ranking minority member you go to Grassley you've talked about it and you say okay what group well probably what we used to uh you you would have said was look we can lead to contact her back\nAnd tell her we can do an FBI investigation if he wishes to this to go forward we can do an FBI investigation\nAnd we can keep her name out of it for a certain period of time but we can definitely do the FBI investigation we can actually interview people on this and keep your name out of it and then we get to a certain point\nWe might not be able to but as to the point of the investigation absolutely we can then find signed tell her that\n\nHer Feinstein's goal was to hold this as long as possible to spring it at the last possible second yup\nKnowing that they're only play here was political in nature not actual procedural other than delaying the process itself they were calling for the FBI investigation but the Democrats didn't really want an FBI investigation\nHad they wanted the investigation Feinstein would have made that happen right away\nWhich tells me one thing a couple of things they didn't buy into her story number one because if they if they felt it was fully credible and could be proven and backed up by an FBI investigation and Feinstein would have acted July thirtieth\nAnd you know something I I I agree with the Democrats they they did shouldn't do an expanded they should do and expanded a you know a background check and they should uh talked to forward and say oh your lawyers are with you by the way why didn't you tell her that they were willing to come and see her yeah\nSo is anybody paying you besides her let's let's let's expand this I Wonder if the Democrats really wish to be expanded huh\nI'm doubting it\nOkay we're done this week I read about no anyway so it was [laughter]\nWell because what they need is a new unobtainable\nGoal\nSo in this case uh like you said Ramirez she needs to be her she needs to\nTest I I Believe that will be the next day she needs to tell her story they're gonna realize this one's going nowhere so you need to go to the next allegation that's not cooperated and hear from her and you just go down the line and you see how far you can extend this now the balls and procedurally the balls and McConnell's court yes\nBut the vote is not the\nWhere the votes fall is not can you stand to lose a Jeff Flake yes if you have man I Can't\nWho's still on the fence Donnelly is a known now if you had mentioned you can lose if you've got mansion you can lose if you've got Heitkamp and if you've got Collins and if\nYou've got a tester do you do you want to fester he said no so if if that goes forward how many I guess the question is how many can you afford\nSo you can you can lose if you've got if mansions on you can lose like in one more\n\nBecause you've got fifty one mhm and so imagine would make fifty two you could lose than to still have fifty and have the vice president break develop right\nThat if they think they've got that then McConnell's not going to hold it up at all if they've got a lot they ... they would have done this over the weekend I I have the feeling that they will I have a feeling that if the FBI investigation comes in and you know even if it talks were nearest and said look nobody can cooperate her story either\nA ... on this in fact we sort of get the same thing with the the witness was there a I think at that point they will have the vote and then what do you ever hear about this to get her doesn't die forever it probably dies forever\nSomebody said they'll keep bringing it up no they won't they [noise]\nWell now you're getting nowhere right produce anything for it yet it is it won't affect his decisions they can't write so they you know if if once you see it on the Supreme Court well though impeach well they could impeach but you'd still need\nTwo thirds of the Senate mhm you're never going to get two thirds of the Senate to peace peach a Supreme Court judge on this all you would need you know and and so you could impeach not removed from the Supreme Court but that's wasting time and energy for the Democrats no they're never going to get\nA you know to the the the sixty two on the on the lack of evidence that you have an any of these cases right now right because you're not going to learn anything new about this about the alleged events and we're likely to learn nothing new about the alleged events from the FBI background check [noise] eight six six Ninety ...\nHow much do you know about synthetic oil heavy duty trucks have been running on traditional
