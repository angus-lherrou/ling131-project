Sunday Morning uh shows yesterday some we'll hear\nFrom him on a on that the interesting thing is you heard of a representative Jerrold Nadler say that if\nUh the Democrats took the house in November that they would start impeachment proceedings right a on a Brett Kavanaugh that would mean you'd have to bring all the witness was back again and everything else that would be interesting from what does this especially Dr Ford who said she doesn't want to continue this any longer\nAh and ah you know it does ah I really wonder whether that's just an idle threat or what the Democrats really want much more transparency on the stories of these uh\nA result of these different of women who made allegations are against\nA a Brett Brett Kavanaugh but as we know the process or even if you did get the impeachment which would be getting a the majority of of Congress you would still in order to remove him have to go to the Senate and there's no way you're going to get sixty six votes\nThe Senate to get rid of him so he's on the Supreme Court\nYeah and he's on the Supreme Court to say yes and there's nothing the Democrats can do to do it there's nothing the Democrats can do to stop it\nAnd if they try to do what they do it at their own peril if they end up taking the or the house yeah it's only really uh they're they're going to use it as a motivator to get people out to try and give people a motivated to get to\nThe polls in November beyond November it's not going anywhere whether they win the house or not ah my I guess my question would be is it a motivator to get Republicans out\nOr is this a because we can we we've seen it I've probably in the past I Can't think offhand up\nOf of an instance but you know where it was something will come along and once that happens it's like okay we got this and then it seems as if the excitement level to go out and vote is dead I don't sense it here at all I sense there is a a anger here and a unity\nRemember you had a significant portion of the Republican Party that was split\nAnd and I don't believe\nThis is just about capital I think it is about the fact that you have\nThe as I've said why'd I think we're Washington Examiner said a a quarter of Republicans or identify themselves as socialist a quarter and a half a Democrat but a quarter of Republicans and I thought to myself you know that shows you how wide the Republican Party is\nUh right now and this and the anger in the unity comes from the fact that\nThey've listened to a Democratic Party and the mainstream of the Democratic party who when you listen to a you're not talking about the fringe anymore you're talking about the mainstream leadership those in the Senate Judiciary committee\nThat are talking insane mhm they're talking about things that are\nCompletely against fairness and constitutional issues that are just so important to so many of us a presumption of ... of of of innocence yeah and it's just driving the Republicans crazy for video world logs here's your forecast\nWe begin a week with a very active weather map there are at least three other systems in the north Atlantic that are being monitored by the national Hurricane Center but we're focus now on tropical storm Michael expected to bring to the north eastern Gulf Coast by mid week the risk of dangerous storm surge\nRainfall wind impacts continue to increase will see at least tropical storm force winds arrive by tomorrow night\nFrom an area basically from west of Tallahassee into the New Orleans area but most of South Florida can expect some\nCall on in the New York times today that the\nYou I Want to put some about Frank Bruni writes I Can't think of another Republican who is a journey from an anti Trump outraged approach from above ... was quite so illogical or half a sad end he suggests that you are auditioning\nFor a place Jeff Sessions as attorney general you're a sponsor\nA Frank you don't know what you're talking about in your world Frank is a noble cause to destroy judicial candidates whose conservative or the day Thomas lido Mork now Kevin I'm bipartisan point it makes sense\n[noise] uh I Try to have a good disposition costs are like my job but don't mistake that I don't care\nAbout the conservative cause so if I made you upset because how would not legitimize McCarthyism dang good and I think I can survive in South Carolina\nWell you know the thing is is that uh I think Lindsey Graham needs to get off the [laughter] that was what he really thinks first of all I think it is going to be a positive if he's campaigning\nI'm a second of all I think the momentum from the from the uh the outrage\nThat he delivered\nA there on Capitol Hill that day I think will I I think that is that needs to be carried through but not just through the election not just through the mid term election\nIt needs to be carried through in that attitude needs to be carried through a on important things that that ah the matter beyond that including a legislative items and other and and who knows what kind of other nomination process we may go through a ... a truck\nSo through a while a Trump still president but uh you know making some very solid point\nOr the left was going to you know they used to it when it's convenient that's what they do they point to the right ah Lindsey Graham and the you know since Trump has been president anything that doesn't go along with you know any comments are that that counters the president the left one do you use that\nAnd and and and really kind of a position Lindsey Graham to be the by porters and willing to cross the aisle Republican that John McCain was and in some ways he was\nBut of course you're demonized now you're Hitler\nBecause you stand for something on its merits you stand for something based on the behavior of the left and your outraged and rightly\nSo well you know the thing is and reading Frank Bruni is come the New York times that none of it relates to the actual\nCase and he was talking about there is it's it's about the fact that Lindsey Graham has had differences with Donald Trump right and you know in Trump is you know been in a Trump has been meaning to him and called them names and things like that and there's been an animosity between the two and therefore\n[laughter] somehow Lindsey Graham shouldn't be taking Trump side with Trump's candidate I mean it\nReally doesn't get what we said earlier this whole cabinet thing wasn't about Trump\n\nIt really wasn't a a burning doesn't get that and I don't know I I have to go back on and and count the number of comments made for or against Trump\nOr from Lindsey Graham\nBut Lindsey Graham's a when he issued this concern that day or a week ago last Thursday\nIt was based on the lack of merits of the case and the ... and on the larger are much to a larger extent are pretty much the treatment\nOf Kavanaugh by the Democrats and and not the not the liberals with the\nSigns outside look right the Democrats on the committee Frank Bruni has nothing to the article he's got nothing well he's angry he's yeah they're they're they're wrong as I've said we discuss this for the last two and a half weeks\nWe didn't have anyone I Am not seen any rational thought were critical thinking statement come from the mainstream media or the Democrats\nTo say that the position that I hold and you hold which would be similar in this particular case to Lindsey Graham yeah where is flawed at all\nExcept for rhetoric and bringing up other things that have nothing to\nDo with this case with this nomination process with the witnesses and the allegations that came forward every single point that we have made\nWhich are the same what I can see as Lindsey Graham are all legit and the oldest is going to drag them nuts and moral and correct and right and you're wrong and reading Frank Bernie's column in the New York times you're a simple ten Mr Bruni\nTalked about the actual things that Lindsey Graham brought up gold point by point and say any of the things that he said\nWe're wrong you can't do that because then you'd be lying\nIf\nYeah I mean it is again a they they just lack the will to have the debate they don't have that debate Canada debate so they had stepfather and ... what Lindsey Graham said on that day so they do what\nWell they used to be for Trump now he's against Trump that's basically the gist of it right\n\nWell from their world absolute loyalty is expecting as we've said on the real world it's I like this candidate for this don't like him for this all the right over there that's a good nominate that's a that's a good nomination pick over there I like that I don't like this\nReal people and critical thinking people and people with rational thought Mr Bernie can do that\nBut I can say that there are plenty of times I disagreed with Lindsey Graham and I might in the future you are you running for attorney general right [laughter] I might add value in general what are you trying to get out of ... exactly ... well that's it\nHe's only doing this well again that's because you can debate the points that he made the only point you have as he was against Trump and now he's four trough\nWe've we've said with the simple ten you know a a arguments that will never and I called them simple to arguments because they never directly go after the the particulars of an issue that we are discussing they always try to bring up side issues that aren't\nAren't even a pertinent to what you're discussing right\n... and you read British telling me like what about the allegations made that they're not wrong you're just saying he's kissing Trump spot to become attorney general yeah\nYou know evidence of that you're not time predicting the points that he made your simply saying he's making it and he shouldn't be making it because he was one of the most fierce anti Trump hers and now he's agreeing with him and if you disagree with Trump you must always disagree with Trump which of course is hogwash yes\n\nYeah it it it is the insanity of the left and and again uh they ... well ... it's funny because they used to uh pretend to be the side that had the greater intellect [laughter] still trying to tell you that they are no they don't but it is the ... the they keep going for the low hanging fruit\nAnd and the and and really the brunt of the argument right now is well he's just trying to get something out of Trump or\nHe used to hate Trump but now he likes Trump debate him on the points made on that\nDay Mr Bruni can't can't do it eight

Ninety right eye let's go to Marty in ... California a mark Marty welcome how you're going to run your welcome to the show\nYou guys great show as usual thanks like I had a ... and I don't know if that's relevant but I think that if mark judge word to possibly a super slander a stock report or\nOther than I Do whatever his name is uh uh I think that maybe do some I think I think that may slow them down a little bit there are efforts because I agree with you guys are going to continue to describe it um but I think that if judge were super slander or level a\nHe's a private citizen yeah because he's not on the same rules of capping off now or anybody else in public office he's a private citizen who was brought in like that it would\nSlow them down I think that we give them food for food for thought\nYeah I I mean you look at it and it seems like a Dr ... her attorneys are are looking to basically not pursue this any further\nUm maybe there's something there and maybe there's the they've already heard from judge ... or ... or is lawyers but certainly at the very least we can say what we do know is fact is that he would\nHave a case or is he willing to pursue that or not is the question but um he would be looking to protect his name I mean it would be something that I Would pursue because my name was ... was made public\nA prove this with with the league and everything else ah that's and and who else would be responsible in that chain of events with the leaked to the media and all that I I think you could probably ... here's what's interesting you the names were brought out as a result\nOf the leak forward as far as we know she didn't leak it so if that\nIf that law or pursued we would likely find out who leaked it\nWhat responsibility do they have in a case or drag ...\nBy ... by mark judge and or his lawyers whoever leaked it to the media would also be partially responsible are forgetting his name out there\nAnd that you could see I think ... part of that and you have in any case that was that was him yes ... eliminate because they play the game because of the gang rape that yes you're right that is clear yes right\nRight right the only possibility of backlash when I'm ... you wouldn't want to put his good buddy or\nDo they already the wind is yeah yeah you got to her problems and I wouldn't want them to think that they're going to destroy desert in spite of used to do this for a spy and\n[noise] yeah well they you know it's it would be ... it it would definitely play out in terms of the spin on it it would play out uh in every ... up predictable and even some are unpredictable ways we can we can try and come to use our imagination to come up with things\nAnd and thank you I'm ready for the call we appreciate it and and I think a fair point or question\nUh he definitely would have standing as you point out Gary and pointed out during this process\nUh you know you're into the political arena when you accept the nomination a as the capital capital did\nAnd and so you would have to go out of your way to prove that malice uh but in this case of a mark judge a that wouldn't he wouldn't have that burden\nBut you you do wonder about you know I guess the future of claims of this these particular claims um and really the only one that is that survived at all was Dr forge claim\nAnd and it it appears they do not want to pursue that any further so that's\nI and and I think you make a case that that his name was released because of the leak and so he wasn't trying to link it to the ... a a media but in the ... case yeah\nTo me that would even be a ... and again I don't know who leaked it so I I don't know I'm just I'm On the doctor words right I'm just using\nRight that that as a possible exception here right uh but with the other case to me that's clear I mean going going after cab at all with an allegation like that that those things are made of politicians all the time and their public figures for the law used them differently yeah\nBut if you're a private citizen you're dragged into it\nAnd you're being accused of a gang rape mhm spiking drinks you know like things like that or you just you can't say you just can't go out and print that right eye and say that about people right especially private citizen\nThe citizens mhm matches then you've got to make your case and say where's the probable cause while I think it might have happened that's not good enough no no absolutely not so and they could just do ... personally\nWell I mean well because we're the chain the claims that were carried out and how he pursued this what role did he play in pursuing this in the media pursuing this and charging you a ... and and filing sue the New Yorker sworn statements the New Yorker\n[laughter] Hi how are you ... got his um\nThe Republicans they came for complaining about all the things that the Democrats do but they never a press charges against anybody is like for for perjury or Hillary Clinton or Dianne Feinstein and so on it's like telling a bank robber I'm complaining about it\nThough well I work I don't want to handle whoa whoa where's the perjury potty approved the perjury\nHow do you prove that perjury for I'm well you know ... if you don't want to take that one and how Dianne Feinstein\nWell okay well I Know how my ... well my point is we go point by point by\nWhat you alleged they should do so you're blowing out your first point you don't go after Ford so then who do you charge next than on if you're not going to charge for who's the next one\nOkay Dianne Feinstein with a ... she has a spy a at a chauffeur\nWell I Believe that there should be an investigation do I believe that yes of course\nRight I've I've I Believe there should be investigation they are not so I Would agree with you on that\nAnd I believe they have that in their promise I get their their ... I Believe they're promising that there will be an investigation they want to look into that\nBut they never make that charge of any kind of Hillary Clinton's emails there's\n... followed that wasn't Republicans fault no\nAnd I ... that was combing who clearly was politically driven\nAnd and that's something you couldn't control in that moment right\nWell do you expect they the Democrats just stop doing any of\nThese now with I don't know why it didn't get them but what does this behavior get them ultimately in twenty sixteen mass of loss it is but because of the reason Gary that they bring it up on Capitol Hill that somebody in elected office\nWould bring these up these items up on Capitol Hill because\nWe said about uh you know if you go back to uh the email thing with a with Hillary or even back to lying about been God's the which was an intern of itself a crime although it should be but it isn't a you look and see what exactly what we've said\nIs that on the email specifically on the email a investigation and the whole no reasonable prosecutor would would uh prosecuted we said well\nIt what matters here's the court of public opinion what you did and ultimately she lost in November or twenty sixteen and and thank you for the call\nIt is not always that that and not that she's above the law or we believe they should have pursued that but I if given a choice having her in jail or is not as great as not having her in the White House\nYou know here's here's the uh the the the point about four to ... maybe he was responding jury and sparks Nevada was responding to\nWhen we were talking to the last caller about a mark judge following a defamation of character lawsuit well when you when you go after a private citizen you have to at least have some type of evidence that this happened\nA he said she said all of a of a private citizen can get you into trouble but still might not go to the level of perjury perjury as you would have to prove you would have to have another witness stating she's lying about it right\nUh you know or it was you know about you know I I don't I'm\nI'm trying to think of wins you know somebody has been hit with defamation of character right when it's something that is just so obvious can't be true mhm uh and and so my point was I I don't know\nThe doctor Ford situation is there in the realm of possibility she's committing perjury absolutely sure yeah ah any things in the realm because we don't know we don't know anything about it because nobody can collaborate it so we don't know what she what she wants to it's proving it\nIs and and our point was is Eric just said that well there are costs to the Democrats lost twenty sixteen uh there there may be repercussions here in this upcoming election where they don't\nAh when the seats that they should be winning a in a first term of a president\nPresident in the first midterm afterwards but almost always the party in power loses seats ... that may not happen a Supreme Court justice was ah was confirmed mhm uh and United a pretty fractured Republican Party\nSo it isn't always that your punishment is criminal sometimes the punishment is criminal as for Dianne Feinstein though a and Clinton as we explain Clinton wasn't the Republicans ...\nKnow if you're angry that justice isn't always done\nAll I can say is this from our point of view the most important things to get the truth out there yes that's what I Want I Want transparency I Want the truth I Can't do anything if the majority as one of the reasons that Hillary Clinton\nWas never charged because there is a majority there's probably half of America even if they knew she was guilty would wander charged right sorry but that's just the way that it is part of the power comes from public opinion\nAnd it doesn't matter whether she committed a crime or not they don't want her prosecuted mhm and so the best we can do is get out the truth and we know the truth about Hillary\nA worry we know I'm\nA ... bumping gossipy for example Susan Rice sure I thought we laugh when you said she said you know the ... that she would like to ... she would consider running against colon seems like an excuse me you're on the ... and ... no it wasn't a criminal offense but it was still line\nAbout a terrorist attack that killed Americans and everyone in the United states knows its ally right\nEveryone in the United states you could take them and you can show them the law that Hillary Clinton broke right there you could read the law and and everybody wouldn't agreement that's what she did and it would still be half of America that said so what you should be able to get away with it and can't do anything about it the best that we can hope for\nIn any thing is that the truth is told and I don't know what's going to happen in the FBI investigation right\nI don't know if it's going to show corruption it's now in the inspector general hands Michael Horowitz you and I talked about this it's the one story that's been buried completely over the last two weeks ...\nIs that when Trump said okay we're you know we we we've got a couple of allies that don't want us to relieve some of this information and uh so we're going to give it to Michael I have an any we went that doesn't make ... Michael ... we're going to give it to Michael Horowitz when my\nDaughter went to my eyes [laughter] Minnesota and I don't have the [laughter]\nWhatever you do give it to Michael Horowitz the inspector general you and I said to each other this was on the air when we went dead ... doesn't make any sense why would they give it to the inspector general the department of justice if if they want to figure out how they can release it and and still you know keep some of it redacted they would go to\nOh wait a minute inspector general only deals with corruption more improprieties right oh\nYes and and that that story has been buried and analysis of that story's been buried by the mainstream media why would the president not release it immediately\nAnd give it to the inspector general of the department of justice because he deals with corruption\nAnd so we don't know what's gonna happen there but get is a true and if the American people if they get the truth and still decide to do the wrong thing that's on them yeah and that's\nThat that's really what it comes down to is that uh we've been calling for transparency\nOn on all of it the whole Russians scandal thing we've said multiple times ... regardless of where it falls politically as long as that is fully transparent and the process the American people can decide\nBecause we can't change what people do it in the past nobody can not even the people that did it\nAnd my question would be that if the Democrats took the house do they really really really want\nAn investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is that what they really really want from three witnesses with no cooperation at all who stories were slowly and sometimes rapidly falling apart because this is this would play out in the public\nOver and over and

Thursday night friday morning yeah that seems like it was a year ago\n[laughter] so much happening on Saturday alone well known\n... okay a friday seemed like three days and then Saturday thinking Steve Martin um\nBut if you if you look at the I I mean I'm thinking back even longer over the last couple of weeks right mhm seems like it's been a ... year because so much has happened in this process uh so the question is how much of this carries over\nA and is motivating on on either side uh it was somewhat Motor City motivating I'm likely on on each side but keep in mind that young\nPeople historically aren't motivated at all during midterms and so that's where the left or has a I think a problem um that could be different but I don't know that it will be\nAnd what comes out of the White House about separation of powers and what they believe you know that's not true but I think that what and I think you're right on here this wasn't just about the nomination it was the belief\nThat the Democrats truly are ... really hit when he realized it was the main stream\nIt was those in the Senate Judiciary committee it is what is viewed as the leadership of the Democratic party that the mindset of authoritarianism and fascism that mindset that they were throwing a Trump\nActually belongs to their party and they've had I don't think it's shredded officially here and I and I I think it is I think it has scared\nSome Republicans who didn't want to be a part of you know the ... of supporting the Republican Party I think it scared them strays right I really do I really I I usually when I went whoa wait well never thought they'd do this and\nAnd you know the last motivator that we could even come close to it I guess in ... during the the uh the Trump presidency ah should to pair allowing this was\nWhen Roy Moore last they realize they need to get tax has done yeah you know they ... they weren't getting it done they weren't getting it done and it was well known within the last one and then all of a sudden right after ...\nRight after Roy Moore's law they got it done what happened over the last couple of weeks or be a greater motivator on all legislative and procedural issues that and it should be for the foreseeable future\nBut that tax policy did not unite the actual party you know that their nose and it didn't it and I mean was it was the ...\nIt was the effect of the Roy Moore last right that got them motivated and that is miniscule compared to what you know the last\nTwo ... and not just United of the ... of the Republican Party I'm I'm Talking about the members of Congress so yeah and and the politicians I'm Talking about the rank and file no they haven't even the\n... where it comes from where the motivating comes from because if you if you look at what drives the legislative process well if we were all still shouting away with Obamacare it would've been gone\nThe first several months that Trump was in office right so no that's I I think you you point out the base of it but that's really where I was going with all of this is that the party itself which of course is driven by the rank and file\nSo the the things that are important to get done\nThere has to be greater pressure to keep all of those on Capitol Hill and the president motivated to get them done and maintain the process defend the process and the constitution\nLionel but if you'd like to get in eight six six Ninety run by\nA food product from from the sales of cattle is obese is it even meat is it safe what agency should decide those issues

a category too though but yeah it's a well inland that's it if if right now the the forecast of course as they always do kind of change going back and forth and\nSo we'll follow it as in fact the John Will uh in our forecast is for um attracts here's your national forecast\nWe begin a week with a very active weather map there are at least three other systems in the north Atlantic that are being monitored by the national Hurricane Center but we're focus now on tropical storm Michael expected to bring to the north eastern Gulf Coast by mid week the risk of dangerous storm surge\nRainfall wind impacts continue to increase will see at least tropical storm force winds arrive by tomorrow night\nFrom an area basically from west of Tallahassee into the New Orleans area but most of South Florida can expect some\nBeen completely bulldozed by the left and not the protesters knock the media but members of that committee the the leaders of the party\nAnd that should be motivating to every Republican I I I Believe it is\nBut I think uh in in hearing or the Lindsey Graham talk about the the campaigning you'll do and some of those purple states over the next few weeks to remind people\nThat kind of campaigning has to be done not just leading up to the mid term but after the midterm and beyond the Republicans as we've been calling them out for many years on this program did you do a better job of spelling out exactly what the left is doing and reminding the public what the left is doing a ...\nYou don't have to be there you don't have to use the hyperbole your show exactly what they were doing you demonstrated as one caller said just what just play some of you know their antics in their own words as we've been saying for years so that for a year yeah and and and and just demonstrate that\nOver and over and over again and how hurtful and destructive it is to this country uh for about the last ... I'm going to say six seven eight years you and I have been saying that it's never been easier to defend the\nConservative ideology in our in our lifetime because of where the left has gone I guess I can also say that it's never been it's never been easier to\nRun a negative ad campaign with\nHaving to be crude or rude yourself all you have to do is play the audio of your opposition and that accomplishes that in itself\nYou don't have to add on to anything from what we have seen the last\nTwo weeks you don't have to be as a Republican you don't have to be caught in any untrue right all you have to do is pointing out the truth of where now and this is very very important\nWhere the main stream of the Democratic party is now not the fringe\nBut the main stream and I think that one of the things that I have seen a and it's anecdotal evidence or to ... to to figure out what all the the the the polls mean and how it's going to apply in four weeks I don't know\nBut the one thing that I've gotten from independence\nIs they look at the Democratic party right now and they say oh my God what in the world are these people about\nThere is no sense of of fairness there is no sense of stability for they don't ... they don't care about it you know are taking ... taking some buddy and destroying their life\nAnd I mean I've heard this from from independence on both sides and that they destroyed forests life by not keeping it secret then it went on to try to do to destroy a cabinet all his life but on both sides you said it it seems like the only thing that matters we don't care who's lively destroy we don't care\nWe destroy we don't care what promises we break we don't care what we do we don't care whether we don't care about a presumption of innocence we don't care about giving you anonymity we just want to win and we will do anything to when we will demean we won't play fair and I do think\nThat there is something here that is even outside of the normal politics that we go through every day that this isn't going to be a discussion if this goes in favor of Republicans\nThat which means you're going to get a lot of independents that that moved in the Republican you know direction it's going to be not be because of both okay we'll ... we'll Gorsuch and Kevin I'll do when it comes to regulations of the EPA\nNow it may matter to you but I don't think that's what's going to drive in I think it was going to drive it is\nThe very clear drama that we have gone through over the last two weeks where people look at the Democratic party and say\nThese aren't fair people these aren't reasonable people\nRight and I think if you look at it got to be honest with you the protesters may be driving the left but they're driving away mainstream America the left may think that they're winning because the protestors are out there gaining the attention for them\nThat they're they're jumping on in in some cases they're bandwagon and their claims the fact of the matter is\nThat's not the case with middle America they see the behavior of the protest it's not to dismiss a claim\nIt is in fact to do exactly what was done in this case and to properly vet a claim to the extent that the president came out and ordered a seven\nBackground check and that Grassley gave Dr Ford her time on TV in front of the American people to make her case it also\nJust part of a great point there because I when when I was giving my explanation there I wasn't even talking about the protesters you brought up the protesters and I think the unique thing that we've gotten to the point now where there's no difference in in many of the public's mind between the protesters and the mainstream right politicians they're saying the exact same thing just\nThey're saying that it's it's not like you can sit there and say well those are just a crazy protesters no because the crazy protesters and the Democrat leadership of the Senate Judiciary committee or using the same argument yes they are\nThey're basically ... the the arguments and and claims made by these protesters and their tactics I mean look at even before we got to Dr Ford hearing the doctor forty hearing what was the tactic being considered\nThe first day the weekend before the first day of hearing a confirmation hearings on Kavanaugh it was well what if we just all get up and walk out over the whole documents thing by the way we're that go nowhere\nBecause they had nothing as Democrats always do these days it wasn't about challenging him on his position on on a rosy weight or anything else it wasn't I mean it was for Republicans with sort of my or or Kagan\nYou know what do you think if the government you can the government force you to buy vegetables\nAnd you know that that was the question based on of course a parallel to Obamacare\nBut that the left doesn't care to do that anymore so they co opt the claims made by the far left and they have become the far left the mainstream members of the party\nThe ones who were elected to office have become that because they think it's working Kamala Harris can go back to California and certainly get praise there\nBut the damage done by the kind of behavior by Hirono or ... and her words and the others on that committee and their behavior\nAll of that\nCarries over into the election elsewhere it's not about her owner I can see that and get reelected in the white Kamala Harris and say whatever she wants to and get reelected in California\nBut how did you damage anybody else that's right now on the brink of losing their election you did and we'll find out how far that went about four weeks from tomorrow\nEight six six Ninety red eye\nEngine report has brought you by Detroit ...
