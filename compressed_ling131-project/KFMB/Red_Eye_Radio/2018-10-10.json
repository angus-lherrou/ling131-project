now I'm a Mac or along with the air early eight six six Ninety a red eye coming up on the bottom of the hour\nMeteorologist Tom hale will join us on the latest on hurricane Michael which has been upgraded to over night and in fact in the last a National Hurricane center advisory about an hour and a half ago to hurricane for\nYeah we'll get another one a little over a Ninety minutes from now and and see where that goes but certainly again or not much is changing in terms of the fact that this is a a life threatening storm a a major hurricane on its way\nTo uh Florida so uh we'll we'll talk to Tom here just a few minutes and follow the story of course throughout the morning this morning and as well or the rest of the week as a Michael continues its path or through the south east and then back out over the Atlantic\nDid you see where uh where are some you Senator Tom cotton said that he believes Schumer's people leaked before louder really yeah he was on went on to she would show yeah instead I Believe the Schumer political operation was behind this from the very beginning Mm\n[noise] well I mean if because that would it wouldn't be a totally unexpected ride it doesn't seem out of the realm of possibilities because if you're Feinstein you you don't take the chairman Grassley you tickets to sugar party letter right and and have him deal with it right for video robot here's your forecast\nData from air force reserve and know a hurricane hunter aircraft indicate that the maximum sustained wins have increased to near one hundred thirty miles an hour with higher just possible as Michael becomes a category for hurricane\nMichael extremely dangerous life threatening storm surge hurricane force winds\nAnd heavy rainfall expected as well as the potential for tornadoes to spawn from the result of this system will get nine to Thirteen feet of water inundation along the coastline\nWas quite a devastating storm a and at that point\nYou have to say to yourself well if you haven't been around for Kate you know what other things have come by well\nAh there's been very few October storms to begin with I'm this storm is an October storm math he was an October storm\nAnd there was a failure but as Celia was a major all these are major storms but a failure was offshore and so it didn't have that kind of a an effect on Florida\nAnd so right now\nIf you're listening or if you have family and friends along that area you need to understand that\nThat on Wednesday evening one hundred mile an hour gusts are going to be common and that's after it's come onshore um tomorrow evening because we're expecting a still a landfall sometime around three to four o'clock\nAnd that means that it'll speed up a little bit before it comes to shore\nRight now it's gone gone to the north of twelve so\nAnd of course uh you know it's been pointed out time and time again not just the wins in the in the destruction of property and and presenting a danger to humans but but really the flooding of the storm surge here the water that comes along with a storm like this\nAh being a potentially life threatening in fact that his life threatening\nAnd is often deadly um and and that is something to be aware of it is not just the strength of the storm in terms of wins but also the water that it's going to deliver a both and storm surge and rainfall\nWell yeah you know remember that the ... in in the past it used to be lightning lightning was like the number one whether killer and you know white lightning isn't the number one whether killer ... because we convinced everybody to go out and the lightning\nRight right [laughter] okay yeah indoors it's lightning right\nBut you know we've done a really lousy job at convincing people to use common sense when they're on the road and they're driving and and we had over thirty people in the Carolinas\nDrowned because they decided they were going to be tougher and they knew what they were doing better than the people who are telling them to stay off the road right now and and\nAnd and so yeah a a storm surge is usually felt along the coast and let's say maybe five to ten miles inland wherever there is a waterway that the water from\nThe Gulf of Mexico can move its way and [noise]\nAnd so whether you're an Appalachian cola or you are in Panama City or you're swinging around uh uh toward the coastline just south of Perry and the big band\nThat you're looking at a a storm surge that's going to be easily nine feet ...\nCould be less right can be up to nine feet or even Thirteen actually the weather service has got a plot at nine to Thirteen feet in that area\nFor those of us who have never witnessed that first and I just described the dynamics of a storm surge especially one with the potential of a nine to twelve feet or more as you mention that because you know we've seen the ...\nSeeing the recent video from the nominee in Indonesia and we know so we can see that kind of force in terms of a storm surge I mean one of the dynamics of that what I describe that to us what takes place during the storm\nYeah because I'm looking here I'm looking here like it at Panama City beach for example that's you know uh you're right there I mean there's no there's no barrier it's not one of the bays is right there what is what is the fact how far I mean that goes in a pretty long way doesn't it\nOh yeah yeah when you go into the west bank or the East Bay um\nAll the way up through um what they called dear point lake which is is is really an extension the northern extension of the north bay\nA or the grand lagoon this entire area from the from the lower ... which is which is basically where the beach is uh the the bridge that goes over to the over to the beach right I'm\nAn inland all of that water rises\nUniformly pretty much and it's kind of like turning the water on it's not like what you're seeing a smelling like salami it's turning the water on\nAnd watching your bad to fill and except in this particular case as the storm gets closer and the last\nHour and a half to two hours or so the bath tub still and so in the Carolinas the the I I don't know if it was the record but it started close to it ... North Carolina\nHave picked up a storm surge a that was at least ten feet I'm there may have been a higher storm surge a further around the point I'm at that sticks out there if the Carolinas um but\nThis water just keeps rising and and as it starts to rise three feet six feet and so forth you need to be able to get to a place\nThat's higher than the storm surge and that is really simple as a gift and this water is moving and and so the water has motion it can erode stuff [noise] um and when I say it's moving it it's it's\nNormal current and it's moving because it's also got winds blowing it at a good speed\nAnd so you've got a certain amount of uh it's not going to be moving as fast as the wind because the surface tension the water's Koslow that body down but it's still moving so I the the place that I recall and I I drove through this area a couple of times [noise] um because\nIt's just a beautiful ride in your ... you know if you've done this if Germany for East Point the Appalachian coal a cute little town especially when you're coming across the bridge and you're looking at Appalachian coal abate down to the south and East Bay on the other side [noise]\nUm then you notice is you're looking off along the water all these nice homes but they're on stilts and they're they're all stilted easily at about ten feet [noise]\nUm well Thirteen feet would still inundate those homes wow\nYeah that's that's that you know that that puts it in perspective for anyone who's gone to a beach and seen these houses in fact we stayed in one uh in in in Texas and the and the guy was scenario over the summer and we've done that many times but if you've ever been to these are areas and you've seen these houses on these builds\nUh you're right those the typically there are about ten feet high but\nAdd another three feet to that potentially and that means even on still you're going to see destruction and flooding of those homes and that is very very powerful and and sobering frankly\nWell you've heard the terms high profile vehicles right okay well this is a house that's a high profile house and once you get past the stilts now you've got three feet of water going into a more solid structure and so that's going to be a lot easier to topple and destroyed yeah\nSure and wildlife yeah great point of the higher center of gravity yes I Am that situation which becomes a very destructive very easily on ... and so again or the timeline here we're looking for the eye to come ashore sometime in the afternoon\nYes and and and right now it depends if it if it goes the speed that is going right now and makes a nice even turn and doesn't increase speed when it makes the turn a little bit to the north northeast [noise]\nUh it wouldn't get there 'til six thirty eastern time [noise]\nUm but if it picks up some speed or even a couple of miles an hour goes from twelve to fourteen and so forth [noise]\nAh we could anticipate the same coming it a little bit earlier than that around four o'clock and that's kind of what everybody's betting on right now I\nThought there and getting rain right now ... has just had the light and rain and not in fact all of this is very light rain\nTropical rain starts off this little find drops and then increases from there [noise] um there's a couple of little thunder storms that are running anywhere from Appalachian coal up to Pensacola Beach so this is the eye opener hey notice it's raining Israel it's coming your way\nRight how far inland can we can we expect those hurricane force winds anything from Seventy five miles an hour and above a two to sustain a how far inland and and how long do you expect that to be the case\nAll right let's assume that it it comes to shore and we'll just simply call it where it is right now for\n... forty five miles inland\n... is what you would be looking at her\nAnd forty five miles inland would make those wins go to Panama City at least and possibly a little further out\nAnd it would take those winds back over to probably not to Perry but at least to St Mark's ... National Wildlife refuge area which is to the chest south or just slightly south east to Tallahassee but\nNow remember this this right now the location is a hundred and eighty miles to the south south west of\nPanama City or a hundred and Seventy miles okay southwest of Appalachia cola hurt a tropical storm force winds thirty nine miles an hour and more are extending out right now as we speak a hundred and Seventy five miles\nAre so so they're starting to feel the beginning of those thirty nine mile an hour winds at the extremities Appalachia cola and\nAnd possibly you know and then an hour or two by morning for sure when the sun comes up they'll be feeling the thirty nine miles forty mile an hour winds or even then it may still be possible for you to get inland\nWe applaud the individual truckers athletes who drive with care and keep our highways say a\nHigh end in Compton for over Thirty years you know the truckers America's most rent recognizes\nNow every week and watch me and my co host of grows as we bring you the only weekly news show creative just\nJoined us for all the breaking news affecting the trucking industry along with are awesome regularly profile\nIn front of the dot com is the one from Tom you're not going to want to have them be he traveled down the highway so tune in every week and watch the news channel my going to the front or not common\nAreas find Seventy five years the seven of them be San Diego's talk\nShows\nYou the news on the hour presented by liberty mutual insurance just\nObject jailer hundreds of thousands ordered to evacuate the Florida Panhandle not everyone is doing so\nI mean so how's it going to be for a lot about it and watch them on television would stay in the\nLatest on the strength of hurricane Michael CBS meteorologist David per se Michael\nIs now about as serious as it gets it is a category ... hurricane and they will make landfall as a category four likely with winds of a hundred and thirty miles an hour to put that in perspective\nThere has never been as long as we've recorded hurricanes the Florida Panhandle a category for making landfall in the Florida Panhandle\nLandfall expected in a matter of hours they're our of storm waters in West Texas for people still missing from an RV parks swept away by the raging flood waters Jeremy Baker with K.

hurricane Michael has increased just spring now is a four strings\nFor spring right now of hurricane for category for storms which means wins over one hundred and thirty miles an hour\nThis storm is not weakening factored still strengthening I mean this is the real the oldest vow to drill a this is going to come and hard it's going to come and powerful and you do not want to be on the immediate coastline in a building\nA that's a storm chaser Mike these in Panama City and that report their ... uh to uh west won a Westwood One the news\nYou know you watch this storm and and and look at how the storm is strengthen over well just over the last twenty four hours really um but from the weekend where ah some were predicting a category somewhere between the category one possibly a two and then by Monday morning\nAh it with a with that report early Monday started to change and they were saying possibly a three now officially a category for hurricane Michael is as you mentioned Gary and everything that comes with it I mean if you look at the the the wins\nA that will be a danger to two people and take out power lines no doubt\nBut the storm surge anywhere between nine and twelve feet or higher or the water from this storm not just from the storm surge but the rainfall that will come\nIt is going to be dangerous it is going to be life threatening and there is again no other way to say it but get out of the weight of this storm if you're in this area\nUh I Do everything you can to get out of the way of this storm as it continues to move inland it will dump more rain and we also have to keep in mind that it will spawn tornadoes coming up here to about thirty minutes we'll get back with meteorologist Tom hale\nWho's been without a been with us through uh the morning and and uh

listeners and conservative friends still care about the debt and the fiscal policy of the U.S but the the people in Washington don't because by and large because most Americans don't\n[noise] uh and uh and they are twenty feet I called and talked to him just a minute ago uh therefore their team of four meteorologist or are in their weather center and uh they're getting ready to start their wall to wall coverage and they are twenty feet above sea level\nNow they're optimistic that they won't see a storm surge um that will get up to the station right\nAnd they're also optimistic that the generators or continue the ... power generator or work in the station is fortified sufficient enough to handle this and we won't know that until a later this afternoon right um\nBut obviously I tomorrow we talk um maybe we'll see if we can get a phone call into them and a half after it has passed by right\nBut I think our prayers need to be with all the people who are up and down that coastline there are there because they realize that\nEven though the majority of people of evacuating it out of a given area that there are still some people behind and while they're not going to be able to go out and do anything once the winds up over forty miles an hour and they become tropical storm wins [noise] um\nBut that being said\nEven though they're not going to be able to do anything when it's over with they're going to be\nIn there in force I Know are surrounding a Panama City they've got to I think six hundred staged power company people were going to swarm in there the governor of Florida\nHas called out I think it's fourteen hundred a National Guards are guardsmen or guards folks ah [laughter]\nAnd uh the same is true 'em up and down the up and down the coast three states of of basically a declared a you know a disaster urgency\nRight let let me let me just ask this big because you did or you had predicted a before the last the advisory that show that went to a category of for you predicted then would go up a couple of of uh of of more miles per hour from a hundred and twenty five hundred and thirty and you hit it right\nYou expected to get any stronger or do you see if we can even as it gets closer to shore\nAh no I don't see a weakening is gets closer to shore in this particular case um [noise] the ah the water hasn't been touched so we're looking at eighty five degree\nAverage water temperature um the other thing that's going on is that\nUnlike a lot of these storms where we've got a cold front that might come in from the continental United States bringing in a little bit drier air there is a cold front out there but it's it's moving through the Dallas area right now it's it's nowhere near\nThis and so in in terms of what we know in the United states and and then the mid west and so forth we call it the worm sector that's the area had a cold front\nThat warm sector is a couple of hundred miles long and they're in the heart of that warm sector they have all the fuel all the moisture and in the heat and heat in the water that's necessary so it won't it won't die down\nOr whatever it gains it will carry to shore and then once it hits the friction of the shore then it will start to degenerate a little bit so Tallahassee could be seeing routine I'm\nEighty two maybe a little more than that mile an hour gusts was sustained winds of fifty miles an hour\nWhile Appalachian coal ah in Panama City beach will have one hundred plus mile an hour winds as it's coming ashore this afternoon and and and they'll have periods where those guys drop off to Seventy five miles an hour\nAs so yeah this is this is a fascinating point um you you may not realize that savannah is way out on the on the coast here or north Brunswick in ... in Georgia coming out of Atlanta and\nGeorgia coming out of Atlanta on sixteen uh savannah because of the wind field is going to have wins that are being ... up to twenty five miles an hour with some isolated gosh tomorrow night up to fifty miles an hour\nAnd the entire coast from the Georgia toast\nUp through the south Carolina and North Carolina coast um all of that area um potentially as far up as Morehead City um is going to feel the force of this storm on Thursday as it moves its way out of\nOut of a Florida and process Georgia across Valdosta and probably somewhere between savannah and Augusta a south of making and eventually comes up across Florence\nOutta ya were looking at I'm not going to the map right here in and a tropical storm warnings for all the Georgia coast and looks like about three quarters of the south Carolina coast and the rest of it as a tropical storm watch as you get it by South Carolina all the way through North Carolina almost all the way up to Virginia\nExactly exactly and I didn't even mentioned Virginia but Chad goes that far north and uh and so we can expect forty plus mile an hour forty five mile an hour winds all the way up that entire stretch on shore wins because this is a this would be a a nor'easter that\nThe Windsor gonna bring onshore flow and it's still relatively warm along there and whatever rain has dropped and rainfall figures for that particular area a are still pretty significant um\nUm we're looking at the Florida Panhandle 'em and mid Atlantic it all the way up to New England one to three inches of rain and as for the Carolinas southern Virginia Georgia three to six inches of rain with isolated amounts of eight inch rains\nWhile while uh and and that causes life threatening flash flooding\nYes yes and as people often do not heed the warnings or ignore high water areas and believe that they can get through those areas that's where it becomes deadly\nYeah let me give you another one of those little analogy is like the bath tub analogy I gave earlier right um you go to the grocery store and there's a gallon of water you pick it up and you go oh this is kind of heavy but it's cool well that gallon of water weighs about seven pounds and\nOK Now let's take a thousand gallons of water per minute rolling over a road which is not unreasonable right amount of water going across something\nEven if we brought that down and have we're we're still looking at you know thousands of pounds two three four thousand pounds it will be as if a a ... ton pickup truck we're\nAt Rhodes level pounding on the road back and forth just kind of bulldozing it and so forth how do you know that there's a road under their\nYeah great point great point what often there are six\nThe salt water six his own level so it's going to look nice and flat and smoothing all across it it's probably not going to be you know perfectly clear so you are not going to be able to see what's under it\nAnd and so just imagine all those containers of what gallons of water on a giant entire Iowa the grocery store rolling across continuously\nEvery minute across the road what are the odds is going to tear up that road and you think you're just being tired enough to make it through\nRight and and the fact that it doesn't it relatively speaking it doesn't take a high water or in order to move a vehicle I mean it it has that forces you raised six inches right\nSo you're talking about uh you know again all these all these threats that people cannot assess possibly assessed properly or in that situation and again he those warnings there's absolutely no reason to go through all high water or a a low area that has high water in these situations\nAnd heed the warnings of those local and state officials\nAnd the that that are there in Florida and those other states that will be dealing with Michael over the next twenty four thirty six forty eight hours\nI hear as we continue our conversation with Tom hill will do that

over there right now with meteorologist Tom hale who joins us live a Tom or take a look at this uh ... central uh update here from the national Hurricane Center watched the first thing that hit you\nFor saying that hit me that it is down increased and maximum sustained wind speed two hundred and forty miles an hour\nWhile while that's not Gus no\nThat's the sustained wind speeds or in the center of the storm to a hundred and forty miles an hour now can this this cat for category\nGoes up to a hundred and fifty seven miles now hundred and fifty six miles an hour after a hundred and fifty seven I I don't expect it to get to that point right okay butter at this point all bets are off I'm ... and it's now it's now increase speed by one mile an hour now that's kind of significant I said it was wobbling and I\nAnd as has started to pick up speed and as it gets closer upper air wins will start to turn it off in a north northeast direction and it will speed up and we'll see that and the next advisory but probably what caught my attention even more than that was what the Tallahassee weather service the national weather service has just posted on their website to okay\n... says unprecedented event unfolding from the national weather service office in Tallahassee\nWe search the history database for a category ... storm and landfall in the panhandle of the Big Bend area and

San Diego\nMake a moment in your lifestyle on a scale of one get one in the ... nothing like them like you were promised after getting good grades in college degree and a good job in corporate America\nCan you ... your dream you answered anything less than they can even into the gal wants the medium shot down some millionaire and founder of lifestyles unlimited must show you how to live the life of your dreams and have foreign family income\nListen to the ... radio show Saturday for news to one PM mug me I'm seven sixty talk and breaking news\nOnce again for another am seven sixty tacos\nGoing to pay a lot of over\nDiego performing arts to grab a taco with your favorite hosted by thirty PM then listen to the talk of seven it's tacos and talk tickets are sold out keep listening\nThe asset management level you have financial central flood housing game rooms at outdoors\nDoors and vibrant water [noise]\n[noise]\nWould have a\nHandful of people who have chosen to stay and ... and I'm I'm really dismayed at bed because again this is a life threatening storm if anything I can get across to lead me now\nVan Johnson mayor of apple electric cola of Florida yeah and saying you know get out\nYou can't stress enough you really cannot stress that enough because again\nOr you talk about the danger or as they mentioned there were some areas there are shelters that they if if you believe the structure you're in the home you're in a could not sustain that they've set up these shelters and if you cannot get out of the way the storm maybe you can get to the shelter but a heed the warnings if at all possible because this will be a deadly should well\nAs as we've been uh told her since a mutt ... hurricane Michael is hit a hundred and forty mile an hour winds now and it's well into a category for right that well build structures can be destroyed if they can offer on the truck\nDrivers we want to remind you that of course I tend right there in the entire panhandle of Florida\nAnd I I Can't resist sharing it again [noise] um the national weather service uh Tallahassee now mind you\nThese are the professionals who are sitting here taking in all the data yeah and they are responsible for the safety of the people who are with in their coverage area in Tallahassee [noise] and and that covers the panhandle and the big band and so they put this little thing together and if you want to see it you can just Google\nTom hale news twelve just Tom AOL News to Google that I posted it on my Facebook page and I invite you to share it\nYou can share it with any of your friends in Florida you can share with anyone you think knows somebody who might be in Florida because they need to hear this message the banner heading says unprecedented event unfolding and then it goes on to validate that by saying that we search the database for a category ... storm\nAnd to make landfall in the panhandle big band and this is what our map showed a blank it's never happened before so this is your last in bold letters chance to get to a safe place\nAnd the time for that is closing and so within the next\nFive or six hours if not already you may be in an area where the water has started to rise up and you may not be able to get out of there [noise] okay that time is closing and so they the weather service because they've never seen anything like this before a long coastline\nAh their pleading and saying if you have been told to evacuate leave and don't stay and don't risk the life your life or the life or your family\nAnd you also have to include the thought that if you are in a situation and it becomes an emergency if you can't get out of there that means first responders can't get to you\nThat's exactly right and and they've heard that message on their local television stations or radio stations and everything else but the reason people choose not to leave is because they go back to their own experiences and their own personal bias is limited ...\n... ... [laughter] really that simple when no nobody ... let's put it this way the vast majority of people who live there mostly nobody but the vast majority of people that live there have never seen anything like this and let somebody might have gone through hurricane Camille\nWelding and you mentioned bill when you mention you know the nearby air force bases and military personnel and you know I mean just any transient population maybe some tourists that are there people that just haven't lived there and as as that or even if you have for a long time if this is an unprecedented a band\nThat means very few people relatively speaking have been through this if any in that area have lived through this kind of storm\n... those those damaging wins the water and everything else that becomes a threat very quickly\nYes and and and it means that the people who are in charge of predicting that are now in a situation where all bets are off ...\n... ... is that printed yeah I mean we make up for it\nWe make for addiction and and and you normally say this about us whether guys well back they get it right fifty percent of the time and they still get to keep their job well maybe we are better than that but it doesn't matter because in this case\nThis is what we're guessing it it give us fifty percent of the time and if we're wrong by fifty percent then forget it\nRight exactly and and and that's again\nYou look at to what you mentioned earlier it bears repeating here in in a well built structure a well built on new construction up to code and beyond this these high winds can rip a ... roof off and will do so in a half a second\nYeah and and that debris goes flying again you know into a into neighborhoods and goes and enter your neighbors structure\nAnd we're we're talking about danger from several different elements of this storm and in this segment we haven't even talked about the uh any given possibility and the potential at any moment for a a tornado\nOr out of it but this is just one big tornado rhyming winds up to a hundred and forty miles an hour and a big torn right\nRight well let me ask you this because you know since we've been on the air it but it was a hundred and twenty five an outside for a hundred and forty as it gets closer to the shoreline and I asked you this after each and every a new update ... is there a possibility that it could even get stronger\nYes yes yes\nBecause we're we're talking about a hundred and forty miles offshore and I can say this first hand uh three or four weeks ago I went down to Pensacola and I I spent a couple hours floating in the eighty five degree water ...\nOkay and so this water is just prime the atmosphere\nThe air is moist and humid and it's a rich deep moisture that stretches well up into the mid level of the Syrian Kurds\nAnd the latest beat her olive just discussion that we read and breakdown shows that the serious layer above the storm has become more centric and\nHas become more organized into the flow\nOf the jet stream that's carrying it away now if you've got a vacuum cleaner and it goes into a container that you can't evacuate the your your plug the blowout mhm\nThan that vacuum cleaner eventually stops working but in this case the what we're saying here is the outflow of warm air evacuating out of the top of this storm what we would call a thunderstorm anvil okay is well\nOrganized and attach to the jet stream flow at mid levels and so it's a vacuum waiting all this warm moist air which creates an increase in the flow at the bottom of the storm\n... as we wrap up this segment and we think you throughout the show you've been with us and and we expect to be able to talk to you or tomorrow and go over and maybe we will be looking at the you know the again all the conditions in London and what to expect\nFurther but to give us a rundown on the timeline for Michael uh when I get the shore all the way you know going into back into the Atlantic what what should we expect to in the coming hours and days\nOkay a first Michael is going to be coming ashore it'll be just offshore and about eight o'clock in the morning [noise]\nUh I Can't tell the exact distance because of the predicted speed is going to change and it'll increase heading into shore [noise] but let's say against the shore and about three o'clock or two o'clock in the afternoon from there\nTwenty four hours later a Michael is going to be passing underneath ... or between Valdosta and making a in Georgia a from their um\nBy the time we make it to tomorrow night it will be crossing the Georgia Carolina line\nAnd it will be moving its way in between savannah and Austin\nOr Augusta I'm Sorry and or at and and so it'll be basically following I Ninety five\nAnd it will be just maybe twenty five or thirty miles inland divine Ninety five probably crossover Florence and Fayetteville as it heads up the coast I expected to get off coast somewhere in the Carolinas or the edge of Virginia\nAnd then stay off the coast by the time we find it friday night it's going to be offshore and it will probably be offshore of um of Boston\n... All right All right oh in the ...\nAnd the next three days it's going to be moving and increasing its forward speed as it moves along as it gets caught up in that jet flow that I described that's a vacuum awaiting the heat and making it possible to be a giant heat engine\nRight right are now right or a wealth of information very valuable to actually live in saving information from meteorologist Tom\nHale and we will talk to you a tonight as we start the Thursday morning program and all our thoughts and prayers are with those folks there and and those first responders and officials there in those states and areas that will be affected by hurricane Michael thank you Tom and we'll talk to you on the next show thank you\nLook forward to that eight six six Ninety red eye the Detroit power train offers a fish and sea through innovation Detroit's Brad Williamson has all the details\nA lot of people in the ministry of and doing down speeding for a while this is really our first entry into that\nArena the well so we've combined a DVD Fifteen with a D.C twelve automated transmission\nAnd my six by two ... and you can also get a six by four but really\nIt's a complete power train all three pieces including the front ASL obviously all four pieces far from Detroit and it also has something to the transmission called intelligent power train management it's a better step towards predict of technology so it looks a mild in front of you when you're driving it knows the territory in the train or going to come up on\nAnd it manages the engine and the transmission\nThe most ... is that it can when you're in cruise control\nFor more on the Detroit power train log on to demand Detroit dot com where shall roads ... that's the interim before [noise]", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "10"}
