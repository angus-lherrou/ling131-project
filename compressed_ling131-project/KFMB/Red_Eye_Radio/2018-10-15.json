with you again for this week from Sunday for Thursday ... billion for Gary inherit those if you don't know me I also have been filling in level network show for over a decade now\nAnd I've also had my own successful local shows in Los Angeles including on Westwood one's affiliate in Los Angeles seven Ninety KBC boy that sounds familiar saying that\nIn fact I got so used to saying that that I went to another station another network show that the engineers that media markets or ... or you know a practice run here and we did in the civil wrongful over flu station but I guess that's what happens when you're so used to it but we know the number here let's do it correctly eight six six Ninety red eye\nOf the same thing as eight six six or seven\nThirty three thirty nine and we'll be taking your calls in a little bit but first I Want to tell you that well we've been doing the last couple of hours\nWe've been trying to talk about the civil war between the left and the right and that's where I think has been occurring here for the last couple of years that I think it's the second civil war\nAnd you've been reacting to that on line I mean a through your calls but first of all let's get it straight if you don't already know what\nThe left liberals Democrats whatever you want to call them will do anything and everything to when they have no limits and they have no guard rails as to what is acceptable this isn't even the era of Ronald Reagan\nWhere he can be friends with ... speaker Tip O'Neill I mentioned this last hour and have a drink with him at night and President Reagan last what had happened with all the vitriol during the day and they're both Neal way was the speaker of the house at the time is so that's a daytime does that night\nWe're way past that and you saw Senator Graham talking about that that these were his friends\nThat he he was saying all those things about because of what they've done their search for power\nAnd oh yeah probably now you can't even have a drink a night 'cause look what it may have done to judge Kavanaugh\nIt has become an all out war anything as I said and everything goes now lying as commonplace as was mentioned this with Harry Reid claiming Romney didn't pay any taxes someone as friends or someone told them that wasn't true and he was a cold on that he said well it would work didn't it\nWas a total insanity of the charge that Kavanaugh was part of the group allowing for women to be gang raped so much so that even the New York times didn't print that accusation\nAll of it is fair game now and now any accusation is to be treated seriously if it has made this key if it has made by someone on the left against someone on the right\nTo serve the process of being uh the uh the proven guilty just the accusation is not\nSo she may not have been politically motivated forward but you you just heard you and your masters and deception used her\nThis is all just crazy and I I Love with Graham said he's going to get to the bottom of that suggesting that someone then find science officer one affords attorneys may\nHave been responsible for strategically delaying the leak deploying to lead to harm Kavanaugh's chances are it's just amazing as he said those actually Senator Hatch so this the goalpost moving never stops and here's my summation and then we'll take your calls the only force is\nThe way you and your cronies conducted the circus\nAnd maybe the ... across the ACLU the American civil liberties union yeah right they chimed in because they too are left this group before they our civil liberties group and so they came out against the nomination and I quote\nThe ... board of directors deeply concerned about allegations raised in recent weeks has made a rare exception to his longstanding policy and voted to oppose the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh they passed a resolution stating they pose the confirmation of judge Kevin of the Supreme Court there aren't credible allegations\nThis is the ACLU allegations that judge Kevin O's engaged in serious misconduct you mean like Bill Clinton did you say anything then that have not fanatical investigated by the Senate\nWhat would it be advocates adequate seven FBI check eight nine what is it\nDr Ford's credible testimony subsequent allegations of sexual misconduct\nYou mean the great thing that even the times wouldn't publish the inadequate investigation maybe they can investigate better and judge Kavanaugh's testament of airing leaders to doubt about it is a fitness to serve as an associate justice of the Supreme Court\nThis is not a decision take lightly we cannot remain silent on these extraordinary circumstances about a lifetime appointment of hardest score to the land I'm trying to shorten it the standards for such an appointment and the burden is on the nominee the burden is on the nominee to prove that something that happened how exactly does one do that\nThe burden is not met as long as there are hundreds of questions regarding the credible allegations of sexual assaults assault get it on resolved allegations so if they can never resolve it which they can't because there is no cooperation than while I can never be confirmed\nAnd it goes on and on I I don't want to make your two depressed but there it is again based on allegations I Want to know I just want to know where in the past the ACLU wanted someone convicted because of allegations\nBut this is what the Democrats and the left have no soul there is no place to go with all of this except down on the other and the loss of a piece of American\nTell me what you think of all of this application of the assumption of innocence and self righteousness of those on the left and the fool's on our side and if you agree with me that we're about or in the middle of a second

I'll run together yeah and you know rent figure out what yeah I was I was there what's on your mind Sally\nThe thing that that there are several things uh one of them is that if Feinstein really wanted to get to the ... when that letter came in a month ahead of time they could have went through the background checks on gun all that she wanted political theater and she is the me too movement to try to get us and it just made up\nOf fires and unbelievable I Am a survivor of a neat to see it happening to me\nAnd I didn't believe by the board for a minute now for a minute and they use that to make everybody just made a stand out of the whole thing and they said it back Thirty years in my opinion and I just I could just green\nAnd I hope that it motivate everybody\nOn the Republican side to get out there and and though because to me that was or what they did kick now was absolutely does that come out I Can't even it unbelievable to me that you would do that or an innocent man for political gain that kind of craziness\nYeah no I understand we're yeah thanks so I understand where you're coming from it was hard for me to watch when you know it was the Democrats turn to a question him or not but the question them they just put on the show\nPretty disgusting and of course is grim pointed out he voted for uh you know liberal or left is a Supreme Court judges and they won big numbers so we we often are the part where the stupid party and then in my opinion than even part I heard someone else saying this\nAnd um we've got to learn that we're in a civil war\nAnd I want them to get someone who fill the greed with me wherever they go they may have dropped off let's go to Tyler in Reno nevada Tyler you're on with mark\nThis Nevada mark and it's I think that ah I've heard a ... a way too much of rehashing of the last you know a couple of months of political she said she said no the other nonsense [noise] one thing that the folks that listen to your show could do to help\nWith the ball over launched so to speak for whoever can do that you want to support is to actually get off your ... and go out and volunteer to sit at the\nPolls on election day and Greek voters or what we found time and time again I've been doing this since Barry Goldwater ran for office years ago thought is that if you have a friendly face at the polls\nIf you have people don't do polls that are still carnival in the sense of where they're going to go you get a seven to twelve percent push\nAt those particular polling places where you have these friendly faces now it won't do any good if you got to curb margin but it's all grumpy and no one wants to get in fights with everybody but the thing is is you just have a nice pleasant person there\nAre I always set up a little card table with a bowl or can be a couple of ... and you know say hello to the kids that come out with their parents\nAnd you could make a significant difference in your community both on the down ticket people and on the main ones like I'm going to be out there for a Dean Heller a starting here in Reno or on the twentieth of October or we start early voting I [noise]\nI I think that uh everybody else if they would take a few days off and participate at the polls they could really make a difference I don't\nKnow you you make some good points to the ... that personal touch I've run for office of course in California last\nRepublicans don't usually win in California but I'm the personal touch makes a difference because they've done polls and and I seen it in the audience was where they ask people have you ever met a candidate and almost all say they never have and when they meet someone and you had a great point in their reasonable decent that's how you can get a vote\nA than Republicans used to be very good at doing that and then they went over to consultants and TV and I think we went to strengthen some ways let's go to April in New York City Hi April you're on with mark on the road I radio\nHi [noise] um I wanted to comment you said you wanted to hear a comment about whether we're going through a civil war and I believe that\nThere's a difference the civil war I think we are going to prove something similar to that but on the civil war both sides of very boisterous and we're willing to fight to the death\nFor what they believed in what's happening now with the media and entertainment and the and the young people\nThey they don't they only hearing one side we're not organized conservatism organized because when nice guys we believe in being in a civil\nBut this is not the time to be that way because the kids are watching and the nature of young people is that they want to be on the winning side they don't even know we exist where all the young kids in ... in school or in a high schools in the colleges the minute they have a conservative view\nThey screen that oh how could any person as a young person is in college\nBe strong enough to stand up against this title wave and the media and the entertainment um people this as a songwriter the singers\nEveryone seems and is appearing\nTo be liberal so all these young people they say well you know this is what we're supposed to be a good side they\nThink they're on the good site and they're being brainwashed they don't even know they're being brainwashed and we're letting this happen I feel as conservative we should be getting organized which should not be you know throwing rocks and and cocktails the windows like some of the ... and ... you know group dies but we're not serving our cause\nWe're being too quiet and I don't think every\nGroan American that's a conservative is going to be able to go against the tide of these termites\nOf little liberals who just following the tide they want to be happy they want to go one friend invites the other friend I'm going here we're going to protest we're going to go down I'm In New York city when President Trump comes in 'cause like\n... of protest it but I Would not go down there because I'm afraid of getting beat up and I might be the only one there was a different point of view we're being like um bullied\nTo just keep quiet and Chuck Schumer oh and what's his name Cuomo what he just said lately that President Trump's he's trying to get all ... or any violence that goes on he's organizing his people to be violent there was something that happened at a metropolitan club\nI think they said Republicans are now now now I\nDid you hear what Cuomo said I couldn't believe it is that he's President Trump this is the way they the Republicans handled things he got them organized to do that he set them up on purpose\nTo go after the ... seats set them up something in ... but the kids and they believe that it's very serious that reminds me my husband watches on TV the History Channel and my son watches and he's twenty Twenty one\nAnd they show how Hitler isolated the young people got him to summer camp they were separated from their parents they only heard what Hitler was saying and telling them you are strong we are good\nWe will be ... feet and it gets all cheering smiling faces\nThey don't know what they that they're being hearing propaganda and we're letting it happen I feel very bad 'cause if I knew there was something going on\nAnd I wouldn't be the only one there and the police would be there to protect and make the children see that there's two ways of thinking but I don't think they know and and we're letting it happen because they're trying to be polite\nBut they're they're gathering all the young people with the media and ... Taylor Swift and all these other singers let die they're not thinking in school they're not teaching them to think independently in college if they don't think with the crowd there'll be just slashed\nWhat do you think did you do that I don't think it's a war that's fair because that civil war the two sides are fighting\nThe two sides fighting equally\nYeah well I Wish you considerably more passionate that's the first thing I Want to say the ... you at I'm teasing you obviously you a very good\nWell here's some I have some optimism for you but you're basically right you may not have heard me say this is it's not a wonder that students come out and they're liberal because that's all they have it here it's a wonder that any of them come out as conservatives because they realize that if your doctor and eat them you get them early then that's the way they're gonna think can be except for this\nWhoever the president is seems to make a difference when Reagan was president yet more Republicans\nAre the fact that Trump is president and we're having some great success forget the media I Know that's a problem to get those schools\nI Know that's a problem they tend to see what's going on and they ... more Republicans are you know take place in the time like that now you're right we got a lot of stuff against us and the republic you are right the Republicans don't know

was eight six six nine o seven\nThirty three thirty nine and we're going to your calls right away and it's Tom in Rochester New York you're on with mark\nHi Tom hello\nGood evening or so it was a good morning sir actually with critics from what I did that wrong I Apologize I was in Minnesota that\nI'm a I'm fifty five years old I voted for Ronald Reagan my first time I get my father was a diehard Democratic Party member for Democratic Party at the Nineteen eighties was the party of the working man and noticed that it has been hijacked by the ultra liberal left\nAnd I am any Nashville trade union and I'm told to vote democratic and I just okay okay okay also like\nTo go with a Joe ... go to Jerry Brown's press secretary back in the seventies Governor Brown has the governor of California and I just look at California and it's like wow\nThis place is just it's it's just crazy and the Democratic\nParty is just so evil and visceral the Republicans and we do have a few of those but for the most part they're pretty down under these people and I think Trump\nHas been the best thing that's happening to us politics you know I have a bunch of liberal friends laughable ... what did you vote for his libertarian that way you can get all that argument there will come after me\nBut I did vote for Trump I think he did a great job [laughter] uh it was so funny Hillary thought she had the lecture in the bag and I remember I was made in a place and\nI came into my supervisors off big Hillary supporter and if you know what I said it's over your girl last\nAnd I looked at the Capitol this week I I've been working in a solar site and make it a Minnesota and I was coming back from work and Rush Limbaugh had earrings I live and I listen to it I just I Can't believe that crap but he was through Mr Kevin do they just they just\nCharacter assassination and here's another thing I think back to a judge Bork when he tried to get on a screen court\nWell he tried to get on a screen that guy from Massachusetts called Ted Kennedy just\nWill be able to just go crazy that really makes me angry as Mr Kennedy was one of the biggest sexual predators world is hurting National Cemetery 'cause he died at her office that's a big problem with it\nSure Mike ...\nThat's ... ... ... you brought up a lot of great points look so there's a new program that Obama certainly encourage the law was passed the where the Florida a shooter murder\nA man program where they didn't want it to go on high school kids on the records of high school students even if they got in trouble which is one of the I think the thirty five thirty six incidents I don't even remember\nWhere they would have found that he had a problem but there's a program to make sure that people can live their lives and not let you know ... or something here or something there get in a way of them\nBeing successful right he had nothing even this I suggested who knows what really happened even if he was part of it in some way these high school kids as you were talking about these were minors and what about us thirty some odd years where is his bank account\nOf all the stuff he did well once in a now that if you just look as you said about the spirit of the law of the litter of law\nHe really wasn't guilty of anything but it didn't matter what the Democrats\nWere up to they were just trying to stall has to make sure he didn't get on the Supreme Court they have this feeling that maybe if they won the Senate which they're not going to do more you know they could make some difference in who the nominee was I don't think that's going to happen\nSo they were out to destroy it didn't matter who Trump President Trump would have a point that they would have been out to get him that's why it's such a hypocritical monstrosity to watch the so such a bunch of ... there was Blumenthal I don't think I mentioned him tonight\n[noise] he said at one point that a lie telling one lie could disqualify you yet he told lies about his service\nIn in the military it's well known who just want to talk about that is true and I never feel you're living on another planet I often feel that way [laughter] I watch what goes on but it wasn't really about the spirit of the letter of the law it was about ... and that's why the ... it was held for\nMonths or weeks whatever it was a you got to know what's going on and that's why they they don't care if the destroying anybody saw about power and Lindsey Graham at at the best it's all about winning and he says about cutting out the you know what\nA and these were his friends but no it's it's ... it's reached new lows that's why those just joining us I mentioned the first hour than we have a new civil war going on yeah with soft civil war or not\n... it's a it's it's really a fight for the soul of this country let me know what you think let's go to mark\nIn Fort Joni [noise] California mark you're on with mark [noise] uh\nHi Mark I won't forget your name that's for sure I Want to learn about Christine part owner talked about Christie\nPoured that Brett Kavanaugh I'm a I'm a former sheriff's investigator or on marijuana addiction period for a while and a\nTheme for this was doing a lot of things during her testimony that the best effects do when they want to cover up their crime and cover up their ally she's a psychologist or the little girl boy raised ... million lecture at the end of the that the\nThat the whole liars technique or body language shrinking her head down toward her shoulders about living that was great about what the people in the eye quite\nYou know always that up or gay so think back to when they're trying to get away with something I I think ms forward as the liar I don't know what happened to that room and don't care because there is no physical evidence yet had in the country and ah we presume innocence\nAnd all that guilt can be proven and there was no guilt proven toward Brett Kavanaugh any way shape or form said that makes Smith poured a liar\nAnd that's that's really what she is\nIn California we have a movement that put for twenty three counties that have declared that want to separate Cal Oregon port there all day Saturday the liars here are in charge of government uh they're in charge of every aspect of our politics and less we fight about things that we're going to get better\nWell I certainly agree with your and a lot of people said this about fighting back because otherwise we're going to lose the country I mean what made this country special is is it risks now left takes it over ... good luck so Marty couldn't remind him\nMarty couldn't remind him forget your name now you use expressed the very well let's go to well here's a good point let's go to Troy in Nashville here on with mark\n[noise] hey\nI'm I uh I've got a little theory you know we've we've got these kids and you know there are what ten twelve Fifteen Years old before they're released\n... and ... are you There God and you hear me now I can go ahead\nOkay um so I was saying you know kids to you when they start\nGetting to the age of of even slightly paying attention to what's going on in the world they're twelve Fifteen Years old so these kids started paying attention and\nFor the next eight years\nAs someone that would have been ... says all this Obama stuff you know no winners and losers and filled day now these kids are twenty twenty five thirty years old and all they know it was Obama so now I've got a twenty two year old daughter and a twenty year old daughter and they're both\nHate Donald Trump one of them refused to sit down and talk with me at all the other one I got to sit down and talk with her and I\nShowed her some facts kind of changed or a little bit and then and then I've got my ten year old that loves strong and he goes to school and all the kids in his class they\nThey're Trump supporter so this generation that's coming that wasn't raised up in a bomber um years I completed my ten year old knows more about politics than my twenty and twenty two year old daughter too\nYou know and and I think that uh these kids when they grew up you know and basically\nAnd the Obama years so we've got this generation that we've got another generation that's coming up that uh is gonna be hopefully the generation that saves us you know so I just wanted to to\nYou know kind of let you know about that or you know it's a generation gap that I see with my own kids\nFrom you you got to get rid of your two older ones just\nTell me about it you know and and that's been you know the other thing about Kavanaugh and and you've got this a huge silent\nMajority um that you're there they're\nThey're afraid you talk about fighting and that's what the the Democrats and the the liberals are doing they're I think I'm In the silent majority is you know they're afraid\nTo say anything like that guy you know earlier said that uh he voted libertarian you know instead of just coming out and saying hey I voted for Trump you know is it fair scare and you've got a small group of people\nWho are ... and the majority and I think this ...\nAnd uh all the spin on it is really going to show at the polls with the we've got a huge silent majority I'm you know so\nWell I think you're right ... yeah yeah yeah no I\nI think you're right how are you guys are move me a little bit you know I came on pessimistic about losing the house\nI don't know just listening to an end by the way you try you also made a very good point which is and I said this before\nWho the president is makes a difference who the people young people grow up with that is what they hear and that's what they learn right that's why during the Obama administration to get a lot of young people all they hear is that side and now with Trump although we have the media against this which are it's a lot\nBought if they see the economy's doing well and their lives are improving the lives of their parents that starts to influence them and more people like that was in his own microcosm in his family\nThe ten year old is a Trump supporter and the ones who grew up with the Obama and he can't even talk to them\nI Know that feeling [laughter] I Would have my own house so I Can't be hard on him let's go to a ... in Fresno, California Iran with mark [noise]\n[noise] yeah I think\nOriginal argument was whether there

Republican Party at a positive way late fighters out of\nUm [noise] in the media is implicit\nWhen you look at what happened the state college but\nAbout where is the choice if he had a choice you kill their babies why not just people that want their health care to stake him alive why don't we have in debt and issue brought up\nAnd that's one thing that's one thing Trump Rana you ran a round and and that issue in an issue legal immigration but yet or is it just health care at where there's\nThousands or millions of people are paying more lenient multiple detection been before and in in ... you how do you think that it will\nIn in any way late in the ... when the party ditches are going to get rid of it and now we're ... which still there and it it it get rid of it I Know they're going to win because at the end you ... ... ... ... or the vote here at all which is which is not\nIn like to shake it if it's a tax you can get repeal attacks like they got rid of ... ... ... that that's why I asked was gotten Robert me to act out of it in a life in the constitutional\nWhere is the choice for that and why is Nick how can we get it gets to go with that he helped me there\n... ... ... yeah I think I can I don't think they have courage or they're afraid you know the poll numbers are actually I don't know if you can believe them but the poll numbers seem to show that the repeal is not as popular as was I don't know if that's accurate or not\nBecause we have problems with the polls but you make another great point Gerry which is what I said there's John Roberts appointed by a Republican president and all of a sudden he changed on Obamacare we're pretty sure we're going to win that\nYou can't even trust wrong which is how about the Democrats they complain about the Kevin Oh they voted in lock step you know the four votes are going to be there every single time it doesn't matter the history you don't ever seen them deviate\nBut even on the Supreme Court is the Republicans who deviate from what you thought they believed him again you're not supposed to question them on every single issue now they don't even answer it\nBut you couldn't even trust John Roberts to be a good a Supreme Court justice who else who's the awful one Souter that the H a Bush appointed I mean he wound up being a disaster\nSo we we we have this problem and thanks so much for your culture the problem is that people are not ... as he pointed out John McCain was probably trying to get back and President Trump but you can't even trust try [laughter] you don't have to worry when you vote for a Democrat when you vote for liberal when you vote for the left is that what you're going to\nVote for our own I mean I I gotta tell ya I wasn't even sure that Susan Collins was going to come down on the side of Kevin I was worried\nWhen she was going to give her speech I don't know if you remember a few hours before she gave a speech people weren't sure what she was going to do\nAnd they all than you have people like Jeff Flake right to life dimension him or he didn't even run again because it's so unpopular ... another one that aids Trump so much\nAnd you could even be sure his well what did he do uh a woman costs name which looks like she may have been part of the ... but I don't want to say if it's not accurate you know some of them were paid the ... did you watch them by the way calling U.S Supreme court a truck stop his nomination obese people losing it or what\nAnd that's why so those are just joining us now I sit in the very first hour we're a civil war going on but we can't even trust that sense of the jury's question they runners Republicans concern is ...\nRepublicans conservatives whatever and then they get in there I don't know they want to be in favor at the parties or they want to get good press who knows what it is it gets them that's why I say this for years and it's a good time to say to the audience now\nWe didn't first become Republicans and then the site on our principles wait a series of values and we said oh with those values then the Republican Party makes sense and if ever they deviate from that what is the point of being Republican what is the point if the party can stick to it what's the point of John McCain you know\nChanges his mind or vote or what he said he would do\nOr Jeff Flake 'cause he's angry at President Trump and we can go down the list the others like that\nBut you don't see the Democrats doing that now you could say you got mentioned in there but ... didn't Trump ... West Virginia by forty points or something like that I don't think he had much choice and he tends to be somewhere in the middle but that's unusual\nFor the most part they never deviate and that's why I say ... and we'll take your calls\nIf the Republicans lose the house of representatives\nGood luck the next two years they are going to have subpoenas they're going to have hearings that go into a peach President Trump there's no doubt in my mind if they have a majority there'll be able to do that in the house representatives they'll have hearings they'll try to teach you judge Kavanaugh\nThis is going to be chaos and I am sure one of the caller said but number to call her ... go out there and vote you\nBetter get your neighbors to vote you better get your friends to vote this is a serious stuff\nThis country will never be the same if these guys getting power and it doesn't matter if President Trump when's the next time if you have a house representatives that trying to destroy ... and there's people as Lindsey Graham pointed out they only care about power\nI mean I'm not going to say they don't have any principles any use but I'm just trying to say they think they're so right there so arrogant that anything goes and you saw it and you watched it at the Kevin hearings they they didn't care about ruining his reputation and in fact as I pointed out before they didn't even care about the Ford didn't care so much about her she was just a poet\nAnd when the phone is like Cory Booker said ah do you think she's making this up you didn't even care she made it up\nIs all about winning your point of you are in your case running for president next time the same thing with Kamala Harris you can't trust these people\nWe we know what they're in for you know why they're in for this stuff to gain power to win the election to take over the presidency they never accepted as when there's going to continue to tell me what you think eight six six Ninety red eye which has eight
