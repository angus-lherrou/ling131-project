do\nHow do we ever win elections well I guess we just finding the people that they won't talk to us and the friend us so we don't get you know the people on our side wouldn't do that you don't know who they are let's go to well I don't know if we have time for one more call it wouldn't be that fair to you but I'll tell you this\nIf it is a new time in America and I got to admit it's discouraging when people get on the air and say I got to be careful what I say my neighbors ever knew my\nPoint of view if uh my uh friends ever really ... or the when they found out what my views were I was in big trouble I've been to a friend did I mean is this the McCarthy Era I remember McCarthy was you know calling everybody communist and whatever you thought of him it was unfortunately ruined a lot of careers\nIs that what it's counter and let me talk about myself you've probably heard me say this I Am a part time teacher and they don't know\nThat I'm a talk show hosts let alone on national radio if they did they can figure out that I was probably conservative talk show hosts are some liberals are most of them are not\nMany do you know what jeopardize being what what kind of a man it's we have

pressure from the east and west coast of metal mean clear skies don't look for clouds in the inner mountain west or the west coast\nMark how you doing well\nGood hey I just wanted to follow up with something you had mentioned um briefly a little while ago about a social media and the effect that is having on relationships friends family colleagues\nUm I've had experiences where I I quit Facebook five years ago because I just couldn't take reading\nSome of the things people were writing and you know it was opposing me but I thought I don't want to jump in here and and you know say something that might soon regret or anything but I Know people that don't even talk to me because it was revealed on Facebook how I felt you know\nUh back when Obama was still president and it just I I think the damage social media has done in my eyes far outweigh the good a ... with a lot of relationships you know\n\nMuch started to go in your direction first of all I got to say my older brother has never signed on in more than one way obviously and was always afraid about privacy issues and that kind of stuff he winds up being right\nOr if I wasn't on the radio I probably wouldn't use faced with that much although I I got to be fair it is good you can reconnect with people when I was a teacher years ago they find me or you find out about someone's life is they just use it for that\nBut I've learned like you became I've learned not to say much about politics and the ... when they know I'm a talk show host and if they know me already good luck they'll never leave your lawn is there a chance to you know trying to\nSay all kinds of things that they can say if they can't get through on radio so people have no limitations there so I just about I kind of control myself sometimes something gets me so sad\nAnd I think I I'm going to comment on this but in general uh I Try to stay away from it I think the social media right\nAnd that does some good but the I like I said I don't even use Twitter hardly ever use Twitter anymore if I wasn't on the Rio there are a lot of things I wouldn't do including like Facebook\nSo I I think people should be cautious with the social media special we're finding out that they're you know so many things were hacked into finding out a lot of your information so I think it's smart you said you have ... five years and\nI admire that Tom in Port Angeles a Washington You're on was mark\nHello mark a a I Want to do a shout out to your Canadian color out you're still listening I I I listen to a lot of community radio up here where I'm at\nAnd she's right it was a it was pretty horrific the way that they you know both the duct tape you she CBS NBC or just\nRegurgitate it everything [noise] there's a bright spot and let the Canadians weren't aware that the U.S electorate we're going to do it fast can not get the candidate that the media was trying to and this\nAnd that worked out in the end so all that horrific stuff that came off of a a Paul Kennedy and a a\nAt a Charles Adler and uh and right and uh and and green or\nAll of that probably helped a jet of Obama or get a Trump elected\nBecause he was trying to hurt for we're coming down from Canada like that\nAnd uh but the reason I called was so we had already been told a for your Twenty years Thirty years that ah you know nobody was going to be able to fix the inner cities and yoga racial issues that we had to confront\nAnd a lot of people a lot of white people voted for President Obama and then when he got elected she ignored his mandate anywhere\nClear off on another Chang judge and things got worse so we were very very disappointed or you know the people that voted for the white people that voted for Obama will review review disappointed and it damaged the Democratic party for a long long time [noise] [noise]\nWell I think if they voted for him because uh they want to show they were in prejudice that was a mistake you know color should never be an issue but I'm sure some people did\nBut the fact is then he was ah didn't disappoint me I knew he was I knew we was when he first came out\nI I'm not to mention his personality in terms of dropping a bill ... who is the rent Reverend Wright and pretended that the you know they weren't as friends anymore you could see who he was\nHe get to know someone sometimes by a their character I admit people come pick on Trump that's for the things he says and does so it's not foolproof but I knew he was far left he he really has got closer and closer he's behind that for for half a second\nI'm no disappointment to me I I never expected much from him and that's what I'm saying the other side the left doesn't understand that we dislike him probably as much as ...\nYeah I never expected much from him and that's what I'm saying the other side the left doesn't understand that we dislike him probably as much as people dislike Trump although that is a high bar that admit that ah people who hate Trump really hate Trump let's go to Dave in gurney Illinois you're on with mark\nMark I've got two observations and then eight point to make a first of all you notice\nAll the calls that you have coming in it's always the liberals\nAnd Democrats that shut off the lines of cute communication when it comes to personal relationships that's well that's the observation and then also you had a caller who was touting that she was highly educated [laughter] yeah she was highly educated but she was not\nHighly indoctrinated that was the problem with liberal friends and then also when this country was founded almost two hundred and fifty years ago it was founded with the premise\nAnd the power of the individual not the state and isn't it funny how the left can sit there in town for individual liberties but they don't like the founding of the country\nWhich specifically states that we have powers as individuals and not not the state over us as individuals but they are fighting for their own demise\nWhen they fight against the founding of this country\nBoy you said that very very well and I by the way I don't I don't believe that the left believes in individual rights that they're so far out there than you know they claim they're against fascism is example with anti fascist themselves\nThey it when it's convenient there on the side of individual liberty but don't mistake that these people care about and what does this group think what does that group I think\nUh they want more power for the federal government\nWhereas we think it as you said we want limited government and the government to stay out of our lives so I I don't think that's who they are they protecting right to protect the little guy and\nThey they care about my minorities and they cared about the basically for no they did they just care about getting in power and most of them many of them are really far left for the adult Democrats that you could count on to be moderate to scoop

also ahah we talk to on illegal immigration as well I ... on TALK about some shops ours at sustainability\nYeah did you say your primary you're getting cut off a little bit there did you say your primary job was league you know folks in legal or illegal immigration\nI our primary focus is focusing on legal immigration course illegal immigration a lot of people come here legally eventually becoming become illegal immigrants so she'll be focused to reduce spent some time on illegal immigration as well\nDo you uh support legal immigration or have certain numbers of that you'd like to see we do\nAbsolutely support legal immigration a well support is ... ... ...\n... that means that we support ending chain migration which is which are the ... family reunification for immigration Parker um we support ending what we would like to see the visa lottery ended as well we'd like to see\nUm [noise] we are all like to see that the uh employment base greeting cards um give out a highly skilled workers where there is truly an e and the American workforce for those kinds of workers that are coming it\nSounds a lot like the administration's position right away the ending chain migration and are supporting the visas with high end talent you where are you with the president\nObviously a Democrat created this bipartisan commission Nineteen nineties any assigned Barbara Jordan the former ... and nobody would accuse ... and her democratic regret credentials as the chairwoman of of that bipartisan congressional commission and\nThe short a commission recommended uh what what we\nWe advocate for today is it called for ending ... migration at any of the the lottery and reducing legal immigration to their recommendation was ... sit down to about five hundred fifty thousand\nWhich at that time the current level was about a million which is around where it's at today so so there was bipartisan support for this but he had a huge push over the years especially in the early years in the in the mid to late nineties you had a huge\nPush on big business U.S Chamber of commerce groups like that that that always want more workers because they look at us as as a\nSupply and demand issue if you have a large pool of labor than you can keep wages lower it's just simple again price supply and demand type type theory [noise] um\nSo you had the big business trips pushing for more than ... ... it in the late Nineteen nineties but then you start to see more of a special interest groups the immigration attorneys um some of the some of the um\n[noise] some of the more ethnic base groups after the two thousands start to get a ... a large interest in legal immigration naturally when you started to see a shift in the Democratic party\nWell so that you know I ... during the week I've been mentioning so you had the conspiracy not a conspiracy but there is a mutual coming together adventurous the Democrats want more votes they see the power Republicans would call in the country club Republicans like the wall Street Journal\nI told my listeners they start the title of the editorial it would say a talk them as if they're going to talk about illegal immigration and somewhere in the middle aged which on me and talk about how great immigrant and swore and I thought OK you guys to see into my subscription if you're going to play with language the

that they're going to try to stop this caravan from from reaching the U.S Mexico border um that they're taking it fairly seriously at least they're giving an impression that they're taking it very strict barely seriously so off to see what actually happens when they when they reach Mexico's southern border and want to gain entry into Iraq into Mexico\nTo get up to the United states but again that the caller was absolutely right what they're going to try to do is they're going to try to game our asylum system once they get here they're either going to try to\nGet in illegally undetected or they're going to come through a\nUm a port of entry and claim asylum or when they if they do try to come in illegally undetected but get detected apprehended by border patrol then they'll entered their asylum ... by defensive asylum ... but again they can't enter an asylum plea\nUnless they get into the United states so my recommendation is\nKeep 'em outside of the United states see if Mexico will allow us to move our asylum educators and say okay if you seriously want to consider or as a ... here in the United states than what we'll do is we'll send our asylum educators to you\nWill hear your case and then we'll only allow you into the United states if you pass through the initial tests which is a credible fear attached [laughter] but I think\nAgain ... you want to read a lot when we both agree wait a second it's mark African one or a button when we both agreed with you [laughter]\nYeah yeah well here's your here's here's my problem\nWait a second it's mark how are you want to re button when we both agreed with you [laughter] yeah\nYeah well yeah I'm well here's your here's here's my problem I mean we got her own refugee here you know what they're called the call they're called homeless he got sixty thousand people and in in California under sneak their their bedroom and they're women children\n... and ... by ... by a teacher with the other people's problems\nWhen we got it or if you do you can't take care of the Iraqis are homeless refugees here that's my point in going to bring out here too in Philly they take care of that I say\nHe's got the ... of the of the or the you know where they came from the government takes care of him and be responsible is like we should try to take care of our own was\nBad and and and women and children do you do you see what I'm saying\nOh absolutely not going to let Chris and we do follow you could go ahead ... yeah\nNo no I couldn't agree with you more and that and that's the reason why we take the position that we take on immigration where we want to reduce legal immigration levels as well because we have our own issues here in the United states that that we need to take care of now when we're dealing with foreign aid\nYou know what what what money do we give to other countries they think there's a there's a number of different things that we can do like the first that plays a little bit more too well for a policy type ... so there are strategic reasons why we provide foreign aid to some of these countries that we we provide we've provided to and I think just as as as the world leader\nYou know the United states is the biggest strongest nation on earth we do have to take a little bit of responsibility to make sure that there is\nYou know that there that there are human rights violations and governments are pressing\nPeople things like that around the world and we've always done that\nThroughout our ... you know throughout our two hundred year two hundred and fifty or history [noise] um so when it comes to that but I think there are also other things that the government\nCan do I think the government can encourage business to go down at best and some of these countries maybe give them some sort of a tax break for investing in some of these more needy countries and and helping to rebuild those countries so there are other ways besides just foreign aid\nBut but I think going back to your original point couldn't agree with you more I think that's why we can't take\nA that every single person in in every other country that happened to be living below the poverty level because we have millions of Americans who are struggling in the United states today that we also need to take care of we need to put them first and that's what we need to do we need to start putting America First ahead of the rest of the products\nNow and I want you to clarify this for me see if I understood it so someone just gets their leg over on our side of the border they can then legally request asylum\nThey can they can legally request asylum ethics and\nThe definition of asylum do is you have to have your persecution back the whole country Samir government because of their race religion political is or a social group that you have to belong to that doctors federal law but that also ...\nHowever what we've seen over the last decade or so is that a very very first step\nTo claim in the silent you're in the United states is that you have what's called a credible fear interview\nAnd in that interview you say that I have a fear a returning back to my country because our X Y and Z well what happened was we've lowered the credible your standard so that somebody could claim\nCriminals gang violence for domestic abuse or or something like that but it got stuck on the actual definition of\nA one and I finally is so because of that we've allowed people to claim asylum who don't actually qualify for asylum by the time they get four and a file a judge they get their case rejected\nAnd they're and they're sent back home so what the what the administration led by attorney general Jeff Sessions and it's been an act by the department of homeland security they tried that that that credible your standard but that doesn't cause some why does not credible your interview that's why I think it's so important for this this caravan that\nThat may be heading our way is as for the United states to prevent them from entering the country that is they want to claim asylum to that credible here in our outside of the United states once they get in they're not getting out so we can't let them all [noise]\nYeah but they can they can pretend and their advisors lawyers whenever I can tell them what to say I don't know how you prove a negative you prove that they don't have fear of the harm or a person ... that have money back to their country and how do you do it anybody I'm just trying to think in claiming if they're trained to say the right words\nYes well usually I mean usually the the that that the state department I thought the federal government is usually pretty aware of what types of\nGovernment persecution are happening on a country by country basis so\nThat we haven't seen much of this you know even though that there are sort of violations rates and showing I in in in in other countries you know we know that we know that is is\nIs of course Korea for example and she believes you're there not a communist state you're going to be persecuted within that country we know that Christians in the middle east are often persecuted\nBy the government because of their religious beliefs or individuals I've been at least a persecuted by the government because of their sexual orientation things like that so we do those things are\nHappening and the government either is aware of them or came quickly investigate into them\nBut when they you know again in the old process uh before ... when they were able to just say well I have a fear of criminal violence while yeah there is violence there will be allowed them to enter into the system that that was bad so doubt that so they can't they can still make a false claim on the other side of the border\nBut these are we can and that's the gate whether or not that claim as likeable likely to be true or not um while they're outside of the country like I said once they get split it's added states\nIt's easy for them to disappear into the into your seats and we never hear from them again\n[noise] yeah well we want to hear from you again because I have a number of questions I still want to ask you and if you have a question from Chris out their eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine and seven thirty three thirty nine mark I suffer rent I radio\nWhat's the difference
