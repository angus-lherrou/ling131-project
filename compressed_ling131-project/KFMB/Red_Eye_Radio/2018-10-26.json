that we'd likely will learn about in in the coming days if you think about the um the forensics behind such an investigation there's plenty of of physical evidence to work with\nSo we'll we'll be looking at that and and as authorities are seem to be right now focusing on for it as a possible place where these packages or at least some of these packages were mailed from\nThen it's only a matter

Chuck Grassley announced that he is referring Julie sweat Nick and her loyal a lawyer excuse me Michael I have an end to the Justice Department for potential criminal investigation as to whether they made false statements to Congress about Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh ...\nGrassley said that in addition to making false statements he is asking the Justice Department to look into whether the Tucson to obstruct his panels investigation\nOf the allegations of Kavanaugh quote the law prohibits such false statements to Congress\nAnd obstruction of congressional committee investigations for the law to work we can't just brushed aside potential violations I don't take lightly making a referral of this nature but ignoring this behavior will just invite more of it in the future Grassley set in a statement and\nHaving any quickly fired back in a tweet saying it was ironic that Senator Grassley is now interested in investigations\n\n[laughter] that would be interesting to see where it tastes like that would go right\n\nYeah um you know you have a number of things there that honestly\n... that that warrants an investigation I think\nHere's here's the question what if anything happens to it after the midterm assuming like the house takes control does it does an investigation like this go anywhere I guess\n\nBecause no reasonable prosecutor [laughter] what was the first to a a a a\nRefer I I I Would have to look at everything the Grassley has but here's your rights here in light of MIT sweating extend Mr ... own statements to the media\nInformation obtained from committee interviews of her associates and publicly reported information about her in Mr ... it has become apparent that the statements Mr ... submitted to the Kennedy likely contain material false claims Grassley wrote him a letter\nGrasses across does not guarantee the Justice Department will open a an investigation\n\nIs the last part of that ... says he sent a letter to attorney general Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray right\nBecause if the if the committee words to do I mean if they do an investigation then what would happen to them if they found that there was wrongdoing you essentially send the Senate you send a a referral to the Justice Department at that point I mean good for\nProsecutorial means if you found that there was a wrongdoing if you through the investigation your own investigation from\nI don't know everything that Grassley has yeah so I can so and I I can I can only speculate but if it's you know she claimed the gang right\nMhm right right right and then but here's the thing\nYou the investigation doesn't go doesn't have to go too far because of the fact that she went on TV\nOn a national television show on the today show and starting to walk back some of the things in that sworn statement\n\nSo it's not like you it's not like the uh the the\nThe house and their investigation into the Justice Department where you're looking at you know it's like pulling teeth and getting some of the evidence for documents you have things in a sworn statements that are countered in a nationally televised interview\nThat are different by the same person\nThe question is you know what do you do with that I mean does the political climate change if ah if the Democrats take the house or you know and and\nYou know what do you do with that I mean does the political climate change if ah if the Democrats take the house a you know and does that kind of soften I guess the or or or steal from the ... the desire\nTo pursue justice year oh that this will be the Senate so I Know I Know but it doesn't change anything about the center of it because there has to be that while I Would again that goes back to that political will I think again no one is above the law and if you go through the process and this\nThis really focuses on the the if the uh the tearing down and the shredding of the actual process itself by the Democrats especially Ron that committee during that process\nWe know that that was the you know the the hearings ... were about Dr Ford but this war was ... at ... this was adding to a an intended to influence the the outcome of the vote\nOn Kavanaugh confirmation vote on Kavanaugh it was part of that entire process well some separate from Dr Ford part of the camp a confirmation process so when you talk about doing it doing away or trying to do away or or completely dilute or shred\nThe process the interstate ... just then then I don't know why you wouldn't at least pursue any of us\nWell when we had the lead come out and say look this isn't a trial just isn't a trial we said well no it is a political trial and and there are things that are similar to a criminal trial which is\nYour under oh mhm if you commit perjury mhm in you know if it is and that's what he believes you know making false statements perjury if you don't that is against the law that you are breaking a criminal law at that point right as we said it's different than a criminal trial but it is a political trial\nThat has similarities you are put under oath\nAnd so the circus that we saw going on and I understand we're Grassley is going from if they if he believes and I don't know what evidence she has I don't know if anybody came forward\nAfter it I don't know who didn't testify or what information was not brought out the crash had that might you know that he might have now so I really don't know but if he believes that he can make that case\nFor making false statements base based on what she said based on the TV interview and based on\nWhat other people that might have come forward have come forward and a might have come forward since then have said to him absolutely he should go forward with that because\nIt is a it is a legal process or if somebody commits perjury or makes false statements they shouldn't be prosecuted we see what happens when we see what happens when somebody makes a false statement to an ... an FBI agent they go to jail Martha Stewart went to jail\nSo should we said that when a political trial happens because that's what it was that none of the law should be followed at all that people should be able to go in and make a circus of it\nIf you can prove they know you know that they lied and their lawyer lied and their lawyer put them up to line should you go after it I think\nThe majority of Americans if you ask them that generic question and kept the you know kept the case out of it the vast majority of Americans would say yes\nBecause it is it was an attempt I think you can they would probably be able to prove through this investigation that the attempt the the the uh the the motive or what they were trying to do was disrupt the process\nAnd if you do that through false means\nA boat giving false testimony a sworn testimony to the Senate committee is against the law for reasons that that that's what that's about because that is a part of the process and if you if you can show that this was the the the clear intent here\nWas to disrupt that process\nAnd you know willingly said things in that statement that sworn statements that were false I don't know why\nYou wouldn't move Fort well\nAbout ... whether they take the house or not this is now in the department of justice for just under the president so I don't see it stopping if they believe they actually have\nA castle ... because it does this really isn't at this point isn't about political will because frankly the left doesn't care about sweat no or apathetic no so you know my question on the on the house thing is that suffer from the political will it's not about political will really\nEight six six Ninety read I\nWas told that ... wrote a [noise]\nCheck out all the latest in news events tracking information

well the if of course I mean after you know after you're done as an advisor not really a lot of people care\nThat's my whole point I don't know what the draw would be for for him\nThere really wasn't a draw your two hundred people yeah that's what I mean you could but you can also join now look at all of the probably not but up until now look at all the attention for Steve Bannon\nThen that increased goes away\nAnd as we've said before the true growth\nAnd if you listen to the show you know we've been consistent\nUh irrespective of whether it's been a Republican president or a Democrat president or the GDP is not the most accurate way it's the way that we use and it's become the accepted way\nIt's never been the most uh uh accurate way we believe to truly a show the indication of economic growth because money being transferred back and forth or government spending is viewed the exact same way\nAs private sector profits and sales and we believe that that distorts\nThe actual growth rate of any economy but it's been consistent from democratic presidents to a Republican presidents well it's important to monitor the true expansion of wealth\nYes and that's and that is the that is the increase in goods and services produced by the private sector not that we don't support an increase in defense spending no we're ... we're just talking\nAbout how we analyze how it applies to the economy is doing so without the increased in government spending\nOr you would have had a a a\n... a growth rate of of two point five six percent up from the two point two percent from the Obama administration\nThe point is how critical it is because you see the increase\nYou see the increase in a huge increase why because of fossil fuels which drives the majority of\nThe private sector increase in GDP that's still what's driving the majority increase in GDP in the private sector it's still not as much as government spending\nRight since April of of twenty Seventeen that's how much you know we have increased government spending\nOver the last\nYear and a half when that government spending goes away so does the GDP increase that's why we have been so concerned and we've taken a great deal of criticism from people who used to agree with us but now disagree with us\nOn the increase of increasing the cost of goods by terrorists and as we've stayed it doesn't matter who you are as a matter of whether you call yourself a Republican a conservative or liberal a socialist a capitalist if you believe\nThat an increased cost in goods in the marketplace benefits the economy then you don't know what you're talking about is that simple and so that's why we have always been so concerned about trade\nAnd about artificially increasing the cost of goods and services when we talked about the president and the new NAFTA the president's number one accomplishment on the new NAFTA has been what\nWhat he believes he has done to the car industry which will increase the cost of buying a car in the United states in Canada in Mexico and we'll make it harder to sell that product made in the United states overseas which was what the president claimed\nHe wanted on trade and we will continue to say this on tariffs the president does all over the place and when you're all over the place on a particular issue one has to ask do you have any idea what you're talking about\nPresident just all over the place and when you're all over the place on a particular issue one has to ask do you have any idea what you're talking about\nWell and as we uh break down the GDP Growth and you look at it right now and and the way that there's this long lead and then they point this out on this Wall Street journal article for items like aircraft carriers and things like this so we're likely to see as this money goes through the ... a Pentagon and then as actually spent and\nAnd and and through the contractors were likely to see some of this growth continue in terms of the defense spending growth\nA leading the way into twenty ... twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty\nSo what's important here is that you kind of separate that from what the private sector is doing we're the growth is in the private sector\nOr wherever the lack of growth\nIs in the play in the end of that you do yes you you do have to\nSeparate the two because government spending even for\nUp quitting and even though there is a benefit for those companies doing it that's not why you do it right it's not why ... why you do it but also that is the majority of that money mhm of increase of that money is coming from borrowed money is coming from money that the that we are putting on future generations\nSo the economic impact overall may help now but down the line the burden of the debt is going to hurt one works against the other one the other thing is the multiplier effect\nIs not the same as in the private sector\nBecause the multiplier effect in the private sector is if you build something that makes somebody else else's life more efficient or make their business more efficient they use it and it's the combination of building that good in service and the increased productivity along that private sector in line that really boost\nIt really is the true economic engine that that shows that you are having an economic growth thing in a sea of our society thinking a smartphone\nYes you know like is it so that that is that that great demand um because it's at that because it's\nCreates that efficiency and society and and and productivity increased productivity and that's where you see again that multiplier ah create that huge expansion and well and and ripple out you're not going to you're not going to see that with defense spending\nWell defense spending you will build the initial product mhm\nBut the initial product is used for what that's the cost of doing business mhm what your ... and so yeah we understand how that helps the GDP but you're creating something\nYou're using debt down the road is where yes it is sort of funding ... write long term debt to to pay for it but then that actual good or service is not used in the private sector and to improve the efficiency\nAnd productivity above their businesses down the line\nIt stays there and it becomes a a burden of the cost of doing business on an entire economy yes\nAnd that I mean difference you could make a a very indirect a link to it and say that it preserves capitalism in general yeah and you roll right but it but that does not have the same immediate effect that the private sector multiples are due\nAnd that's and that and that's why when you look and that's why when we bring up the tariffs and the cost of home building now when the cost of of of timber because those terrorists from what I Know ... until the deal is signed are still on with ah with with Canada the increase you you're talking about the two biggest drivers\nOf of when you talked about what ... what the consumer marketplace of drive the economy it's housing and cars\nBoth have been targeted by terrorists [noise] we haven't even talked about food yet and what a drag that might be down around the road and the big terrorists haven't even hit yet and that's why we are we are so concerned with the direction of this White House when it comes to economics and I have no idea where\nHas has the ...

I didn't know my city my city is actually in four different counties yeah I didn't know the government to I didn't know the right for and so there's different rules all over the place so it's no wonder I get\nMy city still has no dancing not just on Saturdays you can't dance ever do damp down by the snow dance a note card playing no dominoes um yeah yeah what are you going to do for on the\nTrack your workout finally are breaking the rains for Texas high pressure remains clear skies today over the state rain has moved to the east and we'll see it run today from I fifty five and I sixty five north and south\nAnd a good part of the mid west and south will see showers today most device Seventy five will look to see rain later in the day it'll be clear in the northeast the desert southwest and dry in the nation's midsection\nAnd western parts of the country with the exception of coastal Washington and Oregon and the Northern Rockies\nYou look at the the it's likely from call out research that was done and the comments that were made during that call out research or any kind of research that has done I keep in mind again official campaign ad you hear her voice on the ad for a reason that by law she has to be on that ad\nAnd so they use that word crazy\nBefore Democrat for a reason because it's likely get was it was said that way\nBy people they're concerned are going to vote right instead of left\nAnd they're trying to persuade them or trying to influence them and and let them know that she's not one of the problem is is that it's likely in part because of the capital thing and her vote in the Kavanaugh thing\nAnd we said that you don't have to be a you know someone else or who's on the committee you don't have to be a Kamala Harris or anyone else who did something you know that you consider to be crazy or your voters potentially consider to be crazy in order to feel the effect of it\nIf you vote no then you're going to essentially condone that kind of behavior and I think that's what she in part is facing right now in her state and that is your vote was everything that they needed some of those independents needed\nA to make their decision and could well this decide their vote on election day if it hasn't already an early voting\nYou will have because I'm sure they'll be in some of the weekend shows you'll see some analysis of this as they do the analysis of a different commercials but I looked at this\nWe'll be in some of the weekend shows you'll see some analysis of this as they do the analysis of a different commercials but I looked at this as more than just affective Republican advertising or Republican rhetoric\nI Do believe because I'm trying to think of any ad where I've heard the Republicans say the crazy Democrats ... uh I I don't know a ... a ... ... ... I don't know I don't know if it's if Trump is use that in in a in a rally or not\nBut the fact is that you this is in these independents that you're trying to convince in fact I was just thinking\nDuring the bottom of the hour break after our last segment I was thinking to myself because we were talking about people that go out and vote\nThat I went out and voted the other day early voting I always go out and vote it's just a habit I'll I'll I'll always vote I voted before I was ever a talk show host you always went out and voted dad made sure when you got to be Eighteen he's brought up the newspaper everybody goes and vote she live in this house\nThere were two rules you didn't tell you who to vote for he'd give you his ideas of who he thinks you should vote for but you had to vote would no choice you live in his house you voted and when you were sixteen you've got your drivers permit to get your licence and you did not wait those are the two things you couldn't say wow I really don't you\nKnow couldn't be you know saying oh we don't know that wasn't happening in my family maybe my sisters but not my brother and I we wanted our licenses ASAP and so we were happy for that role\nAt Eighteen it was like a day but we had we had to vote so\nThat was built inside of me I really don't understand the mentality which is why when we talk so much about independence this week we've got into arguments when people say well don't people don't react that way well you don't know and I don't know what we're saying is it's a possibility\nAnd when we say it's a possibility I've been getting the reaction back you know it's an absolute that nobody would react that way well you don't know that ... and that's why all these advertisements are going on because the politicians don't know that\nAnd so that's why they put out all these particular ads I don't know what it's like I don't know how to find somebody who only\nI'm undecided I don't know if I'm going to vote yet I might vote on might not both but I'm undecided and all this massive advertising that is hounded my way I don't know what gets that person off their bus as an undecided independent to go out and vote if they're still undecided at this point\nBecause think about anybody listening right now is it very hard to imagine yourself as an independent not sure where you're going to vote in this election\nRight [noise] yeah this late in the process I don't know this this seems like one of those appeals especially using the words crazy Democrat it it it reeks of that almost desperate to peel or Hail Mary\nAnd it it could be too little too late but you do it anyway because you believe that there's no risk in using\n... why is this what she decided to use them that desperate attempt because it's more than just Republicans that this was I guess my point it's more than just Republicans calling Democrats crazy that\nSticking it's the fact that even if\nThey don't hear Republicans saying those crazy Democrats the appearance on Democrats\nIn the media is giving them this\nOpinion for a Democrat to in a political ad for the Senate of the United states\nCall her own party and I know people will say well she was in Poland it it was the actor no that's her doing it that's her ad she approves she ... she was saying they were crazy true that actor for a\nSenator and in ... senator to say that means that sticking that is a worry\nRight now right with Democrats not just in the mid ... because it's not going away anytime soon but even if they get the house they still don't have the power\nI'm not sure that I Would even here I guess depends on if the race were different with Joe Manchin if his race were different in terms of the numbers that were neck and neck if he would use that I don't know that he would use that but\nWe've heard the the idea of before you know over in the house side Tim right\nYou know trying to challenge or Nancy Pelosi a you know back in the day but\nThe fact that what\nWere they saying the identity politics\nBut it's it that's that's gone\nFrom there is that it's not about you know trying to ... it's interesting because identity politics almost sounds like an old phrase right [laughter]\n[laughter] ... full on crave that that's that's so ... seven day and he says you have to go straight to what people are saying and how do you connect with people\nIn their own language that's the difference is is what the people are clearly telling the McCaskill campaign and the feedback or an terminals are seeing that phrase used repeatedly\nAnd that's why it was used in the ad\nAnd that's why it was our audio cut of the the week and I burst out laughing when I saw the Claire McCaskill yesterday called for civility in the debate we need civility civility\nWhat do you mean you're calling your own party crazy [laughter] how much do you really mean it if we look we can understand we understand in politics you call in the opposition party crazy fryer calling your own party crazy yeah\nWow\nJust they're crazy race isn't it [laughter] and and she really is who you're talking about being in the middle well she's a middle of a rock and a hard place that's where she's in the middle because\nYou've ... she had to vote on the Capitol I think right I mean that action is there and it's lasting its recent enough at least and will be\nA through the election to make an impact and the behavior there\nIt's remember they weren't referring to crazy Democrats the protestors on the street no no this was the party they were talking about the party and we pointed that out\nDuring the Kavanaugh confirmation process you're not talking about fringe of protestors on the street you're talking about people that were sitting on the committee these are these are leaders of the party\n... and we were talking in reference to due process and present from the innocence this wasn't the radical protestors out there screaming you must always believe a woman this was coming from the mainstream of the Democrats and as we said most people look at that and we gave some of the credit to all the lawyer shows that have been on over the last ... sixty years on television\nThat Americans may not know the constitution up and down but they do know the presumption of innocence and [laughter] and they do know the whole concept of due process because everybody has watch law and order or one of the other many thousands of of of different TV episodes dealing with what goes on in courts\nAre in this country and they looked at that and they went\nThis is crazy Hirono white men need to shut up\nTV episodes dealing with what goes on in courts are in this country and they looked at that and they went this is crazy\nHirono white men need to shut up ... you look at that and you say that's crazy mhm and it's tough mhm and so Claire McCaskill was force\nIn desperation to say I know this is the reality of what people now believe my party is I'm not a part of it please vote for me eight six six Ninety red eye\nThe Detroit power train offers of fish and sea through innovation Detroit's Brad Williamson has all the details\nA lot of
