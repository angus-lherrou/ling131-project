McNamara welcoming good morning [noise] you know we can do we can buy a whole bunch of different topics together sure OK guys even you know we just talked to John proud about hurricane\nMichael a a a coming in we had a discussion on on on Hurricane Florence ... you and I talked to briefly not we didn't spend a lot of time on it about\nThe Washington Post piece remembered that said the Trump Administration was complicit in right in the in hurricane up of Florence ... uh you know we talked about you know the president\nDoing something on that but all we're really not sure but allowing the the the increase to happen initially\nEthanol was supposed to be about reducing global warming until they found out from farm to tank it actually produces more global warming gases\nBecause of what you have to do to actually make up and all and we just mentioned that the president doesn't bring up global warming it says oh the government needs to uh get involved in this in order to help the farm right um and then we have the United nations\nComing out and saying we're doomed\n[noise] because of global warming and we are uh you have a Al Gore\nTraveling the United nations as well that we have twelve more years yes we'd twelve years now I I Know I Know you're we're already passed the first twelve years aren't we yeah yeah you ever was but this twelve years they mean it\nAnd so so how do we solve it ... well the United nations special climate reports suggest a tax on carbon dioxide emissions would be made to be as high as twenty seven thousand dollars per ton at the\nEnd of the century to effectively limit global warming ... that means you would have to have a two hundred and forty dollar per gallon tax on gasoline in that year huh now should such a recommendation be adopted yeah\nIn twenty thirty the report says a carbon tax would need to be as high as\nFifty five hundred dollars that's the equivalent of forty nine dollars per gallon\nGas tax\nBy twenty thirty well then the experts we'll be right cars won't be on the road to what he ... he won't be anywhere\nI won't be able to get it on my desk with little centrally be a paper wait\nA ... you know and so all of a sudden we're back to you know global warming again as we said we're just a few weeks mhm uh you know before a mid term elections so the Democrats got to bring out the old standby\nAnd they quote home and drink and some of the wall Street Journal here factoring in social economic demographics of the population on the Atlantic and Gulf Coast said Mr lumber damage by future hurricanes will only increase because the population is greater and wealthier and there may be more deaths sane vulnerability is the main hurricane problem facing the United states\nWe should not allow so many houses to be built on flood plains or coastlines we should insist on higher building standards and increased wetlands\nTo handle flooding we should stop federal insurance subsidies that encourage building in vulnerable areas and mentioning that every news site in cable news channel will be promoting heroin and heroic stories about Hurricane Florence Mr home and said major storms have become events\nThey afford great footage which feeds a ... sensation viewers and storms and become more frequent and more powerful meanwhile tragedies befall Americans every day for which the federal government does not shower them with they'd because CNN is not present\nHe might also have said connecting extreme weather the climate change to encourage carbon reduction is today's falls mantra declaring practical steps towards living rationally\nA A R possible he said they could begin with Congress quad defined for the American people how much they are forking over annually to entice fellow citizens to live near the beach uh\n[laughter] so [noise] um\nI just you know interesting the actual politics of it but you know and and we will probably you know hear it again after a hurricane Michael mhm uh again the blaming of President Trump oh sure and that's why like I said during limburg if you want to check out his stuff\nUh he writes some great articles and he does believe again or he believes global warming is happening he believes humans are partly responsible for it but he believes that what the left is doing is completely wrong\nBut do we have an ... interesting prospect yeah do we have an impact of course we have an impact but we're part of his life cycle here on this planet yes\nI Do as people always ask what do you think and I said I don't own neither do you write and I don't think anybody really knows you can take a guess but the average Joe on the average Joe I'm not a a you know atmosphere science scientist but ah from what I've read they don't know because the predictions are always wrong\nMhm well there are things that we could measure in the past that aren't necessarily part of the global warming thing but you do talk and in terms of pollution\nParticularly ... matter yeah even if you want yeah you can quantify these are things that we can measure and we can understand the problem is when you see policy especially the cost of government which keeps creeping up\nA that is put on the American people uh with out\nThat kind of of evidence and discussion I mean again pollution you can measure\nYou can have the discussion there in fact I think the discussion is pretty much over on that but it's different when it comes to well things you can't see and the politically driven idea of greater taxation based on something that hasn't had the pure discussion

run out and go to Justin in Kansas Justin\nWelcome you're on TALK radio we talked about the president ... up and I'll plant earlier Iran Renee Hi\nGood morning guys our very good All right well\nOne of the reasons they start incorporating ethanol or allow all into the fuel was that they use cues what was called MTV metal tribunal ethylene as an anti not anti knocking right turns out it yeah it turns out it was a carcinogen being put out into the air so they started replace them with apple alcohol you\nCan't have two hundred proof alcohol it ... it absorbs moisture from the air so most are going to get it's like maybe one Ninety five Ninety something like that so it's great for the farmers to increase the percentage of alcohol and the fuel bland\nHowever alcohol doesn't hold the same amount of energy right for them as gasoline does your do your mileage fuel mileage so it's screwing up consumers ... doing\nYeah well we we had no problem with the we we had no problem when we talk about this report with up at all for uh the anti knocking capabilities that's not what the temperature sent exists\nNo jumper send mandate existed initially for global warming right yeah we know look we've not\nOur problem is the fact that yeah it's great for the farmers will anything would be great if the government mandates that you must make something and the consumer must buy it it's always great for that industry direct I'd a monopoly great government dictates\nAll right you need to do this for the well what's the reason well for global warming well what's the reason now to make sure you have a job mhm for video robot here's your forecast\nHurricane Michael is a category one hurricane slashing Cuba and is now forecast to be a dangerous major hurricane when it smacks the U.S Gulf Coast tomorrow according to the national Hurricane Center\nThe forecast indicates Michael May be a category three hurricane with wins from between one hundred eleven to one hundred twenty nine miles an hour when it strikes\nLife threatening storm surge is almost imminent along most portions of the Florida coast in the Big Bend area we'd be looking at a well built framed homes incurring major damage trees can be snapped in these kind of wins\nNow we were initially for the first day little dump on a golden couldn't understand why it was going to him\nAnd on the air this is going back ten or eleven days as you and I were discussing why were to go to the inspector general an off the subject was data that's the role of the inspector general is to do what is to investigate corruption there it's the you don't give it to the inspector general does say review this\nAnd tell me what I can release\nAnd what I can uh you know what I can unwritten pact\nYou you that for that you use\nYour a director of national intelligence ear CIA director and uh your your uh a secretary of state it was a former CIA director those are the people you would go to for the for for that maybe your national security director ... you know the secretary of defense\nThose are the people you would go to to just to decide at least in my opinion whether you should declassified or not and I say you're a secretary of state former CIA director because they claim that some allies\nOr didn't want some things to be released and our initial thing was wait a minute what are the allies no they don't know what's in their\nRight how how do they know that the\nAnd we were initially puzzled when he said he was going to give it to uh the inspector General Michael Horowitz until we realize\nThey were they ... that it went whoa look at\nThis but yeah the conclusion we came to was that if you were looking if you're looking to give this to the inspector general of the department of justice\nThen you're basically asking him to do an investigation and to issue a report they said they X but they asked for an expedited process here from Mr Horwitz\nAnd the only reason you do that is because of the role of Michael Horowitz the inspector general's office in in the overall is to do what to look at possible fraud or misdeeds done within the ... of justice fraud or a rousing reception and all of that\nWould be and if you think about it because I I'm thinking of a a a ... and in the room with the president and also or his chief of staff or Kelly is well looking at that and saying\nIf you come out and make a conclusion or draw conclusions from this information by de classifying it and we see the on redacted information here\nIf we jumped to the conclusion well first of all\nThe executive branch is not really that there is no prosecutorial power there you would have to go through a the the department of justice itself but where would you start at the department of justice if you believe that people that are either they're in place or were there before\nCommitted a you know a crime possibly or there was fraud or corruption or any of those items that would be on a plate of the inspector general's office for you would start with Michael Horowitz that's the only way because beyond that you're looking at just a political move that's all the way it would be played\nIt would be well the president saying this and that's not what we think if you take that off the out of the political arena\nAnd that's exactly what you do you\nThink of out of the fact that you're not sending it to the attorney general even\nThat could be seen as a political move because he's an appointee by the president right while our air supposed to be autonomous and you know ... and or which is someone that's been in place since\nBefore he was appointed by Obama he was appointed by Obama but more importantly ... that's a key to opening the door and ending\nThe discussion about whether it's politically motivated more importantly\nOn top of that you add the fact of what the inspector general is designed to do in the ... report you might see from the inspector general's office when we went through the inspector general's report\nAh on the FBI\nThere were a number of things in the uh the Hillary email investigation a number of things there that we found now\nIt you're taking this I guess otherwise mundane report and you're trying to basically build the narrative as to what was going on in this case of the other report of at the FBI under the direction of a then director James Comey\nAnd what was going on and and how the Hillary email investigation uh was handled into and then parlayed into the Russian investigation and all of that now when you have here by the way I think that's part of it to\nYou already have an existing report that covers part of the timeline in fact uh the most important part of the timeline that would be outlined in potentially in this classified are now de classified information\nSo now ... having already done the investigation on the FBI and how they handled the Hillary email investigation and then the Russia investigation\nNow has all that work done the legwork done there to possibly lend support to this new investigation um and it's I think interesting and I think very key\nThat the president turns it over to Horwitz and basically washed his hands of it for now and I think it's\nAn important member Giuliani has been saying that he believes the perjury happen that right you had somebody in the FBI verify 'cause that's his charge okay and and again we're this is going on speculation by what\nPeople who claim they're familiar with the matter a bully even and he is a former prosecutor what he believes his that he believes there is possible perjury in the fact that\nAh the Pfizer warrant and they're supporting documents for the size of warned that they swore were intelligence when they were opposition research and when the when everything was a redacted accent me on redacted\nWhen everything was opened up and declassified so everybody can see it ... how they got the Pfizer warrant application the surrounding documents the three oh twos\nAnd the communications between the higher ups of the FBI that somebody in the administration said don't release this Mr President because if you release this it will be viewed as political you solve it Adam Schiff said Adam Schiff said well he's only partially released in what they want to really solve it\nNope if you believe that you see the corruption and that's what we believed they believed 'cause you only give it to or which because you believe possible crimes have been committed ... curves either something extremely wrong or crimes have been committed\nAnd you give it to the inspector general because at that point he can come out with a complete report and not just use you know the the unwritten pact that evidence so you have but he can go look for anything he wants in the department of justice and get it to help build his case\nHe has access to the documents that the that the ... the oversight committees could not get from the FBI\nThere is no process that stopped Horowitz from walking in and obtaining those documents that the the those oversight committees have been trying to get for a long time he has direct access to all of that information\nNow I Want to read a parts of this from John Solomon that adds to all of this he goes the department of justice and the FBI have tried to work President Trump on releasing evidence suggesting that will harm national security make allies less willing to cooperate or even leave him vulnerable to accusations\nThat he's trying to obstruct the end of the Russia probe before you judge the arguments from the department of justice and the FBI which are similar to those offered to stop the release of information on other major episodes in American history on the bay of pigs to nine eleven consider\nA any does the the chapter on the house intelligence committee's report earlier this year on Russian interference\nIn the twenties sixteen presidential election until this past week the footnote really has garnered no public intrigue in part because the U.S intelligence community blacked out the vast majority of its verbiage in the name of national security before the report can be made public\nFrom the heavy redacted arguments all one could tell us at the FBI general counsel James Baker met with an unnamed person who provided some information in September of twenty sixteen about Russia email hacking impossible linked to the Trump campaign\nNot a reporter or policymaker would have added an eyelash over such a revelation than last Wednesday I broke this story John Solomon\nThat Baker admitted to Congress in a non classified setting repeat\nIn an unclassified setting that he had met with the top lawyer at the firm representing the DNC and received allegations from the lawyer about Russia Trump and possible hacking it was the same DNC along with the Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign\nCampaign that funded the unverified salacious dossier by the British intel operative Christopher Steele that became a central piece of evidence\nUsed to justify the FBI surveillance of the Trump campaign and the final days of the election he's been following this but what are you saying here's another example again at the FBI and the department of justice\nThese these things aren't top secret about national defense no it's about ... their posterior otherwise Baker wouldn't have been saying it ended on climate so I ... that was the point [noise]\nSo are there you go just a little bit of an update on here and we will keep we keep you updated on it because we believe it's

Ninety\nOr read I one of the things I've heard over the last couple of days especially from the left the legitimacy of the Supreme Court is now gone ... of course that's ... right [noise]\nUh it it it is and I mean that's the way when when you're lost or anything else to say that's that's what you say the only other thing as I've said I Will not let it was yesterday showing and I and I do believe this is something the Republicans need to work out and I said maybe I was nitpicking after Republicans were celebrating their victory but\nUh when I heard a Mitch McConnell afterwards being asked a question about conservative justices he even use the term conservative justice and I said look we need to as conservatives we need to take that out of it it's not conservative versus political on the Supreme Court\nIt's originalist versus liberal that's what it is if you want to be accurate as to what is actually going on it's the liberals who wish to put on judges will pass legislation\nVersus not conservatives who wish to pass conservative legislation\nIt's originalist construction has also been they've been called but originally we want to stick to the original text of the constitution and say it's not our job to legislate now that may be a conservative idea\nBut saying liberal versus conservative justices gives you the indication that it's all political and it's not\nFrom the point of view of a conservative\nThe kind of judge we want is one who will protect the constitution not change it changing the constitution is up to a are changing the law or the constitution is up to the legislature or the constitutional amendment process mhm and it's that simple\nAnd we need to as conservatives uh\nUh we need to and libertarians we need to promote that that it is we the people who are elected representatives they need to be making the law\nAnd not abandoning the constitution and having a judge's become legislators\nAnd we haven't explained that it up and so when I hear even in the media on a consistent basis in once in a while I'll even split\nThe ah the was it the the the Thursday or the ... the Thursday or the friday when when Chuck Todd said you better not miss work tomorrow that had to be like what was\nThat right right around Labor Day yeah it was the friday heading into Labor Day when and and that was because you know Mueller's going to let the investigation nobody's even talking about Russian collusion no it's not on anybody's radar it seems like that was\nTen years ago and that's how fast the the cycle has has moved you know what is on people's minds and so when I woke up yesterday I started thinking what are Democrats thinking the issue is what's the issue that they can go after Trump out what's the issue that will even grab Democrats\nRight now to say oh yeah okay that's the issue and you and I talked about the fact that the un coming out and saying OK it's time for our annual we're doomed to update because of global warming\nAnd we're thinking of the Democrat's gonna jump on that they've been jumping on that since the beginning of the Obama administration that and raised on a consistent basis\nAnd so I was looking at your earlier and saying I'm waiting for the race baiting to start some time by the end of the week because it's been their old standbys is what they've always use now even though at the same time the American people have said they don't care yeah we don't believe those are the top issues we don't believe race relations\nOr the top issue we believe we get along with each other really well uh you folks in Washington may not and you people that belong to a certain groups or or you know or may not but for the most part we get along and global warming well you haven't made your case to the vast majority of America let me go get a burger\n... I ... I mean seriously that's words that but you know and we ... we actually stay to during the Obama administration I'll never forget where we said are they doing this on purpose\nBecause I actually think that if we don't talk about the issues of the day if we don't talk about the economy because remember the economy and never had three percent growth the entire time of the Obama administration and you and I would talk about this all the time saying there seems to be no interest in talking about making the economy better\nNo it wasn't even a story that was being discussed\nAnd and they just went back to global warming and and race\nSo I really find it interesting as to as we are now just a little under a month from uh from election time what's what's the Democrats issue what are they actually going to use besides impeachment if they think that's going to work which brings me to this article Wall Street journal Bobby Jindal\nFormer a former governor of of\nAh Louisiana two thousand two thousand six to eight Democrats try some self restraint now I I like Bobby Jindal but this may be a little bit delusional\n[laughter] it was a there was right [laughter] yeah ah it's\nNot certain the Democrats just want to read the parts of it because I actually started laughing during it or it's not certain but that's okay he's trying to be an optimist mhm I'm being a complete and total sitting here at this moment but I think justifiable\nI can justify it it's not certain the Democrats will retake the house but if they do they will likely ignore\nTheir leaders preferences and pushed to impeach President Trump or perhaps justice Kavanaugh\nAnd a swap with Clinton era of positions Democrats now lecture the nation that unseemly personal behavior makes the president unfit for office while Republicans and says his private morality has no impact on the his public duties\nThis is more a than a interesting irony in peach been would undoubtedly energize Mr Trump's base\nAnd make these voters even more loyal to them as it did with Bill Clinton\nDemocrats had an alternative\nThey can set aside the president of the Obama years when the party sought to an act the most extreme agenda it could pass and instead search for common ground with marginal Trump supporters\nDemocrats won't win over this most ardent Tea Party members they will win over ... Christians or other committed supporters but a humble are more open approach could attract some of his peripheral supporters and weaken the resolve\nSolve of his base Democrats can support gay marriage without forcing small business owners to violate the richest religious beliefs and participate in the wedding ceremonies\nDefend abortion without opposing the sorts of restrictions common in Europe including waiting periods and bans on mid term abortions fight global warming without making obsolete many Americans livelihoods and lifestyles\nExpand access to health care without eliminating private insurance protect minority rights without condemning law enforcement\nPromote immigration while protecting the borders value multiculturalism without removing all mention of God or the tradition of from the public square and an act modest gun control measures without stopping Americans from hunting and defending themselves\nHave you lost me now it would be lost and you know already on the ... yeah okay\nJust means bad not going to happen\nYeah I lost you win a while\nRight after we started laughing [laughter] idling [laughter] with all due respect to the governor no um you know a number one it's not going to happen no it isn't a [laughter] and not going to have a number two is also not going to happen and then it will never happen\nI'm no I'm\nWell it it can happen ... look we as we saw this after twenty sixteen we said this one Democrat because I find this fascinating I I find the self perplexed should that the Democrats go through ... you know of and they've gone through it and if you were election cycles where they say\nOkay we we've we've got to reevaluate we we\nHave to get outside of the Washington and here ... we we need to we need to go into the heartland and see how people are really thinking yeah and they really said that's twenty sixteen we have to seriously reevaluated when they went in the complete opposite direction\nLaid off and said yeah they've gone more insane now they'd gone more authoritarian they've gone more a\nDare I say using the F. word or with the fascists mindset out there while blaming the that they are the anti fascists that's the most interesting point yeah\nYeah um and and if that's not going that's not going to change or where it was a couple of weeks ago when we basically kind of wind it up what would drive the ... the Democrats I'm Sorry the the far left liberals those that are really I mean then they're leading the party now\nI mean I think after the uh capital confirmation process we can we can say without a doubt that as part of the mainstream process now\nUm but nonetheless what would bring them back\nWhat would bring them back and bring them too because you know the ... which is by the way the most insane part of um I mean we can we can giggle at at a governor Jindal's you know a appeal if you will\nIn the same way that we can discount Robert Redford a script and his message because I Would ask both of them before we talk about the same behavior of the left tell me what would drive them to come back from\nAs especially when they are they stopped and they can't get out of it is it just it's a never ending loop there into creating more victims\nBecause which ones are not the cause of it right this is this is what that's a great while yet read for once you believe that Trump is the cause of it from stop the cause of it he's the effect of it\nAnd and so tell me if you think that would change just to say for the sake of the argument I Know that Trump decided tomorrow to resign effective immediately and Mike Pence became president\nWe would have a beautiful whom by our world that's where I'd everywhere would go back where being normal we couldn't invite Michael Moore onto the show and we would have a love fest right\nUm well case it yes right right he's sitting in your lap not mine [laughter] um [laughter] ...\nSo we were going to be better chair I Want to make sure what are the only full but God was being there was Michael Moore phobic\nGo ahead yeah I don't know I'm saying is we're going to need better chairs\nSo and you can take that how you want I really don't care how you take it so here's a here's the [laughter]\nI don't I really really do\nWell our churches are ... well enough that simply said they don't have data they can handle the stress okay or not enjoying that\nThose which meant to go with that yeah oh yeah that's actually where I'm at ... ... it was an engineering so [laughter] that's that's what it was\nSo here's the question if case it\nBecame president tomorrow do think it would change you know it would not have John McCain were still alive and ran for president and one would've changed you know what they called John McCain would change yes he'd go back to being Hitler yes\nEight six six Ninety read I [noise]\nBug you read a review with a record ... tomorrow [noise]\nJoin the conversation using the shell row tell a
