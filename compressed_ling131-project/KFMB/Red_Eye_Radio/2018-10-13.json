California a mark Marty welcome Hi you're on running radio walk into the show\nYou guys great show as usual thanks like I had a\n... and I don't know that it's relevant but I think that if mark judge were to possibly a super slander a stock report or\nOther nutty whatever his name is uh uh I think that may do some I think I think it may slow them down a little bit in their efforts because I agree with you guys are going to continue to describe it\nUm but I think that if judge were super slander or level a\nHe's a private citizen yet because he's not on the same rules of capping off yep or anybody else in public office he's a private citizen who was\nWhen I brought it would slow them down I think that would give them food for food for thought\nYeah I mean you look at it and it seems like a Dr ... her attorneys are are looking for basically not pursue this any further\nUm maybe there's something there may be there they they've already heard from judge ... or ... or is lawyers but certainly at the very least we can say what we do know is factors that he would\nHave a case or is he willing to pursue that or not is the question but I'm a would be looking to protect his name I mean it would be something that I Would pursue because my name was was was made public\nA prove this with with the league and everything else ah that's and and who else would be responsible in that chain of events with the leaked to the media and all that I I think you could probably ... here's what's interesting\nYou the names were brought out as a result of the leak forward as far as we know she didn't leak it\nSo if that if that law or pursued we would likely find out who leaked it\nBecause what responsibility do they have in a case ... by ... by mark judge and or his lawyers whoever leaked to the media would also be partially responsible or for getting his\nName out there and that you could see I think part of that and you have an any case yeah that was that was him yes ... eliminate because it's likely to get because of the gang rape that yes you're right that's clear yes right\nRight right or the only possibility of ... you wouldn't want to put his good buddy or\nDo they already the wind is yeah yeah you got to her problems would want them to think that they're good at these shortages in spite of using his buddy to do this for spite and\nYeah well they you know it's it would be ... it it would definitely play out in terms of the spin on it it would play out uh in every up predictable and even some are unpredictable ways we can we can try and come to use our imagination to come up with things\nAnd and thank you a market for the call we appreciate it and and I think a fair point or question\nUh he definitely would have standing as you point out Gary and pointed out during this process\nUh you you know you're into the political arena when you accept the nomination or as the capital capital did\nAnd and so you would have to go out of your way to prove that malice uh but in this case of a mark judge a that wouldn't he wouldn't have that burden\nBut you you do wonder about you know I guess the future of claims of this these particular claims um and really the only one that that survived at all was Dr forge claim and and it it appears they do not want to pursue that any further so\nThat's why I and and I think you make a case that that his name was released because of the leak and so yeah he wasn't trying to link it to the ... a a media but in the oven any case yeah\nTo me that would even be a ... and and again I don't know who leaked it so I I don't know I'm just I'm On the doctor or the right I'm just using right that that as a possible exception here right uh but with the other case to me that's clear I mean it's\nGoing going after cab at all with an allegation like that that those things are made of politicians all the time right and there are public figures for the law used them differently yeah but if you're a private citizen you're dragged into it\nAnd you're being accused of a gang rape mhm spiking drinks you know like things like that or you just you can't say you just can't go out and print that right ... and say that about people right especially private citizens\nLet's go to Gary in sparks Nevada Gary urine rather Radio Welcome to the show\n[laughter] Hi how are you cut or got his um\nThe Republicans they came for complaining about all the things that the Democrats do but they never a press charges against anybody like for for perjury or Hillary Clinton are dying Feinstein and so on it's like telling a bank robber I'm complaining about it\nThough well I work I don't want an adult whoa whoa where's the perjury Heidi approved the perjury\n[noise] how do you prove their perjury prime well you know ... if you don't want to take that one guy and finds fang\nOkay well I Know how my ... well my point is legal point by point by what you alleged they should do so you're blowing out your first point you don't go after Ford so then who do you charge next than on if you're not going to charge for who's the next one\nOkay Dianne Feinstein live that way she has a spy a as a chauffeur\nWell I Believe that there should be an investigation do I believe\nThat yes of course right I I I Believe there should be investigation they are not so I Would agree\nWith you on that and I believe they have that in their promise their their ... I Believe they're promising that there will be an investigation they want to look into that\nBut they never make that charge very kind of Hillary Clinton's emails there's\n... that stock prices followed that wasn't Republicans fault no\nAnd I ... that was combing who clearly was politically driven and then that's something you couldn't control in that moment right\nWell do you expect they the Democrats just stopped doing any of\nThese now with I don't know what it is get them but what does this behavior get them ultimately in twenty sixteen mass of loss\nIt is but because of the reason Gary that they bring it up on Capitol Hill that somebody in elected office would bring these up these items up on Capitol Hill because\nWe set about uh you know if you go back to uh the email thing with a with Hillary or even back to lying about been God's the which was an intern of itself a crime although it should be but it isn't a you look and see what exactly what we've said\nIs that on the email specifically on the email a investigation and the whole no reasonable prosecutor would\nWould a prosecutor we said well it what matters here's the court of public opinion what you did and ultimately she lost in November or twenty sixteen and and thank you for the call it is not\nAlways that that and not that she's above the law or we believe they should have pursued that but I if given a choice having her in jail\nOr is not as great as not having her in the White House\nYou know here's here's the uh the the the point about four to ... maybe he was responding jury and sparks Nevada was responding to\nWhen we were talking to the last caller about a mark judge following a defamation of character lawsuit ... well when you when you go after a private citizen you have to at least have some type of evidence of this happened\nA he said she said all of a of a private citizen can get you into trouble but still might not go to the level of perjury perjury as you would have to prove you would have to have another witness stating she's lying about it sorry\nUh you know or or it was you know I you know I I don't I'm\nI'm trying to think of wins you know somebody has been hit with defamation of character right when it's something that is just so obvious can't be true mhm uh and and so my point was I I don't know\nThe doctor Ford situation is there in the realm of possibility she's committing perjury absolutely sure yeah ah any things in the room because we don't know we don't know anything about it because nobody can cooperate and so we don't know what she what she wants to it's proving it\nYes and and our point was is Eric just said that well there are costs to the Democrats lost twenty sixteen uh there there may be rep precautions here in this upcoming election where they don't\nAh when the seats that they should be winning a in a first term of a president in the first midterm afterwards that almost always the party in power loses seats ... that may not happen a Supreme Court justice was\nAh was confirmed mhm uh and United a\nPretty fractured Republican Party so it isn't always that your punishment is criminal sometimes the punishment is criminal as for Dianne Feinstein though a and Clinton as we explained Clinton wasn't the Republicans and\nIf you're angry that justice isn't always done all I can say is this from our point of view the most important things to get the truth out there yes that's what I Want I Want transparency I Want the truth I Can't do anything if the majority because one of the reasons that Hillary Clinton\nWas never charged is because there's a majority there's probably half of America even if they knew she was guilty would wander charged right sorry but that's just the way that it is part of the power comes from public opinion\n\nAnd it doesn't matter whether she committed a crime or not they don't want her prosecuted\nMhm and\nSo the best we can do is get out the truth and we know the truth about Hillary\nA worry we know I'm\n... for example Susan Rice sure if I'll be lap when you said she said you know that that she would like to ... she would consider running against Collins gives me you're on the line item on big ... no it wasn't a criminal offense but it was still line\nA terrorist attack that killed Americans and everyone in the United states knows its ally right\nEveryone in the United states you could take them and you could show them the law that Hillary Clinton broke right there you could read the law and and everybody would agreement that is what she did and they would still be half of America that said so what you should be able to get away with that can't do anything about it the best that we can hope for\nIn anything is that the truth is told and I don't know what's gonna happen in the FBI investigation right\nRight I don't know if it's going to show corruption and now in the inspector general hands Michael Horowitz you and I talked about this it's the one story that's been buried completely over the last two weeks ...\nIs that when Trump said okay we're you know we we we've got a couple of allies that don't want us to release some of this information and uh so we're going to give it to Michael I have an eddy we went that doesn't make ... we're going to get into like a horror which when my\nDaughter to my metabolism and they don't have to [laughter]\nWhatever you do give it to Michael Horowitz the inspector general you and I said to each other's was on the air when we went dead mhm is it doesn't make any sense why would they give it to the inspector general the department of justice if if they want to figure out how they can release it and and still you know keep some of it redacted they would go to oh wait a minute\nInspector general only deals with corruption ... improprieties fight oh\nYes and and that that story has been buried and analysis of that story's been buried by the mainstream media why would the president not released it immediately and give it to the inspector general of the department of justice because he deals with corruption\nAnd\nSo we don't know what's gonna happen there but get us the truth and if the American people if they get the truth and still decided to do the wrong thing that's on them and that's that\nThat's really what it comes down to is that uh we've been calling for transparency\nOn on all of it the whole Russians scandal thing we said multiple times ... regardless of where it falls politically as long as that is fully transparent\nIn the process the American people can decide up because we can't change what people do it in the past nobody can not even the people that did it\nAnd my question would be that if the Democrats took the house do they really really really want an investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is that what they really really want\nFrom three witnesses with no cooperation at all whose stories were slowly and sometimes rapidly falling apart because this is this would play out in the public over and over and over\nFor a very very long time eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nFor your goals eight six six months she read on the radio [noise]\n\nIf you have driven over one
