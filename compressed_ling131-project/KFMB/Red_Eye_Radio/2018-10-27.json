I was out here I was so low\nI remember going you know weeks on that and uh and I was so low and I was and so the ... the but this has been going on for a long long time if you think about it and I almost did this yesterday and talking\nAbout this McCain Kennedy said day might have a\nBetter chance than it did back then oh yeah given the makeup on on Capitol Hill that we have right now I mean\nIf you introduce that now I don't know if that's the case with this current president because I don't know that you would have the uh uh the the somebody on the left that would jump on board but I I think there was a much better chance that you would have support for it\nNot from conservatives so much but I think because of the makeup on Capitol Hill and there are fewer conservatives at least ... [laughter] and then you you might have a more support for it but the problem is is that no one's asking them what they what they're trying to promote\nIts purpose but over Thirteen Years but this has been a huge issue in huge issue because that's really what kick started this whole thing mhm oh and so it's been Thirteen Years and still the Democrats the Republicans have not or the media have not been able to get the Democrats to admit\nThis is the Democrat leadership and the Democrats in power in the party to admit that they want open borders\nThat's what they want and if they don't want it\nThen tell the American people what you will do what level of border enforcement will you passed as a piece of legislation and promised the American public you will uphold right that's a fair question to ask\nAre you for open borders right just bluntly asked that question and if the answer is well no then what level of enforcement\nBut thinking about Thirteen Years and you haven't been able to back a Democrat a major Democrat into the corner to make them either sweat or answer that question and then keep pounding them on that question as the opposition party over and over and over again\nBecause we need to know do they actually want comprehensive immigration reform of border enforcement or do they want to open borders we can come to any type of compromise if we don't know what they want right and do it didn't get it on eight six six Ninety ride I\n[noise] boy your goals said six six months he read Paul wrote a review [noise]\n\n\nMissed the show listen anywhere at any time on demand to catch up on Eric and Gary's topics of the day visit red eye radio show dot com and click on demand that's red eye radio show dot com\nCobra electronics is rather than for the fight against breast cancer by partnering with bright pink and traveled centers of America and Petro stopping center to bring you the twenty nine LCD bright pink CB radio this limited edition right then to\nThousands of buyers and sellers across the country who may\nHave that perfect track here looking for\nThat don't miss another issue of American tractor magazine to receive your free coffee treasure dot com and sign up [noise]\nEric hardly here for the St Christopher truckers relief on\nIf you could help a truck driver get back to work make their pile of bills less daunting give them one less worry wouldn't you\nEvery year thousands of truckers lose their jobs homes and more when a medical problem causes financial hardships but what's your donation to the same Christopher truckers relief fund you can help get them and their families back on the road donate today of\nTruckers fun ... that's ... responded dot org ... today at truckers bond dot org\nAmerica's finest Seventy five years the I'm seven KF MB Danny egos talk radio\nNews\nThe news on the hour and presented by liberty mutual insurance ...\nPiper after fourteen package bombs were intercepted over the course of a week the feds believe they've arrested the person responsible he's now with the Miami jail awaiting his first court appearance Monday here CBS in ... in plantation Florida we just went on the\nSurveillance footage captured the moment federal agents that awful loud blast to take down things or stay on in plantation Florida agency a cell phone signal let them outside to this auto zone where dozens of law enforcement agents surrounded him near his white van on Fiore works ... all the arrests go down\nHe had the look of okay well you know when I'm done I Surrender I'm\nY'all got me investigators say a trail of DNA evidence left on the packages steered them towards say are the bombs he allegedly sent word a prominent Democrats and people critical of President Trump but he says a recent rally I think\nI've been known to have you on another really voted out because you know the media's been extremely unfair to me and the Republican Party\nDefense secretary Jim Mattis says incidents like the killing of a Saudi journalist undermined Middle Eastern stability and that the U.S would take additional measures against whoever's responsible\nWith our collective interest in peace and unwavering respect for human rights in mind the murder of ... in a diplomatic facility much concern is all great from the\nSaudi foreign minister Adele al Jubeir with this response\nIssue has become fairly ...

I wouldn't mind taking it out to Eddie gossip just plays the Texas ... anyway and putting it on the track a couple of times but I mean what are you going to do with the money I'm at the point is is that I Would be so paranoid to all the time\nWith six hundred I mean it's simply having six hundred million in the bank\nIt would it would not be a bit disturbed there's there's nothing I'm\nI'm not saying I wouldn't want you know I [laughter] and I have a clear it would it would be a huge hassle\n... uh I like my life mhm I don't want to change mhm and I and I don't care what anybody says that kinda money changes your life I have a a set of changes the reaction that everybody has towards you as your\nLife I have a a friend who uh a friend or family member who are ... at one time was working for a a multibillion um\nIt is you know how we talk about the president sleeps four hours a day mhm\nAnd my family member told me that this person was the exact same way only because there's not enough time of the day we're talking about this with our own schedule and sleep the other day and how my schedule was very busy [laughter] not a multi billionaire although ... at least one listener things\nTalking about this with our own schedule and sleep the other day and how my schedule was very busy [laughter] not a multi billionaire although ... at least one listener things we are um but but the point was is there so much going on now this person earn their money they didn't win their money they earn their money\nUm but but still you've got so much going on managing your wealth is more than ... and I also have a fulltime job yes uh you know you hire somebody else to do it but there's the other problem I Can't trust anybody else to know I couldn't trust\nAnyone else to do that that would be the thing because you know people ... what would you do and I said ... I don't know I probably would I'd want to distance myself from the money in ... set up some kind of foundation ... you know and would I be able to do this because odds are if you win that kind of money you're not going to be able to keep your name private so this\n... it would be it would be hard to manage you can you can do that legally and in terms of you know claiming the prize but if you've got that kind of it's six hundred if all of a sudden you're worth six hundred million dollars someone's going to notice eventually\n... exactly the the word your life your life is going to change managing the money mhm 'cause I said you know I'd probably want to come up with some type of follow what I Do I don't even know what the foundation but\nThat means you got to run the foundation so this jobs gone well I don't want to run my in laws there are laws about\nReceiving the money away their laws about giving money to your it let's just say you wanted to take it you claim the prize but you want to take this and you want to go give that to your family members well there are tax laws if you just write them a check and you've got to pay the gift tax the giver has to pay the gift\nRight well my I guess my point would be it would be a full time job figuring out what to do even if not going to give it out in the way that's what I'm going to be a full time job is going to be a huge hassle yeah and it's like oh\nThis life I have is gone well I liked his life five right I don't know if like I said if I was in my twenties or thirties I'd probably be going yeah All right let's say let's have a grand old time but all of a sudden you get a little bit older like when I like what I'm doing yeah I don't want to change my life I like my life\nWell yeah but you're you're not as secure as you could be on that part of why I like my life I yeah I I don't you I I get to do challenging I get to do challenging things that I you know I I like everything that I get to do and so I'm\nI'm not saying that there wouldn't be a part of me that wouldn't be\nGreatly excited about that mhm oh yeah 'cause I don't know I Would love you know I think about it here's one of the worst one thing I think about that if I knew that this is one dumped off it goes through a mind but it's still a thought\nOh we're talking about is is that if I Want one point six billion\nBecause every day I mean I ... the average person out there and I still consider myself sort of average I don't\nYou and I think alike it's not like we don't even think we're on the radio we do a radio job but it's like no it's just like any other title oh we've we've ever done really I mean it's not I never think that outside of being and doing this I never really think I'm On the radio some when somebody comes up on the little today\nA little shocked we work in an older warehouse for those that don't know where you're I mean we really had a guy it's almost like we come to work in a warehouse that we just have the end of the show we grab our lunch pail isn't going to it that's what the feeling is is like that in the last time I work third shift this is the only time I work third shift\nA side of being a machinist and so the mentality sort of the same friends so I but the the the thought is and so there are still you know challenges that I think of every day and what to do here and there and you know a a just and financial decisions and everything else that become a part of your life everything that you're doing in your business\nAnd personal life well you've one point six billion\nAll that goes away and I always think to myself I don't know if I Want to get to the point where the only thing\nThat now is it in my ... because I bought him one point six billion the only thing I'm thinking about his death [laughter] right but I got all these other things but I can think about it basically keep that the thinking adept at a distance well all those challenges the problems are taken away and all of a sudden I'm going\nOh I've got all this money death [laughter] I was a you know I talked to one time about this uh there was a a guy and I I'm\nI'm blanking out on his name but he he developed the game and he sold it ah I I I don't know of five to look it up but anyway the guy sold his game or the company that you know that surrounded the game for two billion dollars\nAnd his take of that was a you know roughly\nLike one point eight so he became a billionaire you know overnight I obviously he was earning before that but then he talked about one night he went on it wasn't a rent just a series of tweets and he was talking about it was that this party and it was the first time I was in a room with other billionaires\nAnd I was talking to people that I had nothing in common with\nBut I did but then I talked to this girl who was there and she wasn't a billionaire so we talked to one girl who was a billionaire he's a single guy\nAnd he had nothing in common with her but here's the problem he talked with a girl who you know worked you know for a living had a job and was not a billionaire far from it he had nothing in common with her\nAnd it was what I'm not trying to cry I'm just I'm just saying it's a weird odd place to be in because I'm you know I'm not from money\nI'm new money but I don't fit in with these people and I don't fit in now with the people because you don't know what the motive is here's a here's the problem\nWith being famously wealth or like\nThe the the person in my family member works for you've got to put up I mean your security surrounding you all the time yeah that's the other than your famously wealthy so you have security detail we talked about this with the president the president has that security detail that\nIs is parallel to you know the types of security detail for you know maybe not necessarily the president in terms of the training but you know up in that level you know what I mean and so you're going to have to be very careful because there are people there are threats against you\nAll the time one of the that story that I read that you read that you mentioned earlier talked about the guy who won the big lottery ran was

I agree with President Obama one hundred percent uh you know we talked about\nThis earlier with the caravan are slowly moving across Mexico won't be here and time for the uh for for the election if if they ever a ... you know get to the border in any type of organized fashion at all if that ever happens they're stopping at ... in Mexico city that's going to take a few minutes\nUm but as we've said this is the time\nOf weeks before the election to take it to the Democrats to say this is the Democrats now to the Democrats still believe this this is the time to challenge the Democrat leadership and say you keep talking comprehensive immigration reform but you never tell us what you what\nI Believe and so to the American people that you want to open borders if you don't want to open borders well then come to the table and tell me specifically mhm\nWhat type of enforcement you will put on the border if you want to plan\nAnd we talked about the various plans everything from citizenship to amnesty which would be citizenship to legal status without being able to vote right\nIf you got bad than what level of border enforcement would you guarantee the American public please be public and tell me we are willing to keep the door open are you willing to talk or is it\nLike we all believe that your party is the party of open borders and if you are the party of open borders have the guts\nTo sell that to the American people or attempt to sell back to the American people that's what I think the president should say I mean he's already halfway there with this yeah you're now and and by the way you\nPeople or attempt to sell back to the American people that's what I think the president should say if he's already halfway there with this yeah you're now and and by the way you can you can get him you can get Feinstein how many more yeah hello seat right\nThat sounds really over the last Twenty years it sound exactly like Donald Trump does on illegal immigration right exactly why he does make the comparison hit the mark you've got the bully pulpit as you know the press pays attention to everything that you say hey is depressed fact checking to make sure that\nObama really set that are are they just laying low challenge the press go after the media right say this is what they why aren't you question them about why they think what they think now what they thought then why\nDon't you why why don't you ask them if they want to open border gets the same kind of positioning by the way I I Would do this during a debate and of course the president's not going to be debating only went for a couple of years but I Would do this if I'm a candidate I Would do this on a debate stage\nWith my opponent if I'm a Republican candidate I Would be doing this with uh with with any of them I Would be I Would say you don't want to I was into the moderator I'll you'll my time if I could just ask ask my opponent\nWhat they believe the level of unfortunate that the borders should be\nTell me what level of enforcement do you believe in closing the borders altogether sealing the borders\nAnd only letting a limited number of people end that's basically what we have now I mean some field we have porous borders but do you believe we should enforce the borders or not because there is no\nHalf measure in my opinion there is no half measure so either you believe in open borders or you don't even force brat\nIt's about time after Thirteen Years\nThirteen Years we were talking about a McCain Kennedy\nWhen that went down to defeat Thirteen Years ago and the Republicans still have not been able to back the Democrats into the corner to make them feel so uncomfortable to challenge them to dare them to tell the American people and don't stop it do you have the potential over the next week I Know the early voting is happening but there's still a lot of votes to still be counted\nTo make immigration illegal immigration the number one issue will get\nYep [noise] for on the tracks here's your forecast\nYou're not familiar with the term nor Easter it's what a good portion of the east coast calls a pretty significant storm with wins out of the north and east\nAnd that's what's moving up along the east coast today and steering those wins right into the shores of New York New Jersey on the Delmarva will see heavy rain and the region today from the Carolinas all the way up through well at least Long Island\nAnd then back into the Appalachians as far as near Columbus ohio a good part of the country though is drive from the Mississippi all the way over to the Rockies will see clear skies today for the northern central and southern plains including Texas\nAh I I don't know I I I I Want to make that if I go by I really don't like to spend a lot of times I may go as one of the scariest things that society knows\n... a conservative radio talk show host mhm\nI'm big enough I just show up like that and everybody can cost him he didn't show up I certainly did conservative radio talk show host now the people that are holding it are conservative very conservative so I think that if I Do show up and they don't live far from me so I may show up just to do

I don't have those on my bed I had a hello can build with candy it's much much\nAbout if that if ... if I didn't have that blood sugar sensitivity I'd be going out today I'd be going out yeah every Halloween and have a bag huge back I'd that pillow thing that's a good idea yeah\nYeah it's it's it's I remember one time when my son but he was right at the age where it was probably one of his last years so he was like twelve or Thirteen\nAnd he and his buddies or had a couple of them are we went out you know together and then I went with them and they we we came back and we went inside because they were it was warm it's really warm\nAs it often is on Halloween Night and they wanted to go and get something to drink and said yeah yeah yeah and so they set their pillow case was pillow cases down in the driveway we're only about halfway through\nAnd we came out and they were gone I mean we weren't in there really sixty seconds at the most we went in to get a bottle of water and we came out and they were gone\nAnd the boys were just so disappointed so was my son and two buddies I said All right enough of the games they said what I went in and I got king sized pillow cases\nAnd we didn't walk\nWe drove I said we're taking a car we're going to hit every porch light that is on until you guys\nTell me [laughter] I Hope those that are located and that night and it was one of the greatest nights ever and that's\nWhy we had been very much like mine's did way yes well I I was just you know of wondering now can you where is it is it okay to where Trump mask because remember the bottom masks or outnumbered the the the George W mass we're out during that\nTime well Ron resident does ...
