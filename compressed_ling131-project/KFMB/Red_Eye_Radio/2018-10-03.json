Bush\nAs they wanted to you know they wanted him to own it completely because everything was Bush's fault remember\nBut river rock rhinos rentals started before that but then ... rhinos became the swamp yes but rhinos from the swamp was\nWhen all we're really came to the fruition especially when McConnell in pain or they were saying we're tough enough and the budgets when you look at you know twenty twelve twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen the Republicans were furious and conservatives still had a solid hold\nOf the Republican Party that's gone when I was at that uh that that\nThe uh Paul Ryan proposed the balancing the budget and it would have taken until twenty thirty\nOh that that was a that would have been a freak out that well that right now it would have been the it was the the summer of the the whole camp it was the summer when\nYou know of of ah twenty ... well okay it was the summer spring southern only get so it was before this one and two of election but yeah All right so you have that scenario and he was called a radical you know for wanting to balance the budget by twenty thirty right\nI mean that was oh no no no that's that's unacceptable now we give the president credit or in fact I I think that falls on his shoulders the credit for getting the corporate tax rate down to Twenty one because\nYou and I thought that was never going to have right based on the rhinos on Capitol Hill and the fact that they couldn't get it\nDone right but but that tax cuts have never been the it's always been the spending rhino when the swamp had was always directed at the out of control spending in Washington\nNot necessarily the belief in tax cuts that was really I'm In my opinion drove the anger and created the rhino when the swamps the spending the spending ... from the the campaigning and twenty six theme\nFor ... no ... even earlier than that remember you know you and I sitting here late at night when painter came out and they were\nTrying to shut down the government uh uh uh uh again in the shot down the shutdowns have never been about tax cuts the shutdowns have been about spending and and when the Republicans wouldn't stand up to the Democrats you're right they were held rhinos recalled the swamp Trump was coming in to get rid of the swamp gas stop the spending to stop ... and even\nGoing out is or the or the school lunch program you know and the rhinos back then going oh no we can't cut anything\n... and so when you're that goes back he's so much for when you got twenty Fifteen\nAnd you know and and a ... a banner was leaving and wind was coming in their ... didn't like messy so he went to work for a tobacco company right and so Ryan came in and and ... remember that but the thing was that everybody expected Ryan Republicans\n... maybe it was unfair but it was what they expected of Brian was to redo the budget deal and when he said nope what's been done has done he\nWas automatically targeting oh yeah people were furious because ... they wanted him out of the speaker of these are the supporters of of the the the president back then Yuri is they wanted him out\nTrump's gotta Khamenei has got to clear the rhinos out the swap out we've got to cut spending liquor we are today and so there's been a huge evolution of the Republican Party\nIn in just a you know roughly a three year some\nHalfway well remember we go back to twenty twelve why was Paul Ryan brought onto the Romney ticket for conservative street cred remember if the concern with Romney was that he was too much of a moderate and\nIt was our final question to ah the light of Andrew Breitbart\nYou know why should if if he's the nominee 'cause it was it was still early but if but if Romney's the nominee and it it looked at that point potentially he was going to you know that I think it it was pretty obvious by that point\nBut he was going to become the nominee but if he is why why should you back on him and his answer basically was ... because ... which by weight rings so true right now does today and thank you Andrew Breitbart for those ...\nIt's ugly which go because Scott ... which by weight rings so true right now does today and thank you Andrew Breitbart for those words\nBut I think it's important but yeah it's I mean look at history and and see what why anyone swamp was about it wasn't about tax cuts was everything under ... being a rhino and being a but now it's changed mhm\nBut back three years ago yeah swamp of the state now but yeah a swamp as deep state a swamp is what's going on right down the Senate Judiciary committee with the Democrats yeah it's sort of been moved over ... nobody's viewing McConnell right now\nAs part of the swamp well I don't think nobody out he was a Republican leadership right as part of the swap if they had done if they had spent and and agreed to a budget that they did this year and last year\n[laughter] three years ago\nThese are Trump supporters would have been absolutely up at arm's these guys gotta go not a peep right that shows you the evolution it's look I'm not making a judgment here this is just an observation of where the Republican Party has gone you know or\nYou know were against the spending but this is not about opinion I'm not criticizing this is just the analysis of what those terms meant back three years ago\nAnd the fact that the definition has evolved completely inside the Republican Party inside the Republican mindset and this is the Republican voter\nI don't necessarily blame those in Congress and even the president\nYou know when they talked about you were going to we're going to ... we're going to cut as to where they are today because that's simply reflecting where the Republican Party where the rank and file voter has gas\nIf there were pressure at their pressure right now on spending on Obamacare and all of it it would have been done all that would have been done it would have been a priority\nAs the president's not wrong for ... focusing on national security and and border control but it's part of the again where's the mindset of the voter that's the question what mindset of the voters that now we don't really want all of Obamacare to go away\nWe just want the penalty to go away and we said litter the but look look at the polling from five years ago\nA until they were discussing it last year and you could see the I mean you could see the difference overwhelming yeah they were against Obamacare and then when it came to getting rid of Obamacare was the we need to get rid of the taxes and the mandates and let the benefits we like yes\nWell as long as as long as you're there you're never going to control spending ... ever for and you're not going to control debt and\nThat's where the mindset of the country is right now how you respond as a politician to that to do the right thing and be fiscally responsible I don't think it's possible right now no\nBecause there was no bad there's no ... there is a small core as to what do we identify a senator and a half [laughter] yeah right that might be concerned about it\nAnd maybe twenty to thirty Republicans in Congress outside of that you you there's no base to even start from

federal emergency management agency ... and experts say the presidential alert will not be Trump's personal megaphone somewhere [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] that they are a lot of it they argue\nThey are arguing oh they're ... yeah it's a necessary twenty first century update to the emergency alert system that has for decades allow the president to authorize broadcast on every television and radio in the country\nAnd an event of a national emergency so it to Eighteen or this afternoon ... will send out the first message testing\nThe new nationwide presidential level wireless emergency alert it will go to every smartphone\nIn America that is turned on and within range of a cell tower there is no opt out originally scheduled for September twentieth\nThe test was rescheduled to today due to\nHurricane Florence ...\nThe message to smart phones will be followed by an emergency alert system message broadcast and every TV and radio\nAt ... pm eastern time\nIt will feature a voice that says this is a test of the emergency the national emergency alert system the system was developed\nBy broadcast and cable operators and voluntary cooperation with the federal emergency management agency and the Federal Communications commission and local authorities to keep you informed in the event of an emergency ... it's about an actual emergency and official message would have been followed a the tone alert you heard at the start of the message similar wireless emergency alert test message\nThat they write Amazon has developed ... and their warehouses for shipping so there's a lot of automation going on in those warehouses where you know well why would I pay someone to you know do this part of it when I could do that automated it would be more efficient it would last her as the people can do other\nJob as as we said with the you know the on the uh the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada mhm uh by the president coming in and and and stating\nOr that there has to be more American or should be more North American materials are in these in all the vehicles and all the three countries and setting labor standards and some wages in Mexico what you're doing is you're going to be tried you know the lower\nUh the the the the lower worker and expect to see a ton more automation coming to Mexico and the United states lowers your workers will be again right I Love lower overlooked lower skilled workers in the United states and Mexico will be overlooked\nAnd they're going to be looking to do whatever they possibly can because fewer cars will be sold because the price of cars because of the new trade deal will be going up in the United states Mexico and Canada and that that's not the only worry the other worry 'cause remember what the president said one of the president's ... main goal we talking about this yesterday\nWas to have companies in the United states producing it here and selling it elsewhere well by doing what he did you're going to get the opposite right\nThere's going to be less of a chance of America being able to sell make cars here and sell them elsewhere and because of all the rules and regulations we have put on cars in all of North America and Canada and I have to say North America and then say\nCanada Mexico and not and the United states because they have changed North America to that in the actual name of it and and so\nKnow we discussed it a yesterday I ... the wall Street Journal and others you don't have that discussion and say look you're actually going to hurt car production in the United states you're going to hurt lower skilled jobs especially in Mexico or there's something going to say fine you're gone automation\nYou know automation a of that comes in Tempe comes into this particular point and in the United states to and you're still not going to be able to\nYou're still not going to be able to defeat all the cost of the regulation from government\nIn the new trade deal which means what there's less of a chance we can build automobiles here and sell them overseas which is exactly what the president wanted and now he's implemented a program that does exactly the opposite of what he claimed he wanted to begin with ... that's the frustrating part in\nIt and keep in mind and two thousand eight when the domestic auto makers were bleeding cash\nTheir their foreign arms\nTheir foreign business was what was keeping them alive you you've you've now encouraged the foreign arms to say okay we're going to make them all over here ...\nAnd that was one of the president's number one complaints and so we implement something that will have the opposite effect ... based on economics which is how people respond to incentive and disincentive ... not my opinion how people respond yeah for eight six

[laughter] well the alcohol keeps us what I said the other night nearly one hundred percent of people who go to bars especially at night go home and go to sleep\nI'm not sure maybe I don't think so but yeah I think an investigation should be done right\nSo that sixty five percent of American voters favor a that an investigation where we are right now\nThe FBI report could be released only to the Senate it will not be made public unless it's late ah [laughter] yeah excuse me it won't be made public until it leaks\nAnd then liberals will be screaming for transparency\nThe first time they've screamed transparency ah regarding the FBI and oh I don't know roughly I'm just taking a gas the last couple of years or so\n[noise]\nAh ... you know it's interesting that seems like a after a two years Americans are paying attention to probably do the Russian investigation to sixty five percent of Americans mold\nA a you know believe that the investigation or you know into the FBI and department of justice or to see how the investigation started mhm uh is uh is warranted hey maybe there's a couple of Democrats and they're like we said they believed that Trump committed collusion\nAnd they want to find out and I ... and they want me to release it to ... to ... he committed maybe there's a couple of people in there that actually believe that well I mean if you look at the number I mean that would go\nA you know beyond that uh that typical party line number of just ... you know of the people in the center being roughly wanting a the independence and then Republicans being the other forty so that goes to sixty five which means there's likely a ... a few Democrats are liberals\nMixed in that and who knows why they want it but yeah maybe they think that\nIt's going to show that he's guilty but we but we've been saying this doesn't matter who's guilty of what what was done was done so somebody needs to be brought to justice there needs to be justice in this case but there can't be without transparent\nAnd by the way we pointed out again today because we haven't been able to uh we talked about it earlier because we received an email we talked about it we believe it was early last week\nAnd and this is the because we've been getting some questions say what happened to the whole Pfizer warrant a application and and and those Twenty one pages we're getting we're getting feedback from our listeners saying hey just disappeared for instance there's going to declassify to disappear and what happened nobody's talking about the story\nRight well we did a a early last week when we said because we were sitting here on the air and the Kavanaugh saying was biggest that point and we finally are guys just started talking about casually\nOn the air and saying I mean what the world why would you send it to the inspector general\nYou know get it because what what what they're saying is okay ah there there may be some sensitive things are in here we have some of our allies or we're going to release it ah but ah we're\nA ... we have so much action for our allies and we're going to send it the inspector general to go through this thing uh uh uh to go through the saying an expedited way\nWe went inspector general when he was elected general has nothing to do with whether you're release something because it's sensitive top secret material that would be your director of national intelligence but that might be you might get advice from Mike Pompeo because it's a former CIA director and talking about OK what our ally subject to which we heard was\nWas a Great Britain and an information on Christopher Steele that they didn't want released but we still started thinking to ourselves\nWait a minute why would it go to the inspector general inspector general we don't understand this doesn't make any sense he only investigates corruption oh\nYeah so in the un redacted version they have found information that they wish to give to the inspector general of the United states whose ... of ... the inspector general of the department of justice and whose job is\nJob is to find corruption and the abuses in the department\nOf justice because you look at that Ariel magic that the okay so the president's reviewing that certainly\nUh you have Kelly in the room with him and then a advising as chief of staff where do you go with this I could see General Kelly look ... and the president clearly looking at this going okay\nIf this is this massive abuse of power under the a ... in the Obama administration if that is the case if we if we're seeing what we we think we see here\nThan this actually will require Horwitz the inspector general to be involved I mean that's going to happen anyway right yes but\nYou take the politics out of it\nBecause you let the I. G. do all the investigation on it\nTell us what happened here\nBecause the hygiene is going to have access to records keep in mind what it was like for Republicans on oversight committees and really the White House White House has been calling you know the echoing a the the uh the the ... and and the death of a new noses of the world\nAnd calling for the release of those documents by the FBI well guess what the G doesn't have to call for that that gee has access to it directly yep so the I. G. takes this and the president because of the president comes out and says hey we we recognize abuse here we see this based on this\nUh on redacted material now from the Justice Department will that instantly becomes political especially with this president while the president has that authority to come out and announced that clearly and has the authority to declassify that that's not the issue\nYou take the politics part of it away and you also expedite the process of not just looking at these documents\nBut the I. G. has access to everything in the department of justice and any kind of trail on devices and everything else that the president would ... ... ... it would it would take a million years for the president's call for that and for that to to be handed over\nAnd you take away from Adam Schiff the accusation that you're selectively yeah just declassified part of it right because when you give it to the inspector general he's going to cover that part of it okay what are you a context of everything that you have released let's expand the investigation and all of a sudden\nEverybody went quiet and the interesting thing is we talked about uh uh that you know Devin Nunes has initially was asked about what's going on here I mean they they could have done this thing and why give it to the inspector general and then he's gone quiet and everybody has gone quiet on this you hear nothing\nRight\nAnd the media is not covering it really the mainstream media I've even seen one story in the mainstream media about why did they give it to the inspector general\nWhy is the inspector general looking at all this they only have only looks at corruption\nBut that's what he's still he's looking for corruption in the department of justice they redacted this and all of a sudden they don't release it and it goes to the inspector general well did they find out that it's that the the redacted part is things that the inspector general is actually been looking at right now right\nAnd so it goes to it goes to either help assist in the investigation or the fact is he's got all this material has looked at it already\nAnd it's part of the when you talk about Russia probe Trump didn't say what Russia probe right\nWhich one which one because I read it to a Russian pro which Russia probe we\nInitially thought you know because because I I'm On the one time they said well mothers and but this this winter for Mueller's investigation right but on the tweets that Russian probe right and I went oh that must have been Mueller investigation that [laughter] right might not be not it may not be the investigation that they're talking about\nYou did well my mother said Russian probe I'm like whoa now look at the pattern of\nBehavior in the in the entire history of this this whole thing starting in the beginning of twenty Seventeen right now what was that pattern of behavior leaks to the media how many of those leaks favored Trump ... almost or maybe exactly zero zero\nSo you have this situation there are people on Capitol Hill and in the Justice Department that are not obviously not Trump on Trump's side\nIf if this on redacted classified material\nHad damaging\nInformation about Trump wouldn't we at least start hearing those types of rumors the sources say it's very damaging on Trump and if that were the case but he also turn it over to the inspector general if it were\nBecause it wouldn't serve him politically Idaho's not required to turn it over to the ...\nRight but I don't think this I don't think any of this has any information that Trump was involved in this was all the FBI and the department of\nJust I Know but what I'm saying is it would be damaging to Trump that they were finding something on him that I'll tell you okay then by then it would actually want to go show was legit right that is going to go OK okay right that it is that the whole thing was legitimate\nEric ... a year for the sink Christopher truckers relief fund\nIf you could help a truck driver get back to work make their pile of bills less daunting give them one less worry wouldn't

all audio or video recordings produced\nDuring the course of the polygraph examination of Dr Ford and all written and the audio visual or any other documentation of talking to any other reporter or anyone else at any media organization\nWell here's my question to on asking for the materials that Grassley asked for by the way on the the video or audio related to or or of the process of the lie detector test [noise]\nHe's asked for that before my question is if the Senate committee officially asks\nHer for that because that really was that was presented as evidence\nExcept for they didn't get to scrutinize the\nMethodology of it it was just the results right the results being presented as\nPart of the evidence will now that she has testified in front of the Senate because at first Grassley asked before she testified but is there just the Senate have the power to subpoena\nThose those are\nDocuments that information I mean it's a binding legally I guess my question now that she's testified because that's where the official claim is made in regards to the Senate committee in consideration\nIn consideration for Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court justice so would that not be part of the legal process\nHer lawyers legally bound to turn that over I don't know I I didn't see anybody right it that way I'm just asking a question but I Would think because it's part of the process and they presented\nThe results as part of the evidence than they would be compelled\nTo turn that information over\nSo I don't know and I did the same point I don't know that I don't I don't yeah I don't know that either\nI don't do it though because it's different before she testified\nAnd that's the first time you've got four I'm just talking about just the the lie detector test right uh the audio or video any any audio or video related to it um because as as they as she officially basically ... banned under oath she testified in use\nThat as part of the evidence he's still requesting it hasn't gotten and hasn't gotten that I Wonder if they're just delaying or you know if they believe that they lay long enough that the vote will get through this whole thing goes away I don't know that they're legally compelled to or not I'm not sure I'm just asking the question eight six six Ninety red eye\nBarry what's a high profile egg issue connected to U.S Mexican and Canadian

Fox dot org slash pack [noise]\nRadio eight six six Ninety\nOr a red eyes so it's good that we're we're in for a couple of really interesting days I'll tell you this do I I I think that the if the FBI background check comes in and there is nothing new right\nIt's all the same or if it even a throws more suspicion at Dr Ford\nDr Ford's testimony a at that point you have a vote this weekend and you move on from it now will they continue the investigation to find son I think they should as to whether she liked it because that's about Senate rules incentive protocol\nSo I I Believe that that will go on a will they uh you know if if they believe they could get a or a doctor forward on perjury or suspect that they could if they investigated more will they continue that\nI don't know I I Would doubt it I think that if they get if they get the vote and he is you know they get the vote and he's in he's confirmed I think that's the end of it because to me I think that Republicans we view that as the the victory\nFor on the tracks here's your forecast\nIt may not sound like much that an area could get six inches of rainfall and be under flash flood watches and warnings but that's what we have over the next couple of days\nIn effect for multiple states including California Arizona Nevada Utah Colorado and Idaho where even six to ten inches of rain is enough to dislodge Sandy soil rocks and tree limbs and flood dry creek pets\nAll due to the remains from tropical storm Rosa\nYou'll need the wipers heavy rain on I've forty I tend I Seventeen from Phoenix up to forty\nA justice Americans look at Americans believe in due process that was the one call we got today didn't even talk about anything well here's unprofessional because of the way that he acted which is again was the talking point by we and as we reminded the color he's about two or three days past that talking point which really died\nA couple of days ago that talked they moved on from that talking point to something else but\nReally that's it and that's how we get as anybody knows what you accuse me\n\nBecause you think about it the accusation\nActually as has been accent expanded because ... not just attempted assault but because she claim or that or I Can't think of the other man's name I'm\nMark judge was there that no that's almost an attempt to gang rape isn't it right and then the game right Alex ... you know allegations came along so you sit there and you see a a cabin on as we talked about he was angry yeah you'd be angry too far shouldn't be oh you're in a job interview at found a job interview\nNo job interview was not when people are testifying under oath a job interview was not when you had senators in the in the Judiciary Committee looking at you and saying I Believe her which means they're accusing view\nOf sexual assault on an allegation alone\nThat's a personal attack on you as an individual but still that's all they have boiled but it was on professional that cause you're running out of any type\nOf argument to defend the person that you were hoping\nCould ensure that Kevin on never served on the Supreme Court of the United states we know what it's about we know what is what it's always been about I just wonder what happens if you get to the point where\nAre we know I mean after the ... and I don't know is the FBI 'cause we we asked you know where's the FBI going with this background check are they going to talk to Ford's old boyfriend and for Jordan old boyfriend identified a a Ford's a girl friend\nIdentified her by name a ... as saying she told this woman I'll help you with ... and show you how when I'll help you with\nA ... a how to beat a lie detector test to both they can find that woman and I said earlier she's alive the reason I said that as she can only be a witness who she's alive\nBut does she live and they find her and she's willing to testify\nAnd she says yeah I mean under oath yet she\nHelped me do it you've got a perjury charge everything falls apart it's already all of these cases are falling ... every day another layer is being peeled from these allegations against Kavanaugh I think right now and again\nYou know I I don't know the answer the question I asked earlier about her lawyers being compelled to to uh to forward that information and materials that\nAre Chuck Grassley a cold for buck assume that's not the case and they're not legally compelled to do so even still they would resist doing it\nUh I think they're going to resist wrong whether they are legally compelled compelled or not but the they're likely doing that why well because\nWell because if if she's telling the truth during the lie detector test which they say I mean that's the whole point of life is Tucker test is that you passed it\nExcept there were different questions\nIf they asked a different question and she answered that question truthfully she would pass a\nVideo and audio the methodology of that test is important\nAnd so if you use that as part of the proof to cooperate that it did happen yet you were telling other people because it doesn't cooperate the crime no it just it it just and we can't even get to the point\nOf her the ... the the what she says there's cooperation that she had been talking about this but she won't even let that evidence to be seen all that evidence be seen which is\nSorry the therapist knows you brought it up you use that as evidence yet so you've been talking about it like you said you said certain things but you haven't released\nEverything that the therapist has salary when you make the accusation and you say this is what backs up not a crime because you have nothing to cooperate the crime so you're you came in with your lawyers as the secondary\nA point you were going to make well maybe you know where that hoping that the witnesses might cooperate you and they didn't\nSo your second point was but I've been talking about it for years and that should give me credibility and you won't release that\nEvidence to the people who are the judges in this case mhm well then you lose even more credibility and that's why when they say she's credible\nWhen the members of the Democrats' Senate ... Judiciary Committee say she's credible or you can't make that case because on every single instance when you want to get to the credibility by getting more evidence that she actually has her lawyers refused to hand it over\nBecause if she is telling the truth and has been all along why would you refused to hand it over in fact why would you not voluntarily handed over without being asked\nBecause here's the proof here's everything you need to know here are my notes are here the therapist notes here are here is the audio\nAnd or video from the lie detector test you would be out to prove that this happened isn't she out to prove it happened\nYeah well you you're going to hand over everything voluntarily why with her lawyers not encourage her to do that listen Dr Ford this is going to vindicate you this is going to show why would you not be doing that\nOr at least it sets a at least it sets a pat\nSummit's evidence they have right it's it's the most evidence that you had that you even been talking about it yes and you decided to use you and your lawyers decided to use that as evidence yet you won't present all of the evidence it helps to build your case but it doesn't work that way right you're right we're case to begin with that would give you a little\nPath to go down and you're saying no sorry you can't have that I mean\nYou would have you would want to provide everything that was within your control to provide\nWhat the other people say in terms of people corroborating her story or or or or not that's on them you can't can you can't compel them to a testify or you can't compel them\nDoctor for can't her lawyers can compel them to talk to the FBI or any of that\nFor what they can do what is in within their control is\nTurning over every piece of evidence that you have in your control and why would you not do that that helps to build your case right Gary doesn't prove anything\nBut if your doctor forced position you're looking to be vindicated and show that this happened because you're being criticized and your credibility has been criticized\nAll along the way you have not proven your case\nYou would want to turn that over the if you're telling the truth you would want to turn over everything that you have it's everything within your power and that's it that's it's all you have but it would be your your best attempt at being believed here\nI I I really believe that uh that I well I think if I was a betting man that the odds that the reason that\nFord's lawyers want her to talk to the FBI again\nIs because she's going to remember people more witnesses here and I think that we're mirrors to because we're ... said well we\nDirected the FBI to more with this is out there because the whole point is to extend yes yeah even in light of witnesses okay right we can do it while you have to talk to those because of the be all come back and say well\nWe had ... let's say they come back friday with a limitation we couldn't find these people will then we can vote on it until we find all these people to find out because they claimed that I have additional witnesses\nAnd the whole thing is just keep extending this week in and week out or get one lady\nWho said on Sunday night on ... on sixty minutes forget what they said about we think this is fair the week you know the the FBI or what they call the investigation\nIs the one week we believe is fair yeah I'd I don't expect that position to hold if indeed you start you it comes back and it does not a show anything different than what we already know\nRight but I Do think that that's what's going on is they want you know there why risk because the remembers his lawyer well we wanted them to some new witnesses out there and some new people to talk to and I bet you that's why for lawyers want her to talk oh there are I just remembered more witnesses to this whole thing this ... and then you have to start the investigation over again\nAnd then while the FBI needs to work on this another week and investigate these people or do a background check on these people to and you just keep extending it looked I Do not think that the goalposts at all have been embedded into any type of concrete that is going to settle in the next week right\n\nYeah I I just don't think we're going to say anything or change nothing is going to be ...\nEight six six Ninety red eye what's the difference between standard number two diesel and premium fuel rods Justin is director of product management for cynics the makers of ... wrote master ... premium diesel fuel and he fills us in", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "03"}
