know\nUh when Rand Paul's I'm afraid somebody's gonna get murdered though we're not afraid or by going to get married but I understand that it could very well happen that they've already tried it and you see yesterday a candidate school out campaigning one was not to the floor yesterday the that's sort of stuff shouldn't even happen\nThat shouldn't even be happening and I wonder we're with the campaign workers you've got somebody that you got to you and your team out there and somebody just cold ... who's personnel on the floor so they should carry that other person out of there\nThat other person should've been on a gurney\n... to ... somebody got to beat them down\nNow they're not that kind of misunderstanding because their parent is not an American citizen they weren't\nUnder they don't have to make the other has to be\nI well I don't argue that you may be right but my understanding is if their child is born here and that's why they're called an anchor baby and those anchor babies are American citizens\nWell that's a lefty a propaganda that once you to think that way that the ... the parent has to be on the sovereignty of the American government\nAnd just to give you another example or for the American ... says saying does analytics name any decade in another country and has children their children aren't automatically ... they have to have some kind of Lanka residents say in the United states before they hand yet\nBut that's not true Frank or babies they don't have to they don't have to the parents don't have to have a ... as you say in a slam the citizens of sovereignty\nAnd ... and the colors can let us know if we're wrong but that's not my understanding that if if they're born here and that's why you see the people come here all the time we talked about that a pregnancy in the hospital and people come here from other countries and tried to time and so the baby can be born here\nI if I'm wrong call me at eight six six Ninety red Iowa I Want to know I don't want to say something is incorrect\nLet's go to\nLet's go to rich in Charleston South Carolina richer on with mark\nMark good grew on a day job and I don't say Phil and because we had a concept when I was in the in the navy you're sitting in the chair you're the commanding officer you are doing a great job okay I think um Yes sir Yes sir great great job like I said I'm On my point is this here's here's the thing\nWith the purest definition of terrorism as I understand it\nTerrorism relies on the the fear of the use or the fear of the threat of force of violence towards and intimidation to subdue the opinion ... abuse the will of the people that are directed at so\nI think it would be safe to say that the left is by and large are domestic terrorists\n\nThat would be something I Would think that that's that's that's where I'd go with that I mean if if I mean look there they're shooting at the ballpark shooting up Steve ... nice though you know I mean the by the grace of God the man still alive today\nOkay um you just you just had a conversation with a gentleman a couple of callers ago and I I think you might call me correct me if I'm wrong I don't want to put words in your mouth you might become you're you're a little bit worried about what happens if we do when\nThe house and the Senate by a large enough margin what are they going to do now\nMhm so you know I Hope that people are going to vote the way they see the facts rather than not vote a certain way because of the fear of intimidation oh gosh well and the anti for people you can't even drive down the street in Portland, Oregon without having your car ravaged\nYeah no no I did say by the way I I did say I'll take my chance of winning I'd rather wind and see what happens I'm not going to lose and be intimidated by them\nOh okay okay then I stand corrected Yes sir Yes sir so yeah I mean and and that so I mean look the whole thing with a with the Charlie Hebdo shootings or Europe Europe is going to be gone and in ... years but because they're scared to death to to do anything about the problems that they'd rather I mean look at London for God's sake\nWell and later in life\nThey're scared to death to to do anything about the problems that they'd rather I mean look at London for God's sake\nWell and let her know I've had\nPeople on the air yeah I've had people on

the first place they welcomed in huge numbers Angela Merkel was her mind\nOh hey Angela Merkel and she I mean but she she might very well be the most effective weapon deployed against the Germans since they attack since America got involved in World War two\nAnd I and and the opposite of a fall and the thing with with regards to the President Obama he's been the most effective weapon deployed

William civic\nPresented by west automotive Bruce October twenty Thirty years ago from forming are listening to when I Am Seventy six\n[noise]\nRadio and you can call in with your questions from my special guests over Norquist presidents print not presidents he only wants to be one percent of Americans for tax reform\nAnd you can reach them at eight six six Ninety red eye if you have any tax questions and we'll leave that in a but I wanted to ask you what did you think of the tax cuts passed by Congress and the president\nWas a really helpful for ... uh what do things that happened was during the Reagan years we reduced marginal tax rates cookie individuals top rate was Seventy percent ... percent during World War two\nA Kennedy took it from Nineteen Seventy Reagan took it from seven eight to twenty eight [noise] unfortunately Bush and Clinton and Obama\nRaised it back up towards south or the forty percent and uh so the individual level we began to take the rates down a little bit but business taxes is where the United states was where the line with the rest of the world or the rest of the world started experimenting with lower\nBusiness taxes low or corporate income taxes when we took our individual rights down and did very well economic quite a lot of Eastern European countries after they left the Soviet Union their individual rights like Fifteen Percent\nHungry it's business tax nine percent we're at three o'clock we had the highest business taxes in the world and then we sat around going how can we can compete you know with China and Germany and stuff like that and Ireland to Ireland's business taxes twelve and a half percent\nA week what thirty thirty five plus an average of ... percent by state and local governments so really thirty nine on average and uh the Republicans took that down to Twenty one\nAnd it made us more competitive on the tax credit than most of the country's law yeah European countries about twenty five or ten points better than what we used to be you know we're at thirty five they were twenty five and they would be that's when they said let's say\nHave a million dollars I don't think there's like invested ... million dollars what do I put it she invested I hate those jokes thirty five percent of every damn it if I put it in Germany it only takes ... ... ... ah and we ship to that yeah and we have seen a massive\nA diversion of a for a direct investment [noise] out of your it did I get\nA for starters that was a a five hundred billion dollars half a trillion dollars in the last six months which was arranged by American companies over seats and we used to have a lot\nThere's half a trillion dollars in the last six months which was arranged by American companies over seats\nAnd we used to have a lot until the Republican tax reform\nPunished you you've brought laid back that states could leftovers change there's maybe three trillion dollars that the left over Shays I'm partly because largely because our tax college she said we will hurt you if you want to bring the money back and if you don't bring it back that's okay\nAh show three trillion stock overseas because of our tax policy\nAnd we said you know we're not doing that anymore if you earn money in states with taxes but if you're in print French it will take some and then we're going to bring up the whole the America good they'll ... they'll probably no penalty for bringing like back it how 'bout that ad that we've seen a tremendous again half a\nTrillion dollars by the end and back last six months and an apple they said look we have two hundred and Ninety billion dollars or earnings overseas they ... billion right back\nAnd said you know what because it's no longer had allies to boot buddy from London to New York or tax list um\nWe've read all back now it's all coming back but right now where they live in London back because it doesn't matter in terms of our access to capital whether it's in London or in Arkansas\nUh whereas before it did show that money might as well are ready to be back but\nWe've seen a half to try and come back a lead it and we'll see more as a as we move forward\nAdded that guy's overseas you know German and Dutch people and Brazilians\nMaking decisions are shelling that money to the United states rather overseas is really irritating your pets because we're much more competitive than we used to be and it's been a big help\n[noise] yeah no I can see why is it just seems so obvious all these things seem so obvious to me I have a couple of more questions and we're going to get some of the callers questions for you also but right now we're going to take her get our national forecast for um detracts\nAn area of low pressure will be moving out of Canada into the great lake region today and that'll provide some showers for Chicago at least for the early morning hours\nDetroit so you can look for ... hours throughout the day and then in the region and in fact Monday for the entire eastern half of the U.S we'll look to be rained free but today a few more spots of showers mainly in the Ohio River valley that will extend it into the mid Atlantic region\nAnd again for Texas but the good news there is showers won't be wrapping up today mainly for central and north central Texas we're going to get about another inch of rain today\nI not only agree with that I wrote that in the paper like freshman year at Harvard and they like foreign to me that they said you know this does come from a conversation I had with the IRS I\nCalled my phone and said they did if you didn't withhold taxes out of their paycheck every two weeks\n... once a month you said by the check like the electric bill and Fonda or on April fifteenth said send the check the whole year and the ... is the Irish person I was talking to I interviewed for the the paper ours right he said there'd be a revolution it's\nA their way out I think if someone had to write you know check five has little ten twenty whatever there would be you'd have a new Tea Party right or any of these days with\nBarry yeah it make it clear they actually pay\nNo let's go I promised a car to mark in Albuquerque New Mexico you're on with mark and with Grover Norquist [noise]\nThank you appreciate it up to what you just to work right out of my mouth and here's what I've always thought flat tax\nAnd it's ... percent are\nClose to port it don't matter whether you're a Warren Buffett or whether you're the guy work down there McDonalds seven percent you'll eliminate every deep Doug seem that there is as far as a a with tech fuel eliminate all federal\nTax bills whether it's the fuel tax that we pay or whether Social Security income tax you name but the federal tax it no longer exists you will limit\nWhether it's Social Security income tax you name but the federal tax it no longer exists you will limit the sixteenth a bad day and then in order to raise taxes if you're going\nTo do it as Congress that means you have to have a super majority of both the house in the Senate to foot the bill\nOn the president's desk for him to sign up for\nIt be for it to become a ballot or the election of\nOn every two years if that's what they're going to do and it requires a super majority of all register\nVoters in order for the taxes to the ratings and I think you know and as you just mentioned it does it come out of your pay check you write the check every month or every quarter\nAnd believe me once people realize how much they're paying out taxis they would they would there\nWould be a revolution in this country like you would not believe 'cause I was self employed\nAnd I had to write that check every quarter I couldn't believe how much I was having to pay taxes [noise]\nInteresting groove or what do you think of that to his idea\nI think he's right and a number of the ideas you put out there are in state constitutions uh in California in Nevada or if you if the government wants to raise taxes state government wants to raise taxes\nIt's a two thirds voted legislature because taxes are about as permanent as constitutional amendments which usually take two thirds\nOr to impose on people\nAnd if you say it takes two thirds to raise taxes it really slows the tax and spend down doesn't stop completely but it really slow it down it has to be a really good idea it has to have broad support\nA to an act and it I think a flat tax with a super majority to raise taxes uh would dramatically change our policy curious\nWhat do you think about some people propose the sales tax consumption tax so what's your response to that well\nIn Europe they have a value added tax which is a sales tax at every\nStep of production if you're going to have a twenty percent sales tax is American countries do you really have to you can't just collect it at the supermarket 'cause everybody would buy their stuff then\nDown the street from the supermarket out the back of a truck\nOr so they put that twenty percent at every level of production the farmer pays that the guy who trucks goods into town pays at\nA twenty percent on his value added to where you get ... percent tax but he had little amounts and there's no one place we can avoid ah\nThe difference between the United States Europe is it your\nAnd has a sales tax of a national sales tax of value added tax which gets every level of the production [noise] ah\nIt's why they have higher taxes than we do they have to put it on taxes and high income taxes you can only get so much money out of their income tax people will quit working they'll work around it\nHide money [noise] um when you add to that the difference between the United States Europe is that we don't have that and they do but don't have the sales tax they do tend to say no no we want to sweat whether the income tax and have a national sales tax tax\nIn staff but it's kind of what they promised to your hands on the Japanese and the Asians and the and the Africans when they put that send overseas or it will be in addition to it will not be instead of and if we could\nAnd I'm for bringing that income tax down towards Sarah I'm what you want to do is we just spend it not just turn it into a different tax what who cares if you've got right the income tax and took the exact same amount of money out of ...\nHow would that change anything it's the same amount of money out of your pocket or it it makes you feel better somebody else's writing the check\nBut everything you buy from your house cheer car cheer\nCheer food your clothes would cost more that that the taxes would be hidden in that so um I think going to a single rate tax income tax or and reducing spending as it were to go to know if you got taxes down enough that you could shift from a\nTen percent income tax too\nYou know a Fifteen Percent sales tax has\nGot to ... ... plot or a bad yeah I I wouldn't mind that but you got to get the government to half its presence size before you could\nRisk that and you really have kept protections how do we know we're not going to end up with an income tax and the sales tax true many countries have had been hit with that\nAnd there's no incentive and the politicians because they get their money campaign contributions right as part of this hey you know give me this donation someone on a lower your taxes this they don't want to think solved eventually right that would reduce their campaign contributions for my part [noise]\nHaving taxes that are complicated allows politicians to raise money ah to protect people bit by bit where everyone's you're paying a one percent in the same percentage less ... less opportunities to make money for politicians\nLawyers and counts maybe my final question for you well maybe I've got two more what about the midterm how do you know what do you know if if the Democrats ... take the house what do you think about what's going to happen next situation [noise]\nIf the Democrats take the house there'll be no tax cuts for the next two years or they will be pushing for tax increases that won at least a trillion dollars in higher taxes Hillary ran on raising taxes by a trillion dollars over a decade\nAt least to try and I'm from where we were we cut taxes uh trading and a half ... they want to raise them a trillion from where we were so that is true and a half trillion dollars in taxes\nPer decade that they want to increase taxes they'll be pushing for that I I think with both Trump and the Republican Senate that they won't get a tax increase but they'll sit there and say hey if you want\nThe military to get pay will only do that ... only passed a budget\nOr the soldiers and airmen and Tim and buy it if you get any tax increase they ... they will spend two years trying to get a tax increase [noise] um I Hope they will fail that is what I Will be working on 'em by Democrats\nOn the tax issue I'd like teenage boys on a prom dates they keep asking for the same thing in different ways they just again and again and again that keep coming back they want one thing going higher taxes\nAnd they will ask that question twenty different ways of the green taxes it will save the planet that will be\nAnd the taxes that the only pay but\nAnd they will ask that question twenty different ways of the green taxes it will save the planet that will be the taxes that all they have other people a day while we package the same tax increase and as always\nMay maybe a new Supreme Court tax to pack the court who knows they can come up with anything [laughter]\nLurk west I talk about it really I didn't hear that yeah yeah\nI hear a lot of us want to get out of it and they want to re of British proposed a tax for it or even or course prison Americans for tax reform ... people get in touch with you\nAt our website it's H. E.
