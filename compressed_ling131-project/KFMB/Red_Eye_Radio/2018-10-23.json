caravans going across Mexico a very slowly\nThis or from San Antonio dot com divided Democrat struggled to answer Trump's claims on migrant caravan Democrats are struggling to respond to president Donald Trump but as Republican allies were casting the care of\nA of a thousands of migrants heading towards the U.S Mexico border as a failure of Democrats to helping act immigration policy in the GOP controlled Congress dumped some Democrats said Trump is vulnerable to counterattack on his court campaign issues\nGiven that his policies failed to reduce the number of unauthorized immigrants yet party leaders and democratic candidates have been largely silent ahead of the midterms and refusing to engage with Trump\nOn this particular issue that's why we shut this was a loser from the start where people were saying no what their hope is a you know before\nElection day that these thousands will be at the border and then the military will be there and there will be violence will be going on and it will hurt the Trump in a war hurt the Republicans well that's not going to happen you know you and I were discussing before him he said well maybe\nMaybe Charles will pick up a bunch of people in his private jet drop a hundred dollars you know in order to do with a climbing wall that's going to be the next thing or to live in cars whatever look the problem is if you have ten thousand that arrived at the exact same time as good a if it's a couple of hundred that's going to be that won't even be news now\nThe problem is if you have ten thousand that arrived at the exact same time as good or if it's a couple of hundred that's going to be that won't even be news no well I mean because they're not going to be there won't be violence it'll be simply there'll be taken are going to be violence to simply the border patrol can handle that kind of thing right and if National Guard or needed out there or something like that but\nIt's if the ten thousand all arrived at a particular time\nThat we're a energized and well fed and old decided to run across the border at one particular time well and\nThat's that said look if you just go back to the planning of of of such an event ride or just say you're\nA liberal ah a backer Soros or whoever and you're going to fund this and you're going to do you know organize all of this um what do you expect that is going to happen uh okay uh our plan we'll go we'll go to an official border crossing Mm bill process them like they would any others they have\nAs the border patrol\nThe customs officials there have direct orders and a job to do the whole process the mall and the same manner uh they'll go to it was okay so we'll go to an unofficial crossing a will go which will be out the desert or somewhere else and\nYeah maybe I ... I made I Want to be fair here and there might be one senator on the Democratic side could answer that would that would give you is even if your plan is even a Joe Manchin saying anything right no no no\nBecause the question is what is it really I mean the party has to promote it you're going to have to have the rest of the party obviously um and you know you're trying to get your trying to take control of the Senate you think you're going to win the house you've got momentum in the house you want to build momentum and the Senate races so\nHow do you do that what's the plan what measure what level of enforcement do you support\n\nBecause really in my opinion if I were in ... answering there is no half measure and the problem with amnesty is that you're going to do it again later on it's gonna happen you're just saying okay ah amnesty now and then it will be also amnesty later because we'll have the same debate and we'll still have the exact same scenario or Twenty years from now\nAs a as a debate point yes that would be you bring that out as a debate point ... as a ... to find out what because the goal is here not to get legislation for the goal is to get out of Democrats what they truly think\nAnd what they truly want what the leadership of the Democrats want\nWe know you don't want a wall okay one level of enforcement do you support\nIs that an unfair question Danny Democrat is that an unfair question to ask your party leaders right\nAnd you think about it how can we have all this discussion on ... on immigration and illegal immigration and that never gets answered ever by the Democrat leadership right ever does it get an answer right show me where does the specifics\nOf once you get the amnesty what's the level of border enforcement right specifically they don't want to touch eight six six Ninety red eye\nTo eye with what I told ... ...

some of the early voting out there that NBC reported yesterday would shows Republicans\nAre in most states are that they have a survey to seven of those states with close Senate races favoring Republicans right now one of the reasons why you know the one issue is that Democrats were using that they believe is in their favor ... what's the one issue Democrats are using right now against Republicans\nAnd it's the one that we said they would we said you've got to either do nothing or do something but if it or or complete the task because if you don't do it and you do it half\nPosterior the Democrats will use it against you when premiums skyrocket come down temper and October ... as they now refer to what Trump care mhm that's the one thing that they believe that's the one thing in the poll\nThat the Republicans are way behind that the people believe that the Democrats will do a better job they do not loud\nAnd Republicans on healthcare yeah as we said would happen you saw Schumer was\nA it was a a few weeks ago or\nWhat it was actually it was right after the Kavanaugh confirmations\nWhere they talked about their their focus was going to be healthier because obviously there in terms we're showing you know this is where we get a win on an issue but what's their answer to healthcare which Medicare for everyone Medicare ... right well we can't buy for Medicare\nFor some by the by the way it's complete Medicare where everything is taken care of ... which we can't even do for the senior citizen right who put in for Medicare for their entire lives right it still doesn't cover everything right and they're promoting the fact that we can Medicare covering everything for everybody twenty four seven for the rest of their line is it\nReally now mhm we can't even do it for senior citizens who put in Port their entire working lives that we how do I know what are the commercials\nYeah Medicare part B only covers is you have to pay for this and therefore you need to get supplemental that's right\nOr cross your fingers or\nCross your fingers which means they can't even they can't even pay we can't have for Medicare for some as we've been saying\nThere's no way to big or Medicare for all we we oh wait no no no we can't we can we can go into\nUm I don't know how many trillions of dollars of debt hundreds of trillions of dollars the ... the only thing right now I think the Democrats could have focused on it if they didn't go crazy over capital if that hadn't happened they might have been able to use that as a wet that's that's a good point take the Senate\nFor video road log here is your forecast\nA pool of cold air from Canada has decided on the central us mainly the northern plains and the central plains as we get into the day today will only see a high in Indianapolis for instance of fifty six\nAnd another reinforcing shot of cold areas do Wednesday to sweep not only from the mid west but into the deep south\nRight is mine and now you may spend a lot of money at\nYour doctor ah you know and I understand people not wanting to have well I don't want the chemicals or or this to to go to sleep but\nThat's something I Would discuss with my doctor even sell you know okay let's not do the pills or whatever let's what can I Do what do you recommend a I I don't know that I Would go into the for me I Would want medical experience first if I'm going to turn to somebody you know\n[noise] you know for for me it's really interesting and I've been blessed that I really never had major sleep problems at all and and I feel blessed because of it but I Know last as I was telling me ... or are we just today the last week\nI still can't get on a regular schedule where you sleep you know really one time of day who's the de ship to so tough now I'm back on this ship sleeping twice a day 'cause that's what I did when I came on the shift and I you remember I just said I'm going to you know I I couldn't\nI was trying to figure out okay what time can I sleep all I Can't do that with my body my body tells you when it's time to sleep yeah and and I'm Glad that I can pick up on what my body tells me that because it's twice a day I go home and I go to sleep and and and then I sleep again at about five to six o'clock when my body gets tired\nAnd you know I mean you know what a disciplinarian I Am at that people that know me and to know me my whole life said you really became disciplined I mean you have to sleep during those times and I said if I don't it throws up mine tire mind my mind is gone if I don't\nIf I don't do it but because I'm a because I'm On that schedule rarely do I ever\nHave to you know take even anything over the counter mhm anymore I I was for a little while they're taking the melatonin maybe once in a while and\nSometimes on weekends I may have to take a little bit of it because my I changed my my sleep pattern but that's even rare now I've decided no just sleep and if you wake up in the middle and I get up you know do some stuff for an hour and I go back to sleep and it was my ... my my dentist my uh who\nAre as sleep therapists who who uh\nSaid when I told him I scheduled 'cause he was always concerned as my dentist is there is also went to sleep therapy\nAnd I told him I scheduled me what oh she's asleep twice a day goes when that's how the basically the caveman used to do it came I used to go to sleep like seven o'clock there was no TV they went to sleep seven eight o'clock\nThey woke up and midnight one o'clock and set up for a couple of hours and back to sleep again that's how human beings used to do it ... you said so you're basically into it and he said do you find many problems and I haven't had any problems no type of medical problems but to me the only thing that really insurers\nAre that I I mean it it's almost set I Do have to I Do have to work out almost every day ... working out does make a difference for me [laughter] tiring out my body does make a difference doing physical activity\nI'm having trouble getting to sleep I have\nTrouble finding the time I mean my my life is so busy it ... it literally is a a round the clock you know huge family or other business aside from you know this uh and and then of course a lot of the stuff pertaining to this\nYeah but yeah it is but I've known your long enough you can operate without sleep I Can't yeah yeah well I Do not my mind's\nIn point I was up at two AM a Sunday Morning and uh up\nUntil a almost one PM on Monday a afternoon that's when I went to bed Monday afternoon I got up at six thirty and then went back to bed for another Ninety minutes ah\nSee I I Can't I Can't I've known your long enough to know that you can operate with sleep your brain still works my brain does not work yeah the same at all if I if if I don't sleep crack heads is so tough for me to to to do that so I guess it's\nFine for the ... same thing while I mean my allergy well yeah and and for me it's the same thing it is also too about the exercise and diet and everything else because had I during that time I mean you know where the where the big a family wedding on Sunday and I was\nI mean I was there until I was the last one house at night falls closing up a venue and and uh and and clearing everything out a loading out\nA but\nHad I had a well a piece of wedding [laughter] that that show [laughter] and you know what I mean cause you and and you have to know that I mean everybody was looking at me strangely although I did I take some home and I had some Monday morning you know when I when when it was time and I knew\nThat wouldn't be that wouldn't cause me any any problems but you you have to do that and it also has to include like for me and a big difference with people I Know people that can like drink coffee you know full strength coffee and have no issues um it's you know comedians and cars getting coffee\nIt's amazing to see Jerry Seinfeld loves coffee\nAnd he talks about these they drink you know it looks like he's drinking at least two or three cups if I had two or three cups of coffee in the day well then that would be no but I just couldn't I couldn't do that I can drink a total of maybe one and I'm good but the I have to know\nWell then that would be no but I just couldn't I couldn't do that I can drink a total of maybe one and I'm good but\nThe I have to know the the point being is I have to know that I've got to keep exercising I've the die it's got to be right especially during those times when I'm not going to get that sleep I'm going to have to really mind my piece in Houston and lots of water or\nThe insomnia thing I've I've been there\nUm and and maybe it's because I'm aging I it's not about insomnia for me it's about schedule a typically lately it has not been this this past weekend was a total anomaly\nBut typically it has been here lately you know getting to bed a and getting a good seven hours of sleep on the average um and I I Do notice the difference in that it does it is you are a especially physically you're you're better\nYou or mentally your your better I mean this has been a big issue for truck drivers for a long time because there's ours a service that regulate the drivers and and a lot of changes to those hours of service going back to well gosh going back to the Fifteen Years\nAnd and I like that I couldn't do it why couldn't do it it's a airline pilots and you know they all go through the ... they all have their their hours of service you know based on operating you know the the aircraft are operating the big rig\nAnd I for me I don't know how someone could sleep in a you know in the cab of a truck for me I ... and I I think I guess eventually I'd get used to it but\nBecause you've got to ... you got to create that sleep environment right a or a people tell me though the same thing I don't know how you sleep during the day I don't know how you sleep all night um or or stay up all night and and sleep during the day but for twenty two years now I've been I've been doing that and it's it's perfectly normal\nI don't see how people work on the rotating shifts my my dog ran my best friend's father was a cop yeah yeah ... most of his career yeah he would work six weeks ... yes than six weeks second shit right than six weeks third shift said that I don't know ... I don't know I don't know how he did\nThat you can't get a routine down no gotta have your routine and that's the whole thing you've got to have your routine or whatever that is uh that worked for you whatever works to get that sleep you've got to stick to that and that has to be disciplined and you know it's a habit\nThat I I don't know if they still do that is in law enforcement but to me ... that are well that would be an an alert is concerned yeah are you alert when you're out there well I knew and you've got to change sleep shifts like yeah I that would be a\nTotal concerned yeah I have a friend who's been a prison guard for a long long time and that's that's kind of what they do they it's called that's called shift work right where you're changing you know that that your routine\nAll the time my dad did that he was talking to me about recent he said I I still don't know how you do this and I said well that it's easier than what you describe a back into your military days he would do that when he was a military police officer in the air force they would do shift work especially in the early days\nOr when he rose in rank that you know changed he didn't have to do that but uh you know for the longest time they did the same thing and uh as an MP and he said that was just for me he said that was just difficult it was impossible because you don't have a routine\nThe only thing I Can't do is on Sundays when I go back to my regular sleep shift yeah I get up at like five in the morning yeah I have to change it a little bit I pick it up so I'm tired by the time Sunday night comes around I go to sleep\nFor one thing I Can't do on Sundays Evers lift weights I lift weight in the Sunday I cannot my muscles are too much stimulation just to just ... that's the one thing I Can't do any other day I could do it during the week it doesn't bother me on Sundays can't do it right eight six six Ninety read I\nWas guilty must have found that regardless it's radio [noise]\nJoin the conversation using the shell wrote several hotline eight six six nine zero seven three three three died when I radio and shell hotel on making your hardworking journeys more manageable\nTap dance ski we have hundreds of\nFlat bed and specialized million mile drivers blight because if you like driving for a local trucking company with national power than we have a long term home for you as a as a family of sixty locally runs flatbed and specialized companies in communities all across the usa and Canada\nWhere you can put down your roots you on short haul or long hold on a drive our late model drunk or your own trying to do you like to drive ... research team\nAbout the challenge of specialized loads of desk ... family of companies is your million mile hole if this along with consisted miles great pay and top tier benefits sounds like what you're looking for go to Dr ... dot com\nTom simply click on view digital version or current issue to listen on your smartphone or Bluetooth connected that said or speakers just activate by clicking on the speaker I gone for any story and voila just start listening road gene dotcom\nEra currently here for this thing Christopher truckers relief fund\nIf you could help a truck driver get back to work make their pile of bills less daunting give them one less worry wouldn't you\nEvery year thousands of truckers lose their jobs homes and more when a medical problem causes financial hardships but what's your donation to the same Christopher truckers relief fund you can help get them and their families back on the road donate today of\nTruckers fun ... that's ... responded dot org give today at truckers fund dot org [noise]\nAmerica's finest city five years the seven sixty Seventy San Diego's talk for a\n...\nThe news on the hour presented by liberty mutual insurance\nI'm Lenny Gillette a caravan of immigrants in southern Mexico has swelled to more than seven thousand CBS is Adriana Diaz says they're\nHere only wearing sandals\nThat only one hundred degree heat and exhausted souls Jessica florists brought her strongest child with her little she left her for others in ... and they almost city but I went to my mother had her for her mother to leave her children\nThey say look\nFar though she goes the harder it is though that her children are farther away from\nTo migrants continue toward the border in open defiance of the U.S government\nTurkey says it will cooperate if there was an independent investigation into the death of journalists ...

[noise]\nYeah Hi you know I was in the show or you were talking about Booker Harris and Booker Mm yes they're they're trying to buy vote that's what it amounts to well yeah\nBut I give it away at giving away the whole everything mhm they can buy their ... well if they got married it it'd be president and first lady you know\nI ah I doubt that's going to happen but clearly the it's always about buying the boats\nYeah you want to give away something you promise something for free I mean back in the day Hugo Chavez in Venezuela if you if you uh don't remember Venezuela was a a a socialist nation now they're they're just to the remnants of a socialist nation\nBut in Venezuela they would send checks out in the mail before election day you know yeah it's always about well\nBuying ... I ... I think ... every every politician on boats on on both sides looks at people's self interest now what do you do it all depends what your self interested that's I've voted my self interest right I I vote for my self interest but what might\nWhat what was my it it really didn't work out for me just laughed and why shouldn't we since we have to pay more under the Republican's tax plan no but what is my what is my bigger self interest my my bigger self interest and your bigger self interest\nIs not what other people's self interest is my self interest is not getting free stuff\nNo my self interest is freedom\nWell when we have the liberty of it did and and the ... of of our nation right that that's my number that's my self interest and floods so people vote for their self interest all the time for other people's self interest is give me free stuff mhm that's not my first self interest because I Know\nThat it's a bogus concept I Know that it doesn't work I Know that it doesn't solve the problems that they claim that they're trying to cure\nAnd so they're simply selling to people who believe in don't care what the future may bring look we live in a nation that doesn't care about\nThe deficit or the debt either side now doesn't care about it is completely and totally irresponsible\nBoth Republicans and Democrats don't care about the deficit don't care about but that they don't care they don't care what it does to a future generation\nSo far for both sides now keeping the status quo of what we have today is extremely important sure\nKeeping the status quo of what we get from the government I Can't tell you when the banks were getting bailed out how many people called up and said there shouldn't be bailing out the banks who should be bailing out me right also government's role is to give you money well from somebody else\nThat's where this shift was for them you know a lot of people in fact that that said that they were either conservative or voted Republican and they were talking about saying it and it it it really was kind of this mentality that had been built through the media and also from Capitol Hill and\nAt that time uh you know at the end of the Bush presidency or that the world was coming to an ... remember a McCain and Obama had to come off of the campaign trails to rush to the White House to save the world you know because the world is coming through that\nUh but the that that a a fear drove a lot of people after the bailout started happening to say well listen you know that's going to happen then right I Want mine so it became is almost the looting effect\nRight the government money looting right idea I I wouldn't mind if they if they're thrown out money to throw it to me and I'll throw bank right to throw it to me and we were saying no\nThe government money looting right idea I wouldn't mind if they if they're thrown out money throw it to me not throw bank right drug to me and we were saying no throat which no one right way and\nAnd that's because when government gets involved in every aspect of your life they become a ... and everybody understands this when you take it out of the hardest and talk and you're talking about should we be run by a monopoly right sure healthcare system be run by a monopoly\nDemocrats just to be scared to death of a monopoly why because they understand the monopoly has complete control right there for Ken Ken you know can do whatever they wish to do you know we live in a way we live in a a a a time\nAnd you know already got response whenever we talk about health care well other countries spend less on healthcare no they don't\nKnow not for the same services they don't know\nWe can't make that correlation you because you can't compare you can't you can't compare it if waiting times are double for some procedures\nWhich would include your college you're existing college loan or in some cases right will pay off your college mom um\nThose are those can be retroactive or can be a future promise for people who are voting now not only if you're talking about the you know the people who might vote Democrat or or might be in the center\nAre being independent and look at this idea and go well well well that could work or does it really effectively work with their particular situation and then on top of that or does that interest me if if I'm really think about a generation who's having fewer kids\nThere's the book or plan even resonate with them were kids I I Know what about me\nI'm not I don't I'm not worried about my children because I don't really plan on having a family I'm giving my children the debt well yeah [laughter] I'm not going to have kids because it's too expensive even with your fifty thousand dollar plan enough it's not enough so I'm not a oh wait a minute\nBy\nThe thousand dollars doesn't help with raising my child now that's what I Need to ... dollars a year at the exact and help with raising my child cutting out that's\nBecause the idea is that we have you know we have too many kids in these poor families that by the time they're Eighteen they're a disadvantage because they can't afford college were home and all this all these items\nWell no no no no no no you're you're not you're not trying to get the future vote of those kids who haven't been born yet you're trying to get there but you know would be parents votes\nRight now and they're thinking to themselves well no I've got a number of reasons why I don't want to have a family 'cause I Can't afford it you're not giving me so it's never going to be All right\nSo now I'm so Camilla Harris gets my vote because she's promised me six thousand dollars if she gets a lot and it was my kid ... I Want ethics thousand now and or\nBernie gives me or maybe come out with Harris comes adds onto it and said free college for everybody and she gets my vote too because she's going to include existing college loans and of course free healthcare yes Medicare fail to right yeah\nSo the what you can give me no ... my kid you're fearful thousand I Know I'm not having kids fifty thousand Eighteen years from now no and and my kid gets I don't get ... no no I'd rather get the six thousand dollars now all the ways that will give me both will know give me the six to ... don't get me six thousand dollars\nGive me Fifteen thousand dollars to raise my kids now right\nInstead of the fifty thousand dollars at my kid could use down the road right no I Want it now and give me an now gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme that then\nYou're not trying to get the vote of the the baby that's yet to be born you're trying to get the adult vote they don't care about the future\nThey care about now see they're not think we're ... we're trying to tell them Gary we can do the strategy for I don't know a couple of million apiece they're just not thinking you're either not going big enough or you're not going direct enough let's go\nTo William in Virginia William welcome you're on run I Radio Welcome to the show high\n[laughter] hey great show as thanks I Will say that was thinking about how when you

like we were initially when we when we when we started with the program\nWe weren't going to attack soon but ... years into it we realized that everybody eight years from now yes everybody eight years from now will be taxed on it right and therefore nobody's going to be against it because it's a year from now so eight years old I only be upset eight years later when we actually tax that heading at\nYes exactly yeah yeah thank you well we appreciate the call it but but again you have to go direct you have to go with who directly to the account of\nThe the person you want a the vote from so it's got to be free college for them it's got to be a free money free you know a Medicare for all all of it for them to you and it has to be now you know you can't waste any time\nI remember when they when they when they were talking about the reports of Obamacare kicking it or when they signed it rather they signed it into law and of course the rollout didn't happen\n... right away but you have people calling and making appointments [laughter] I Know [laughter] where's your insurance well I have a bomb in here [laughter] no no no that's still a few years away at all what do you mean I Want it now there's this into me any good a few years down the other the other thing\nAbout Harris whims and twenty twenty right and she wins on the whole Medicare for all she wins on the whole\nUh ... now

she promises this then what happens inevitably right she gets ... ... let's say she got elected based on those massive promises\nWell two years in her first mid term of a sudden there's that shift in power let's say the Democrats won and the house and Senate and twenty twenty as well although they didn't get it they don't get it done in the first two years and there's a shift in power well she

would be the the lasting effect on the ... as a Democrat\nBut it in that it it would be well we need to you know capture the Senate to block or you know Trump's nomination right we need to we need to do that\nBut if they believe looking at the polls well we're not going to get that anyway so I'm not motivated to go for the opposite of that we need to get a vote out but if they see that as an uphill battle but there's no way to get the majority of the ...\nThe cabinet thing doesn't have an effect for somebody on on the left\nTheoretically it just doesn't it just because the\nThe point

not seen an ad anywhere Internet that has said don't all don't allow Trump to pick another Supreme Court justice\nMaybe that's running somewhere right right right I have not seen it yet and I'm surprised I haven't seen it because in the last couple of days I've seen a ton of political ads on the different channels that I go to especially the different sports channels on Saturday ... that are covering some of these regional football games around the country I've seen a lot of that\nAnd you would think that that would be one ad that would be out there is that is that just not a selling point right now there are Democrats tested that and that's just not working because you would think that would be the one thing mhm luck vote for this senator don't give Trump another shot at picking another Supreme Court justice like cabinet right\nAnd I even or at very least leave Kevin ... out of it we cannot let Trump pick another Supreme Court justice yes an end it there I haven't seen that

that's how I took that was the almost the celebration of the ... of of the Republican Party from everything that went on from Kavanaugh yeah even though\nIt isn't all it's it's it's more than just that but to me that was the symbol that it showed a lot of people that look okay we're all Republicans most of us are conservatives we even if we're moderate and moderate conservatives we can't have\nThat party in power because they'd been blunt\nAbout what they believe in and we and we do believe I I Believe this is part of their statement we do believe that if they don't believe in the constitution if they don't believe and due process if they don't believe in the first amendment if they don't believe in the second amendment\nPeople are being blood in St Louis then what makes you American yeah and I know sounds probably harsh just some people but if you don't believe in you and I talked about this for the longest time if you don't believe in the constitution if you don't believe in those basic tenants than what do you actually believe\nIt well and and what kind of country do you really want right what is it that you want a your country to be you\nWell and and what kind of country do you really want right what is it that you want a your country to be you\nKnow you look at the the never Trump where's the conservatives and I think the Kavanaugh effect\nWas was a you know something that was I opening for a lot of them who realized okay a couple of times\nOr this president has shown a his efforts in terms of the highest court you and I by the way can can officially called this the Breitbart Andrew Breitbart effect\nYes because and twenty twelve just weeks before he died or we asked him as as we were talking to them why should we support a a moderate like Mitt Romney it was inevitable Mitt Romney was going to become the nominee or appeared he would even early that year\nUh why should we do that and his answer was guys I'm a stone's throw as I sit here and talk to you from SCOTUS it's all about SCOTUS\nSo they're ... it's it's different you can have a conservatives say well never Trump and maybe maybe I you know\nThink about it and twenty twenty in terms of ah you know we'll look and see what what happens in twenty twenty ride I didn't vote for him and twenty sixteen I stayed home or whatever\nBut in terms of the ... mid term\nWhile yes they're supporting Trump there were there a couple of things at least Trump will do this on ... so I've got to get out I've got to vote I've got to be motivated to get out there and allow him to be able to possibly seat another constructions\nBut it's exactly what you said to it is\nThey're they're you were going to have to build that Republican wall around the constitution and around the process that is in place that preserves the constitution\nAnd and I think that's really a strong it at us a strong addition to uh the Trump momentum mhm to have conservatives who are idiot logically driven\nWho did all the constitution and do know an arm stream Lee fearful of what came out of Democrats during the cabinet nomination which to them really has nothing to do with Trump\nBut it is all United in that same ideology and I like to call it the republic because you've called that a couple of times Republican wall meanwhile we've played a couple of of audio cuts from from President all a form of President Obama's former reason\nAnd that was I'm Still looking for what was the major issue because look if you look at cabinet what came out of cabinet and and I I specifically go back to a conversation that I had\nAt my at my family reunion I and this was a a gentleman who I talked to the relative by marriage mhm okay is a professor at an extremely liberal college\nAnd from what I have known him as for the longest time because of other friends who know him\nA very very big liberal right very big liberal we had the most amazing conversation in July most amazing conversation went on for over an hour\nAnd you know very quiet conversation just you know what do you think whatever and he just told me she said you don't have liberal I Am I said well I've heard of we'd never had a long discussion\nBecause I'm pretty liberal he goes the campuses are insane because they're not liberal I'm a liberal those maybe I'm an old because I never thought I'd think of myself as an old time liberal and what I found out is he's ... he's a lot like for example of Camille paleo mhm oh he's an old traditional\nA liberal and he talked about Trump because look you know Trump's stuff that goes but look\nA lot of stuff to Trump says actually because when he goes too far actually helps us a little bit so people make claim they really care about are offended but they're not ... but\nThe fact is he goes my dad loves Donald Trump ... my dad died before Donald Trump run ran in a won the presidency but my dad would have voted for Donald Trump those Trump's not a racist well not what you know it's not a racist\nAnd and he says he goes but he goes our party because my party's killing itself\nAnd I wonder if I had a conversation with him today after Kavanaugh 'cause Eric you're on you and I both know that the average Democrat I'm Talking about the work in the the working class Democrat who you know who lives in so many cities across the United states I Know who they are because I grew up with them my family\nPart of my family is from that working kind of a Democrat family I Know\nThey you know we're Democrats came from in the north east you know we talked about Tim Russert ... you know and and if when if you ever read any of his books I mean he came from a south buffalo Democrat Party but they're very conservative mhm extremely conservative you know morally speaking and that's been passed down through generations\nYou'd think the average rank and file average working class Democrat related\nTo the Democrats saying that evidence doesn't matter that due process doesn't matter that the presumption of innocence doesn't matter you know it's nobody's rallying around that anymore right now nobody's using that as a campaign thing\nNo Democrats going out right now screaming always bully her mhm if you if you voted ... if you bought a Republican in the Republicans going to vote for due process we cannot have due process we cannot have a presumption of innocence they may have been saying that two or three weeks ago they're not saying that now\nThey can't sell it no they can't sell it to their own party so what are they selling\nTheir selling Trump fear and maybe a little bit of\nThe increase premiums for for a a is as they call it Trump carrying around a but is that actually going to have an effect right now no no I don't see that having an affair it might have had more of an effect if the whole cabinet thing hadn't happened\nWell because health care costs have been going up forever they were going up during the Obama years I mean after they put the the even out Obamacare remember the first couple of years\nLook at the ... as we went through twenty sixteen the increase their it politically you can't get away with that anymore because it is it's going to go up\nPeople with ... with with an employer based\nHealth care no the costs are going up\nSo the only thing that resonates forget about saying well a Trump care is is ran by raising premiums nobody cares about that it's about what are you going to give me if you're going to you know again appeal to somebody who's on the left route not everyone but but any people\nBut you know something the the free stuff and we talked about that earlier with Cory bookers you know the new new program the navy bonds and Kamala Harris over the weekend but that's more of a president show that that's more for twenty twenty and that's not really you can as an individual congressman you're they're not walk and I'm going I'm going to give you all free stuff\nThat's why Schumer is not making any noise when he announced the days after the uh just a few days after the uh Kavanaugh's confirmation you know we're going to focus on health care well because nobody cares when it comes to the mid term yeah you know so what do you do\nThat they may when you're talking about an individual which is the presidential candidates\nBecause nobody cares when it comes to the mid term yeah you know so what do you do that they may when you're talking about an individual which is the presidential candidate it may be the focus is going to be there but there's just too many races to be focused on right yep though as we have a fascinating to eat well I just think this is a fascinating\nYou set it earlier is could this be one of those unique midterms in terms of you know the numbers of love you know the average turnout or what demographics or what motivates anyone remember twenty six theme was unique very unique\nAnd we've changed as a nation since twenty sixteen there are many things that have changed the left has ramped up their rhetoric and and the craziest over the top no telling what when we get past the midterm two weeks from today when we look back on what we're\nGoing to say eight six six Ninety
