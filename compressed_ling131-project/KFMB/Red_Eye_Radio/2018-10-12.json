you know have they look to the president said look Republicans ... they they look and they just say we're voting against the party of the president if it's true it's about I was saying that it's weak in the mid west for the Republicans is it because of the terrorists and agriculture well\nAnd and that's it uh there are I think right now if you look at the the farming community especially sending that message back to the president and the administration on you know giving the money they're saying they would rather have the business or that shows that they believe this could be long term pain

definitely be going to the polls in November\nYeah it's really it's only when you think about that here's something else interesting looking at the end and it's just\nOne small indicators of small movement but I find it interesting looking at our sleepy and the map for the house race or the house races\nSo Republicans took one from the Democrats I haven't figured out which one it is but it was at two o five Democrats in other words likely very likely Democrats\nAnd one Ninety eight for Republicans it's now too old for for Democrats one Ninety nine for Republicans\nAnd the center of the toss up districts still remains at thirty two and two yes I Would love to see what district that was that that that that shifted and I and again not from toss up\nBut from the Democrats so I'll go back and look at it I I have no idea um but it is interesting so you but you do look at those ... to ... keep in mind to Eighteen is the number the magic number a for a majority right so right now\nOnly Nineteen dubose thirty to need to go for uh the Republicans but even fewer a fourteen\nUh fourteen only need to go for the Democrats\nSo\nIt will be interesting to watch those house races as we start seeing the polls are and we\nAnd we will more and more are in the coming weeks that's going to be I'd be I think by the time we get back a week from Monday things will start shaping up because those undecideds more and more of them will start making up their mind and that that's where a shift happens and what is the impact\nOf the capital and that entire thing\nAnd really me and my look at the our CPA for example I mean Montana isn't a tossup state right with test her you know up or the last one was done not you know nine twenty two which had test her up for the one before and and uh with the margin of error three point seven five and the one before that was tester up just to\nWhy isn't that a toss up state why is that definitely yeah I'm On the Senate race yeah unemployment rate right and and ... my point is so yeah is the legitimacy of\nThe R. C. P. average if they're going by polls and there are so very there there are a lot fewer poles when you talk about a lot of the congressional races out there\nWell ... ... and\nI guess historically tend to shift happened\nAh with with if you look at the margin of error on the on the polls that were done\nBy the recent polls that were done in that race uh the the uh you know test her up by by four and the grab us a margin of error is three point seven\nSo that you know that right there could be neck and neck are they calling a toss up because of the fact that you know it's still too close to the margin of error once we ought to consider is not a toss up that's my point my point is that it's our cp has it as definitely blew\n'em\nOn my map is still showing great it's just when gray\nJust sit there and get it when it justified grey eye thanks to the staff at our sleepy for ... it was a ship them aware of what happened that just when it just went gray yeah All right I'm I'm I Apologize yeah I don't know if it updated it and then what I had was from a week ago or something\nBut it's just one great ... tiny grain ask myself like I Do wonder am I looking at the right Montana well and the look and when you're ... or something like ... and all of a sudden it updates its gray in front of me yeah because ... Arizona was in grade before\nArizona was like blue was flashes what men slightly favoring blues and I was going to ask that next because it makes Sally and all of a sudden boom that appears in that comes up is great\nAnd that because ... there's been a huge swing there okay in recent polls\nAre going from All right I'm going down Ari Sienna ... and and now she's plus six that's a huge swing\nDifferent pollster\nBut it is a it's it's a pretty big swing so um and it is a it's a different uh the polls are in fact I'm well\nOkay I Know what I was looking at I had the one that said there's the R. C. P. Senate map and the one next week is the Senate note taught sop\nOkay they don't include any taught some Senate that's what I was okay that's what I was I had no that is different if you click that that's and I thought that was their general analysis oh right right it it makes sense now yep yep 'cause that was like how can you call\nA camp Montana and not be a toss up at this point right All

S. P. S. thing if prices get too expensive and it's costing you know the uh the company to raise prices on Amazon\nThey do one or two things get rid of that agreement and go and move away from it or they pass it along to the consumer\n... plain and simple\nOr this news item the co founder of the opposition research from behind the Steele dossier [laughter] for those of you that her brand new listeners\nWill do it very quickly because we we can do it very quickly an update you so you understand completely what we're talking about\nUh the Democrats accused the Trump a campaign of colluding with the Russians to hack and or change the outcome of the election [noise] all the evidence we found out is it's just the opposite the DNC and the Hillary campaign\nPaid a law firm ... who paid and opposition research from\nA ... a fusion GPS who paid the former British spy Christopher Steele who got\nA information he says from the Russians close to the Kremlin in order\nTo change the outcome of the election by getting unverified salacious allegations against Donald Trump\nThat they weren't going to use to kill his campaign and when they couldn't do that they wanted to use in order to destroy the legitimacy of the twenty sixteen election they also use that information\nAs a basis to get a secret warned against the Trump campaign while the campaign was actually going so you know you see fusion GPS was a part well\nThe cofounder of the opposition research from Glen Simpson will invoke his first and Fifth Amendment privileges to avoid testifying before Congress next week his lawyer has told Congress\nAccording to the hill Simpsons attorney told house a judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte the Simpson will not appear for a deposition because the congressional investigation is not designed to discover the truth\nReally know the average Virginia Republican\nSubpoenaed Simpson on September twenty nine\nOr after the lawyer said his client would not appear voluntarily for an interview before members of the house judiciary and the house oversight and Government Reform committees\nSimpsons from a fusion GPS was hired during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign bottle law firm that represented the DNC and the Clinton campaign ... fusion GPS hired former British spy Christopher Steele\nTo conduct an investigation into Donald Trump's possible links to Russia the result of the probe was eight thirty five page report alleging collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin Republican lawmakers are interested in the CIA\nLargely because the FBI reportedly relied on the unverified document or obtain surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page so of course all or is going to say you're not trying to get to the truth\n\nWell then what does the ... say they're trying to fight here's I either get are they going to ask are they going to ask him about his personal taxes I don't think so right are are they going to ask him about a a\nWho he believes is the best running back ever and the national football league if you're listening earlier to the show you understand why I brought that up\nUh I don't think so what are they going to ask him up on me I was I Begin to ask him about Kanye West [laughter] probably not they're probably going to ask him about fusion GPS and their role\nOr\nIn the uh entire flow chart of the Democrats and the Hillary campaign colluding with the Russians to change the outcome of the election\nSo here's my question thinking a of a fusion GPS Bruce or his wife\nWas employed at fusion GPS yes the inspector general's office\nOf the department of justice where Bruce or was employed\nAs the and an associate deputy attorney general uh the inspector general would have then access to any communications if they're still there\nBetween Bruce or and his wife if there were any to begin with and if they're still they're inspector general gets them for the asking\nA does he oh he but he yes from the department of justice yeah it'll yes\nBecause because they were done internally yesterday right on right on an official yes device from the department and I and again if the those are ... that that's the number of hits right away from the point being is that\nYou look at all the in this case basically it's a it's a block because you shouldn't GPS doesn't wanna cough up the truth they have no interest in doing that\nBut\nHow so how how would you find it otherwise well part I Would think part of that would be looking into Bruce for his involvement with a you know a\nProfessionally possibly with his wife and if there were any communications I think the number one thing you would do the first thing you you would do as you would look to see if there were any communications during that time and if they were on a those devices if they're still\nPreserved in any way we we know you have the you know you have the right to claim the fifth mhm you have to incriminate yourself yes and we understand ... what I Would wonder is a blend Simpsons lawyer ... what is he worried about if they aren't\nLet let's take him at his word mhm that the house Judiciary Committee\nAnd the house oversight committee aren't trying to get to the truth right then I Would ask ... lawyer then what do you think they are going after right\nIf they're not well look at ... ... is is part of what they hypothetically as part of what they are concerned with is the same thing as a mall or investigation\nThe Mueller investigation has had nothing to do with actual Russian collusion with the Trump campaign right so that would be the question are you worried because of where the mother investigations is going is at the same thing might happen to you\nThat there was nothing wrong that you did nothing wrong and I don't know I don't I don't know what I don't see any crime from what I Know of of fusion GPS committed any crimes\nI don't know what I don't know where there was any evidence of that you would uh concerning you know get gathering the information and getting the money ... they're an opposition research firm that just on the level is as far as what you do you get dirt on the other\nParty's candidate or whatever you you do opposite well the what they do opposition research is self explanatory so what does he worried about\nWhat would they be what possible crimes is Glenn Simpsons lawyer worried about\n\nWell and and heightening the time it gets interesting look I say this because Donald Trump junior I testify I'll go under oath I'll do there are plenty of people that do wonder oh mhm so what is the crime that he is ... ... what is the charge\nThat Glenn Simpsons lawyer if you talk to him privately would be concerned about even if he believes his client did not commit a crime where does he think they're going to try to prove that Glenn Simpson committed a crime and why would they be going after Glenn Simpson\n\nOr if there's someone else their fusion GPS he's worried about and by talking forget about incriminating himself he's incriminating\nHis from yes\nThose are the questions that went to ... those are questions on the investigator would have

that's a huge number of people did you stay\nIf either by the way um you know and this and this is that said that terminology thing and I I Know I'm splitting hairs and preaching to the choir in terms of our audience ... gun rights it's my rights\nUh yeah the gun doesn't ask John even doesn't that doesn't have the right place I'd gotten has no right the gun\nDoesn't have any rights I assume all of the the guns rights when I put it in my cold live fingers\nIt's the people's right yes a very interesting I just want to get to this topic 'cause you happened to bring this up and I didn't know about this many employees on the Las Vegas strip fear being replaced by robots and you were telling me there is actually these and I'm looking at it right now that they've come up with these drink robots that will make bartenders obsolete\nYes and you can come as they design I've seen I don't know if this is in place in Vegas just yet but the design I've seen also includes you walk up to the kiosk\nOr the kiosk is even better than to the counter like they do the are they actually have like a a if you go up to a bar and the gambling city of for those who don't gamble or never Ben\nWhen you sit at a bar you can get your drinks actually for free if you're gambling and they'll put the right there\nAt the seat there is a video poker thing you can play mhm right\nRight by the way the drinks not free [laughter] it'll cost you whatever you lose and video [laughter] to be clear you mean they're not giving yeah anything free\nNow that uh I I just that they don't deserve to buy a bunch of alcohol and lose money on it no\nI'm the those are the [laughter] getting back to the robot thing [laughter]\nI'm a I'm not sure what the strippers will look like ... ... ... but but for the bar is they'll move away from ...\nHome man oh no no no no rind bartenders robot brothels yeah I I guess by the way we never really talked about yet we didn't talk about Houston didn't we didn't talk about everybody did last week of well I mean\nYou know if you think about remember the old but I guess they still have them the coffee vending\nMachine where would make you cough yes yes I was go back to the Terminator two the security guard making the\nOr it was a ... that went to make a a cup of coffee didn't work out too well known as\nCheap to walk up behind them and then became him which was weird but\nYou think about robotics in serving food that's been around for a while but it will be different in a bar like this where you go up and you basically uh order it\nYou know and you know the type it in a you're going to insert your credit card and then all of a sudden the drink is going to be made and even delivered to you depending on the set up on the counter\nBy automation\nYou know I think John ... a guy who has a pretty good uh business uh or has over the years in Las Vegas and also from uh the the bar rescue\nYou're never going to see a well first of all there's no way to steal from the till I'm not blaming bartenders from for that I'm not condemning all bartenders but that does happen in the business and you know tappers caught it\nWhere they were you know skimming or whatever from from the ah register but even to a greater extent pouring way too heavy right ... robots not going to do that well either one\nBut I did here's the other point 'cause I was thinking the same thing I'd ask John tap for how far can you go with the robot bartender ...\nKind of regular Barbie all robots right and just a person walking around or do you have to her is is that right 'cause he talks about the science of a bar mhm and the science of the bar is about people and interaction\nAnd wrote a a a robot can't be pleasant trust me I Know a few of them\nWell a robot also can be angry either ... NBA an angry bartender right a gay can't be a drunk bartender\n[laughter] wow that's that but how\nHow far do you do with the science of it you mean I I can see this working totally in a place like Vegas where the focus is gambling not not communicating with the bartender or not walking into your corner bar\nSo my wife and I uh recently went to a place that had\nA robot roulette wheel now we walked by several times we didn't we didn't look at it\nBecause it was often like they have a a a a what would you say it it's there's there's there's poker and blackjack were you walk up and the screen has\nYou know a dealer but it's it's animated right and so that you know the the whole tables animated the cards were animated well\nOn this roulette that's what I thought I was ... that I thought it was all animated it's actually\nIt's it's an actual wheel in the center and you don't you're not close to everyone it's not crowded like a real roulette table\nAnd so we thought okay let's see how this works and it was interesting we played it for a few minutes and it was interesting because I said you know that's that's not the animation thing is still gives you the view of a real roulette wheel right and that's important for a lot of people they don't trust right ... exactly well\nIn in the case of a a a Vegas and in a in a bar setting there's a couple of settings you're going to be a nightclub kind of setting and nightclubs are huge in in Vegas um where they don't care they just want to drink\nIt's not your pub riding whereas at where the bartender right dates to be pleasant needs to be a companion for and cared maybe a little bit of a conversation on with you in Vegas it's not that\nIt's not that for the most part it's either the gamblers or uh like I said the nightclubs and\nNo one cares anything except about the alcohol when it comes to the bar is all about the alcohol or it'd be interesting to see how far this goes\nI Want to be alive when they come out with the home version of the robot bartender\nA year ago when you walk into your house and they basically you've got bottles that you insert vodka or whatever I mean right ten different types of alcohol that you put in their right and the mixer and everything else and then you just walk into your house\nAnd you say Alexa give me a screwdriver\nOr go out and then she hands you affiliates [laughter]\nNo life so [laughter] I doubt it oh my\nGod [laughter] and then it's ... the old\nAlexa drinking alcohol [laughter] a satellite dish or I Want to get drunk\n[laughter]\nHey six ... biggest engine report is brought to you by Detroit ...
