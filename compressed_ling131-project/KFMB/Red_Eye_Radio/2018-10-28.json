those out nowadays like I guess you could write\nA twelve days away from uh the uh the mid term elections I went out and early voted yesterday ... a a went to the local community college was one of the early voting sites for me right it was pouring rain and just pouring rain mhm and when\nIt was funny 'cause I've never even though this campus is only five miles from my house I really just\nNever been never drove through this community college right oh drove through what the science route front of you know the that you you could tell me okay this is early voting political science all over the place\nAnd so I started driving around trying to find the building saying I've no idea what building that's going to be in but when I but I Will know it when I see it because of political science will be all over the place right right yeah and they were the only thing is\nThey didn't have any parking\nIf you came in to vote it was all student parking at a college uh yeah yeah which and I just thought to myself because that was one of the reasons I wasn't going to go there I was going to go to a court house right uh where you know that was also about the same distance away from me maybe a little further couple of more miles\nAnd I was going to go there and I said that\nI Want to check out the the the campus because I've never been out of before so I had about a thousand\nA couple more miles and I was going to go there and I said that I Want to check out the the the campus\nBecause I've never been out of before so I had about a thousand foot ... pouring rain\nBut when I got in there everybody friendly ... no matter what the ... is ... outside the anger the range that we see in the media every day\nEvery time I Walk into a polling place hey how ya doing everybody's laugh and joke

the today because it's been pretty crowded and then just you know one right up and there were three or four machines that were open and went in and voted and it was done now the interesting thing is I was wondering since I'm a college campus for young people voting\n... because number one I never felt that was my real number two I never thought the people that were listening to what I had to say had to be encouraged\nAbout well this is the great thing about especially our audience I I think the the the people that listen to our show and and and especially I think beyond or just new listeners the ones that have been with us for\nA while I Believe there you know we're all\nKind of standing in the in that same line ... ... ... were were part of that that same mentality and again they're they're leaving themselves I Know they don't need me to say and they know they don't need me to say it and that's the great thing there is that um that that understanding and and the only thing I\nAnd I think I mean we might have discussed this before the the only thing that I think that you know war needed for is the fact that there are busy doing their jobs\nThey've got their jobs they got their families\nAnd our job any of them were eating right now right in and and and our job is the fact that we have\nWe have time to pay attention to everything so we can articulate what's going on to them\nSo in a in a condensed sense they can get an idea of what's going on every single day and what's going on in the issues in a different form that they get from anything else and and I would say that's about it now and I'm so glad that I can do that because I think that's a great thing to be able to do\nWell that's you know makes me feel useful [laughter] yeah exactly I mean that that that's

points\nSo ah the you know here's the other side of I guess and not a lot of media on on that obviously the media was on everything else that was going on uh with the suspicious packages and everything but\nYou or the administration and they're they're probably looking at this going okay as we go and get what a you know again twelve days out from the mid term\nThey need to build some momentum so they need to I guess return uh some of that a positive stuff to back to the market uh we'll see where it goes uh in terms of ah any kind of rebound later today or or maybe next week if that has to happen\nBut you can bet there watching this and a lot of it has to do with trade and tariffs\nSo the material costs especially the steel and aluminum right now you have and the retaliatory tariffs on\n... remember also the the I Believe the temperatures are still in effect from earlier this year on Canada timber coming until NAFTA is actually sign right or whatever it is the new out in the ... we're not calling now have you All right\nUh but as far as an end so housing has gone up you know we look at there's an apartment complex behind us\nAnd and it's I how many units are in there maybe three four hundred days it's pretty big issue Jagger a and the rate of construction every time we kept its it's almost as if it's not moving along at all and you would hire totally\nAsking why why is it going so slow is a labor is a material I've never seen a building built so slow and this is a major ... apartment developer or in North Dallas\nFor video wrote Bob here's your forecast\nWet weather that was located in the south yesterday moving into the mid Atlantic region for the later part of the day is now moving up into the northeast for this Sunday and we'll see that nor'easter

plains to provide showers from North Dakota into Wisconsin Minnesota portions of Michigan at upstate New York the south Gobi drying out today the deep south as well as the southern plains Texas dried this weekend\nThe care of them currently moving from ah the Mexico Guatemala border towards the United states gets Trump's and the Republicans a chance to double down on immigration and issue the Democrats themselves remained vulnerable on\nWhy are the Democrats vulnerable on immigration because they have not just about the attack that they are for open borders bingo\nWe've been saying for years and this is what we said pretty much throughout the show yesterday and and uh earlier this week as well they have to be positioned very clearly the question has to be asked where do you stand on the border\nThey must be\nForced to say it because it's very clear to most people but but they're going to have to answer the question what level of border enforcement do you support\nWhat don't use the word comprehensive\nExactly what do you support we know you don't want the wall that's a given what do you support we know what you don't want what do you want [noise]\nHe said again I've argued outs where the party should have embraced an immigration compromise where the wall would be built\nIn exchange for a pathway to citizenship for the eleven to twelve million immigrants not here legally remember he's a lifelong\nUh uh you know a Democrat and a former Democratic pollster just you understand but that's really a lot of what we said that we have ... as we've said yesterday and I believe the day before on on the whole caravan thing this is a perfect opportunity for the Republicans and the president\nTo back them into a corner\nAnd go after the Democratic leadership and state what do you want because I still hear it from Democrats what we need to have a comprehensive immigration reform and nobody ever asked them what that means right what does that mean specifically what do you want\nAnd he talks about it here are I Would you be for the would you be for a pathway to citizenship for the immigrants that are here and then a wall is to be built and anybody who comes here in the future must go back and\nAre you for that\nBut you can't we have said it's impossible to have a debate right now and has been for the last Thirteen Years yeah because when you when I came on this show together the issue we had to go back and looked at this yesterday in the history of our show the first thing that we really discuss was a\nWas a a a Kennedy a McCain McCain Kennedy mhm which was the amnesty that was two thousand five just if they they made the decisions to couple of weeks after you and I started working together right\nAnd so for Thirteen Years of Democrats have not had to tell the American public where they stand on illegal immigration what\nWould they do what with their plan be thinking about this and that by the way that the Republican failure mhm because the Republicans should be demanding every ... every time they talk about illegal immigration it shouldn't be the Democrats ... ... it should be as we've said\nYou make the accusation Democrats wide open borders and when they cry you our line fine then you tell me specifically what kind of deal you would want done\nIssue them the challenge and that's what it was shown as saying here that again they haven't had to answer\nThey haven't had to they don't then they some of them don't agree with the open borders but they don't denounce it either and he also talked about the elimination of ice how you had that and there wasn't a massive response from Democrats saying well that's ridiculous you don't get rid of ice\nYou don't get rid of border enforcement in this country that's ridiculous that the American public and even Democrats a significant portion of Democrats one border security they may have compassion for people that are here\n\nAnd want to have compassion when it comes to even legal immigration but as we brought it to your attention\nThe demographics that want the least legal immigration into this country are blacks and Hispanics ...\nWhen you look at the polling as to the number of when you go the demographics and you see the the numbers\nOf of\nMinorities in this country who want the lowest level of legal immigration that even from has never talked about mhm\nIt's minorities the vast majority of them the huge vast majority of them who vote Democrat mhm\nNo the American people stand with the president on border enforcement they do he's winning that politically but the other side of it is is that\nHe's winning that politically but\nThe other side of it is is that the Democrats have not been forced to to say what they want at all you do with the president wants you know with the Republicans want\nAnd and I think that in the entire first off you have to go and you have to be you have to go after the Democrats and say\nAnd you have to you have to force them and backed them into a corner and as I said uh get in their face yesterday rhetorically is what I said I don't mean physically but rhetorically and make them answer back them against the wall so they have no choice\nTo either you made your point that they're for open borders or they have to respond and give you the specifics that they do not\nThe second thing is sort of what Trump is doing already when he's talking about the care of and saying we'll pull ... we're going to pull aid from you mhm but look if you improve your country and you become more capitalistic will be the first ones here to help you write\n\nSo we can't take in the entire world but this is where you need to start focusing on those governments in those countries and saying we're here to help you help your own people from\nThere\nBut you need to embrace free markets you need to you need to do something yes\nBy the way also we when we talk about the imagery you know the the one picture that came out with the hunter and flag ... and all that and so people start question why do you want to come here right do you want to come here to become citizens or is it just to work and then you know go back and then we have to have that discussion as to well what do we want from people who come over here\nAs citizens but first before you even get to any of those other things that I'm Talking about you have to find out what the other major party actually once when it comes to illegal immigration and border enforcement we're not even to that point no how can you have a discussion when only one side\nHas said it has put forth plans of what they want and the other side\nWon't go after they're part of the party than endorses open borders and just keeps quiet on it will silence does your consent yes silence is your consent saying get rid of ice is your consent we're not going to get rid of border enforcement in the United states so why are you preaching that\nNow that stuck with shown whose looks like to me is the longtime Democrat\nWho are about to use Claire McCaskill's verbiage a isn't a crazy Democrat or\nA says of course the rank and file Democrats the average person who voted Democrat and they want border control sure\nIn fact the constituency the votes most Democrat most the time actually to get out of illegal immigration in the legal immigration is a demographic that once the least legal immigration into this country look\nYou have a sanctuary city policies thanks for each state policy sanctuary county policy by Democrats have been promoting it for a long long time and now you have the you know abolish ice protest\nThey they're saying it but they're not forced to say the words open borders\nThey should say they should be forced to say because that's what they're promoting and if they're not where's the pushback if they're promoting border enforcement at any level\nTell me who\nAnd I mean the ... from the party that is actually saying that in promoting it is Chuck Schumer promoting that Nancy Pelosi\nOr they promoting that may be a Joe Manchin we haven't heard him but we have you know there might be one or two maybe clear [laughter] you know she's not one of those crazy Democrats but where's the party saying this is what we want\nBecause that's the official political battle\nHow can we how can we have a debate on illegal immigration and border enforcement when the other side won't officially tell us what they would ... what they want right except for those that are in the party to promote open borders and\nThe elimination advice they won't even have the debate why right\n\nAnd that's what Republicans Republicans have a Thirteen Years the pound on Democrats for it and they failed miserably in them in that role of doing so right they have another

Capitol Hill screening facility and Marilyn water set in a statement that the Capitol police are told her that her Washington DC office was the target a suspicious package\nThat has been referred to

rendered the package\nAt the male facility safe and investigation will be turned over to\nThe FBI so that's the latest said we\nA have a right now a again a the one thing\nThat is a bit I I think uh\nEverybody wants to know is worthy ally bombs were the Israel Bonds now we must admit that ah that the national review story that has overnight gone viral on social media\nThey're saying the powder was harmless you know that that's what the source said the powder was harmless they didn't even mention about\nThe suspected potentially explosive package they didn't say that either way\nRight on that one so uh again that's you know that's what we deal with\nAnd you know we saw yesterday but you saw it again you saw from CNN you saw it from the the the Democrats are you know we're picking were well you really couldn't pick and choose the facts but she didn't have any\nVery few very and when do we know these devices were sent we know who they were sent to we know what the authorities have told us already at the problem when you start getting these so called experts and and and they are experts otherwise you but you can't be an expert about the situation unless you're investigating it yourself\nAnd there were plenty of them on television yesterday\nSaying well it looks like see what you've got here and what you got here okay there are certain things you can tell from the pictures you can tell while it was um you can tell the like the label on the packaging that went to see Annette well\nWe know it had Brennan's name on it we know it was addressed to CNN we can see certain things\nBut in terms of\nThe the bomb experts that Ron well here's what it looks like still doesn't tell us the facts what it appears to be and what it might be for what it actually is could be two different things\nWhat what gets me the most though is again the people the cry that you know there are the\nUm\nAre the arbiters of fairness and they're against divisiveness while at the same time they are ...\nYeah I'm\nThere the arbiters of fairness and they're against divisiveness while at the same time they are ... their their behavior is the most divisive which is Trump is responsible for this and you have no idea who did this you have no idea the auto idea who did it and you're claiming you're against divisiveness\nYou're against it and you you have this kind of surety you're trying to proclaim and you're being the most divisive in that moment\nAnd it's so obvious and they seemed to be completely and totally clueless are unaware that it's like I'd die you're just saying you're against the divisiveness yet you are committing the ultimate scent of divisive is like blaming somebody and you don't have any of the facts you don't know what the facts are\nAnd you've already come

until a dead heat yeah it is it is is a dead heat and so the fascinating thing about uh this radio ad\nIs what is said in it where there's you'll hear two men talking\nAnd they're talking about you know a Josh Hawley and the problems with him that\nUh the claim as he gets wind and works out during work hours which we've found really interesting per cent of race to be the main accusation and an ad that clearly is a\nDesperation at yeah they were just why not that he\nDrinks water you want to he purchased wind purchased wind and went to work out right uh and when you're an attorney general which probably your hours\nYou're probably a salaried workers were just as your as your state a salaried employee yet yeah uh but [laughter] but I I'm thinking that that that's it but so do we know we'll we'll play coming up on after\nVote it's you can use real real people but that's not what they did here they're trying to portray real people with the sentiment of people um and they probably couldn't find it to be\nWhat am I I Will set it at all I mean with if you look at the the issue that they were concerned about most in that at a uh it was terrorists yes and we've talked about the mid west but something that we talked about yesterday that the the the the the farmer\nThat is some of the backbone of the Trump support Democrats are going directly out because of their loss of business because of the the the terrorists mostly due to the Chinese so it is something we we ... we were you brought that up in the last couple of days when we talk about okay what might affect the Democrats\nTo help them win or what might affect the Republicans to help them win what is the strategy that they're using but in that ad\nIt was terrorists twice\nHere's the interest interesting question outside of farmers that that was targeted to in Missouri\nIf you went up to the average person in the street and said what do you think about terrorists do you think they'd have any idea what they were in a nation we're Seventy five percent of the American public cannot tell you what the three branches of government are\nYeah um you know it's it it really is about the president's I guess in the state of the industry the particular industry right and and and that is the case in in huge farm states it even if you're not a farmer\nUm you know what I don't ... yeah right wow you know like you know to you know the effect on the farmers and they weren't very vocal about it if you're in that said even if you're not a former\nAh you know again depending on the impacts and they they felt it was worth\nUh making that point ah which you know we'll see if if that point works out or if if any of this works here within two weeks\n[noise] it's\nA I I think the most notable point is the word crazy yeah because it is it it that positioning was I'm not going the way of of others in my party because keep in mind she she's not trying to position this and this is her\nYou heard her say she approves this message this is her campaign that\nShe's not saying the people that are protesters\nShe's referring to her ... her party and\nWe have to point out that we've pointed out you know over the last several weeks these are the mainstream high ranking members of the party that she's referring to here\nIn terms of the word crazy that's what that's what they're trying to\nHow they're trying to do the positioning hear that word is very important because it likely came back and research\nAnd we made the point earlier that it wasn't she didn't use the word I'm not with the extreme part of my party or she didn't say I don't always agree\nYou know uh you know with my my party in it no so I wrote a writing again it wasn't it ... the men having the conversation didn't say look she doesn't always agree with her party and there's some extreme as you know in there that she doesn't she's it was the term\nAs you brought up and so rightly\nIt was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat and then she rejects the crazy\nAs you brought up and so rightly\nIt was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat and then she rejects the crazy Democrats you had to be put in to that ad right\nWhere the momentum they believe might be moving towards Holly and not her that's a desperate tactic because they're looking at the ... and remember this would be in the undecided voters more independent undecided voters\nWho they are looking to sway one way and it's it's a desperate ... it's a Hail Mary throw Eric is what it is yes I got to let these people know I'm not part of the crazy Democrats right\nYeah because what they're thinking that's one of the things that's coming back to their polling is the independents ... ... they're they're they're looking at holiday because they think you're part of the crazy Democrats my not part of the crazy Democrats right but it's using that term crazy Democrats specifically and not\nA you know not radical not yet a extreme cause extreme if something is is a term that Democrats have used a lot\nAnd it's All right and it's almost a mainstream if you will term word right ah but\nThis is this is also something we pointed out weeks ago during the Kavanaugh saying is that it doesn't matter that\nYou're not a Cory Booker it doesn't matter that you're not a ...\nA list of this war and or just you know pick a number of them that are in the Senate\n\nOr that are Democrats that could be you know I guess people were describing clearly as crazy Democrats I think we have a close\nAides because their actions and and we said this a few weeks ago their actions go outside of their state in terms of the race right they will uh taint the races and other states but especially\nOf course those that are neck and neck and and I don't know I mean there's or maybe one or two but this this race is probably one of the closest in the Senate if not the closest according to the polls right now the latest polls we have\nSo that the effect is is that come out with Harris or or or Elizabeth Warren or any of them\nThey whatever they do is going to affect those races those other races and those\nPeople in the ... the state of Missouri maybe looking at this going what or may not have anything against Claire McCaskill but I don't want her party having that control because she might vote with at some point a Kamala Harris or you know a side with\nAs you're crazy Democrats she as she just did as having you're outside [laughter]\nAnd which is the perfect example and that's the thing\nThat endorsement in fact you point out something that is key here that is likely that action yes one action we talked about it before the vote happened\nWhere does she go on this well she made the choice to go because she didn't want to lose those Democrats in her state that did support the no vote but it's not those Democrats and and it's you know it's it's that scale the tips\nYou know the the water balloon you squeeze it on one side he goes to the other if she loses Democrats\nThan it doesn't matter of the people in the middle are going to be with her and if she can't get them right now she acted as one of the crazy Democrats whip that no vote she can dome that behavioral Lenny we saw during the cop Kavanaugh process and and that's\n... I'm I'm Wondering what the effect would be again on an undecided independent and we've been getting ourselves into trouble because people have when we've been talking about\nYou know how you're trying to win an election people think we're talking about how we think and how they should think and we're not we're talking about probably people who don't listen to our show mhm we're talking about the election strategy we're talking about the undecided independents right here in undecided independent\nWho's looked at the cabinet thing and so they're crazy I mean they're they're really crazy and I can't vote for her\nYou know a Claire McCaskill and that's and then that's what the ... coming back ... bad may be received by these people just say you're just lying to me right you are one of the crazy Democrats but you're willing to call your entire party crazy that you're that you belong with because you just want my vote right\nBut you actually don't believe that they're crazy right you don't believe they're crazy you actually agree with them this just shows you the lame the way you will do you will call your own party crazy in order to get the vote and then you'll be trained me when you get into office and you'll vote with the crazy Democrat and with that vote on Kavanaugh\nThat was also condoning their behavior is not you know all of that that's the that's the evidence to back up their opinion yup coming to that conclusion just have it all just prove that eight six six Ninety right I\nWas pretty much stand regardless it's radio [noise]\n\nIf you have driven over one million

trade partners as having an impact on\nOn business so overnight as it is up and which I which you might expect uh all the Asian markets are down one percent three the three percent for the Japanese market down three percent a Shanghai up a little bit above ... percent there\nA you're a mixture of over in Europe so we'll see whether it's just a correction whether there's really worry\nWe know there was in the housing market and we know for example but you know Ford coming down and and St look thanks\nWe'll see whether it's just a correction whether there's really worry we know there is in the housing market and we know for example about you know Ford coming down and and saying look thanks for all the thanks for all the help with the tax cuts but the terrorists are killing us\nAnd and there's something like what happened yesterday on the news playing out makes a lot of people nervous and and of course the the markets because one possible you have to consider is that it was a foreign enemy a that was that was involved are responsible\nFor these suspicious packages and and the the concern that it might not be over or something else might happen we it was a lot of uncertainty yesterday so some of that is built in to that drop I mean you often see that if there is something that that is happening\nUh as as big of a news story as as you saw yesterday that does make the the market's very nervous so uh we'll see where it\nWell and that's something that was you know was was brought up the yesterday by you know some of the experts say look you know there's there's three things that could be it could be somebody in their right it could be somebody and they left it could also be a foreign entity right\nYou know just to disrupt the American you know an electoral above a process or it could be just terrorists now who have decided to do it again which that's that's why we find it surprising that are so late into this because it's been three days since the ...\nA bomb initially that\nNobody has stated whether these were active lie bombs that would have gone off right if the if somebody would have touched it in a different way right apparently they were handled it didn't go off\nWell because I Would think that if there was a threat of these devices going off whether they could be set off a remotely or by the handling the package itself that we would see that warning come out by authorities would we not\nYeah because if we learned that that was the case and they didn't warn the public and there was still a possibility of such devices being in the mail system or being out there in in the public and it's still being a threat to the public\nBeyond that the intended recipient recipients over the past few days that they would want to get that message out and and we would be hearing that I Would think that and if we hear that that you know that they were armed and and they didn't say at the most someone's going to have to answer them for on a track here's your forecast\nWet weather that was located in the south yesterday moving into the mid Atlantic region for the later part of the day is now moving up into the northeast for this Sunday and we'll see that nor'easter provide some more showers hugging along the east coast\nAs well as a system out of Canada providing showers for the northeast and Great Lakes\nAnd that system will sweep as far back as the northern plains to provide showers from North Dakota into Wisconsin Minnesota portions of Michigan at upstate New York the south Gobi drying out today the deep south as well as the southern plains Texas dried this weekend\nWas interesting too so I understand uh the the the fact of of using the pre existing conditions because all Democrats are using that Schumer said we've got to go and we got to hit that so you knew that was going to be the messaging or\nNot you're not surprised or shocked but very interested in the fact that the biggest issue was mentioned twice was the terrorists now I don't know why you take valuable time because if if you believe as a Democrat that the tariffs\nThat are on products that are hurting farmers in the mid west\nAnd you believe in and you you've you've mentioned it\nYou know white okay because you believe it's important you also know or you believe is we we instead this way back when in springtime\nA we know we've said this when when the way before that we said this one the Republicans passed the health care bill we said don't be surprised if it comes back and it's a negative against you not a positive anymore but as used against you in in the mid term elections and it has been mhm\nSo you've got bad and you've got the terrorists that you believe you mentioned it twice in there because you believe that there's a significant number of people who might be attractive to that anti terror message\nThat Trump has been so louder mhm\nWhy are you throwing it in wasting any valuable time commercial about when he's on the job he went apparently the claim is he went and bought wine and went to the gym anybody knows that when you're an attorney general here\nWhen he's on the job he went apparently the claim is he went and bought wine and went to the gym anybody knows that when you're an attorney general here ... you don't work hourly you're not you're a you're you're\nYou're really you're on your ever\nOn I work here and there are more All right so if you're sitting there and say oh okay I'm going wrong gotta stop by and and get a bottle of wine or something like that or I go to the gym during the day because that's a lot of the day when\nBest time to go or you know but but that's it if they didn't ... there was no real focus honestly they would have been better to leave that out completely and joke goes straight onto the crazy Democrat well maybe they maybe they should have mentioned the crazy Democrat twice\nAnd by the way I was just thinking the law and order ... uh uh you know didn't didn't or I Can't think of his name and then he ended up running for da\nJak yeah jak ran for Diego he was he became ... ... ... ... should never use the fact that they they ring ring or are in their office the whole time that we've always talked a lot of them on TV [laughter] they drink coffee after every case win or lose try to run their drinking at the end of the day and they're often not wine\nBy ... it was hard liquor they're always drinking [laughter] we thought\nAnd so when I heard that when it come on a hey come on if they're\nIf they're prosecutors they all drank a [laughter] but but yet when we had ... getting back to the ad\nAnd you said there certainly are on the show that because we focused in on using the term crazy Democrat instead of using the term extremists Democrat yes ... leadership of the Democrat address\nRight there's the verbiage is clearly some kind of response that they've got verbatim they were hearing that repeatedly that phrase crazy Democrats by people in their cola ups the in their internal were showing that this was the day you know this was a way a hot button\nThat they could connect to some of those undecideds right now those independents who were leaning right at that moment and the concern they had was the crazy Democrats the ... that's that's why that was used\nIt was used and directly came from a likely from that that kind of caught on research response that you get\nThe because there's there's no other way to do there is no other reason\nTo put that in and that that becomes what the Hail Mary in this really neck and neck dead heat race in Missouri it is I mean it's out of all of them I think it's probably a if it's not the closest it's pretty ... pretty close to the closest Senate race right now uh so\nI think it's it's um\nClear that they want him to connect with those people that are leaning right that her independence that are winning right might otherwise vote for him the castle the problem in that is for her actions is specifically with with capital because in fighting with her party in Kavanaugh\nYou were condoning that kind of behavior right and you can come out and say no I just wasn't sure and I need to be short when we see that doesn't sorry perception is reality especially\nAnd and and this kind of situation that is that is going to end could well that issue decide and many of these races the uh the outcome of the the Kavanaugh situation\nAnd and when you look at the polling there in in Missouri to begin with a a if you look at the September polling\nA you know or the CNN a McCaskill was up by by uh by three with a with likely voters and you get to the Fox news poll which was\nUp until a was nine twenty nine to ten to and it was a tie and then you know through that whole time the cabin all thing and moves misery scout a huge sample of of over twelve hundred likely voters\nAnd holy up one still margin of error is to point seven right uh and still nobody has hit the fifty percent mark so there's still a ton of undecided there the\nUsing that term crazy Democrats a Democrat using that in an ad by the way apparently ticked off other Democrats in Missouri I was reading an article on that earlier a but using that term means that the undecideds are talking about it\nThe undecided that's part of their mindset\nYeah you know the Democrats are crazy these are crazy Democrats now that had to come directly from cabinet yeah because for that to be too late for that to go to the level of\nUh from fringe to extremists\nToo I just read my leadership too crazy Democrats mean that exact term they're not stir crazy that is the mindset that they view when a significant portion\nOf undecided independents in Missouri that she's trying to get aboard I'm not part of the Democrats I'm not part of the crazy Democrats I'd I I I think for myself I'll go to the middle I Will compromise which means mutt you'll compromise with Republicans and\nYeah\nYou know it's it's a ... this is why you have this race that you have here it's not because her opponent is is is this big great strong opponent\nIt's because there's weakness across the board and [laughter] it is bipartisan we in nature I mean she's giving she's get of course they're they're Republicans in that state that would never vote for uh the cast is you know that that that's a given\nBut those people in the middle and this is what we've been talking about for a long long time those are the ones that may vote one way or the other insurance for one party or the other\nThey're the ones you have to convince they're the ones that get you over the top and right now she has too many weaknesses that ... that are that really don't serve her well with either side and I think that comes directly or certainly her vote on Kavanaugh was an indication of\nThat weakness if if it didn't help create well you know there's it's it's one thing you know you you can uh the ... the uh\nInsults the ah the accusations against Donald Trump being crazy being not you know everything that you remember him to the whole mental health things that has sort of disappeared hasn't it\nYeah but he's mentally ill and all that was you know you can look at that and you say okay that's that's an attack that's always thrown at at one person the president always gets that yeah but we're talking about a political party as a whole\nWe've been talking about the the the Democrats from twenty six team where they said look we've got to go and figure out what the people the heartland as are going and we said back then we said\nYeah but they're they're talking crazy stuff they're talking you know the whole transgender saying well\nWe have compassion for everybody but if you think you're a ... if you think you're a man and you're a woman doesn't make you want man and it doesn't make it home and it shouldn't make you want man legally when you shouldn't as a man be able to compete against a woman in the past majority of Americans believe that\nThe trans racial thing that they started adopting President Obama before he left office talking about the fact that he's come to know that race is a social construct no one's not\nPresident Obama before he left office talking about the fact that he's come to know that race is they social construct though it's not right and and so we talked about that craziness well it's gotten to the point\nIf it's no longer the Democrats in order for Claire McCaskill put that in the concern is no longer the Democrats aren't relating to the average person it's at the average person is W. when the Democrats as crazy ... and the capital thing I Believe is what put them over the top\nYeah and and and that behavior by the way as we pointed out not from protesters from from the high ranking officials and and and members of the party on those committees\nClaire McCaskill's now as a Democrat believe she's fighting against the crazy Democrats ... eight six six
