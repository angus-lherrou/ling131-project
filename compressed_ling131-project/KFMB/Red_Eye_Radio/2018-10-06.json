and I I doubt they're going to want to delay\nA much longer after that cloture vote\nIf they get fifty or more we go to Chris in battle creek Michigan Chris welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show\n[noise] and they are you good to [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWell I'm curious about and it's just something that went through my head is what do you uh what do you guys think about the idea that the whole reason\nThey held everything and that they've been doing what they've been doing and they laid the groundwork for in the hearings by a claiming that he was kind of partition and attacking them is that\nThey didn't think they were actually going to be able to stop the confirmation of Kavanaugh so what they've been doing this why underground work to once he's elected and there is on the Supreme Court from this point forward\nThey're going to claim he's part is in and try and demand that he recused himself or abstained from any votes\nMay be worth anything they want to but they they don't they can do\nHe's you know it's not he's the only person that can recused himself\n[noise] okay yeah they can't scream that\nLike you ... ... email us ...\nEmail us ... screaming all day long but they'll get nowhere getting where with it okay 'cause I heard lawyers you know try and no show that judges short recused themselves Oh yes for an hour well\nYou know when they lose the electoral vote than we should do away with the electoral college if they lose this then you know that we should do away with this process we should change the way that Supreme Court justices are seated and we should and it will be all about well we don't we didn't get our way so we should change the rules\nRight ah and by the way that\nCall happens already in the Supreme Court mhm yeah\nI Can't remember we've even there's been some cases were or even said some of the judges mhm should recused themselves or I Can't remember a specific one right ah right off the top of my head but I Know that we've talked about that in the past and I remember I Can't\nWait we're an appellate judge on a case yeah you know and before they were seated on the ... got to the court after they were seated on the high court that's happened or they argue the case or something um then the ... but again that's up to them because if if or or there\nFor example they're arguing the case of deals with the law you know with the company and their wife works for the company and writes for the economy at that point you have to recuse yourself\nBut to say as we've been we've we've heard for example well they can't he can't ruin anything that involves the Democrats because you've been part ascend and he got angry at them that's not going to hold any water\nYeah you remember when the talk about ah you know his nomination this was back during the Gorsuch nomination process or the talk was well the president should nominate his sister you know and it was like okay [laughter] she would have to recuse herself from every case\nOf that [laughter] well that company is indirectly\nWorking with my brother's company and that and you know you you get the the the whole thing and and of course you know the fact that the well she's part of his family but the\n... the\nThe process and you and I were having this discussion during the break\nThere is a great deal of respect by everyone that seated on the court right now for the process not that they make a decision that we always agree with in fact the uh well I can think of free that often make decisions we highly disagree with 'em back or for sometimes with John Roberts [laughter] but\nWe can talk about that but the procedure\nOn procedural issues all of the justice that justices that are seated right now on the high court have a great deal of respect for those procedures and how you move forward with the case or it is not it is not\nDriven like the social media world up today\nAt the Supreme Court in terms of procedure now the hearings often have these interesting comments that come out of him and questions that come out of them and then the media takes them and runs with them often out of context ah they did that with Scalia\nOr but you know there's but but still in terms of the procedure there's a great deal of respect why each of those that are ...\nAnd you know but I I think you make a great point by saying the world of the Supreme Court or even the\nFederal judges to begin with is not the social media world but I'm the I'm I'm Glad you made that comparison that is not the social media world that we live in for example most people don't know\nThat a former Justice Scalia\nAnd Ruth Bader Ginsburg were great great friends were great I'm One needs to make that their their their family their families used to\nVacation together yes that's how tight they were you could not find two polar opposites so what you what you end up getting is a there is when you get up that high in a very very unique job\nThere is even even if we can sit here and and we have and said we don't believe that this person respects the constitution\nThat there is a camaraderie that exists for the process and if you were to ask the judges privately what they believe\nAbout the process of Kavanaugh is going through right now I bet you the majority of judges would say is absolutely horrendous and should not be that way because entertains\nDoor this is my point earlier about what I Believe and how the rule came about by the Senate and two thousand nine controlled by the Democrats that keeps this process of the background checks secret and the content of the three oh two secret\nIs likely because of exactly what we're seeing right now and that is if this uh if some content came out just imagine that we never her doctor Ford's name but the plane came out what they would do is look at that and go okay well is there anybody backing it up\nBecause the claim would be in the three oh two except if they found that they couldn't find any anyone with first hand knowledge of the event or the claims\nThen they would say we couldn't find anything to corroborate well\nThey know the Senate knew back then that you take something like that a simple claim that cannot be backed up and it could be it could derail the entire process and that's exactly what we're looking at but\nHere's here's the point that nobody's talked about with all the federal judge ships alter forget about the Supreme Court just the federal judge ships out there that background checks are done\nHow many thousands of claims that are on cooperated when you think about the federal federal judiciary out there\nAnd the process that they have to go through\nThe background checks that are done how many thousands or tens of thousands of allegations are made that are uncooperative did I ordered to defeat somebody\nAnd never get known to the public eye only reason this one did was because Dianne Feinstein said okay this is going to be the exception to the rural ... we would normally never do this this is against complete protocol what I'm doing complete rules the Senate complete protocol we don't do this but I'm doing this because\nThe end justifies the means in this case we cannot allow a five to four majority\nThat is a more construction is well journalists core and then learning\nOf this this rule now it puts it all into perspective she knew that if she turned Feinstein if she turn this information over to the FBI the fat as a part of the official process it would've it would have been in the official three oh to report and you wouldn't hear about it\nWhen it would've never it would have you know that's the ... when you think about that that's the whole point\nNobody would have ever known that this existed right her name would have never come out because everything would have been on ... ... we're not that would not have been able to collaborate and then at that point\nIt dies just like probably the thousands of other allegation yes and you know that have come out against other federal judges and Supreme Court justices\nThe decades and that's that's it because you could you could start easily a smear campaigns simple\nSimply with a claim now now what makes sense as to why Feinstein for her political you're white worked to her end\nAnd and for her side at least up to this point why it was more important to leak to the media and certainly you could not take it to the FBI because if that were in the report of the three oh two we wouldn't hear about it\nNow you know why Lindsey Graham was

never conservatives to Kevin I'll Fight isn't about Trump we're all deplorable now right and and uh you know make a great point in the number conservatives are the left by the way they've got that doesn't matter it's got nothing to do with Trump this has nothing to do with Trump\nAnd and we have talked about how this has United the ... the Republican parties and the different factions and even the never Trump hers and it has it has helped to unite them\nBack to coming home to the Republican Party and a couple of things that they wrote here they said Democrats were so worried about Senate norms that they hid\nMrs Ford's name from Republicans for six weeks found or a lawyer midwife the lie detector test who's results they still haven't fully disclosed an orchestrated the ... of accusations\nMr Trump's rhetoric is too often divisive in this assembling but no action in his presidency comes close to matching the hardest and viciousness of the Senate ambush of Brett Kavanaugh\nThese are today's democratic norms mhm\n... says the media sometimes for best to be puzzled that more than eighty percent of Republicans across the country tell pollsters they support Mr Trump despite his personal flaws\nThe never conservatives which is a left or the reason and the assault on judge Kavanaugh is the latest showcase the mess that methods Republicans have figured out\nThat if the left can willfully even gleefully destroy a man as distinguished us Brett Kavanaugh they can and will do it to any conservative who threatens their grip on power sure\nRepublicans are well aware of Mr Trump's excesses and false village but they have also come to understand that the resistance to him is not rooted in principle\nOr some August called to superior character they know Democrats nominated Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen despite her history of deceit voters know this\nIs about the less will to power by any means necessary Republicans across America can see and certainly there are senators voting on judge Kavanaugh should realize that the left hates them as much or more\nThan they load Mr Trump conservatives understand that and for the American left they're all deplorable\n... yeah I think that's a I think it's a great piece and right on target which is why you see I think more of a United front much more uh more United front than I can remember with Republicans in a long long time\nA ... here and it's more than just about this it is about the fact that they now understand how far the left will go what the left is about ... and that's it and and\nWe come up with all the ideas and everybody listens to us yes they take all the credit\n[laughter]\nSo we are to blame for nothing but important people weren't listening [laughter] well we're all in that were to blame for this country is right now [laughter] always that our listeners are the most important people on the planet and and they are I'm Talking about the non politicians [laughter] All right and and the other the other breaking\nNews and and this is really huge when you think about the whole Russia investigation over the last of a couple of years\nOr this it's been a you know a reported that there was an explosive testimony uh yesterday by a you know Well hi FBI law enforcement official a former official well the hill dot com John Solomon\nOr has released the name and the details he says congressional investigators have confirmed\nBut a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election which would make it right before the search warrant they got the search warrant targeting Trump's campaign came out a\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met during the twenty six teams season with at least one attorney from Perkins Kuwait the Democratic National Committee private law firms\nJust we we like to do this because we can do within twenty seconds just so in case everybody know nobody knows it's the Democrats that ... ... you know they accused or the Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack the election\nOkay remember that was the original or a charge what we found out since that time\nWas and nobody disputes what I'm going to tell you right now that the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign gave money to their law firm ... law firm ... who then gave the money to an opposition research firm\nCalled fusion GPS which then hired a former British spy\nChristopher Steele who then got information he claims from\nPeople Russians very close to the crumbling which was unverified still to this day and verified in order to uh destroy the reputation of Donald Trump\nDuring the campaign to hurt the election and when they couldn't do it to destroy the legitimacy of his election after he was elected\nA lot of that information and that dossier promote we know it was the major source for getting the secret warrant to spy on the Trump campaign\nAnd so now we know that right before that the FBI\nLead counsel met\nWith the law firm Perkins Cooley\nThat really when you look at it they're the ones that started you know the the money started flowing from the DNC and the Hillary campaign and we've gotten to the law firm they were well the ones that were distributed to fusion GPS I mean they were you can look at them and say OK they were the lead organizers\nRight and I would counsel for the FBI do that I mean if you if you said an investigation was ongoing and looking into it and lead agents were there to question the the the I guess the principles of that law firm and others in that law firm\nThat would be you could just easily I guess\nA compartmentalize that as part of an investigative\nProcess why would\nWhy would the counsel for the FBI do they say well as well as he says to talk about the allegations of the Donald Trump Russia collusion or just weeks before the twenty sixteen election but it was lawyers\nMeeting with lawyers right why why not an agent's asking some questions of the attorneys no it was attorneys and attorneys meeting so former FBI\nGeneral counsel James Baker while he was with the FBI or met during the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney for ... the Democratic National Committee\nThese private law firm ... that's the term used by the DNC and Hillary's campaign to secretly pay\nResearch firm fusion GPS was unpaid Christopher Steele the former British spy compiled the dusty a oven cooperated raw intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed a Bible testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation by Republicans on the house judiciary and government oversight committees the sources tell a John Solomon from the hill dot com\nIt means the FBI had good reason to suspect that dossier was connected to the ... main law for them and and it was the product of a democratic opposition research effort to defeat Trump yet failed to disclose that information to the Pfizer court in October twenty sixteen\nThis is a bombshell that shows the real collusion was between the FBI and Donald Trump's opposition the DNC Hillary and the Trump hating British Intelligence officer\nTo hide the Jack the election rather than some conspiracy between ... and Trump a source told John Oliver\nBaker then was interviewed\nA Jim Baker was interviewed a by lawmakers behind closed doors yesterday sources declined to divulge the testimony others uh other than to say it confirmed other evidence about the contact between the Perkins Kuwait law firm\nAnd the FBI we've often stated that said I mean it's it's mind boggling and when you think about it is a movie it's not a movie\nThis this could be twenty four\nYeah you can do a couple of seasons ago you could do probably more seasons then law and order a couple of seasons of it because we've always broken down\nAnd since we've been on for such a long time I do believe that you know you could include us in the group that was first in asking so many of the important questions on this but when you think about it it was the Democrats that we're accusing Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack end or change because of change then to hack\nAnd or to change the outcome of the election and then in reality what you find out it was completely the opposite the people the party that was making the accusation they were the ones yeah\nWho colluded with the Russians to get dirt on Trump and verified information still today yes\nAnd by the way if it's unverified as far as I'm concerned this long the vast majority of it it's false after I've ever over after over two years right so and and and so they did it to destroy his campaign and when they couldn't do that\nIt was destroyed the legitimacy of a lead shit presidential election in the United states and they tried to do it by taking that information\nThat information and and just do well faking it as intelligence instead of opposition research to the Pfizer court to spy on the Trump campaign exactly the accusations they and they don't make it against Trump\nYes they still make the say he's treasonous for Russian collusion right and when you look at it the actual Russian collusion was completely from the other party and all those things that I just brought up right now\nAll the way to the whole Pfizer court you everybody knows it's true I don't know of anybody decide or or that as\nIt tried to even debated especially after the you know the work done by Sarah a quarter and Solomon and others at circuit news or when you started seeing some of the documents that were that were coming out um and what was going on the behavior of the previous administration I mean so many of these pieces of the puzzle that have come together in the last two years here's the problem\nWith having something go on for so long where it is active because it is still active Mueller and his team are still working which means it's still\nRelevant even though right now and the left they've gone very quiet on it\nIs that you have more time to shed light on the truth\nThat's a problem for anyone who may be guilty of doing anything illegal in this entire scenario what\nYou think about it I Can't even apply to what's going on with the allegations against cabinet right\nThe longer that you go on and you looked at the you know the allegations that have been made the story starts falling apart as more\nInvestigations go on as you've seen you know with the uh the uh uh you know Evan Eddie's right a a thing and then you sit there and as time goes by and you see that it still remains\nYou know a no cooperation for these particular stories right they they go nowhere ... and so the longer time that you do with whether it's you know you're you're able to find out more of the truth\nAnd like I said more of the truth of what we have seen it but the Democrats dead wood Stein Feinstein did you know the the the fact of you and I talked about this earlier the fact that\nThey actually could have kept her name secret yes now that we know how background checks for gun yet and they keep it ... they could have kept her name sacred now I mean all the processes yes they could have done it and she chose not to and

other evidence secured by a joint investigation of Republicans on the house just jury and government oversight committee\nThe sources told a John Solomon or\nThe other thing is the Baker was interviewed just yesterday by lawmakers behind closed doors Wednesday and sources declined to divulge the testimony other other than to say it confirmed\nOther evidence about the contact between Perkins could we law firm\nAnd the FBI the sources also said bakers interview broke new ground above the FBI's use of news media\nIn twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen to further the Trump case and about deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein ... uh conversations in spring of twenty Seventeen regarding possible use of the body while you're to record Trump\nThe interview was one of the most productive\nWe've had and it opened up many new investigative leads one source said another said Baker could not answer some questions the FBI\nAbout FBI media contacts citing ongoing investigation by

and Justice Department have withheld from the public about their collaboration and ...\nRationing collusion with clearly partisan elements of the Clinton campaign the DNC fusion GPS and steel that we're trying to defeat Trump and so that is you know breaking news because what you have that you have you have the first person from\nThe last administration the Obama administration\nThat worked in the FBI you have them now on the record yeah according to John Solomon test to find the tie in we were ... there's no reason\nIf you're investigating Donald Trump to be talking to the ... lawyers private lawyers\nJust before you got the secured worn right Internet your investigation going on and he apparently that's what the sources say he said they talked to they talk to ... the lawyer specifically about the allegations of Trump and collusion why why would that be I Would that be\nSo that she was breaking news other news and we'll talk more about that I'm sure in the upcoming days or they just want to get in Saudi Arabia has increased crude production significantly to a near record level amid intense pressure from US President Donald Trump to reduce prices this from Bloomberg now\nOver ... largest producer is currently pumping about ten point seven million barrels a day the energy minister told reporters on Wednesday that just shy of the record set\nIn November of twenty sixteen before the kingdom and allies including Russia agreed to cut production to boost prices were meeting every single demand for barrels he said we've increased production quite significantly we just have to be responsive to demand because some would say that the market is currently over supplied he said\nAre the key insights this is from Bloomberg their analysis Saudi Arabia appears to be borrowing again to pressure from Trump\nNow we talked about this because we got we we got a couple of messages when we said that the United states now we're not we now are the leading producer of oil in the war yep we beat sought it we'd be ... every other country and somebody called up and they said well the outcome prices aren't really really low\nBecause there are other factors involved there's Venezuela a there's a sanctions against a a a a you know Iran there has been a growing economy so prices haven't gone to record lows we didn't expect them to go to record lows the whole point is\nThat when you produce your own oil here and we become a record producer of oil that's money that stays here\nWell and and you look at the again the mass of wealth expansion that were saying you have the fed chairman making the comments that the economy the future right now looks very very bright and in fact almost unbelievably good\nAt some levels well that comes from an expansion of you look at the number one I'm On the GDP and you look at the growth and everything else what's always the the number one category leading this mining which includes drilling and that oil export exploration and and energy exploration and and and production\nIs key you don't have to have a you don't have to be working in the oil fields to benefit from that and that's the whole point\nWe've been saying this for years that once we realized that the regulations only the regulations were holding us back\nThat we would start seeing a wealth expansion and I'm convinced that's exactly what will start seeing more and more that I get\nI give credit here to President Trump yet where he communicated the message to Saudi Arabia ... excuse me\nWe're there for you right we're there for you all you know are we why are we funding or military where we're there for you all the time mhm ah and whoever thought that the United states would be the leading producer of oil and couldn't convince and OPEC member Saudi Arabia the OPEC member I deal pact member [laughter] very good deal back at\nThe OPEC member right Saudi Arabia or to produce more oil if you don't think look we've criticized Trump in in in in ways\nBut we talked about when he does extremely good things we talked about the fact that no other\nThere was no other Democrat courses nor the Democrat there's no other Republican that could have gotten the cut in taxes that he got especially\nThe Twenty one percent corporate tax break no one he deserves full credit for that and he deserves full credit\nFor that right there now one other point I just wanted to make real quickly because we talked about the new NAFTA agreement and um but every weld starts to be called NAFTA you know the new trade agreement ... and we said look we have this long time ago we said one of the reasons that we are concerned [laughter] and we're ... babies\nAre one of the original terribly terribly [laughter] you know one one of the reasons that we were concerned who said look\nEventually when this agreement comes out it's not really going to be different than the agreement that that we have now ... or ... who is leading economists for the wall Street Journal the exact same thing yet in the end the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement looks like a\nLot like the old NAFTA mhm Mexico's only significant concession was on automobiles and parts rules requiring more production in North America highway higher wages for workers\nAnd potential terrorists if its exports to the U. S. exceed two point six million vehicle that even though there's a cap because her way below that now\nA yet these auto rules may have little practical significance they talked to judge Schuster of a a A L L M C automotive said some lower price models now assembled by Volkswagen miles to in a few other manufacturers in Mexico may no longer qualify for duty free entry but\nThey're not going to shift to the U.S production they may simply pay the the two point five percent tariffs and will hurt us consumers especially low income consumers in the United states\nAnd so we have said and they've said the cap on exports may discourage manufacturers from sending expanding capacity in Mexico but it won't affect current shipments\nAre they basically said it's exactly the kind of thing that we did with\nSouth Korea ... that we set these limits but we're not even reaching the limits were not close to them now and that costs limits now so it really doesn't make a difference but he said really there's not much difference in the old NAFTA as there is the new NAFTA and you build a name has been changed right and as we said all along\nAre we there's been a lot of us you know industry that has suffered because of this and you wouldn't have if you end up basically with the same deal or things that you claim are great things that can't be enforced or as we say the auto things that hurt the economy and will hurt lower income people will then was it all worthwhile", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "06"}
