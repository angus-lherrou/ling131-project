Congress said okay you know we ... this is this is the law this could Congress except the ... you know the fourteenth amendment here\nAnd so you'd have to go back to Nineteen fifty to the justice is to say OK did anybody even bring up the birthright citizenship but it didn't include it in any Congress purse or anybody who uh you know who who submitted this bill to Congress even bring that up\nBecause as far as we know that that wasn't an issue at that point why they did it more research has to be done as to why Congress did that in Nineteen fifty two and what that specifically met\nOr if if ... were to decide to define who it applies to the uh the citizenship clause if they were to define clearly Ina decision I don't think this is going to happen but if they were to do that with that no fly\nThat law from Nineteen fifty two\nThey've said is if if the law says otherwise and the constitution the fourteenth amendment or the ... all day to fourteenth amendment is clearly defined it\nIf the if the Supreme Court heard it and the Supreme Court said\nNo here's what it says than the what Congress did in fifty two would be gone that's what I mean oh yeah yeah oh yeah the ... that law also right that they could one one fell swoop\nAnd and that's the and fire protection which means that there's much you can let you have to get past that part and that it would I don't see happening no no I said earlier I don't ...

the bottom of the hour we'll but we will get to it I'm I'm Still going through some of the the reason why young people don't vote from New York magazine dot\nCom yeah because a mailing things\nReady for this gives meetings I go to Laura age Twenty one or land or Florida has never voted in high school I didn't even know or vice presidents theme was Joe Biden my high school classmates were Republicans super very vocal about it especially during the whole Romney and Obama election I realized I didn't believe everything that they were saying\nThen I Googled Republican versus Democrat I like kind of both kind enough that's why I'm an independent it wasn't until the Trump versus Hillary election that I realized how important it was to vote maybe it had to do with like society and all\n... every maybe\nEvery one I was following was like go out to vote I was in college in Massachusetts I decided that I wasn't going to go through the long process run out of state student\nTo register to vote either hectic schedule I just didn't have the time and energy it's just not that important also I didn't know how my parents would feel about the whole thing because my brother does not bode either\nSo it wasn't asked if they could help us out with the registration and mailing all the forms to us so she doesn't want to get by with their parents with\nMy mom was a Republican and my dad as a Democrat\n[laughter] I Wonder if she's ever bought a concert tickets on line [laughter]\nYou know you asked yourself okay is there anything because millennials aren't stupid if they want to go to a concert or something oh man boom they pull up the up a boom boom boom boom they've got tickets right oh voting oh no no mailing things gives ... who wrote law here's your fork out\nThere is a line of showers and thunderstorms today extending from Detroit down to Texas said we're going to see this line of showers continue to progress eastward slowly today\nAs the front becomes more pronounced will see the showers extend into Dallas in central Texas\nWith some heavy thunderstorms likely for the architects today\nA so an act of Congress can certainly be changed and overruled\nBy the court notified by the court also yeah so ... you know if if if you if you had Congress come out today\nAnd and pass a law stayed in law you know that the Nineteen fifty two law was just\nAn you know an assertion that that we believe in the fourteenth amendment but we as Congress do not believe that the fourteenth amendment covered birthright citizenship that's up to the Supreme Court\nTo decide because we don't clearly see it in the in in the text and we believe that you know and and you you pass this law and so we we you know we either we either pull that Nineteen fifty law out or we amend the Nineteen fifty law\nTo include the fact that we're not making a a a judgment on birthright citizenship because that and I I don't think you'll ever see Congress do that I'm saying they could do that for a and and then at that point the the courts would say will Congress was looking for\nWhat we believe on this to begin with now we're never going to see that that's a complete total hypothetical delusional [laughter]\nYou know delusional scenario because it's not going to happen but I'm saying they could do that but because Congress in Nineteen fifty two said that many believe that the courts will use that in order to different say no sorry I'm\nThe Supreme Court gave that opinion in Nineteen eighty Ninety eight even though it wasn't a precedent that was that it was an opinion the opinion lean that way Congress didn't object to it when they basically approve of the fourteenth amendment in the Nineteen fifty two law so sorry you don't have standing as the executive branch yeah\nThey could do lower courts can do that in the higher courts might refused to hear it\nBut it has never been my my problem is\nAnd this is where you know occasionally we'll talk about the failure of the system I believe that we as a nation need to have when you have a\nA law that clearly is that how it's been interpreted is not an amendment to the constitution which is clearly not being viewed\nBy modern society as the makers and the writers of that amendment and the people and the legislators that voted for that amendment back a hundred and fifty something years ago\nThat the Supreme Court does have to step in the times they did for they did with the second amendment that was two hundred and Thirty years yeah now a federal precedent not Supreme Court precedent but there was federal precedent in there that was date precedent to their the Supreme Court came in and said sorry uh owning a gun as an individual right\nYeah yeah yeah thank you Scott we appreciate it I because yeah that\n... the\nThe argument is often well it's been in place for so long this is what we've been doing up to this point that's really not a legal argument\nYou'll hear that if if they were to take this case that the if the let's just say this word fast tracked uh the the president issues the executive order it's challenged and gets right up to the Supreme Court and ... and quick fashion I'm In the hearings you could you're going to talk you're going to hear the impact\nBut the impact remember is on\nWould be on on on children that would be born to aliens and in in the future\nSo it's not on it's not even though we're not even talking about the legal status of anyone who was born here of to this point\nTo a parents who were here illegally that's not going to apply that's not going there is not going to be any grandfather ring of a revoking the citizenship of someone who was born here up to this point it would be those children\nBorn in the future to illegal parents and that's who would apply to and there's a certain a behavior there that is that is not immediately affected right uh we we often talk about the immediate effect like the travel ban well you and I had to go back and\nScream the word temporary how many different times because the media was making it play out like we were shutting the doors for ever\nOr on people coming from certain parts of the world and and it was in you know again it was played out and ended in a different\nIn a different way the media but it's not going to it's not going to it wouldn't be the same in in consideration fear of what the impact would be because the impact would be future\n... but I'm a I'm afraid what you're going to have is you're going to have judges look at this and say\nHas never challenged what they did in Nineteen fifty two they never said it with Congress has never or there's never been a push to change the way in Congress\nThe way that this law has been interpreted the only thing from the Supreme Court was the opinion that just was not a legal precedent that was set that they believed it was an Eighteen Ninety eight\nHas been interpreted the only thing from the Supreme Court was the opinion that is was not a legal precedent\nThat was set that they believed it was an Eighteen Ninety eight and Congress has never fought that there's never been a serious legal challenge it has been accepted that the interpretation has been there for a hundred and fifty years and you're going to have judges even construction is judges\nEven cabin on Gorsuch may look at it and say well there really hasn't been a fight over this the second amendment there's always been a fight over a fight going on constantly for that and constant precedent being set on that on birthright citizenship\nMaybe not so much and they may look at it and say it's been this way for a hundred and fifty years it is a specific law about a specific type of behavior that we allow were gun rights could be every ... she was a different issue in a different law in a different state\nAnd they might look at it and say this is pretty clear that the interpretation whether the author wanted or not but the interpretation taken an accepted by the country for a hundred and fifty years even if the author that was not what the author of the amendment thought\nIt's been accepted all the way back not just recently that it should be changed that back in Nineteen Ninety eight that was their\nOpinion of the Supreme Court\nAnd a lot of judges just don't want to touch it because they don't want to be the ones that change what they believe the country has come to a consensus up rightly or wrongly I'm just saying that's what they would that's what I think where I think it's\nGoing to go ...\nAnd it's a shame because you know and these things will happen in in any uh you know any republic any constitutional republic where a lot can be passed it will be vegan somebody will take an interpretation and it isn't challenged\nWell and and that's that's what I Would say is that the ... it doesn't matter what society it doesn't matter how new or old the challenges if it's a new challenge that's never in a new challenge means that no one has ever stepped up to travel\nI I I agree with you on that is why it took two hundred Thirty years to get you know that guns are and you know you have an individual right to bear arms in this country\nYeah trendy Eighteen Ninety eight case would be different because you had parents who were here legally you didn't have the question of right what about the parents who aren't here\nRight legally but the opinion there was an opinion written which wasn't a precedent that made the claim that they're running that ad recorded which may be used and said okay that opinion was out there it's not legal precedent for but nobody ever\nIn challenge that and they were doing it at that time they were still allowing even at that point you can be an illegal immigrant in this country and since it's been going on for ... it's not like it stopped for\nA hundred years and then came back again magically mhm that's the problem\nRight bullet hasn't been challenged ah\nSo that's the question do we ignore it because it hasn't been challenged because nobody challenged it or not one sought to to find that claws well\nI I agree with you I Will leave without question you have somebody on a ... look\nOr you know when when you see that when if I was a judge and I'd say well look let me look at the original like looking at the federalist papers for the constitution you can't just look at the constitution and say well I'm gonna flip a coin\nAnd and see where it lands that's going to be my opinion you go back and you look at the first to men or the second amendment as many of the justices ... the justices did you say okay what's in the federalist papers what were the founding fathers thinking when it came to guns why did they want the second amendment what was it about and once you do that\nYou know that was the original intent and you\nKnow it it's it's easy to come to a decision I agree with you I think they should do that ... because it isn't a it isn't a law that is written specifically there is no specific ... it doesn't specify birthright citizenship\n\nIt doesn't state it's not this is what were you and I've talked about before if it's clearly in there like in the second amendment [laughter] [laughter] uh they still went back and look to do it it's not clearly in there mhm it really does because\nThe argument would be made them in this case coming from the other side well\nIf if [laughter] if\nAh Jacob power the senators who wrote the citizenship clause intended it to be a such\nThen the citizenship clause should have been Britain is exactly and since it wasn't the only thing you can do is go back and see what the authors mindset was who actually wrote the bill the members of Congress wrote that amendment that got passed what that's there's nothing else you can really do on\nAnd actually with thousands of buyers and sellers across the country who may\nThat perfect track here looking for that don't miss

Radio Welcome to the show Hi\nHey I'm not sure if I tell you guys always caution but uh but what was I don't understand why\nSome people are saying or client the birthright executive order proposed by Trump or the president is stupid 'cause ... executive order clarify law\nBy our my understanding why can't a president clarify what the actual author and you got you got to talk about Jacob our attention in order to enforce the fact that\nThe fourteenth amendment does not extend to aliens or people vote for a nation giving birth in our nation well\nThe the executive order does not necessarily a clarify the interpretation of the fourteenth amendment it may attempt to but then beyond that the court challenge ultimately if it got the SCOTUS it would be the job skills\nTo interpret that would be the top of his ... it would it be his job of his lawyers to defend it but the secular border\nSell a is an executive order to change what the immigration a law is right now under birthright citizenship the explanation would be\nIn the ... that his lawyers would give where he would try to make that point of clarify in the original author would be in the actual right\nIt would yeah and the actual court case so did he got could've branches interpretation of it is not the the final say now now if they ... as Gary pointed out the president could write the executive order and if there were no challenge [laughter] that's a fantasy but if there were no challenge then it would it would stand and it would be the law the ...\nWell yeah 'cause that was the question gardener yesterday which I thought was a stupid question gotten a president writing an executive order to change the law and and what did hold on well yeah sure he could write an executive order for a ham sandwich [laughter] no nobody challenges him yeah then yeah but it's going to say there'll be an injunction\nAnd there'll be an injunction and the law will never which finds a way I could be a brilliant move by the president and or the attorneys or or the Justice Department maybe some input her idea she here to say that\nYou know let's attempt to get this at at at least for the president I I think it's it's a\nIt's part of his his fight whether you want to put it just purely political or not it is part of the campaign promise to thousands sixteen on controlling the borders and I think it's worthwhile fight and were with him on that on the spirit of it and thank you for the call but ultimately\nIt is going to be about\nUh you know getting it to the Supreme Court to have that interpretation or ... or at least the citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment if it got that far I don't want to go to ... I don't believe it ever will but\nBut still though when people say well he's just so she's just campaigning\nAn\nHour and it it will not doing this is part of the campaign promise from Saddam's not exceed that's my mind that that was where I'm going exactly is the fact that well he's not campaigning\nI could see if you're upset say he's just campaigning for example when you've got Democrats when you when you when you got to Claire McCaskill tried to paint herself as a Republican fry just who happens to be running as a Democrat yeah now that's something you should complain about because she's not telling you the truth right when you when you have now when you've got many Democrats trying to portray themselves\nAs oh we're not part of those crazy Democrats aren't and I don't know where we're very very moderate they've gone back to that that you should be upset about when you campaign\nBut Trump as president\nIs what he's always campaigned on and one of the reasons one of the major reasons he's he got elected was illegal immigration\nAnd immigration issues across the board so anything that he does well he's doing it just to ah just to the campaign before the midterms well on the caravan thing the only way you could make that point is it\nIt just to ah just to the campaign before the midterms well on the caravan thing the only way you could make that point is if he financed the caravan which I don't believe he did I don't think so and therefore when this was happening he's doing what he believes he should do\nMight help his campaign yeah but it's what he's always right on\nAnd it'd be consistent in his opinion why would anybody it buddy be upset about it or college strictly campaigning strictly campaigning is what the Democrats are doing trying to pretend they're Republicans right exactly that's the campaigning that you should be upset about\nBecause that would be an action and I the president clearly knows this was going to be an executive order like this was going to be immediately challenged and the ... he knows that so he is setting it up for the fight but it is also part of the positioning yet politically\nAdded to that I told you about an old old friend of mine who I saw here in the last month and when I had last asked the question a few years ago how many cats and dogs do you have now she said seven cats and for dogs ...\nWhen I saw recently I said hey how many catch you have now and she said well I have four dogs just said oh what I said what nine cats ten thirty three\nThirty three cats yes\nHer and her spouse actually put a extra room on the house for the cats can walk in and out to non heated room but that's where the cats can stay in congregate together well but thirty three\nThat's three cases of cat food a day [laughter]\n[laughter] I\nDon't know which is that being the study claims that human compulsion to seek out animal companionship is one of the primary factors affecting our climate either where the two idiots overnight told you this was coming along time ago Jeff we told you this would be next\nResearchers at the University of Sydney in Australia claimed that those one hundred and sixty three million pets\nHeavy detrimental impact on the environment from the food they consume to the waste that they produce in the U.S there are more than one hundred and sixty three million dogs and cats they consume as a significant portion of their diet animal products and\nTherefore potentially constitute a considerable dietary footprint the study proclaims ...\nHere the energy and animal derived product consumption of these pets in the United states is evaluated for the first time as are the environmental impacts from the animal products fed to them including fecal production\nThe problem isn't just the United states now or just not the United states though the popularity of companion animals has grown worldwide Americans are the largest pet owners in the world I don't mean that means we're the fattest pet owners are we owned more pets probably both\nBut tradition of pet ownership in the United states has considerable costs as pet ownership increases in some developing countries\nEspecially China and trends continue and pet food toward higher content and quality of meat globally pet ownership ... compound the environmental impacts of human dietary choices it continues\nThere's only one solution no more pets ...\nReducing the rate of dog and cat ownership perhaps in favor of other pets that offer similar help an emotional benefits would considerably reduce those impact the study concludes\n... one of the things we're talking about is the fact getting rid of your dog and getting a rabbit because the dog eats meat and the rabbit once or the or that test of wills yes so so what do we do with the dog\nWe supposed to put the dog down or\nJust after this dog not get another one hey I never search for a cat I rescued one had rescued you let's be clear and by the way you're not the only person that sets so that to me this week yeah I think we all know that\nAh [laughter] and a mango\n... Halloween Halloween you know the funny thing is I had I had a a bug few weeks ago and I had all the autumn stuff up already I had a a a smoke detector actually the smoke detector I thought it was a battery but smoke center went defective in it you know beeps after about ... you know yeah the ...\nDr actually the smoke detector ... I thought it was a battery but smoke detector went defective and it you know beeps after about ... you know yeah the toll is part of my house of course so I you know so it's like fourteen feet up but I got this incredible ladder wide base and everything else\nSo I was like you know Tim Allen very excited to bring that ladder out really tested capabilities right so I get up there and realize okay this is in my I I have a ... it's\nSort of an atrium it's my music studio ... got a little studio there a piano all that stuff so but it's way up so I get up there take it off bring it down and realize it's not the battery so I order a new one on Amazon ...\nTakes a couple of days so do I take down a ladder not leave the latter believe it or leave it why take it out yeah so ... for a couple of days and I noticed that the cat black cat keeps walking\nUnder the ladder thought that if there's a lot so I figured that out and I'm like ... should I be worried about yeah that's a good luck thoughts I never had before\nUh but uh there's only one solution no more pets reducing the rate of dog and cat ownership perhaps in favor of other pets that offers similar help an emotional benefits would considerably reduced these impacts\nThe other choice researchers recommend is having your pets pets go vegetarian nope something that's not recommended by veterinarians are animal health and welfare experts who can see that having some type of meat based protein is best for your pets yes\nParticular those for whose ancestors were carnivorous [noise] yeah I Can't get my cat to eat a carrot\nNo no\nAnd so uh uh there you go the study of the researchers say isn't designed to dissuade animal lovers from taking in the maximum number of pets possible yeah it is yeah that's actually a point\nBut to encourage Americans to consume less meat so that's the point All right I see what they're saying keep your pets you go vegetarian I'm literally falling to stakes right now I'm going to you both of them today\n\nI might have to go by a third one just because this article is making me hungry for meat [noise] my favorite one remember this goes back ten years ago\nI think you and I ... the only been working together for a short time uh-huh remember the guy that came out\nThat said that we need to get rid of all the cities in the United states right and we need to have said he's no bigger than twenty five thousand people ... and ... what was it was it over half of the people have to go\n[noise] yeah we don't want to go to I think it was more than half we're gonna have to take them somewhere what do you do with them I don't know like we have to [laughter] what do you do with and who decides who goes\nAnd and I think it was one of the of the probably closing in at that time seven billion people we only have like one\nRight so what do you do with the what do you mean [laughter]\nOkay what's what's your plan I they are just going to be the weirdest lottery you guys ever heard of but here's how it works [laughter] are you committing suicide first yeah\nRight hey that'd be cool psi phi movie right it's the end of the planet\nWe're down to what ten years\nJust some kind of doomsday whatever climate suicide well it wouldn't be climate base because that would just be well\nThen you'd have Hollywood would never make a movie where let's just say you know the chunks of ice just start falling out of the sky or that the water rises in Manhattan over a period of three hours and then freezes over the period of ten minutes that would just be a stupid movie\nOr it would be called the day after tomorrow [noise] um [laughter] so [laughter] that's not making about climate change there's some\nWhatever right but\nIf we could whittle it down to one billion people and then it would be\nOver the ... you could make this a series or the period of years you know because you got ten years or Fifteen Years to figure it out to kind of figure out how to deplete the population\n[noise] [laughter]\nI don't remember [laughter] remember Star Trek didn't remember how the the\nTwo forces are the two societies on the one planet right war with each other and instead of going to war they simply killed people on both sides okay we're going to kill a thousand people today you kill a thousand\nUm they like managed war and then there was the other one remember all the people that were like plastered up against the wall and the ... member that one yeah I don't they open the window\nAnd there were like all these faces on the wall like rice has society had grown so much and I don't know how would they ever solve that\nProblem yeah I don't remember that one of the one of the most interesting post apocalyptic type movies was children of men Clive Owen two thousand six\nAh haven't seen it was about essentially a the there was a women could not give birth there was whatever happened to the apocalypse they no longer have the ability to give birth and then all the all of a sudden they came across this woman who was pregnant\nSo you had to they had to hide her because all governments would want you know to a study this woman and then you know all of this and and they just wanted to protect her and her baby so she kind of went underground so they could protect her\nBut I mean that kind of gets into that area right of a population that basically as lessening not in in the crazy way that the Democrats or talking we've we've far out far left liberals are talking about\nAnd did in the past of depleting the population but just kind of a ... thing of okay there's only a billion we can only save a billion\nAnd it's a global thing right\nI mean there were ... it's it's not it would be one of those those questions almost like a Sophie's Choice I mean they did it in deep impact yeah oh yeah that was very clear that that uh oh Bruce Willis uh you know ... ... yeah it's got it's got to take one for the ... no\nThe unfortunate result of these circumstances

seven sixty\nWithin that Congress louder saying I was an executive I certainly\nThink that if the president were signed such an executive order and I hope it will be carefully for this this would be in the Supreme Court pretty quickly talk and breaking news\n[noise]\nIf\nYou're a Mac and my eight six six nine the ah ... the\nBig story yesterday was the president in an interview stay in that he might put an executive uh or in just stop\nThe birthright citizenship but immediately a discussion on the fourteenth amendment ensued uh we heard things like ah the president can change the law with an executive order or Kenny change it was also put in the\nQuestion for of course you mhm if nobody challenges but it was it would it be immediately challenged and we when we spend a significant amount of time on the show talking about it\nOr you know the president may do what he may not do it you know we we we may never see it but if he does you're not going to change it'll be it will immediately be addressed\nA by opposition groups or will be a lawsuit will be filed the right injunction within a couple of hours after the president has has has done it and I don't think that we would see a change in our lifetime for on the trucks here's your forecast\nVery very live showers and thunderstorms today extending from Detroit down to Texas or we're going to say this line of showers continue to progress eastward slowly today as the front becomes more pronounced will see the showers extended to Dallas a central Texas\nWhere some heavy thunderstorms likely for the architects today at the same band showers will then move up through portions of Missouri southern Illinois central Indiana in northern Ohio\nTo include Detroit and areas of northern New York Georgia the Carolinas will be dry today but tomorrow will pick up shower ...\nSo there you go but does this I saw somewhere the president should be impeached a of a for putting out this executive order if he does it stop executive orders are put out all the time by presidents that are rejected Obama did it he was rejected ...\nGo that that we go through and this one if ah if issued will immediately be challenged and that will go through that process right in the courts the department of justice will go up to defend the president's a position\nOf the attorney general's office will go out and and look to defend it and well first of all we have to see how it's written you know the words mean if it if ... if he's even happens ...\n\nHave you know the president said he would do it well he actually follow through with that remember when it came to children being separated the border it was the president they backed off mhm he realized he couldn't win that battle on immigration ... we talked about it when that happened\n[noise]\n[noise] so will he really attempt to fight this or was it just rhetoric we will find out\n... and ...\nAnd again the language of the executive order will be will be everything um but it will it will not go without a ... it will not go without him an ... an immediate challenge in fact that's going to happen right\nNo you don't have an injunction book if he if he puts it ought to nine AM there'll be an injunction by that afternoon by by federal jobs ...\nWe're starting to court and and I don't believe here's here's the other thing to this it could take years just to get through the federal court system before it ever got to the Supreme Court mhm it if it went anywhere even if it went through the entire system because they're not going to fast\nJust to get through the federal court system before it ever got to the Supreme Court mhm it if it went anywhere even if it went through the entire system because they're not going to fast track at it's not like the emergency that the executive branch were saying you need to fast track this because it's about national security right now and terrorists coming in\nBecause it would have essentially a move like this effectively would would um be about future lives\nFuture children right\nIt would not be retroactive and in nature would not have any kind of grandfather in awe of powers\nOr so at that point then you look at the uh the interpretation a of that of that caused the ah or a bad part of the fourteenth amendment\nAnd\nWhat I'm what I Would be interested to see\nIs is if the citizenship clause is mentioned in the executive order as the basis of it because\nIf that because the language the language will mean everything in the court battles obviously so even if it doesn't get to the Supreme Court there's gonna be a very a good discussion about it over the years\nYeah we suggest ah just to the president because of a past attempts to put through an executive order ... don't have the first draft of the first executive order be get rid of the fourteenth amendment [laughter] right\nOkay yeah no ... be specific for the part that well but you're going to have to I think you're going to also have to have a\nEssentially an interpretation of that citizenship clause yes of the fourteenth amendment as a as the basis of it in the actual language of the executive order because if you\nDo that what you're doing at that point is bringing up the discussion again that doesn't mean that the Supreme Court has even going to hear it\nBut it it if it's the basis of the order then it gets straight to the point in the courts regardless of how it goes to the courts\nAnd I think that would be that would certainly be my advice is she right so you have you have to tailor the executive order\nA in a particular way and then when you go to court mhm you've got to be very specific I think that\nYou know 'cause you're not trying to change the fourteenth amendment know what I was trying to ... ... what you're trying to do is you're focusing and write on only mhm a birthright citizenship\nAnd whether that was contained you need to make the focus as narrow as possible to get to that particular point that you believe is a weak interpretation a ... of it ... and still is going to be a tough sell to get through\n[laughter] right\nSo and I don't know if the you know again this is something to that were dragged to the courts for years because I don't I don't believe there's any chance of it being fast tracked\nAnd and so this could sit in the course for years yeah the travel ban had an immediate threat right ah attached to assess the basis I don't know if he wants I don't know if the president\nWith with all the other things that are going down an immigration that he can without question when and probably when sooner especially when it comes to legislation if they're able to keep the house right\nOr that he would ah that he would want to spend the time and energy on that she might I mean they might I don't I don't I don't you give support\nLook remember when we have the influx of children coming across the border uh years ago a few years ago and you had people in the inner cities that were saying ah listen I mean Obama was president but they were outraged that we were spending so much\nPublic money on on\nDeporting those children in housing those children remember we are putting them in schools that was during the summer months we were putting them in schools and then other locations and so there were people that were outraged over that basically they're point was uh the government shouldn't be spending money on on on children who eventually will be sent back home\nIt should be spent on my children who are American citizens as they are the same support\nFor the current president in terms of okay wait a minute let's have the discussion I on on I'm try alien parents giving birth to citizens and the U. S.\nUh I'm I'm trying to think if I've seen a poll on American citizens and what they what they think about that recently I'm sure we will and the next week unless again it's just something he said in an interview\nHey could have been something he blurted out and then the news cycle changes today and we never hear about it again I looked at the question yesterday I was on the golf course when I saw it burst out laughing was ten ten Trump quite an executive order that becomes law no we can't and I burst out laughing as simple ... of course the cat\nIf nobody challenges at ... nobody challenges an executive order but somebody's going to challenge it and it's like well that's not the point to the point is if you're going to discuss it let's talk about the original intent of the of the fourteenth amendment as we spend a lotta time doing ah earlier on the show\nSo what do you dress up for a you know for Halloween today as a a a guy who's sleeping [laughter] wow we've got the same ... [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nThat's embarrassing we're gonna have a lot of rain here in our area I don't know if we're going to have many adults degree or at the door\nI don't think we are so very quickly there I was working at our affiliate W are okay ... in Nineteen Ninety four ... doing a show or my producer tells me doing an afternoon show my producer tells me there is a ghost that's known to be in the studio and I say come on and this is true was it was witnessed on air and I said and\nKidding around I said if there is a ghost in the studio make your presence known right now and when I did\nAll the power in the building went off for like five seconds and came back on five seconds later and we're just roaring laughing we thought somebody set us up you know the engineered to engineer because of what's going on everything will we thought you want to know\nThe power company the utility had to come in there was some kind of power surge and the utility company guys I'm walking out if you're doing the show and utility company guys were there and I started talking to him and they said we were listening to your show what had happened [laughter]\nSo there I Am four years later at the McLaughlin house haunted house in Oregon City Oregon ... working for a a a freedom nine Seventy sister station ... ... and I'm doing my show there McLaughlin house haunted house I'd tell that story\nAnd when I get to the part of sane [laughter] if there is a ghost in here [laughter] make your presence down now not ... not kidding you the power went out ... found out that a TV Guide because all the time\nIf you're presidents do now not ... not kidding you the power went out ...\nFound out that a TV Guide because all the TV stations go to that house in Halloween to you know take pictures of this was supposedly real haunted house drove over a wire and pulled it out\nGood at it and it's and it set off are brought it you know turned off our broadcast I urge just roaring laughing I mean yeah just everybody back to the station thought I was playing the game with them without you just you know turned off the ... right with no\nSo yeah there you go twenty three years ago today the man that hired means of radio\nAh passed away I was with them in the hospital when he passed away from cancer and in the moment that he passed the radio station they hired me out in the last radio station he actually worked at he came back and work there in his late years\nTransmitter went off the air at the same in the same minute that he died\nThe all of it is there's you know the doctors obviously document time of death and engineers have to document when the transmitter goes up all of a document", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "San Diego", "day": "31"}
