think he's going to just weekend and of course they'll all have sweetness and light just get along and not the same conciliatory tone is Chris promoted on CNN last\nNight that's independent impartial that's a political\nOf course Trump like his performance Kevin ... belief that dignity of the station signature Trump traits he said he was there as a son and husband and father and that what you saw some testifying with his family in mind\nSo ask yourself that's how we decided to represent himself in front of them by being ... combative and rude he admits he was quote too emotional at times and said a few things I should not have said\nThat there's a problem with his ... he didn't just fly off the handle those were prepared remarks I disagree with former aging Casey Anthony didn't hear her testimony so how was responding to it while he drafted his remarks they were thought out\nHe also had set of answers about the year book and how to sanitize his past was measured what the answer those questions he wasn't just going off the top of the ... so now again both sides have natural hair and finally did in high school except for the allegation Jesuits for I don't care about his drinking yeah she ... from what I've heard\nIt sounds like what many if not most in college are prone to excess I was I was at the same school and the same bars and you know what I fought a lot more than he did but I own it\nI'm flawed I was and I am I doing stupid things my life was never just about books in church and charity and neither was his all that time he was out for suffer fooling around with his buddies you know what that means that doesn't mean what he says it means while still\nSeparating out the serious allegations no problem is not the behavior it is the denial of the same the most telling phrase I Would suggest is I have been known for my courtesy on and off the bench I\nChanged he hasn't been that way when they had either as a rabbit righty man of hacked dog and I had\nAnd he has not changed based on that testimony\nTwo points when you're innocent poised calm in the face of criticism reflects your power of belief losing control suggests something incriminating Kavanaugh\nIs who he was in that hearing for better\nWorse yeah manners Chris promo for better or worse so sanctimonious on CNN well is that when it when Trump's done whatever that is\nWhat a CNN do by the way some of my uh liberal friends and I do have liberal friends many I Love them but just wrong most of the time not always but uh when I'm a liberal friends was back in the mid west big my one

even despicable thing is because both a cabin on an Dr Ford in this case have been\nUsed as political pawns and you're right to the right people who champion her and she we totally believe her because because of other things that have happened to women through the centuries I can understand that to an extent in the me too movement time but again the specific charge years to vote\nOn Kavanaugh with you know a consideration FBI investigating for the seven times Kavanaugh looking into these charges and that's what the vote is but they've they've elevated this to a vote on a woman who had you know and you know\nAt the end that's tragic and I think go for women\nAnd they'll say are under the bus 'cause she won't be needed any more\nExactly she's she's going to be she has been used she she played her role\nAnd are they failed to prevent him apparently from being in the next spring court justice and again ... they'll find it it'll be on to something else if they really were serious\nMark about a women's rights and it's actually a harassment issues those kinda things they'd be going after Cory Booker who's admitted to it back at his his high school days and college days and then he going after\nA Keith Ellison Minnesota where there's ... there was actual video evidence\nUh of him you know I'm domestically attacking his his girlfriend so they don't care if it's if it's a day in front of the name ... they're not going to go there it's it's it's all about going after Republicans would especially going after President Trump\nYeah there's also some other intrigued is just come out of all this um before we leave the doctor for a deal a friend of Christine Blasey Ford barely felt some pressure to\nRevisit this to her statement on allegations is is a a leaves on the Kaiser former classmate who was identified as Dr ... by Dr Ford and she had written to the Judiciary Committee back in September twenty third quote she does not know Mr Kavanaugh has no recollection of ever being at a party or\nGathering where he was president and\nThat conflicted with her friend Dr ... testimony so apparently now we're learning that the than the wall Street Journal had this as well that uh there is a little bit arm twisting their uh she felt some pressure to maybe one team to reconsider that want to change that wouldn't that be a witness tampering\nIt absolutely would be and uh you know that's that's getting a heartless that they're capable of just about anything I mean like I said you know nothing ever happens uh by mistake in Washington DC\nAnd it's gotten so purely partisan that uh you know it's just gonna despicable for the entire country actually I think if I think it's a\nIt's unfortunate that both sides of the aisle that we've gotten to where we are today um but I just think you know it's a it's where we are right now and I think President Trump is the endless toward President Trump's ... drives a lot of this and that they're willing to do or say anything it's right out of the Clinton playbook matter\nMa'am ... than you might do that well you know that absolutely well and that continues to be one of the more uh mystifying things Hillary Clinton was out speaking somewhere this week talking or haven't saying nice things about how women should be or the herd then you need to take any charges seriously what and this is the same person who has first lady\nWas working with James Carville and Stephanopoulos and everybody else and car pulls out there talking about dragging a hundred dollar suit ... demonizing Paula Jones and a Juanita Broderick and the others\nUm she's not\nShe's not innocent of the state just but it's amazing how people do but because Hillary as Hillary and you know she should have been president she's the smartest ever well then we'll believe or implicitly that just doesn't match\nWith the facts and then we find out a yesterday late yesterday congressional investigators confirmed\nThat and they're currently has the hill dot com and there's there's not some conservative dealers their report confirmed but of top FBI officials met with Democratic Party lawyers to talk about the allegations of the Donald Trump Russia collusion weeks before the election and twenty sixteen when Hillary is out there running and then about ...\nThat's a big deal because this is the ... all this whole thing with that that um fusion from the uh the the one that was snooping around a Christopher Steele fusion GPS the for amused by the Democrats and Hillary Clinton's campaign\nSo man there's still a lot more there\nI don't know if we ever want to but you know ... and everything else and and but they've been masterful and the other side saying look Trump Russia Russia they're projecting when they've got some of their own things to explain still born yet\nThey're always circles back to the Clintons it always has it always well you know mark getting back to Paula Jones Monica Lewinsky I was there by his depositions I I I knew

new generation are going I don't want to date tell just by the robot will do the last together\nOr something like meanwhile here's why so many people think they know Brett Kavanaugh and then they don't tell their nose and he's the boozing you know he's just a just drunk all the time and time women throwing ice on everybody\nAnd yeah he's got some rape bring part of it may have well the R word and I'm not treating our lightly I'm just saying here's the evidence in the past three weeks CNN has used the word rape or variation number one tied to Kavanaugh one hundred Ninety One time shares of south\nNo one is accusing presser Kavanaugh being a rape out judge Kavanaugh being rapists and attempted rape is do yes my Supreme Court nominee may be and attempted rape is there any attempted rape is angel attempted rape attempted rape this is a charge of attempted rape attempted\nRape occurring that is so critical to the nomination of judge Kavanaugh a high school\nDrunk at a camp in re attempted rape ... or all attempted rape attempted\nRape I says well I guess that's why I went back and saying you don't necessarily believe that the fourth\nI think rape culture is so pervasive that it's possible that he's not lying and still did it the woman who is that Kavanaugh tried to rape or the woman who says Kavanaugh exposed himself to her\nShe said that she remembered that Brett Kavanaugh tried to write for I've put his hand over her mouth to ship and scream\nKevin I held her down and she thought he was going to rape her I Believe he was going to rape me I Believe he was going to rape me I Believe he was going to rape me the most serious allegation that Kavanaugh aided embedded in the commission of the gang raped\nGang rape and excessive drinking and impressive ... here from Brett Kavanaugh off\nAnd I pay the ... in a gang rape gang rape opening racial gang raped gang raped gang raped in which this ... the Supreme Court nominee participate if\nThey raised their hand they're going to have to know that I'm raising my hand yeah hey no way that a woman stood before the Senate accusing the nominee of right and the FBI\nSaid nothing of a short in the latest the seventh investigation the capital and it doesn't take away from people they made this about\nWomen who have had that happen is horrible\nBut that's not what they're voting on but there are people in the Senate who thinks through voting on the grand a bigger thing that was just CNN and the last three weeks one hundred Ninety One times of the R word\nMedia Research Center analysis went in there just to count it all up hundred Ninety One times only on CNN more than ten times a day\nNearly Twenty years ago Juanita Broderick accused been President Bill Baba Clinton of raping her while he was attorney general of Arkansas reportedly leaving her with a bloody lip and the words you better put somebody saw that\nFirst story\nIn terms of what what was reported that's what she said never had on investigation\nSo they got less than they are still valid points there but they're basically saying we need a change agent you made the case bonding diminished have been involved in a lot of good things over the years and has had pretty darn good track record in law enforcement for starters\nAnd that district by the way district for is more in terms of registration a lot more majority Democrat and Republican\nThey're also ... when this came up with a primary they did some surveys and heard of one actually saw some of the information\nOr a lot of people still think Nathan Fletcher is a Republican because they can't tell this is version three point O. he's gone beyond Jerry Brown with ... what are you know I smell of reform party or maybe reveal if this doesn't work out for him\nAnd he went after a ... a glory so dying you Democrat much more far left maybe I don't know maybe that's where Fletcher is now\nBut really went after her which wasn't a I don't think that was being sensitive to a woman wasn't so the union Tribune basically saying yeah he'll be fight\nAnd I get this the San Diego union Tribune formulate their daily or editorial boards still thinks there's something there was something opportunistic which is a waste of that about Nathan Fletcher is Eighteen month evolution over two mayors racism twenty twelve\nAnd a twenty thirty and from a pro business Republicans to an independent critical of both parties to a pro union Democrat\nOthers weren't so that it's called calculated\nIt finally say that\nThey still the union Tribune editorial board\nStill thinks there was something we're not sure what it how do you word it that way there's something opportunistic back\n\nAnd back in twenty Thirteen the union Tribune under previous ownership\nHad an editorial that was headlined Fletcher versus Fletcher versus Fletcher so now they're saying that doesn't really matter and then they have this wall Fletcher is emergence as a Democrat may have been calculated he demonstrated into interviews with the editorial board this year that he has a grasp on many county government issue as well so\nYou can get a grasp of variety of ways you don't just suddenly go so let's go with you I mean it'd be a with a change you don't know how big a change that is unless you want the county run by the union bosses\nSo I don't know how you trust that county needs a wakeup call\nAnd Fletcher is far more likely to jolted out of complacency nice they vote for Nathan Fletcher pro supervisor the habit of talk with and we'll talk of bunny demand as we do um I'm I'm just really surprised because they're they're saying well buddy\nBuddy to Madison's campaign has not been as focused I agree she is she needs to be sharper then she's been in all of this she's also saying she'd be a change agent and hit the ground running the point that out but\nIt's interesting none of this none of what they're talking about here they will not bring up in the editorial endorsing nascent Fletcher for county supervisor the UT will not pointing out the concern over\nKind of like Bill Clinton ran with with Hillary about what you get to free or do you buy one get one free way can't do math anyway ah get Chelsea so the first one is actually yes that's correct that's correct but that Bill Bill Clinton proudly until it didn't sued him said you bought while you get one for you guys were just so smart grid is really agree you in the front row like great [laughter] you know\nSo you get Lorena Gonzalez what they've been Fletcher okay and just do some Googling look\nAt some of the issues and you talked to people within the county are very concerned about this not because they're trying to maintain their own personal thing and obviously there are a lot of that he anybody in politics has to have healthy ego\nBut this this this is not some old by the way maybe in a union Tribune should've said doubt about that union influence\nBut now the union\nBosses have at city hall and that's increasing that's added\nA lot of the venom to the tenth floor at city hall where whereas like mean pop up a lot\nUm\nAnd they have in the Fort condition and you know I'm I'm I'm just actually really really surprised to to visit but\nI guess not we may be surprised that by the time they\nTake the vote tomorrow maybe tomorrow afternoon our time to vote on Kavanaugh that some of the people who are ... I'm forum that may change overnight\nBecause you know that I mean Jeff Flake announced today he's going to go ahead and and support cabin on what happens is after a\nWeek ago there were touching his government to please you're so why is connect feel your fabric\nA member that picture [laughter] bizarre enough lakes back\nCourageously saying he will vote so that makes you of the street protesters who grow started yelling at him outside his office\nSo there's a long way between now and the vote\nTomorrow [noise] yes it's political sees you know what else is frightening that and the next I think what next week the absentee ballots go out and we're going to start early voting so people are gonna make judgments based on what a whim\nI don't have to go out on election day on November ... ... difficult\nWait till then unless you have you have to be out of town or something because so much news comes as so many things\nSo much gets dug up good and bad and ugly and no you can't go back two weeks later and go I Want to recall my vote you can't do that\nOne eight hundred seven sixty K.

little radio\nOn her desk at the church she works at\nLove that flu shot out to Carolyn ah I'm In another guy yesterday who listens to his radio I listen to show every day at noon on the radio in his garage and I mentioned that because I think the best place to listen to the radio\nThe garage some best place to have the garage radio\nSo I felt place and he lives in a very progressive part of town so when you have your radio blaring from your garage tends to project into the neighborhood as well which is nice little extra bonus so he turns it up and I said ... during good moments like that last out anyway a Carolyn said she's very upset at the false allegations\nAccusations against cabin on a and I think the Democrats overall and we'll see overplay their hand on this\nYou know one one of the principles of the show is perhaps the opposite is true\nAnd that's my show and sometimes I still fall for this because I remember watching as the last let's just call three weeks of coverage I'm watching the whole thing unfold and I got tricked at times into thinking that this whole spectacle would be bad for Republicans but all the\nNegative press coverage even I remember thinking that we get a half ago that even if Kavanaugh does get confirmed which I thought he would be it would still do terrible damage to the conservative brand rights because we'd be a lighter confirming someone with a cloud of suspicion in the end it would still be bad for Republicans and the Democrats are going to win this battle yet again\nAnd I got tricked into thinking that was going to be the case and I didn't stop I didn't ... myself I came up with that expression and I couldn't stop myself to say hold\nOn ... that's the proposition that's what we're being told is going to happen but perhaps the opposite is true I never gave that a second a consideration because it looks like the opposite is going to be true and this whole democratic created fiasco this Dianne Feinstein created debacle I think in the end now is going to be good for Republicans\nNPR did a poll NPR did a poll in July in October to ask the same question and you don't I don't like poles when asked the same question over time I do like those polls Fred at least a grain of salt\nThat's the same question in July in October\nSo pre hearings post hearings the question was about enthusiasm\nOr the question was something like ah do you believe these this upcoming election is very important among Republican women\nBefore the hearings Seventy one percent of Republican women thought that this election was very important after the hearings eighty three percent that's the biggest jump of any other group Republican within\nNice piece from the leftist Atlantic conservative women are angry about cabinet they're not angry at Kavanaugh they're angry at the Democrats are going to take a break come back we'll finish that thought talk about the fun how some\nYears in social media now you can't focus on the fun house in the years that used Twitter and and the ... the young people in the news that just echo Twitter\nJust echo Twitter outrage kit that is a fun house near that it's not reality\nOr make that point and then we'll wrap up and we'll pay tribute to the medal of honor recipient which no one paid attention to yesterday or two days ago President Trump or to someone the medal of honor so we're going to pay
