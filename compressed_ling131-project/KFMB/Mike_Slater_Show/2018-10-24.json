seven sixty five research to talking about these are the series of explosive devices even a scare a downtown at the union Tribune building which happened to be same building where capital Harris senator Campbell Harris's officers located coincidence the same kind of thing when I don't know\nBut\nWere explosive devices addressed Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama intercepted by security people who work for them that's what they do\nSuspicious package was up there and there's some talk about some substance or whatever and that so they're all looking into this now trying to find out if the two devices that we're going to Obama and Clinton are linked to a pipe bomb those found yesterday the home of George Soros near where the Clintons\nLive well they tell us that like I don't know last time there were there together who knows\nNot passing judgment but well that's an interesting topic anyway so um the\nEarly thinking from experts is that all three devices are similar pipe bomb style construction\nSo\nThen it's easy to jump to ... must be some right wing or it must be someone wearing a make America great again hats\nBecause who else would do this it's only targeting these this thing is targeting the series targeting only left these including CNN which apparently Newark Mayor and governor most way out of the people or something but CNN why this is that attack on the media is it\nMay be\nIs if somebody with an agenda and maybe they also had a suspicious package of building were a Democrat representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz former Democratic National Committee chairman is an office or as an office that was evacuated there well that's that's a and assuming that somebody thinks she's significant amount well\nI mean she is is a human being but politically and so I I Know this this could very well be\nReverse psychology by somebody on the side of the left making it look like it's the right or could not be that at all we don't know but that doesn't stop the usual

aid to blame Trump for mail bomb so that's already happening again history proves\nWe don't know where we don't know I mean I always think about the uh rights that fire with Hitler and that's one extreme case but you know it's like look I Need more power 'cause look with the the communist did to me and us and you know the father of land and all that and all of a sudden the turnout was an inside job\nIs that on her to know is this unprecedented in terms of\nOf the numbers of ah the the suspicious devices and so forth when we go back to the sixties and seventies there was a lot of a bomb and going on then you know during the Vietnam War area there are so there's a whole people say oh this is it the ... never been this unfortunately yes me histories history\nI think there's a certain amount of ah\nOf people finding the current situation intolerable film in and and so and yes again I think that the tone some times of a you know we watch cable news all the time and it's [noise] um there's just so much ah [noise]\nWhat they called news that's just a pile of attitude and opinion about how this is the worst press than we ever had\nRallied yesterday it was all ... CNN the whole time on the bottom of the screen almost all day about ... fear without the Mac and and then\nConveniently enough yesterday the first at the ... suspicious pipe bombs or appears to be a threatening the left the financier George Soros a factor as a piece on how that unfolds\nMeantime the FBI on the scene north of New York city after all live bomb was left in the mailbox philanthropists who funds democratic clauses and as a frequent target of criticism from the president ABC's aerial Russia on the scene tonight\nThe FBI investigating that bond found him in New York mailbox of billionaire liberal philanthropists George ...\nMany things right Allen has details\nTonight billionaire philanthropist George Soros blaming what he calls the politics of hate for the bond planted that is New York is the\nCorrect the FBI searching for the person who hand delivered a pipe bomb to the home of billionaire financier George Soros was placed in the homes mailbox and could tone of New York and soundbite employee these six inch long bomb was loaded with explosives black powder\nIt was later detonated by authorities Soros who was eighty eight with not at home he has spent large amounts of money supporting Democrats and progressive causes\nWhich has made him a target of criticism by many right wing groups\nAlso interesting how they all are so gentle with Soros there and if it was let's say the Koch\nBrothers or anybody at all on the right the language of maybe that'd be quite as hospitable but that was yesterday not course today we have all these other suspicious devices sent the CNN and the Clintons the Obamas W watcher person shoals and so forth so the rest of the day is going to get interesting to say the least write them\nYeah [noise] ah ... what we found intriguing about this was we've had these stories for a couple of days where Republican candidates\nHave been assaulted on the street [noise] um and ah you know they have their signs yanked and and some of us on our social media saw this demonic guy screaming about how much she hates Ted Cruz and [noise]\nAnd these are stories that they they you know the national networks won't cover and we saw this Soros headline yesterday and um the the evening news crew here came over and said they're going to cover sorrows when they haven't covered these other things they said that would be extremely cynical on your part but you're probably right\nAnd there again there they all wear 'em and what's funny is they had to explain that this guy as a target of right wing criticism well why do you have to explain that because we've never found him controversial whatsoever because he's on our side\nOr the Koch brothers are seen as villains by the liberal media ah and even when they're funding PBS stations in Boston\nRight they don't all ... ... if you just went out and said oh who are the Koch brothers anybody who pays any attention and most people don't but people who do and say well there are just the conservatives supporters but they're not they're they're\nOffered him with a left wing causes and so forth one of the brothers more so than the other and so the other is so much easier just to rubber stamp at them and make it so I watch how this unfolds and and again I'm\nThinking back to like the Unabomber was for a long time like last gotta be if there's something exploding has got to be a right wing or maybe it is maybe it's somebody who is just totally sick and twisted\nA appears to be political in nature ... but it wouldn't be the first time that reverse psychology has been used in people on the side being being threatened the other ones were setting it up can be of and this is the thing the timing before the election is just way too convenient sorry it is that that brings up the big skeptic hat\nWell I think that what the conservative always starts here and this is where Philip brains breaks it down a conservative says blame that criminal don't blame a climate of rhetoric\nDon't blame an attitude don't blame a cable network blamed the crook blamed the bomber blame the shooter the you know when when uh this guy shot up to the baseball field in Alexandria softball practiced the Republican softball practice\nYou blame the shooter you don't blame Rachel Maddow and that's the conservative say you you don't blame the rhetoric or an attitude you blame the person\nAnd you punish the person and that's what that's called law and order that's conservatives believe in\nWell uh what's good and meanwhile what's going on symptom grandmother media Research Center news busters dot org I'm Megan\nKelly this is day two of and she was doing this ... even as these these suspicious devices were unfolding in the news\nBut she got in trouble talking about what Halloween and making it appear that\nShe's OK with what minstrel shows now and white people putting on black face and\nI I'm trying to sort this out but she opened the show again today on on NBC\nThen she says I'm Megan Kelly I Want to begin with two two words I'm Sorry because they had a discussion about political correctness and she talked about back in the day\nYou know there are things that ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another well it's an interesting discussion but man she got she got taken to the woodshed and it's probably not going to be over is it\nNow she looked she's working an NBC\nAnd they give her I think sometimes a surprising amount of free rein to do whatever she wants the whatever she wants to say because\nLike during Kavanaugh ... you know the the first two hours the today show or like Christine Blasey Ford is a saint and then they come on and Megan Kelly would say she's got nothing you know what I mean it's\nIt's a ... they're very different show some days and I think in this case ah she definitely said the wrong thing which is you can't do whenever the word black face gets used you're in trouble it's one thing if you were going to say can um\nUh you know can I ... a white girl be ... for Halloween and I think that's you know this is one of those things where I think the conservatives all agree like you know it's supposed to be a tribute if you want to be at Disney Princess that's not your race\nThat's supposed to be a good thing and yeah we're living in an age with cultural appropriation and all that stuff you know it's it's it she stepped in it\nUm and she's being punished inside I mean yeah they're coming on the air and pregnant what's called they're stupid and al rocker says she's this and that and\nIt's worked out real good I like Allen me he's a he's got his politics too but I always liked to um\nHe's obviously I'm not alone he's been there for a long time very successful but he said about Megan Kelly is march ... was nothing good can come out of this nothing I mean for one thing and having a discussion in a different level that's good too isn't it\nYeah I I just it it it I think it's a decent discussion topic for a morning show and I think that there's definitely a point\nThat people are uh get awfully sensitive about their Halloween costumes [noise] ah a hand you know I'm sure I probably worth some Halloween costume when I was a kid that would be inappropriate now\nI have an Obama mask all gather Reagan mask I go well if I were that back in two thousand eight when he was running for president I did the thing I talked about every year at Halloween or just just a quick version of that is I went to the door and I said oh I'm I'm broke a bone\nAnd I'm running for president there's how the economy is going to work and that would reach out one kid I go you have some candy you have more of that one and I reached and puts them in any of the other bag that worked once until I had to sleep on the couch for a night\nSo it was it was fun it was fun but uh I don't\nThink I could ever break that even though it's because you could do all the white ones you watch any of that whole that's the whole point it's we're so sensitive and I understand that as much as they have\nTo know where the lines are and honestly mark ... making should know where the lines are and she's working at NBC she

white\nWe won't make Kennedy's\nGoal of getting to the moon before the decade is out and the Russians are going to beat us there was all that well but never Apollo seven and why it matters a you know

frontiers of flight museum over the weekend I was honored to\nTo be there and be part of death fiftieth anniversary Apollo seven but there's so much history too often the mission gets to be almost a foot notice like well there was mercury Gemini then there's the horrible Apollo one fire\nAnd then there was a polish data and then we went to the moon is Christmas Eve and didn't land in Nineteen sixty eight by but that was fantastic we don't get anywhere including Apollo eleven the first landing or the subsequent weddings without what you and Wally ... done I usually did fifty years ago\nWell you're absolutely correct on that but a culture not society [noise] changing [noise] ah that's not the way they look back in history I don't look back to analyze that kinda stuff\nWhy do you think that is just not enough time attention span short or what\n[noise] well I think it's an evolution of thinking I I I typically don't like it but most people today are perfectly happy with it or if he talked some money in the twenties even out there you go out and asked somebody about Apollo they will remember\nApollo at eleven you know freshmen on the moon and they will remember maybe the Apollo eight 'cause first one I went around the man [noise]\nMaybe Apollo Thirteen to the movie was made about that but I don't they they rarely even know anything about Apollo seven in Palo nine and what

investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice we will spare no resources are expense in this effort\nAnd I just wanted to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together\nAnd then send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\n[noise]\n\nIt's a

or ... when they were the best ... or or get more information than or we can decide what's really going on because it's often not\nWhat you think you're seeing maybe maybe not we don't know ... people

them is ...\nAnd you look at the map I just saw one on MSNBC and looks like every liberal on the east coast is under assault and CNN so it you know and and hey it's let's find out what happened is not acceptable um it's not surprising in times we had back in the sixties and seventies a whole lot more sometimes an average of five bombings of one sort or another during the Vietnam War era\nI'm not saying we should have more than that let's just remember that there have been historical precedence here in the meantime the timing is is the biggest thing is just nagging if my God on this\nAnd especially when you see this week last few days here comes the caravan story then the story of the Trump is celebrating violence and nationalism at his rallies and then all of a sudden wow threats the Clintons the Obamas I'm sure it will be here certainly MSNBC reacted as this unfolded\nThere's a link rice joins me now is well Felipe is a deputy assistant secretary former deputy assistant secretary of state under\nA Hillary Clinton and believe we know that the secretary in Florida right now for some some pre planned event some fundraising events um and and we don't want to jump the gun too much here we don't want us to get too far out in front of our skis but we do know um that we are\nShall we say in a climate now where there are often\nAttacks made on the medium depressed journalists um and\nWe know that there are um attacks that are often made on George Soros and Brock Obama and Hillary Clinton uh two weeks before these midterms fully does it send like does it seem like someone might be trying to send the message here\nWell look obviously someone who send bombs in the mail or in any way delivers or try to hurt people\nOr isn't a sane or good person so I don't want our scribes that many kind of higher political strategy of affecting midterms but I think your larger point is correct and that you know irrespective of what this person's political leanings for motivations are\nWe are living in an atmosphere where hate and violence has been not only a incited by condoned by Donald Trump ahah and look\nYou know this could be the most liberal person in America who have some problem with these for individuals institutions it doesn't really matter\nTo me there are a lot of people who are living on the edge of sanity in general I don't mean that to be a facetious and when we when people in a sari kind of lift the guard whales from that um people are going to act out and there is no human being more responsible\nFor the climate weren't than Donald Trump today's the six hundred and forty third day\nHe had been in office I don't think he has offered a single word on any of those days that in any way condemn violence or tells people to dial it down he\n... he did today he just stood there twenty minutes but it won't run it's got me to actually\nGet it and and I disagree with their characterization happy to do more because I think the violence we've seen as almost uniformly if not Ninety plus percent of it come from the left towards our politicians you know the steep Scully shooting things this nature we haven't seen this type of ballots minute by the right and I don't believe it's four minute by Donald Trump ever I really I\nSaid and I agree there was the one guy that he endorsed they've the other guy who is kind of ... what\nThe rally the other day and yeah there were certain tweets and so forth so that gives you any gives fodder to the opposition to say aha but see his language stirs it up well that's been as old as politics if you're going to get real with I mean both sides and leave a left has been very creative with that over the years going back to the sixties or beyond so\nThere there's no doubt that I think the other thing that's important to remember is you know nobody is endorsing this type of behavior whatsoever out I think it's even more important\nYou know certainly not in a in in our society because we see this so much for the rest of the world in the middle east and stuff like that is such a huge problem with the people even just living their lives because of these bombings and everything else to go up but\nThat being said you know I think what we need to do is we need to find out what the source of this really is and we need to go after that source with extreme prejudice and I think it needs to be public I think the FBI doesn't need to sit around on this I Want to know whether these were real devices are not right now in other words if they were fake devices\nThat releasing following well Maxine Waters of course is not exactly been calm and her rhetoric and she was a recipient one of these uh as well Scott ... with his co author of American Sniper latest the latest book is called city of deaths across the camp valor book and upcoming series as well\nUm I I Want to get one more clip here and I'd just warn people with already eating in early lunch\nAnd let's go to the ladies that doctors on the view today led by Dr joy ... hard talking about this issue as well I was\nIn fact thing with my former colleagues at CNN and they're scared and one\nHighly former colleagues said this is what happened when the president calls you the enemy of the people that price and I thought my gosh you know if if the tone is coming from the top and now CNN has become a target journalists that are simply trying to do that I still don't know\nAnything yet about where this is coming from and what the motivation and end with this person or that people are behind him so I can point to be careful because we don't know yet but I didn't get the by you know how I haven't gotten a bite yet but we don't know if they\nDon't why mommy and I don't want to go back to the country and the only good as its people\nAnd I remember a time when I Do think leadership does matter at all and the president I think what's so important data is being in a fire and finding you're not paying you not have president of one party or the other and you are the president of the night and play and come out and denounce what's going on\nI ... I don't I don't blame somebody for him and I keep saying I gave up on this a long time ago I gave up trying to get in the lead and unify fine and then he ... the way we look like my cooking together I\nThink he should be doing that and\nThe way are the White House has announced yes I Am\nTalking once and then I could be on the view that'd be fine so Scott McEwen I mean there was Fox News ... one of the ... no I think it was sunny hostage Fox News hadn't\nGotten a bomb well no we don't want him to get one ...\nWell I think that really speaks volumes really at the end of the day to to whether this is for real or not\nBark I mean I'm going right back to it I mean I I'm Sorry but the\nYou know it's a horrible act whoever did it left right middle crazy whoever did it\nIt's wrong but the bottom line is what was the real motivation here because they got their talking points out they wanted to talk about and the question is was the motivation to get a political talking point out there by someone for the left or the right or is it actually an attack\nBy the way first question we must stand you know it's also ah the important television November ratings sweeps period is coming up and CNN with the way they would benefit from it and I get I'm nuts\nYou know it's also ah the important television November ratings sweeps period is coming up and CNN with the way they would benefit ... again I'm not I'm just speaking like you are objectively here we don't know we don't know but it's too easy with the timing this close to the important mid term elections\nTo say that this is all well obviously it must be they're going to find somebody you know make America great again hat remember back a few years ago with the Unabomber\nWhere it turned out the Unabomber there by some right wing crazy inspired by talk radio or whatever it turns out he was left of center it had a lovely copy of Al Gore's book earth and the balance on his bookshelf and the hut\nOr the whatever was on that show that's right that we got around to Scott Scott McEwen or you could find them on\nFacebook or San Diego will get his books over at Amazon coauthor of American Sniper and others take much got seven sixty talking breaking news across start coming up at a second\nDesert season there is a fun bipartisan thing it doesn't matter what your political you want to go to the desert and have fun going to make sure you get there and back where the truck that works so have a great truck maybe your neighbors have\nGone there with their desert toys and you're feeling a little I'm\nLeft in the dust and dirt and fun [noise] we'll go to al ...

I mean that's\nWhy I don't know you got anything once in a normal would have been fine I guess so we talked to the next on the other day from soccer city for an hour\nAnd a great conversation but soccer city and measure he came up attack which is not only us him into a excellent points were raised or interesting arguments at least and a very short notice I wanted to see if next don't come back on and address these two things and he of course greed yes how ironic\nI'm great things like how are you good things in the short notice some two points first one [noise] uh let me reiterate\nOr something you said the other day on the air and then make sure I'm getting this right and then we'll go to park to 'em so\nSome opponents people against measure he said oh soccer city is only gonna pay ten thousand dollars for the land\nAnd said that the full story is\nAbout two years ago when no one was sure what the fair market value of the land is that there was a chance that it could be a negative valued meaning the city would have to pay someone to take the land so soccer city you guys came back and say OK to protect the taxpayers we will at least pay ten thousand dollars to the city\nFor this land even if it comes back to the land worth negative money or at least going to pay the city something ah and then in the end the market value the land came out to be a hundred and fifty\nMillion dollars so the ten thousand dollar point has moved to that is that an accurate description yeah so\nIt's a that's exactly right on the ten thousand dollars it will never be the number or the total number Mike across two properties a hundred and ten million dollars eighty three million dollars of for the stadium site twenty seven million dollars for the charter training facility formerly charges training facility um and and we are the only get initiative\nThat's actually guaranteed to pay fair market value that are on Thursday Afternoon the university athletic director was saying that that eighty three million dollar number is the court starting point for the discussion between the city and the university\nOkay so that there is a question that someone brought up yesterday they said well you're not really paying was it a hundred and ten million a hundred and fifty million in debt\nHundred until I got so so then what they say well you're not really paying a hundred and ten million you're paying a hundred and ten million then subtract the costs of construction and subtract the cost of the park and some trying to cross the infrastructure improvements and you end up getting down much closer to zero than you do a hundred and ten million what do you say that\nI think that's a perfect description for what measure Gita but that's completely false rush so uh there's no question the number that we have the pay is you know we're paying a fair market value based on a hundred and ten million dollars is a marriage as a result came back with a third party appraiser\nWhat measured gee allows people to do is to have the city council determine the price that is fair and equitable and ended up public interest rate different had a gay and the public interest really broad language and then the ducks the cost of the park that by the way they are not required to build\nSo are you from your eyes that an accurate description for soccer city is a hundred and ten million for the land plus the cost of the stadium plus the cost of depart plus the cost of the infrastructure plus the cost of all these other things\nThat's exactly right which is why it's part of why the city or county taxpayers association has looked the two and said you know what it's like I say to you two hundred million dollars better\nFor the city tax payer and that's just for the city taxpayer that ignores the impact on the schools that ignores the impact on the county where hundreds of millions of dollars better again for the schools in the county um precisely because of things like this difference how gave her a\nFinding them in any report for Ninety nine years\nSo how how much is so how much is the land again\nLanded a hundred and ten million dollars\nA guy in the last the forty million to the park plus the forty million for the park plus the million\nA year for nine nine years plus fifty million and traffic improvements Maine\nSo hundreds of millions of dollars you guys are putting ended up okay I've got the number one aren't excellent what am I I'm I I heard a lot of people say uh you know I don't\nWere given the land the way I don't want to give them the land away like speaking on behalf of the city right I don't want to give on behalf of the taxpayer who owns the land I I don't want to give the land away and I thought give away what do you mean give away they're paying a hundred and ten million dollars with\n'em but I think what they really meant was first they think the land is worth more than a hundred and ten million dollars\nAnd I've heard that people say we should open it up to more bitter international bitter is that we can get a lot more money\nFor that or this city should never sell it and keep some ownership of whatever is built on it so that the city's always profiting as opposed to just getting a single windfall of a hundred and ten million so we think of those two things\nOkay so uh so let's tackle the first part first um we're we're the only initiative that sign up to pay for market by and if you look at who are competitive set is is the measure gee initiative it is huge developers that on hundreds of acres of land or right around ... valley\nIt's ... I mean the initiative are appraisal was no they ... it would be incredibly easy for them to just sign up for the eighty three million bucks that we're paying for the stadium site ah they worked really hard not to\nAttract what they did was to say look I definitely want to sign up for that I Want to let the city council determined it over that would be the mayor or city council determine that or why because you get the lobby that which is precisely the point with regard to the second question\nYou know how good you feel about having kind of an RSP process here where ultimately\nThe city council to side and the last time I did that it's called liberty station and the second highest bidder\nThe politically connected better on the topic was something like sixty million bucks the second highest bid with eight bucks a year that one\nSo none of this ... ... people like liberty station rice and they did a good job but you're saying it wasn't a win for the taxpayer at least in that regard\nYeah I looked up so um they've done a nice job with it there but if what we're seeing is hey you know in our peace process guarantee the better outcome that like it guarantee that will take ten years what's our sb ...\nConsumers urge to put a lid on the future use of those toilets Jimmy ...

said that the uh the the opponents for each of these two were well intentioned well intentioned campaigns against Kevin ... in my book where I think Tom Illinois Campaign is a lot more than well intentioned and I just want to give him a couple more minutes here\nA Tom how are you sir Hey Mike how's it\nGoing good run up San Diego Unified School board or how do we even begin first let's talk about your experience a you ran a school right\n[noise] uh it was a health bound up public charter school that in four years became a top academic charters a public school in San Diego and one of the top five percent in California so yeah I have a little bit of experience there and\nUse like welcome executive experience to do that now I'm just trying to help kids\nI Love it how the UT truly made it seem like you're just some some guy who was I you know I I have a kid and this will be fun yeah raising so why do you think your school succeeded what school was it\nUh it was elevate elementary we primarily served our local enlisted military families\nLike I said why would you do some festival\nWell ah because we had a diverse board we had the best in education and we had the best in any business a couple of Qualcomm one Qualcomm president welcome vice president and the other person in the energy industry\nAnd tree outstanding superintendent level are educators and one military liaison show and we have a a fantastic uh executive director\nSo it's an example of of uh another one is the diversity you weren't necessarily talking skin color you are talking diversity of experience and rights had been bringing together in\nEducation should be colorblind right quality public education should be colorblind but it's\nUh so what's that about\nDiversity of ups experience\nAnd it was an innovative thing that you were able to do an elevator elementary that uh you want it to be able to do in a traditional public school\nWhile we're on the leash a teachers to work together and collaborate we give them the tools so we hold them accountable but you know we don't get in the way\nYou have to hold them accountable of course a unfortunately we have outstanding leader who works very closely um we're always evaluating always assessing and that's the other thing that's necessary we know how well our teachers are doing\nAnd our teachers aren't guaranteed an opportunity to come back we do and you will contract and you will ... will agreements and the teachers that teach what they do a or they're not teaching\nHow do you pay them of course a a compared to other as to unify teachers [noise]\nAh it's comparable but let's face it um many of these teachers left the district and left Kenya and left great a retirement systems because they love teaching and they wanted to free opportunity to collaborate and because of that they're thriving and our kids are\nSo that's a really interesting dynamic yeah this is an interesting dynamic that needs to be analyzed more right so you're you're taking a there is a teacher many teachers how many teachers do you have a healthy\nWay below twenty five twenty five people were at\nA district is one of those unified or somewhere right and decided to leave prices I Love my tenure left maybe more benefits are higher pay someone out there and went to a teacher who's totally completely voluntarily there's no ... that slavery or servitude in business right ah\nWell no guarantee you actually have to compete\nAnd why would someone who is that\nBecause again we don't get in their way I mean let's face it the administrative a system in the district is kind of like the DMV it doesn't mean that there are well intentioned people and and great opportunities\nSystem and the district is kind of like the DMV it doesn't mean that there are well intentioned people and and great opportunities but it's for\nThe fact that you have Ninety five Ninety to Ninety five percent of your annual operating budget in

around the radio in the house which now has become more independent individual experience um\nIt makes it can you know again I think that's pretty powerful so what would you take a you know\nI wasn't at the end of it I think it was Joe who mentioned it but I thought it was\nIt was what I was searching for it was\nThe idea that our country was founded on yes people coming together\nAnd debating and an open forum\nAnd getting it right sorting it out talking through it understanding things\nAnd really getting down to the principles and let you like to point out striking the root of issues I think that that's a really cool thing and I think it needs to happen way more often there are people taking notes\nAnd the audience yeah\nAbout different prompts than bad so I'm Talking about ... um and there was a cool back their gold interesting back and forth with the audience to which is not there weren't microphones the audience right but uh like we talked about Kate and ... doesn't do anything [laughter]\nI like these people were genuinely yeah very upset at Chris Cate mirror may so [laughter] I was like well you got to call it soccer skates on at the same thing with misery or some dumb and made a very good point about misery which is why we had an ex stone from doctors have you back on this morning and\nAsk them that question I'm at this guy had but uh yeah I think that's right gathering together in a group disarm but again that's a similar thing because a lot of times when you're walking\nWatching cable news or on the Internet Facebook or whatever we're doing a reading politics it's also very individual experience and that's not the same as when you get a group and talk it out that's way more how it's supposed to be way more enriching way more fun\nYeah and you also get that that live feedback from the audience\nThat's way more how it's supposed to be way more enriching way more fun\nYeah and you also get that that live feedback from the audience\nFrom the people that you know that we're that we're speaking with not necessarily a good thing always the lie feedback do\nNot know but I think that's a good thing to know one way or the other way what\nPage people are on the end what page Iran I think well\nOK so misery yeah I I brought up a jury to crickets and how I support it and then I was a ... who here's the boards misery\nDid anyone razor [laughter] no federal\nPrison though there are All right well I guess I got to change my approach on this year there was they would have resonating there\nWas a little bit of awkwardness around the Duncan Hunter or yeah ... district some some stuff that was said it was interesting just to see how the how people actually are thinking there's like you said we don't get to see that when we're here yeah\nBut if you're in debt\nHaving a seemingly infinite amount of money you're right you're probably go back into debt again like most people who win the lottery I end up going bankrupt within a couple of years how can that be it's because they're already bad with money in the first place\nIf you have a ton of medical bills I think that's maybe the one thing you could pay for with ... lottery winnings right medical bills\nBut that being said all the money in the world can't make you\nHealthy or stop you from aging Steve Jobs died of cancer he had a lot of money was a ... some one of the richest men in the world couldn't stop the cancer right they didn't money won't stop that\nMore money will make you more popular certainly does not sure about that\nNo no no doubt about that but it is the worst kind of popular [laughter] the popular because you have a lot of money I'm going to be so people are going to bite you to a bunch of charity events all the time of day and then hit you for cash nonstop every day all the time but it's not a good popular\nEvery time you get invited anywhere you're wondering whether it's not for your money just ask miles what it's like to live like that it's tough [laughter] I every time someone said hey let's go I Want to watch the world series\n... where are you you know what are they what are they ... they did they love me yeah er my money totally set a more money can\nGive you a life of more leisure that's true but that's not a super\nWay to live the rest of your life just ask people who retired and then a month and [laughter] like ah I don't really want to wait out the clock anymore like leisure thing not really all it's cracked up to be people think more money gives them freedom\nAnd most of the time or money makes you a slave to it to become a slave to their money it consumes their thoughts\nYou have to work harder and longer to keep up your lifestyle right so you win the lottery and you buy a giant house and you got to pay a ton of the sped up a ton of money to fill it with furniture we uh we\nWent on tour and one of the houses miles you know the one of the big guy one yeah those things yeah\nI'll never forget I walked in huge like how many square African twelve thousand dollars ... ridiculous houses or\nUm [noise] and the ground floor is all very open for a plan and you know there's\nTen rooms you can see the kitchen the grand Roman every room and there were probably sixty chairs [laughter] because he just had to fill it with the eating right or you just never know when you're gonna have that sixty person [laughter] and like I think eight\nDifferent tables you could have a family dinner around all the different areas of the downstairs like well what does this all for\nIt just fills space\nAnd then you need to hire people to to staff the house right if it's big enough and you get your landscape that is the more and more money\nAt the more money earned more money more problems as they say Eric why can't people learn that it's a fun thing to say why don't people internalize this Seneca said that knows slavery is more disgraceful than one which is self imposed he was talking about money he was one of the richest men in Rome news is talking about money\nAnd the more money you have it's it's just it's its own form of slavery it's self imposed form of slavery it's been a bunch of studies done in this before either to prove that money can't buy happiness over a certain point to a certain point is what's the interesting thing to come to be about seven\nBye happiness over a certain point so there's a certain point is what's the interesting thing to come to be about\nSeventy thousand dollars household income now maybe that's a little different in San Diego so let's say Ninety thousand dollars tribes so if your family household incomes over Ninety thousand dollars no amount of money will make you any happier than you are right now\nAnd happiness has its own issue right now that's not even something worth valuing it's it's really can tetanus or joy ride so no amount of money will make you a more joyful person or a better person or more virtuous person\nPast a certain point passive around Ninety thousand dollars a year\nSo if you make thirty thousand dollars a year or yeah another fifty grand a year we'll\nGive you a level of financial comfort and make you less stressed and give you enough of the creature comforts of life that you can focus on a higher level of needs right\nPast a certain point past that whatever Seventy thousand fifty Ninety thousand mark whatever that is passed that there's no improvement and happiness and I would argue that it actually would make it worse off emotionally and spiritually and many different ways there's a famous line from Jim Carey he said I think everybody should get rich and famous and do everything they ever dreamed up\nSo that they can see that it's not the answer\nI Wish everyone could get rich and famous and do everything they ever dreamed up so they could see that it is not the answer to that as Jim Carrey but it's a very\nOld sentimental quotes Seneca again he wrote in one of his plays he said if only the hearts of the wealthy or open to tell all meanings oh if only you reach could look into the arts the heart of of a healthy or of a wealthy person might've only the hearts of the wealthy were open to all\nHow great the fears\nHigh fortune so wealth how great the fears of wealth stirs up in\nThe same same exact thing that Jim Carrey will say\nHaving a lot of money brings a lot of fear a lot of insecurities are\nProblems so I don't like the lottery for a lot of reasons but one of the biggest ones as it gets people take it takes people's attention away from what we should be focused on and that is a things we can control\nBut also virtue and living that life that we think we would live if only we won the lottery [laughter] right\nI hear a lot of people say uh\nYou know if I Won the lottery I give so much of a\nCharity heard that yeah and then the other day that really helps and people have really helped a lot of people you give your money to charity now are you helping any people now and then\nThat's fine if not right just like just beyond like every every giving a lot of your money to charity now\nProportional to what you make if you're not the ...\nKids yourself into thinking that if you had a hundred million dollars you'd become some great philanthropist overnight\nYou won't\nGive your money away now your time away now don't wait until you win the lottery to be this mythical I Won the lottery version of yourself why does he didn't know what I'm saying what I'm saying it's like\nThere's the you right so this Eric and then there's this mythical\nEric who won the lottery version of Eric bright guy I Love that guy [laughter] guys are good frantic ... who is that guy like ... what are the characters of that guy that are so wonderful feathered robes yeah [laughter] I'd want to be friends with ... okay I'll go and shoot the costs of\nHere's the thing we'd like to come as the ... mile show regular some we'd like to say that we think you're wrong on this okay go for it not that you're wrong per se I actually think let me try yeah\nVery last one my my ... is that it's this mythical Eric won the lottery Eric he's such a great person yeah could be that person now just beat out a person sure don't about the money just be the person that you think this lottery winning person is\n... you're right we I think Eric and I both agree you're right it's a losing battle what you're fighting was that there's something just American about it about playing D O D O\n... [laughter] no no no no because there's just so that out I don't know very little\nPerson you want to do this and the outcome here why do this why the outcome for instance new put up decorations for your decoration now exactly 'cause you just don't get like it's just not part of the things my wife has enough you just it's like why what's the point right I\nProbably wouldn't even had a second birthday party projects we want to go because I was finally I Would have gone in the air and Space Museum and others that you're not a dreamer okay yeah that's true there's just some people just let them dream is relatively harmless ... eyes rises agree too I think it's harmful\nBecause it's so you're rational you might as well dream about flying it's it's not going to have her and then you get depressed when you you can't fly sure and if you every\nTime first of all your spending time dreaming about them is not going to happen so it's time wasted a but also you dream about this thing is not going to happen and then when it does it you're sad because oh now you're\nJust you're poor version of their self which you don't like sure\nBecause all other all the things I Am and then you dream about it you're like oh life would be so great to be so brand I Do this and that I have these things and all this and then you wake up from your ... your silly dream and you know what I hear those things and then you're miserable\nBecause I drive an old truck\nIn the same thing I hate it in my life is poor and I live in a house is falling down and I pay rent or whatever it is right whatever the reality\nIs which sure it's all and then that's distorted because yeah you live in a junky old apartment it's still better than Ninety nine percent of the people who ever lived on the face of the planets so totally changed our perspective we shouldn't be looking towards the richer wealthy as like oh I Wish I could be that we should be looking into the Ben Franklin thing you should be looking down at the people who are worse off than you\nAnd then be grateful that you are better off not what the lottery does lottery takes our attention and puts it on what could be one of his money which is not a thing they ever be aspiring for frightened to sell your life but was that we looked at this mythical oh this person has all the money I Wish I could be that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mike Slater Show", "city": "San Diego", "day": "24"}
