Dillingham how did her connections to former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger\nOur all Danny the school district hired Dillingham in twenty six keen to provide sports and share program for some sixteen hundred students\nThey did check cancelled the contract three months later when nothing what provided\nIt still hasn't gotten it's money back board member mark as the ads that he'd be taken advantage

right there you realize how much that happened this is like the school bonds that day may vote for I don't Catholic and one that I voted for\nIn recent years 'cause it's it's it's well it's for the children right just give us more money it's find the kids will get smarter and yet the studies show that our schools have gotten worse when I moved here back on the stone age\nNineteen Seventy six is a very small child I'm In the covered wagons coming out from mid west in California schools were at the top like top five maybe not the top top\nNo not so much that's not because they're all horrible because they are but there are problems and getting them big like Gavin Newsom pay how dare you question the schools why we're doing a marvelous job and many are\nBut then you find stuff like that where people come in and say compared to what usually span it's only pass bed not even three hundred thousand dollars will do a great after school program and they find out you know sometime after its net as an happened\nJust it's a big state imagine how many times in how many places that kind of thing happens\nOr you vote for a bond and you say well this is going to help our infrastructure and then you wonder every year like we do and why it's so many schools in San Diego unified\nStill aren't air conditioned I thought we did that with bond issue twelve you know whatever number of years ago

one of the things is I'm I'm guessing you and maybe Roseanne are happy that the ratings for the new Roseanne show whatever they're calling it but the ... or the Roseanne is dead them keep watching show um\n[laughter] but it's kind of doesn't roll off the tie that it'll yeah um\nI mean come on they kill off the character by she owed D's on painkillers\nI mean they didn't have to do that you know the ... that shows the writers and much towards Roseanne Barr and we know now because a couple of big executives went on background to talk to the u._k. daily mail yes and they basically said essentially\nThat not only that I regret to weigh Roseanne was treated but there were a couple of cop senior\nDisney executives who had it out for Roseanne and didn't allow her\nAny other alternative but to be totally remote\nSo they were looking for any option like we've talked about it the any way at all to get her out of the picture right\nPretty much ... yes and and once they found it\nThere would not back off in other words she tried hey look what can I Do I'll apologize and under normal circumstances she would have been suspended they put her on hiatus maybe without pay and then she'd get to go on some shows and explain herself and have a chance\nTo rehabilitate herself but ... that that didn't happen but what's amazing about this whole uh the Carter show which is the Roseanne show without Roseanne\nIs the way the crash has taken aside if you look at the New York\nThe way to make it funny\nWell it's a sitcom and I my experiences if you have a sitcom and it's not funny it's headed for the trash yeah and uh they add unprecedented by the way advertising leading up to up to ... you couldn't watch any cable channel I bet\nThey had ads on the golf channel because they they had him on the Fox news channel they had him on TBS had all these\nYou know ... ads leading up to the premier you got to watch the Connors and yet\nCouldn't even take they're like yeah forty to fifty percent down compared to Roseanne they view and it usually moves and Roseanne show did too and they all do uh moved down a little bit from the premier and this is the same network\nThat got rid of a hit show on a friday night which is very hard to get ... Tim Allen's last man standing up\nAnd the Fox network has picked it up but the last three weeks it has done stellar ratings better than it ever did it ABC\nAnd last man standing now and Fox television own friday night\n[laughter] an ABC has some shows you never heard of it you never want to hear of and they're getting a half a point in the Nielsen ratings 'cause this is if a D.C was a stand alone public company going on their shareholders would be suing over the\n... well but it is the different times we have the me too is that which is not to be discounted but the whole the Roseanne saying how dare you be a Trump fan or do anything to even appears to be or could be twisted to comes through the\n...\nOnly Roseanne had gone to the scientists that Elizabeth Warren winter and got a DNA test\nShe would have been [laughter] said she was the Native Americans I still have the gigs\nYeah James ... and you can find them James her some dot com which is H. I. R. S. E. N. dot com and he's an author he's a Newsmax dot com used an attorney he's a professor he's a musician\nA lot of good stuff on James ... now what do you make of what we now know about this uh this Saudi Arabia story with cars Jodie who's last piece appeared what today in the Washington Post little did way they see out of your hung up and editing\nBut this is there's so much in this and of course Tom pale the secretary of state says well I met with the Saudi king met with all the top people and we didn't really talk about that\nHowever they are going to do and investigations can be very transparent\nAnd they'll fully report what's next\nWell you know this this is a truly complex calculus because Saudi Arabia is a critical essential\nAlly of the United states in the middle east it's a bulwark against Iran\nAnd this is why this has such severe ramifications what's amazing to me and I'm working on possibly an article and those this guy the central character here crown prince Mohammed bin Salman called NBS for short\nHas been a favorite\nOf liberals and conservatives it because he is he's young thirty three years old\nAnd he's characterized himself and presented himself as a reformer he wants to reform is long he wants to make things better for women\nIn Saudi Arabia and he wants to do more business with Silicon Valley and Hollywood he worked out a deal to buy a piece\nOf one of the big the biggest talent agency in the world Ari Emanuel brother of rama manuals Zeke Emanuel the manual triplets\nYes for hundreds of millions of dollars he has partied with Bob either the chairman of Disney\nHe met Kobe Bryant um he met stars like Morgan Freeman and throw a rock and the guy's been he's been a rock star ... ... ... ... there were there's great hope\nOf reforming Islam and ... is a guy associated with the\nMuslim Brotherhood\nA guy that when we had one of the biggest tragedies in in American history ... nine eleven he tweeted out or that your nine eleven is like our twenty four seven signed it Palestine so he's like a\nMuslim is and what the world is he doing writing for the Washington Post and the thing that bothers me and you're you're from the Chicago area\n... um the people are being killed every day by professional people\nYeah dry and by the hundreds every year and there are things going there are no go zones essentially were you just want to stay out of there um\nBut ... but the point is when the ... you know organized crime or intelligence agencies or governments kill people they don't do it like this this was a very if it's true\nThat's a good point that this can be ... yet right as sloppy it and then you get back to the issue or not they can you know the guys obviously didn't have parents they allegedly did a show he is but I don't know what made him and unless he thought it would expose\nSome of what we now see and we wonder about and who's behind this if you figure they're going to get him anyway so he goes into the Saudi embassy in Turkey\nWhile his fiance waits outside and he goes and it doesn't come out it was like the old a Roach Motel bugs jak ... I'm not suggesting anything about him and just saying that kind of there you go in you know they have security cameras everywhere so it's not like the hidden thing unless the crazy in the in ... so\nAn insane you know I mean basically if we're to believe the motivation of this crown prince you know this guy was bothering annoying him and he does have a habit of going outside the law he ... he was kidnapped is a\nOpposition and things like that and that's part of a Saudi the day to day activity um\nBut for him to do this with jeopardizing so much in the geo political world and he wants to do so much in the way of reform\nThat's the part I just don't understand so the other thing is of course the Trump Administration has to thread the needle here because if it's proven we haven't seen it hurt the audio tape that turkey claims to have and we're talking about turkey that's headed by another guy that we don't trust her to God\nUm but ... who benefits the most is Saudi Arabia's punished for right now Iran it's Iran you know they benefit they can get away with more of a they're evil days and the other\nBenefit and it appears this way the way the press the press is cheerleading to go to war with Saudi Arabia they're just\nThe other benefits and it appears this way the way the press the prestige cheerleading to go to war with Saudi Arabia to destroy the Saudi Arabia has pledged they will double their oil prices if we sanction them hard\nThat would cause gas prices to go to seven dollars tank the economy I Wonder who would benefit from that won't even twenty\nCombing gee who could it be who made it to be well [laughter] but they're going to try to I can already hear MSNBC they're already on at the CNN to an extent as well somehow this is all gonna be Trump's fault no matter what comes out\nOh no I mean if they could they blame dropped the Trump murdered but\nWell they didn't they didn't make it sound like Trump rounds up journalist and puts them in pens and kills them all went out looking either I mean there's some people actually crazy so no that struck him drone actually does that in this kind of an art form\nWhat Mike I'm pale and Trump are doing is exactly what they should do and that is to make sure they get all the facts in from Canada and they have to punish Saudi Arabia in such a way that Saudi doesn't punish us with their

believe me was a in February rubble his feathers you can hear it on the podcast just like ruffled feathers with a cap on a jar asking about things you want to talk about\nGraciously did as did Duncan Hunter but when I said well you know the cap on the jar has the commercials running that say through your wife under the campaign bus\nAnd Duncan di ... said well let's see my wife found him I said well I mean it really you got to understand that people look at that and I hear from people saying is\nThat when they first allegations came up about the campaign finances\nAnd you repaid some of that because it was Mr appropriate or ... whatever witness maybe that the word that the rate we're putting the wrong place accidentally or otherwise by your wife you brought it up so you can't then say you know leave her out of it when when she was in it because of the first response that's all that's called a fair\nQuestion some of the stuff just drives me nuts\nWith all due respect because you in this community for a long time forty two years since I came here in the covered wagon and I was seven\n\nBut you know I I'm going to remain as independent of voice I I'm not a card carrying Republican I'm not a card carrying member of any party I tend to vote Republican until they embarrassed me and they don't do it well\nSolve but I'm not like I was later and I are talking about this on ... today you know when this whole thing came down with hot or it's like he ought to leave you know I said I'm not prepared to say that because he's not had his day in court have the day in court and let's see\nI Would like to see everything we need to know about any candidate I Want to know all around and the forty nine district about Mike Lebanon and Diane Harkey 'em by the way just see the ad with um it's on behalf of die of a Mike eleven\nAnd its former astronaut Mark Kelly and former Representative Gabrielle Giffords who survived that durable attack in Tucson right\nIs it just me or does it look I mean it's painful I Wish her only the best and she's had such a struggle and she has a struggle to even to speak but it does it is it just me or does it look like they're really really using her of course they are because the whole commercials about\nGun rights gun control we just sensible gun control and that's why they're like my ... and then she's speaking\nIs also done some for Gavin Newsom I Believe it's just painful to watch so who's using home\nSo I'm always going to ask questions find out what's really going on now we asked about the fundraising I asked camp at a jar I said you're going to report some pretty big numbers and your fundraising swabbing I said that they all local numbers\nYes they're mostly local are they from PACs because you said you wouldn't take any pac money so I'm not going to\nTake any corporate tax money so the report came down and they put these out yesterday this is for the three months and the September thirtieth\nDuncan dean hunter in that three month period raised one hundred and thirty three thousand dollars which is not a lot when you're the incumbent basing a hot challenger so you decide what that means a ... it's a hundred and thirty three thousand that's the official report\n\nJust under two hundred thirty three thousand metals reflects the period when this indictment came down or whatever and that's where a hunger would say less than it was political and how the timing wasn't probably was but he still needs his day in court so we know what else we need to know\nSo how to raise the hundred and thirty three thousand in the three month period ending September thirtieth a mark happened a jar his challenger raises one point four million dollars\nThat's because\nPeople in and out of California go hey this thing's in play let's put some money there that the Republicans often nationally don't do they look at California and go wow it doesn't really matter well yeah of\nCourse it does why don't like the Republican National committee they do that kind of stuff even over northern California's is like a Nineteen eighty nine mostly\nSo the report says the capital jar campaign says that their support has driven largely by contributions from individual donors\nWere the source of the report said about Ninety five percent of the receipts the total receipts and the campaign that's according to the federal election commission or committee a data commissioned data\nHunters campaign has about half the contributions from donors the restaurant political action committees political campaigns and I think there was even two thousand dollars from Trump for president in there 'cause he was the first to step out for Trump\nIn ... in the house in two thousand six to eight which he says is why they're targeting him or not we don't know to get to this day in court in December\nI'd like to know if those are individuals they listed as individual donors for capping a jar Ninety five percent of the campaign receipts event like the individual donors that donated to a bronco Obama for whom he worked\nAnd mother whose leadership got security clearances well he did confident or does that [noise]\nIs that like the American and she was house at eight and somewhat in two thousand twelve but especially two thousand eight Obama got all kinds of quote individual contributions bundled up little donations that came from mysterious places these ... some of\nThat here I don't know I'd like to know well that's an unfair question no it's not it's called politics\n[noise]\nWrecking the small groups and discuss meanwhile um\nWhat was it two weeks ago I said watch national and this is the impacts of all races to they're going to play the race card\nRight is what they do and the opposition to resistance\nHere's an example of this is over on one of the cable networks which network is is to get another race there was a\nMSNBC or listen to this guy talking about Donald Trump and uh this uh well the race card is pretty obvious here to\nThe president is completely in the pocket of any other dictators in the world because she Myers their ability to basically kill or tacitly allowed the death of anybody who criticizes him\nI don't think the president ever got on the phone with anybody and Saudi Arabia I don't think he read any sort of a you know a an essay analysis to come to that decision he basically said\nI don't care it was a brown journalists he's not in America and I were fairly happy with our relationship with turkey and I'm perfectly happy with our relationship with Saudi Arabia thing I just wanted to go out and what you say you think it might have been different if if it was a different person Oh yes yeah I think there is a possibility look\nI'm not going to name any particular news networks but I suspect\nThat if this was someone who was a an American who was born here of a different color and perhaps representing a news outlet that the president was more happy where he may have a very different opinion about how serious this is and whether or not Saudi Arabia should be held accountable\nGood lord there's a possibility that so they couched that\nWho is that ... buses are three really have to name him Jason Johnson MSNBC contributor yeah there's a possibility that Trump was saying about the show gave the guy a disappeared\nMSNBC contributor yeah there's a possibility that Trump was saying about the show gave the guy a disappeared ...

people in video games who don't do or say anything I think the simplest way of thinking of it is if you're playing Madden football\nOr any sports game these are the people who are in the stands okay right and they're so they're not so the graphics are great yeah because it doesn't really matter they're just like people in the stands and they're all still like pretty much the same person yes just

usually social\nJustice warriors progressives who are unable to think for themselves or an unable to think objectively the funny okay yeah so the idea is that these people progressive are programmed to spout talking points they don't really have any opinions they just repeat what other people say\nIt's my favorite example does mean is it the picture a screen shot above the five person CNN panel which I vowed to never ever be on a ... will never be on a five six seven person panel that's ridiculous absurd so that they have the screen shot of all the people up on the panel and the faces of each person are\nKinda like Microsoft Paint panned out they're all just sort of pan with two dots fries and a little try and go for a nose in a straight little line for a mouth right so they're just turned into just super simple cartoon non\nPlayer character's this robot right right that's NBC character and PC mean and you'll see a million different examples of these and the left hates it and

night at the sunlight ministry having an election foreign Russ park is here to tell us about Ross how are you sir\nI'm doing great thanks for the opportunity to come on and promote this um we're having a special guest speaker Craig Huey who is the it was an author and TV radio commentary publishes a\nThing called the reality alert and he's president of the election form and uh he's appeared on Fox News and radio stations around Los Angeles such as ...\nThey just got on the show has is where they started but my point is when he tours around is how to vote for and not against your biblical values right so this is a forum where we are going to run through the ballot\nProps and even I was wondering is really important to the judges and I learned was the right people are for these jobs right yeah\nGiven what we should go down with\nKavanaugh and someone who's advanced or the rank of judges ah there was a lot of importance put on the court and\nI don't know if you or anything like me I think I'm somewhat\nRelatively informed and yet when I look through the judges on a ballot I I just don't know where to go with that and one of the things that Craig does a really great job of is explain\nA one way as a person with a biblical worldview how to look at a judge's background in history and decide are they going to do the kind of judging that I Would want in a judge and it really is whether you know are they a Republican or a Democrat or anything like that it's more about\nIf they've done any judging before what if what kinds of ways that have ruled are they a strict constitutional is someone that looks at the law and tries to hold the letter of the law they\nAre somewhat of a you know more of a are we going to interpret things and put my own set of values on it and\nWe talk a little weed out yesterday to a judge creep\nAnd he said he's he's Diego County bar association gave him a not qualified rating method I judge what what is about and he went through is always ... yeah well a while but did not qualified to be a judge and and and I said what's the deal and he said\nWell I went to the initial three person panel hearing and they didn't like some things you had to say about the constitution because he agrees the\nA and right and then they had to have appealed it and there was like twenty eight people there and he wore across\nA lapel and one I have one of the people there and he said a bunch of other people agreed with the to\nThe person said you can't be a Christian and the judge she can't be a an unbiased Christian judge at the same time so they kept the unqualified label for Mr creep\nAmazing and that's one of the reasons we do exactly what we're doing as a saw light ministry believe that the Christians are being told oh you can't have Christian worldview and vote your world view goodness gracious you're going to try to impose your religion on everybody\nWell we believe differently and we're not trying to impose a religion it's just that we happen to be just as much of a citizen as the next guy and the fact that we have a point of view was which we want to use to make decisions\nOr shouldn't be in question a I have I have a right to use my understanding of how the world does and should work based on my biblical values and use that and making decisions on who to vote for and what kind of issues I'm going to say yes or no to but the rest of the ...\nUse that and making decisions on who to vote for and what kind of issues\nI'm going to say yes or no to but the rest of the the the people out there that don't necessarily see eye to eye with my values you don't like the fact that I Want to vote for him\nNow uh when and where is this form that everyone can attend for free\nWe are holding this this coming Sunday night six thirty
