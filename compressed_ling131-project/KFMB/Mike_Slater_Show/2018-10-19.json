phone calls\nThat's on canning and it's All right but I just use it as a computer but I guess you can make calls on it\nAnd you go to seven sixty ... dot com or you go to mark Larson dot com that's M. A. R. K. L. A. R. S. O. M. mark Larson dot com or or seven sixty care for me to come get the podcast and then you won't miss a beat and you can listen to it and no one else for you in the morning\nWhatever works for you as we unpack the issues of the day one of the hotter issues in San Diego politics will get to another one is this this measure el this new with raising salaries of elected officials and that makes people I Know cringe just a bit though don't make judgment yet we have to that's coming up in the second segment but\nYou know the power struggle to just take out another a non union control just\nIncumbent he was a big big deal at San Diego city hall because already the balance of power has shifted they may have told you many times about how the union bosses and have not broad brushing union members here great people who were members of unions and and I really have no choice\nUm but the people who run them sit down and usually in the front row on the street at city hall and they have their arms crossed and they pretty much send signals or tell people in the back hallway during the tenth floor they'll say hey you got to understand how we're when in the states that different thing now we're\nReally you're working for us that kind of thing it's ugly so they know they can take out one\nOf the incumbents who doesn't go along with their side\nCase in point of view gets a ... or or Laurie zap and district to then you've got a better chance to get what you want and they may even pick up ... who's who's a Democrat and on the side but not always in favor of some of the far left why would they do that by the power of course\nBut mayor Wagner will be term limited out and you got to have I think it's six votes to override any mayoral move is done in his final stretch over west the next couple of years\nSo he can understand why it's a big deal so anything and everything is used and it's the ... campaign season where you pretty much say anything you want\nAnd the opponent from where he's at Jennifer Campbell is claiming a lot of things that ... campaign saying wait a minute that's not what's going on here John Hawaii is the\nCampaign uh mogul uh\nThe guru for the ... campaign there what's really going on with this I haven't met Jennifer Campbell I'm sure she's a ... a nice person but there is some claims are crying foul on these what's up\nWell she's smart by the way thanks for having me on this morning and you you characterized it right this is really a struggle for control of the city council whether it's kept whether it's going to be taxpayer oriented or special interest oriented\nThe Democrats and the labor unions that big labor bosses as you point out correctly went out and recruited or a person from Claremont who had been a utterly unknown before in fact when\nWe began asking about or are about ... Jennifer Campbell the most common response was getting for who or no one had heard of her she hadn't been involved in anything one of the things that we discovered when we began to look a little bit or background was this\nI can only be described as a as a disability scam\nSome years ago about eight years ago ten years ago\nNow she claimed that she was a one hundred percent disabled she had three a disability insurance policies which I never heard of that before and an over the next uh six seven years she collected about\nSeven hundred and twenty nine thousand dollars until finally the insurance company kinda cried foul had been asking for some additional reviews of her medical records to board certified rheumatologist examiner and said no she's ready to go back to work but we just what the insurance company discovered though\nUp pop up a pup tent Alexis how fast parking lots I wouldn't be the first in line to get the all new Lexus yes but you know it's the class leading hybrid

Tuesday [noise] say\n... to tell you off the night I Hope they didn't hurt your feelings that maybe you're one winning moments you've about lotto tickets for the mega millions of Powerball\nNot sure that carries over if it does we'd like a piece of it I just just said meanwhile uh speaking of money\nOne of the measures that it might cause your eyes glaze over in there because there's proposition is there's measure that the one of the San Diego measures\nThat is actually the focus of an editorial in the union hype attribute today and this is measure else this is for San Diego voters is has to do with compensation for elected officials what's interesting is that the the lead\nEditorial today's is no on measure el make officials justify it and we've touched on that with a with John ... worries that she's not taking a position of the council said well let the public\nVote on it which you could make the case gives them cover I think that's the point that the union Tribune's making right alongside it is the case for Israel by Bob bottling\nIt was a successful attorney been around San Diego a long time he says the chief proponent of measure rail and former chairman of the San Diego salary setting commission Bob oddly joined us so Bob uh this is unusual you have both Republican and democratic parties here locally endorsing this should I be nervous it makes me nervous when everybody's smiling but then you chi has been grumpier apparently grumpy\n[noise] well yeah you can never figure at your table Mark I'm in a town over three decades three and a half decades I have never and I've been involved in ... city government issues that's how I got here I have never seen more bipartisan support for\nManager or an issue that's how I got to go about the Democratic central committee and the Republican central committee have endorsed this measure the league of women voters or taxpayers association a super majority of both Republicans and Democrats and the city council voted to put it on the ballot so it's great\nSo the bottom line here and I know a pretty much everybody will recall I Do at times even with the people I Know who do a great job on Monday we'll city council really anything I mean there are people who really give their all and it's really not all that lucrative most time Congress may be a different thing but you have a lot of different expenses\nAnd so forth and temptations were having a but it's been Fifteen Years in San Diego's elected officials had a raise and then that's where many would say maybe I Would say this won't pie and make them work for it but you contend that we're not getting as great quality people as we could is that part of the deal here plus the ethics I mean they\nThey test for this measure and and and by the way this is a comprehensive package of ethical reforms but one of them response to the two thousand Fifteen grand jury recommendation that that recommends that city council no longer vote on there\nOr is but one of them response to the two thousand Fifteen grand jury recommendation\nThat that recommends that the city council no longer vote on their own pay because it's inherent conflict of interest and it's fundamentally flawed showing that charter they're forced to vote on their own pay\nBut at the grand jury has pointed out when they do so there's a conflict if players that one of two ways and the city of bell California people went to jail because they dramatically increase their pay here they've dramatically decrease pay and that's one thing real dollars\nBecause they use that to their political advantage and were that hurts all of us is that decreases dramatically the number of people who can afford to run for office which in turn drives down the quality of representation that we get\nThe whole thing between behind prop out is that we really need a citizen legislature we need people that are willing to come in for forty eight years through other and rank come down and serve the community but let's make it possible so they can afford to do so because right now all we have is career politicians\nOr is there any evidence about all these side deals and whatever I did it in public officials I Know ... one of them were charged with the John ... who works with her on the campaign 'em and they're always out these people are always out there with one meeting or another obviously during campaign season they're raising a lot of money is anybody running like some side stuff so that becomes a conflict or what\nWell what measure all does is first of all at lemonade three distinct things they can do now that benefit them personally or politically first of all it precludes them from taking speaking fees before groups they appear\nTo you and I probably can't afford to have an expensive dinner for an elected member but these groups have special interest groups are doing that all the time we eliminate that\nWay I sold lemonade this practice that everybody listening has seen which has wearing humbling utilizes constituent may lanes on taxpayer dollars to essentially campaign for reelection\nAnd then the third thing we do is wait prohibit\nFormer city elected officials from ... city for two years after they leave office so they can't cash in on their office\nAnd andme aren't we also get rid of the sky box as most people know may not know this but the city council held back sky boxes ... first at the chargers stadium that at the Padres stadium they used to take lobbyist to those hang so you'd have this access that the rest of us don't have\nRight and then they pulled it a few years ago right and then they kind of sneak back in is that what happened\nNow got worse what they do is every council office can designate people in their district or constituent groups to get these tech so that's over a hundred thousand dollars a year and free tickets they're able to give out as they're gearing up to run for reelection\nWow what we're going to do is end the practice which more than have for the pay increase and I'm now will market\nThose seats and that'll create revenue to the treasures office instead of allowing them essentially to have an extra hundred grand a year to run for reelection\nRight well read all about it in today's union hype and Tribune you can find it on line there if you know and I I go to the old fashioned way are you going to be able to wrap something amiss Saddam fancy when the uh the bad but uh Bob on making the case from Israel\nOpposite the editorials saying no make officials of the on the record than vote for a very interesting um and I I'm I'm leaning toward the saying I'm for it so thanks Bob appreciate it\nThink about all the way I Am seven sixty talking breaking news coming up fleet week San Diego's coming up and ended up so there's two coming up so I give you a lot of the decision and we'll talk to a true a male veterans hero coming up or just a minute about that and

answered unanswered questions at my age and so forth um do we have to we have a better mindset now or are we a little more more ...\nI think we're I think we're worse off [laughter] myself now this is my opinion but uh we were so divided in this country and\nIn my mind to America we seemed to be a society where uh you know we're interested in a a thirty ... thirty minutes sitcom or an hour program like that and we just move on and we came to ... to ... to forget our history\nAnd uh I I just think that uh for instance\nI think part of it too is it only one percent of the population now served in the military so we got one percent of our population checking of the rest of us which is kind of a\nHistoric I guess but or the debate it's kinda sad because I always looked at it as everybody should serve a little bit and give back to the country for all the great I'm sure are things that we have in this country\nAnd one of the ways to do that is just weren't events like fleet week and so forth um it it is in first and we're kind of used to this so much in San Diego running into members of the military all the time that is ... lessening of being here but most parts of the country a lot of parts of the country\nYou rarely see someone attract a who is serving or has served and and that's why this continues to be important to broaden the message\nI'm Jack and two of us a calf niche and talking about three weeks San Diego here post some of his background you should just Google Home and read his\nAh read his bio a representative of so many with whom you served and and that's always

people will never figure that one out people have ruined California and then they're going with the taxes that are ruined taxes\nThat's gotta be wanting aspect of it are aired your dad had a a less right he he did yes that's got to be a top part of it to the fact that they're fully present throughout this entire process what does that like for them and for you\nOr it was it was really difficult in my dad's journey he was officially diagnosing in October of sixteen or six months after that can barely move a six months after that he was dead and\nI'm physically it was very difficult for him but also mentally to your point having to watch himself go through this\nUm just before his diagnosis she was on a surf trip and crew had surfed twice a day for more than the sixty years here throughout San Diego and or to go from that sort of freedom in active lifestyle to zero mobility within such a short time frame was at first very overwhelming\nHow did ... how is his mental state throughout it\n[noise] um he in the beginning really struggled with a diagnosis he just uh was devastated by now with the lifestyle change that happened so quickly but I'm In my dad's true spirit he quickly turn things around and focused on the positive and what he could do and what he wanted to do\nA well he's still have the time awesome or I should bring this up to a there's a walk a right to the bail us walk this Sunday Sunday morning nine AM and start a seven thirty you can show up and enjoy the festivities ah whereas this\nMission bay DMZ Kobe product up to two thousand to to show up bugs going to be a very dynamic day if I kind of term it might cause our biggest support group meeting of the year as right it's a very dynamic than Eric has done a phenomenal job organizing the event prop can give you a few little points on on what to expect\nLocked starts at nine am a prior to that at eight thirty will be are opening ceremony we\nHave some nice surprises for that I'm proud of eight thirty a folks will start showing up at approximately seven thirty and that's when registration opens for those who haven't yet registered on line\nAnd we have all sorts of activities have made it very family friendly friendly this year including a coffee truck pointing free coffee all morning inflatable bounce houses for children some other long games and a two areas that are especially important to us this year one of which is our remembrance civilian\nWhere we have some beautiful photos of names of those that we've recently lost\nAnd and also our keys to unlock LS program and what that is this will be worrying for a different color land yards at the walk\nAll the participants will and each color stands for different reasons of why they're walking or in my case I wear white same with David because we've lost somebody reading means you're in for the fight\nA yellow you're you're walking because you have a a less the disease and and um [noise] in blue means you're there and support somebody\nWow Les wow wow that's super cool brings here's what I imagine being there and seeing someone with a yellow lingered ooh good night that's mhm yeah that's pretty that's something that's power for at that moment on a you know my\nOn that topic you know it's probably somebody that that is engaged with our chapters someone does register with our chapter of the families are involved with our chapter what is our chapter do you know we we don't charge our families a penny\nAnd so we want to provide as much support as we can all be at a quip man I'll be support groups I'll be at home modifications ideas thoughts tried to get ahead of the journey and I think in this case with you know Eric can End Days you know\nWe've done everything we could to try to support them through this process and you know we're we're certainly I'm inspired by their courage inspired by their fight you know I had a chance to really get to know Eric's father amazing dynamic\nUm he made my day to day better than I think I'm I mean as a personality and I'm so Sunday is going to be a really important day for all of us\nTo come out I'm David tell me about your wife are\nGoing was a fifty eight when she passed away she was an amazing mom you know she was the love of my life she\nMade everybody's they'd better ... what we've already talked about is just the kind of person she was\nAnd she loved people deeply and uh when she first was diagnosed you thought we thought she had multiple sclerosis ... does that was the science that she was showing so she had hoped everyday that something's gonna happen it's going to make this better\nAnd when we finally found out that it was a less initially it was a terrible shock you know when you hear that you have something that is a hundred percent fatal is very\nDefining you know you definitely you have a definition of when your life is going to end\nAnd uh she was a very quickly though to a different spirit about her and brought it with dignity and love and you know because she was of are full of mind of until just a few days she uh she loved us she loved our daughter she loved her family is ... ...\nGoing down the dignity ... what do you mean by that can you give an example\nShe asked me one time or do I have to keep letting people come see me you know she said I I I've I realize some people\nThey asked me one time or do I have to keep letting people come see me you know she said I I I've I realize some people feel like they need to come to say goodbye to me but I think I'm ready\nYou know that I don't need to keep saying goodbye and then she thought about it for a minute and she said\nNo I think I think I Need to keep letting people come and sit here with me and and if it's helping them then I'm okay with that and and for her to be like that you know it was just incredible that she was always thinking about other people\nYou know all the time what was the hardest emotional part for her\n... eventually I guess a a less you lose all use of your limbs completely I mean she couldn't scratch your nose\nSo I mean in the middle of the night one night there was an aunt growing across or ... and she screamed and ... there was an ad and a run in there and\nYou find that and then make sure there weren't any others and I think that was the hardest thing for her that she lost complete control of her life she had nothing she can do nothing on her own\nLittle what was the hardest part than of that for you but then also like it was there and do you have any silver lining to solve it is there any positive aspect that you got out of this horrific experience\n[laughter] well that's a that's a difficult question\nThe positive side is that it brought our family together ... friends together and still are you know there's over twenty people on our team coming when a Sunday you have to walk and\nLot of people who supported financially and we've gotten cards and you know from others who couldn't be there and uh just our family is I Would say much closer much tighter knit than it was before because of the commonality of\nA terrible disease like this happening to someone that they all loved Kelly would have been grateful for that yeah she's I Know she's happy that we're doing this\nFair physically what was the hardest thing for you for the husband\nOf\nPhysically I was getting very little sleep because I was on duty around the clock that I was going to work for a long time and then I took off a ... took advantage of it though if MLA and a stay at home with her but we had help during the day but insurance doesn't pay\nAnd hospice is wonderful but they don't come in but more than an hour or so a day so the rest of the time you're on duty yourself and that means at nighttime anything that happens you're up I wasn't sleeping hardly at all\nOr so physically you know it was very difficult but it was an honor to take care of her I mean she kept saying I'm so sorry I'm so sorry I'd be like ... okay\nI'm honored to be able to do this for you\nSo I was literally the word I was thinking it's an honor Muslim I then started two seconds for came out of your mouth [laughter] yeah um\n[noise] any final thoughts David final message ... final final lesson from your wife's life ... slash your family's experience through all this\nI'm Amazed at how a a\nAn organization like this one has came to our side very quickly\nAnd ah provided us with support that we we\nWere lost I mean we had no idea what what direction to go to Keith Miller who's also a part of the ill is came to our home and did an evaluation\nRight away stuff there with us with Kelly we laugh we talked he looks like Santa Claus [laughter] and uh we we have\nA great time you know learning okay here's what to expect over the next\nFew weeks few months that she had left and um our family came together in a way that I never could have to carry her sister moved in with us now as a nurse she was able to provide support that\nWe couldn't have done on her own she literally moved in with us for the last two weeks of Kelly's life and uh was bonded us\nAll that much more so uh I'm I'm I Can't say that I'm grateful that I went through it like I say I'm grateful that you know we've come out of it ... around the other side of it now my daughter lives with me and\nUm we we are holding onto each other every day one day at a time limit\nOr how about you do you have your dad's a life lesson you learned out of all the\nUm you know go uh\nBusiness needs bass secure networks to be efficient and profitable

homelessness\nA in the last uh thirty five years have dealt with the people that deal with them\nAnd seeing how to create innovative solutions have done that as the da keeping people out of jail instead of putting them in what we can get them turned around a and I think that uh with my experience of innovation and out of the box thinking that's what I bring to the board of supervisors I'm a change agent just like I was the eighth or office\nAnd I don't believe in that same fresh look to uh to the border supervised\nHow about the fact that all the board of supervisors the doors to the fact that they've all endorsement all want you as their\nColleagues and people may vote for that other person who's not endorsed by them\nUm let me ask you about mental health because this is a a big

do to help\nWell right now the biggest mental health facility in the county is the share is the jail yeah and that's just not right\nSo um what the reason why I understand it so much as we probably
