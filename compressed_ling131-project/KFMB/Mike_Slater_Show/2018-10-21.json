payment plans okay\nThis is a rotten terrible idea end up paying more for the phone each month likely been for your service each month\nAnd so it means just step back and look at in spite of all the

pretty persistent and so I just said let me\nLook them up and see what they are all about but ah I haven't really been able to find out much about them so I guess my thought is I'm a ... number two um if they all legit today you know do a\nA little law offer on your property and what are the dangers order risk in in going forward with one of these folks yeah and I'm I'm just doing it primarily right now for\nEducation to learn what they were about what their business model is like so that I can make an informed decision\nRight so the the people who are approaching years your house a house in good condition and I are established neighborhood\nYes it is\nSo go ahead and name who it is who is on your radar is there any particular company that\nYou're curious about\nI'm One of them call a a thing goes by name open door\nAh I've addressed open door on the air and let me explain to you what this is about there are a number of companies that are sabotaging and they're racing to establishing city after city in the country\nWhere for um [noise]\nI guess you could refer to as mid priced homes in a market there's enough inventory where they feel like they can figure out what is a fair value for your home so with these people do is they guarantee lie in the case of open door and\nIts competitors they guarantee you that they'll they'll evaluate your home they may come in and they'll do that on line they may come in and do an inspection\nAnd then they will make a firm offered to you to buy your home and then with the idea being that you've vacate really quickly typically within a month can be quicker but\nThey just buy it and they charge you roughly the equivalent of a real estate commission to do what they charge you about six percent\nOf all I'd say just for argument's sake they said the house was worth\nTwo hundred thousand they would pay you like one eighty eight somewhere in there and you're out and you're just going to the question with any of them oh and the reason they do that\nIs they believe that they develop systems open during his competitors leave they develop systems\nWhere they can properly price a house cat it I'm dressed up however they need to win the landscaping or inside\nAnd get it sold quicker than you can with you going to a traditional real estate agent and having them market the traditional way whether or not these things are going to\nStand the test of time the market will decide the weight you get out of it is you're just done ... if you like the price they offer you ma'am you're out no questions no gifts you know you're done you don't have to worry about showing the house or anything like that\nI see okay and you also have to decide the price that you were offered [noise]\nDo you think they're low balling you or do you feel like it's really a decent offered they're making\nFor your house all day does that make sense\nYes yes it does I just wanted to have an idea what they're about whether or not you know they were\nTotally totally legit no doubt\nThat this is a a a real thing and the company's doing this I think another one is offer pat is another one and there's another one called knock\nAnd so with these companies they're learning how to price they're learning how to market their learning how to sell\nAnd then they add cities around the country very heavy emphasis\nOn the south south west and west and the reason those areas because those are areas of the country that developed along the automobile have a lot of suburban housing a lot of uh subdivisions and developments built with very similar\nHousing plans and looks so they can more accurately price the house they're not interested\nAnd really high end houses 'cause they don't know exactly how to price them and how easily they'll sell and they're not interested in the houses that tend to be in neighborhoods let's say there in transition that maybe had been rough neighborhoods trying to get better or something like that\nBut it is the real deal\nAnd Tom is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Tom\nHi how're you doing stuff that corporate thank you Tom how can I be of service\nWell about a year and a half ago I got us let's say in the mail for a credit card from a small business and I thought well let me go and sign up for this 'cause it never hurts to have a backup card case you need it\nSo I I when I got the cars started isn't that because it actually had a better cash back or than the one I was using crack this way so that was going fine one afternoon I got an email from the credit card companies saying well we've got your address change which obviously was a mine so I called them\nStopped the card you know sent me a villain the whole smear at that point to sue the cart into the to my file and started using my original our Afghan and last September this last September I got the same message from the credit card company so I called them\nThey went to the old hands on they sent me a new card and then it happened again and also all kinds of happened it's been a different addressed if a male and the new car too [laughter] so I talked to the company and they sent me on to the frog department that

me some language skills to say well people can guess that well maybe not but it's still a bit level of security they should offer\nThere's an issue though that I Need to point out to you the reason the current issue or\nMay not care as much with a business credit card\nHis business credit cards don't enjoy the consumer protections fit a consumer card does under pre existing law and the card act that was passed after the banking scandals so the Congress carved out the exception\nSingle and the card act was passed after the banking scandals\nSo the Congress carved out the exception to consumer protections for business cards\nSo as an example let's say a criminal did run up a lot of charges on your car and if they were successful you able to take it over and run up charges their credit card company with a business card can say oh well\nWe don't think they you Tom took good precautions and so we're going to hold you liable for the charges or whatever which they cannot do want to consumer

just discussed with you with a massive changes going on in how you buy a mattress in the U.S and how online sellers\nOr where all the gross is in traditional players are shrinking bankrupting out closing their doors because people are finding the shopping experience so much more pleasant\nBuying a mattress on line where there's no pressure no confusion and you have typically three months to decide if he liked the mattress or not if you don't like it no questions asked you get all your money back\nIs so much better\nThan the old way of going into a store having high pressure I'm self consciously laying down on a bed for a few seconds to say oh no that one doesn't work let's try this or do I know I like that wouldn't maybe then you get the thing home and you're like this the worst thing ever\nHappened to my mother in law and father in law that they bought a mattress in a mattress store and hated it so much but uh you know all sales final there were stuck with the thing\nAnd they then next round bought one of the mattress in a box and got a great one well now the traditional\nMattress stores are pretty fired up and now trying to get tariffs put in\nOn foreign manufacturers of these mattresses in a box the good news is they're going to fail because amazing stats I saw in a market white story\nThe Chinese account for almost no market share\nIn the mattress in a box business\nSo\nTerrorists are not gonna ride to the rescue of the high pressure retailers trying to cram some mattress down your wallet that you don't really want because the Chinese\nI mean they're almost none of the market at all so you just have all your fun\nPutting tariffs on Chinese mattress makers 'cause it's not gonna make any difference it is quite courageous that you're trying to use political influence to keep yourselves operating and you just know as a consumer when you're looking for a mattress checkout these online sellers\nYou're going to love what they do you're

Michelle how're you doing\nClark I'm good how are you great how can I serve you\nWell I have a lot of daily life changes happening in the upcoming lands and I'm trying to figure out what the best part is timeline wouldn't be we are um can say opening up a new business and getting an SBA loan and also purchasing our first home\nA little bottle low\nWe shouldn't do all of that maybe we should read [laughter] wow\nWell yes [laughter] you do have fired me advice or what I what I heard as I heard cash flow\nKnocking out the door starting a business moving buying a house starting a business always short order\nYeah how and the world would you sleep at night you must they must feel no anxiety out all your life\nComes and goes a specially during the day\nBecause I Would I Will tell you you know I Wonder if you've ever heard me talk about and I should do the sometime soon talk about my path to where I Am today but [laughter] when [laughter]\nWhen I started my own business and I was twenty five at the time\nI had so much anxiety I Would wake up in the middle of the night just anxious couldn't go back to sleep you know worried about a wrong worried about something went wrong the day before whatever\nAnd if I it piled on top of that like a house in the same time I mean I I think my head would've exploded\nSo oh my goodness maybe years ... who can handle the dual 'cause you gotta do suck there on cash flow by home and starting a business so which is more important to you right now [noise]\nI'm starting a business is is more important if we have to rent temporarily that's okay um\nWe have that that matched me stop shallow breathing the same\nDay [laughter]\nSee some kind of entrepreneurial P. T. as David said that I was like [laughter]\nOkay um\n'cause you don't know exactly how the business is going to go how how quickly is going to be profitable how much it's going to grow how slow is going to grow and I want you to be careful because you buy a home you got a fixed overhead there you rent you know it gives you more flexibility\nOkay how are you for the business\nI'm a combination of the sun some cash and to some some alone and do it we wouldn't be investing in a franchise is is there out we're going to go and then um we have twenty percent down saved away for the home in a way we can\nYeah I Would really I'm I'm really asking you to put that just on the shelf for now\nBecause when you start a new business you don't know what your cash flow needs are going to be you know you know the franchise people are going to promise you that oh yeah our trend line is you're going to be casual positive and how many months do they tell you\nHow proud I say anything they show is their best guy their worst guy in their average guy and and I and even their worst guy would be okay with that is\nOkay All right well that's good I ... and ... either you you say we as you and your husband are going to\nOwn a business have either of you worked in the industry before that you're going to have this franchise\n[noise] we have not\nSo I'm just all a stop signs and red lights right now I'm a big fan of one of you going to work for one of the franchise is doing anything and everything\nFor at least three months because you got the rest of your life you can own the franchise but I really\nLike for you to uh experience that one or both of you to experience the business before you're all lay on\nOkay\nAnd I don't know if that's something you've considered but with any business whether it's a franchise or not having some experience when your money's not at risk\nThere's so much you learn in a relatively short period of time that women aids issues concerns mistakes you might make once you're owning up not parading it\n[noise] yeah that makes sense\nSo I put your whole life on hold but you wanted to talk to about\nOkay well I'm I respect your opinion and I thank you so

part time and a beach community in Florida and our next door neighbor as well as about oh about a dozen homes in our area are built using a new construction method\nWhere the homes are built like and I think this is the one in Mexico beach was the same kind of idea built with concrete and know sheet rock at\nAnd the homes are built to withstand a cat five hurricane plus\nAnd the windows may not survive they may blow out the home itself is a hundred percent structurally sound\nAnd all that has to be done is that supposed out there is no issue with mold and so the reason I bring this up is we in America face an increasing problem with flooding\nFrom population growth um increase rainfall he's wearing a cycle of that\nAnd much of the United states and there are so many techniques that can be used\nThat will make homes and people in them safer make the structures more solid I went and toured\nA neighborhood in Holland is a an area of subject to flooding a lot of Holland is below sea level and they now have these homes for flood blown error prone areas that I went to see that the homes rise with the rising water\nAnd the cost of constructing them no higher than normal construction it just rethinking how you build for circumstance we in the United states tend to after a flood or disaster to rebuild exactly as we did before\nAnd a lot of these things if we think about how do we prepare\nFor the unexpected\nA lot of these things don't cost\nIn many cases any more money\nOr just little amount photo incremental amounts to make a structure much more robust make it safer\nAnd eliminate the thing of wash rents and repeat where property gets destroyed and then you have to rebuild and then another a active nature happens you have to rebuild again on and on there's no need for

term maybe sometimes used in a state\nThe flagship state universities charge the highest tuition\nThen there'll be second tier third tier forest here is a community colleges many of which now offer a four year degrees each here has a different tuition level the greatest irony of it though the whole system\nIs that people who go to a first tier state school\nYou're a freshman and sophomore year will be far larger class sizes than someone who goes to a fourth tear\nCommunity college and the state so you might be in a classroom that has fourteen hundred students or eight hundred students or something like that at a tier one the flagship university in a state\nInstead going to a community college to deal with your ... as a freshman or sophomore you might be in a class with twenty six

going not ... not bad at all how can I be of service do you\nWell over this last ... maybe a little bit longer up and get offers from companies that are interested in buying my house you know they're pretty persistent and so I just said let me\nLook them up and see what they were all the falls but uh I haven't really been able to find out much about them so I guess my thought is um [noise] uh they ... number two um if they are legit today you know do a\nA low low offer on your property and what are the dangers or to a risk in in going forward with one of these folks yeah and I'm I'm just doing it primarily right now for education to learn what they were about what their business model is like\nSo that I can like uninformed decision\nRight so the the people who are approaching use your house a house in good condition and I are established neighborhood\nYes it is so go ahead and name who it is who is on your radar is there any particular company that you're curious about [noise]\nUm one of them cause a a thing goes by name open door\nAh I've addressed open door on the air and let me explain to you what this is about there are a number of companies that are sabotaging and they're racing to establishing city after city in the country\nWhere for um [noise] I guess you could refer to as mid priced homes in a market there's enough inventory where they feel like they can figure out what is a fair value for your home so with these\nIf and when tore where they feel like they can figure out what is a fair value for your home so with these people do is they guarantee lie in the case of open door and\nIts competitors they guarantee you that they'll they'll evaluate your home they may come in they'll do that on line they may come in and do an inspection and then they will make a firm offered to you\nTo buy your home and then with the idea being that you've vacate really quickly typically within a month can be quicker but they just buy it and they charge you roughly the equivalent of a real estate commission to do it they charge you about six percent\nOf all I'd say just for argument's sake they said the house was worth two hundred thousand they would pay you like one eighty eight somewhere in there and you're out and you're just going so the question with any of them oh and the reason they do that\nIs they believe that they develop systems open during his competitors leave they develop systems\nWhere they can properly price a house cat it I'm dressed up however they need to end the landscaping or inside\nAnd get it sold quicker than you can when you going to a traditional real estate agent and having them market the traditional way whether or not these things are going to\nStand the test of time the market will decide for weight you get out of it is you're just die if you like the price they offer you ma'am you're out no questions no gifts you know you're done you don't have to worry about showing the house or anything like that\nI see okay and you also have to decide the price that you were offered [noise]\nDo you think they're low balling you or do you feel like it's really a decent offered they're making for your house\nAll day does that make so\nYes yes it does I just wanted to have an idea what they're about whether or not you know they were totally\nTotally legit no doubt that this is a a a real thing and the company's doing this I think another one is offer pat I think is another one and there's another one called knock\nAnd so these companies they're learning how to price they're learning how to market their learning how to sell and then they add cities around the country very heavy emphasis on\nThe south south west and west and the reason those areas because those are areas of the country that developed along the automobile have a lot of suburban housing a lot of ... a a subdivisions and developments\nBuilt with very similar housing plans and looks so they can more accurately price the house they're not interested\nAnd really high end houses because they don't know exactly how to price them and how easily they'll sell and they're not interested in the houses that tend to be in neighborhoods let's say there in transition that maybe had been rough neighborhoods trying to get better or something like that\nBut it is the real deal\nAnd Tom is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Tom\nHi how're you doing ... corporate thank you Tom how can I beat him service\nWhile about a year and a half ago I got us will stay so the mail for a credit card from a small business and I thought oh let me go and sign up for this 'cause I never hurts to have a backup card Kay she made it\nSo I I when I got the cars started isn't that because it actually had a better cash that war than the one I was using crave

milk sent me an oil and the whole smear at that point it through the cart into the two lifestyle and started using my original heart again\nAnd at last September this last September I got the same message from the credit card company so I called them\nThey went to the old hands on they sent me a new card and then it happened again and also three times as happened it's been a different addressed that well now in the car too so I talked to the company and they sent me on the front of the ... in a whole thing I did ask them I said no other cars I have\nFor a second level security where they

I'm not even allowing gay [laughter]\nBut it said that all or they said that they they they gave me some of lame excuse to say well people can guess that well maybe not but it's still should be a level of security that should offer\nLike there's an issue though that I Need to point out to you the reason the card issue or may not care as much with a business credit card\nIs business credit cards don't enjoy the consumer protections said a consumer card does under pre existing law and the card act was passed after the banking scandals\nSo the Congress carved out exception to consumer protections for business cards so as an example\nLet's say a criminal did run up a lot of charges on your car and if they were successfully able to take it over and run up charges their credit card company with a business card can say oh well\nWe don't think they you Tom took good precautions and so we're going to hold you liable for their charges or whatever which they cannot do want a consumer car so I don't like even if you're using a card\nFor business purposes I like for you to get the consumer card and just use it in your business and pay for it from your business\nIs it less course

because people are finding their shopping experience so much more pleasant\nBuying a mattress online where there's no pressure no confusion and you have typically three months to decide if you like the mattress or not if you don't like it no questions asked you get all your money back\nIs so much better than the old way of going into a store having a high pressure I'm\nSelf consciously laying down on a bad for a few seconds to say oh no that one doesn't work let's try this or do I know I like that one maybe but then you got the thing home and you're like this the worst thing ever\nHappened

how are you great how can I serve you\nWell I have a lot of daily life changes happening in ... and I'm trying to figure out what the best slightest timeline when the\nWay our um can say opening up a business and getting an SBA loan and also purchasing our first home\nI don't know what I mean we shouldn't do all of it maybe we should rent [laughter] wow yes [laughter] you just have fired me\nOh maybe we shouldn't do all of it maybe we can read [laughter] wow\nYes [laughter] you just have fired me by what I what I heard as I heard cash flow knocking out the door starting a business moving buying a house starting a business always in short order\nYeah\nHow and the world would you sleep at night you must feel no anxiety at all or what\nIt comes and goes ... during the day\nBecause I Will I Will tell you you know I Wonder if you've ever heard me talk about and I should do this sometime soon talk about my path to where I Am today but [laughter] when [laughter]\nWhen I started my own business and I was twenty five at the time\nI had so much anxiety I Would wake up in the middle of the night just anxious couldn't go back to sleep you know worried about hey wrong worried about something went wrong the day before whatever\nAnd if I had piled on top of that lying a house in the same time I mean I I think my head would've exploded so\nOh my goodness maybe years ... who can handle the do because you gotta do suck there on cash flow by home and starting a business so which is more important to you right now\n[noise] I'm starting a business is is more important if we have to rent temporarily that's okay um\nWe have that that made me stop shallow breathing man saying hey [laughter] see some kind of entrepreneurial P. T. as Steve said that I was like [laughter]\nOkay [laughter] okay um\n'cause you don't know exactly how the business is going to go how quickly is going to be profitable how much it's going to grow how slow it's going to grow and I want you to be careful because you buy a home you got a fixed overhead there you rent you know it gives you more flexibility\nOkay how are you from the business\nI'm a combination of the sun some cash and to some some alone and so it will be and that Santa franchises as they're out we're going to go and then uh we have a twenty percent down saved away for the home if we can\nYeah I was literally I'm I'm really asking you to put that just on the shelf for now\nBecause when you start a new business you don't know what your cash flow needs are going to be you know you know the franchise people are going to promise you that oh yeah our trend line is you're going to be casual positive and how many months and they tell you\nHad to promise anything they show is their best guy their worst guy in their average guy and and I and even their worst guy would be okay with that\nOkay All right well that's good I ... and ... either you you say we is that you and your husband are going to\nHave either of you\nWorked in the industry before that you're going to have this franchise\n[noise] we have not\nSo I'm just all a stop signs and red lights right now I'm a big fan of one of you going to work for one of the franchise is doing anything and everything for at least three months\nBecause you got the rest of your life you can own the franchise but I really like for you to uh experience at one or both of you to experience the business before you're all in\nOkay\nThan I don't know if that's something you've considered but with any business whether it's a franchise or not having some experience when your money's not at risk\nYou there's so much you learn in a relatively short period of time that women eight five issues concerns mistakes you might make
