west dot com and they cook on the alec ask Joe and you know All right\nSo you can just go to our website and speaking of the website we got a couple of emails questions as we get get right into\nAll right we got rich or from shy town [noise] hey guys thanks for the great show and entertainment well pick you rich [laughter]\nI Am a few years from retiring and have a question about the three bucket withdraw strategy [noise]\nIf I understand correctly the first bucket is short for money cash one or two years second bucket his mentor money bonds three to nine years of expenses in the last bucket for the longer term stocks\nThey say this is good since the three the nine year bond bucket would carry you through a recession without you having to touch with her bucket of stocks if correct my question is how would this work if you had a large portfolio\nIf you have three million dollars in needed say fifty year doing above would put you in an allocation of about\nEighty five percent stocks and Fifteen Percent bombs\nIsn't uh too risky does the bucket approach makes sense for higher portfolios thanks [noise]\nQuestion buckets that buckets of money ... no fuzzy now that this was not the way with the show I think because he thought well maybe not [laughter] she said higher Chicago San Diego guy guys I think for the great shall we might have been talking about buckets of money that we thought this was that\nI doubt it let's say you there we go what's your what's your answer of this uh\nWell let me see if I can sort of paraphrase the buckets of money strategy so that I guess the idea is you have really safe assets in the short term bucket because that's what you're going to drop plan for the next year or two maybe three whatever the new ... not ... but that they're that did happen\nAnd then the second back at it as kind of like Moody's mid range ... yeah that's exactly what was then the second bucket and that there were submissive there anyway that's a whole other show topic\nHow and then to the last a long term button bucket is your stocks your long term um money ... ... yeah the thing that these attacks and there I think\nAnyway the concept is fine we I guess we would say it differently so\nFast so I although I like the concept I'm gonna tell you how we would think about this a ... which is kind of get rid of the buckets of money idea although it's not necessarily bad per se but but I Would I Would say this first first there's there's a couple of ways you can go about this one is rich to figure out\nWhat you're spending needs are and sounds like you already have that's fifty thousand a year\nCamped so let's make sure you get a look at at least ten years of safety so that's fifty times ten that's six hundred thousand that's probably where you came up with a Fifteen Percent I'm guessing that three million\nThat is the way but that's that's that that's the only one way to figure out exactly what you want that that you know that's one approach another approach going at a different direction which is the er the fifty thousand dollars out of your portfolio three million what rate of return eat\nRight and and the rate of return is probably relatively low at at fifty thousand and three million them probably\n... percent and a half maybe something like that lower than two percent\nSo in other words you don't have to take much risk you can have a much higher bond portfolio if you want to on the other hand\nBecause you've got you have not that huge of a need you could take bigger risk so now you got to go back to like what's your long term goal do you want to grow this thing for your kids for charity or are you good with where you're at you just want to be safe you don't really want to be bothered with the ups and downs of the market you've\nGot a little bit of latitude there [noise] um [noise] I got a few comments camp\nYou know given the bucket strategy there's multiple bucket strategies um there's just some individual here used to practice in in San Diego\nThat had the the the up a book called that but what what is that okay\nSo but no I like to strategy a lot actually um in regards to looking at having different components if you will just say hey you know over the next ten years just be very safe because there's very rarely have you seen a ten year period where globally diversified portfolio has lost money\nDeath so make sure you get ten years of income needs and really save money that she can withdraw right regardless of what the market that\nFeeling but then I'm looking at Richard's point he's like well wait a minute and I don't need a ton of money right and if I got several million dollars does is even make sense so how do you have to look at it as a few different things that's kind of the first step it's like All right well here you need six six hundred thousand bucks that's started that really that yeah right start it's where you start in the you know like well wait a minute this is a lot of\nRisk here yeah I'm because you're telling me the rest in stocks that seems like a lot right so there's something that's called ... capacity we've talked about today a little bit in the past\nAnd it's like a lot of times it's the opposite where people have to take on a maybe a little bit more risk than what they're comfortable with\nBecause because they need to higher rate of return yes they need to generate a four five six percent ready to return versus maybe just sitting and casualty bills right and so there you have to push that individual that say hey you might need to take on a little bit more risk to all these taxes and inflation and accomplish their goals\nOn the flip side rich here he could sit in cash and accomplishes ... right right but is that the prudent thing to do so I agree with you have thousand percent Allen's like All right well here I think you'll find [noise] what what you could do riches say\nAll right let's card this stuff about so I Know that I'm going to be said for the next forty years he's only fifty six K. I. so then you know no matter what happens within the markets within the bond markets stock market you know you and your family going to be fine\nYou throw a different what if in there you know a long term care stay up um you know all sorts of crazy expenses\nAnd then after that he could say well I still have ... ... these dollars here maybe want to take on the risk for that for your kids your grandkids for charities or or or things of that nature\nSo it really depends on his goals and what he's trying to do but\nHere's what I Would say I would take the least amount of risk possible to accomplish their goals\nYeah I think that's the the the key right so make sure you get ten years of safety and then take the least amount of risk to accomplish their goals and the rest of it right\nAnd those goals could be several goals that could be All right I Want to make sure that I have a little bit for my kids I Want to make sure I have a little bit for some charities for my church and blah blah blah\nRight and those goals could be several goals that could be All right I Want to make sure that I have a little bit for my kids I Want to make sure I have a little bit for some charities for my church and blah blah blah\nYeah long term care and a lot of folks when they actually do retire they end up spending more they travel more right they have they spend more hobbies and it's like you're maybe around the house for and it's like oh gosh I wouldn't be there to be nice if I had a patio so then he got by the lumber you hire someone to do it and all of a sudden you're spending more money\nSo I Would encourage rich to spend more money but if you're fifty six and he got three million bucks\nHe's a pretty good saver right unless you inherited all would have to be a possibility where our company that has stock options are just filled it out other lucky or real estate probably save the diamonds lights a lottery moderate weather I'm speaking of lottery did we find out what the hell when the two billion dollars if there was one\nPoint six I'm billion ... billion\nYeah ... ... with a B B ... and I think was the ... like six something and I I don't I didn't see who won but somebody then you know\nSo that's our two cents rich appreciate yet I'm tuning into us in a reading them or got another email Chuck from Virginia well we have people from all over the ... that's ... hey I just discovered your Web reports\nI don't know what Web reports are Chuck I'm but I guess we have um al ...\nGreat they speak to my level of expertise we have a financial advisor we're happy with what I Will check into you regularly\nThat well thanks check with the get go without it and I was struck at the ... we we uh\nI guess and and and full transparency we do have clients were looking for clients but the truth is we do this for you guys to\nAnd it's it's like we always say that everyone needs a financial plan not everyone needs a financial advisor and if you need a financial advisor not everybody needs to use us but if you're getting good information from our content that were happy\n[noise] but I'm Ellen the most important investment we can make is probably an investment you can make them yourself effort that and you know what I Want to give everyone that opportunity right now but this investment will cost you a nickel for a very small handful of listeners on the show today what we're operating user retirement assessment\nIn this for a science review you'll discover hall lawyers savings will truly labs and retirement highly effective strategy is to transform your savings of the income or they can increase your Social Security benefits with uh that you don't even see understatement basically strategies that legally reduce your taxes plus proven the fence moves to protect your life savings\nOr from this crazy about illegal that we're experiencing on Wall street it'd be do one thing to take control your money in their retirement this is it um our retirement assessment is ideally suited for people who are recently retired are looking to return the next five ten years to get yours you have to call us though are in the next five minutes\nAt eight eight eight nine nine for six to five seven eight eight eight nine nine\nI I'm going to read this little differently I think he needs an income stream and three years of true so that's a little different answer\nI suppose but he's getting as well so the first thing is if you actually need the money if you need all the money in three years then you don't invest that you keep it in a in a like a CD [noise]\nTrue but All right so then he wants to take a ... a six percent distribution right at sixty three years old\nSo I don't know what do you think should be but\nProbably I don't know forty percent stock sixty percent bonds you sixty three ... traveling the money's going to be gone in I don't know how long does he want I well you say\n[laughter] so to\nTo catch our listeners that so what you just said he took a thousand dollars per month and need multiply by twelve months says twelve thousand dollars you divide that into two hundred thousand that's six percent distribution right if you listen to us and other advisors the standard is four percent which is by no means a guarantee of what the number should be\nIt's just a starting point and you want to do some planning to figure out what isn't appropriate distribution right for you but at age let's say he'll be sixty two are sixty three at that point probably you want to stay at four percent or lower so as a distribution rate and a and a distribution ... so now you're looking at to what maybe eight thousand\nSeven or eight thousand a year not twelve thousand per year that would be more realistic expectation as to what you could would withdraw overtime maybe over the next twenty five years that's that's kind of where that came up from and that that's a that's generally considered to be a sixty forty portfolio sixty percent stocks forty percent bonds\nI Wonder where he got ten percent from well because that's a hundred year average at the stock market\nYou are tired of this\nFrom well because that's a hundred year average at the stock market\nYeah OK you are tired of this [laughter] so anyway\nThat's that's our two cents Victor ...\nUm we got jump from San Diego ...\nShe's an elementary school teacher that will get a callous there's tension when she retires [noise]\nUm I've been told that even though I have qualified for Social Security that I Will only get a portion of it because at my pension I Will be over sixty five when I retire and a few years so should I wait until I retire or start collecting the little amount of Social Security and then um that's how the email\nCuts off yeah I always I always say this when it comes to ... and Social Security I give it right back to the well\nHere's here's the issue with casters coasters uh for those of you that are now in California it's a state teachers' retirement system I'm challenged for California\nAnd so John as a school teacher she's been a schoolteacher for I'm not sure how long um it seems to me that she has qualified for Social Security benefits at some point [noise]\nWhile they're there's two things that she has to look at something that's called Web or windfall elimination provision a so let's say she was an elementary school teacher for Thirty years\nBut she worked in the private sector for ten years so she got her forte quarters and this was a long time ago so she qualifies for some Social Security benefits\nBut for the other Thirty years she did not put any money into Social Security she put everything in the ... and now she's got a nice ... pension breath and so she's curious alright well here I Want to grab my ... I'm I'm going to receive my shelters pension Bush should I start collecting my Social Security before she retires [noise]\nUm she'll be over sixty five but that's probably not going to be her full retirement age for full retirement age is probably closer to sixty six in sixty six and two months or something like that that probably\nIs so if you claim your benefits even though it's going to be reduced price to your full retirement age then there's earning limits that you're not going to collect anything anyway so that doesn't make any sense\nIf you do wait until your full retirement age in you're still working yes you can collect your Social Security benefit\nDoes it make any sense sure I mean it's it's not going to be reduced if you wait till your full retirement age\nI'm from the already wiped out I'm Out\nI Would imagine her Social Security benefits going to be a few hundred dollars she has no information in regards to you know how many years that she has in ... I'm Social Security\nHow many years that she has um in ... we wouldn't need to know that information or or or Joan you need to know that information to determine how much of your Social Security you're actually going to receive\nA you can't go to assess said that job and you can put in a W E P windfall elimination provision and then there's the GOP government upset\nAnd so you can plug your numbers into that or we can do it just email us back to give me your numbers don't tell you exactly what what what will happen but these blanket statements is pretty hard\nBut you can do it yourself if you just go to as I say that God and you can find out exactly what your Social Security benefits going to be but I guess you're real question is if the claim it prior to full retirement age doesn't make sense and the answers now right\nSo so there you go there but it's a long winded that to say no [laughter] by the way that isn't cheap\nP. O. GPA or what did I say GOP there isn't a political party Kevin attention on there that I didn't even catch that different well you know rural which is Victor six\n[laughter] [laughter] I just you you said it's so fast that to me it felt like you said six government\nPension op so yeah well in general when you say that it is a total opposite Sumpter yeah well gee oh\nGee okay what do you give it a

that's being strategic kind of what you should be doing right now and both times yeah\nSo I'm going to go through these and let's see if we agree or disagree guys okay here's the first one take seriously the need to finance a long life you'll likely have live last longer than you expect lifespans keep increasing and will continue to increase in Nineteen fifty to\nThe average expectancy was sixty eight point six years by two thousand six it was Seventy seven point eight but here's the IRS the more important that although it's not in here is if\nYou made it to retirement age so let's just call that sixty five if you made it to sixty five in all likelihood as a male you're gonna live Twenty years as a female twenty four years right that's really what you have to fund in retirement\nThat's the medium that means half the are going to live longer than that so you probably ought to be set or plan that leads least they've Ninety maybe even Ninety five\nSure yeah I agree with that hold our I mean there's so much advanced technology gets crazy just taken the next five ten years what ... what what was already happened and what's probably going to happen right so the longevity is is here and I think people are a little bit naive with it right because they might not have saved enough\nThen they'll be like oh no I'm not going to make it that long or it you know I don't want to plant\nWell sure we don't we never know when we're going to die and I don't think we want to know [laughter]\nI surely don't I don't either but but you will you absolutely have to plan because if you think about it just picture of yourself Fifteen Years from now flat broke right right yeah so you get you made an eighty but she had no money you're you're done it's like well no I mean

sure you've heard him speak and he's very um you know he talks a short sentences and he writes in short sentences because the seventh one is Dr the safest car you can when I was young\nI hot rod it sets a word yeah hotlines and I know but I I Would say I drove a hot rise up and I ... I don't even know what that means [laughter] because we were told Cubans genes that tough kids have spent\nTheir spread of the reasons why they do get you when when we're in an odd rotted tell you that none of the strip I was late for them to the hot right now the reason why I wore those genes likes them as they were double stitched in the city when we're at your news now of course if it were you on your knees\nBecause your for your for your best diving into basis but I don't know where you can have negative for like [laughter]\nI played by counterfeit Opie [laughter] [laughter] it's so good [laughter] I Would get the fact that they get ready for that I was sick too tired or to\nTo [laughter] get ketchup bottle the outfield [laughter]\nThat's over there [laughter] [noise]\n\n[laughter] oh my goodness gracious [laughter] so if you go back to the point drive I drive a safe\nTo\nDrive you either ... [laughter] I don't know what I guess what ... what they can receive you know you're right ... yeah okay that have come to appreciate and love Bogle has there say they are safe very sick so anyway that's what it feels as to drive [laughter]\nI Know [laughter] she only person in the world that says I'm a really bad driver yeah everyone else's above average except for her she knows she's like a ...\nI've heard about I've never actually written with her you have right oh yeah so how's what's experience boom\nLike jazz Beto breaks as like whiplash city [laughter]\nWell that's good that she has the ball\nYeah she's got a big one to set is probably pretty safe about little things everywhere around the park next door [laughter] so number eight is build a cushion into your financial plan not everyone is highly disappointed about spending and planning if you suffer a big gap between plans and reality is it causes anxiety me so how do you create a Christian\nOr cash reserves I guess you know the stuff to do it I guess that means you have to say I mean we all want cushion sure since they had to do\nIt can't come up what tell us what should they be a little\nThat's tough to do I guess yeah I mean you have to say I mean we all want to cushion sure since they had to do\nIt can't come up with a telescope quite sedate me a little meat here [laughter]\nI guess what he's getting at is probably for those that are not yet retired but thinking about it tried to save more say more save more to create a little bit of extra you know if you think you need a couple of hundred thousand maybe she for three hundred thousand or whatever the number as they get a little extra I'll go with that sure that\nCap number nine no your network but don't obsess over it well your net worth is what is network\n[laughter] you know we're trying to ... [laughter]\nIt's\nA all your assets minus liabilities Alan ... that's that's like how much of the county fair yes but\nThe problem is not worth it it's it's how much income you can derive from your net worth I think is more important than what the numbers on your network right give us an example often is that let's say I had a farm back in Minnesota and it's worth fifty million dollars\nI can never sell it and it doesn't produce any income yeah so what does that get you write it gets me fifty million dollar network\nRe re and living on south Robyn [laughter]\nMeans nothing so yeah the network is a good starting point just a organizer overall financial live ... assets where your liabilities at what are your interest payments um you know how much money are you a saving where your ass it's located and so on and so forth I think it's really good to have the networks statement\nBut I agree with Ken here don't obsess over it because it it really doesn't do any good how are you going to create that network to do the things that you want it to do\nRight I agree with that number ten have a financial backup person\nOr two because they might need a backup person like when I'm too old I was like yeah what a mix of armed ... [laughter]\nMy forget to pay your bills right All right so what a backup person might forget to eat your applesauce Sharon's right\nOkay backup person I hadn't really heard of that term be that they're not talking about a second opinion I'll read the rest is very sick tend to writing as to whether you comma a loved one or a professional comma\nBe clear who should oversee your finances if your\nNumerous no choice can't\nNumerous maybe that's number one that's your number one ... I doubt\n[laughter] but I'm I'm I'm a Spanish [laughter]\n... [laughter]\nI was a senior citizen\nOr um or if you've ever needed that decision made in haste and emotion can be as expensive as any [noise]\nSo okay so let's just say it was like I'm hard of attorneys talking about yeah so so let's just say so you're married back a person is your spouse right but maybe you want another back a person after that or is it like a health care directive power of attorney for financial problems\nPosed by them I Would think so yeah so so like I my parents a return them\nFinancial but didn't trust fan health don't really know either I just saw the fighting [laughter] okay we finally getting to the end thank you remember oh this is talk ... okay you like to remember that angers lays\nLook if I get I'm getting angry I guess I did was I\nI got huge peace of mind when a psychologist so apparently because see psychologist a psychologist buddy are they trying to say it's just a friend who's really gone from self taught me to live my actions as if I live forever and my emotions as if I knew I'd be dead and thirty days\nSo here's let me explain because everything every time my anger I asked myself if I waste time over this if I knew I only have thirty days to live I never do it's calming anger slaves investors and yeah so if you're going to only live thirty days what's the point of being angry news\nDelivered by angry that only thirty ... lives probably be more and\n[laughter] so that's our\nEleven ways to protect your money and vanity\nAs you age right well I think you can fish or for the lightning a piece he wrote him do we have to say yes we are not the source or it's yeah USA Today I Know you're looking over my shoulder and you think you\nWill put a copy of that somewhere in our Sherman's and speaking of our show what we're doing today has given our twenty Eighteen tax money checklist you can go to your money ... dot com download it for free right there on our website and you can listen in subscribe to our podcast for free on demand\nAnd then right and it's like okay well what is that going to do the oil and then you have what Italy is doing their own thing with the euro zone they're like hey we like to spend money go pounds sand and then that's kind of your cousin friction Sarah it's so right it's\nThere's the market totally overreact quite a bit and then you look we got mid term elections coming up night so I mean it's weird how these politicians kind of pull stunts [laughter]\nKind of you know all of a Senate freaks people out and saying well I Want to go either right or the left because of what I'm feeling right now\nI'm I'm probably going to get a couple of emails for that comment and that's all right you know it's being silent yes there's about ... but here's what ... ... if you look at all of the different things that are going on right there's always going to be crisis is there's always going to be issues there is always going to be things that are not good and the media likes to play on that than\nI think that's always forget and you can go back six months a year five years ten years twenty or Thirty years there's always crises happening right and we forget that it's like it's just seems like it's never been like this like it's always been like this talking about I\nAm but when when when you hear all of this stuff\nBut when the market goes up it's not really that stuff that big of a deal but when you see market volatility and then people really start to focus in on it re I it's like ... the problem is is that when\nIndividuals retire and if they don't have a really good strategy for all their retirement and not necessarily\nThe the financial part part of it but you know we like to talk about the softer sign I mean they need hobbies people need hobbies because one they're retired in the living out their money what do they do they look at it more often than they probably should yeah I agree and if I continued to look at my assets and I'm looking at the news and then all these crazy AIDS is is unbelievable\nBecause you look at one stupid thing on your phone right on whatever feed that you're doing next thing and now you're bombarded by\nYou know what the hell's in inverted ... heard that and then you like type that stuff up on your phone and then you get forty five articles on how the world's going to end the recession because of it in Britain ... and there's all these\nExperts and and you think I'm not an expert they are so we've lived\nI guess right oh yeah I mean if they have an article on Facebook there must be a true [laughter] that's true [laughter] so anyway um\nBut I guess that's the takeaway is that when ... markets when they decline so self correction so we're we're we're in or near a correction right now that's defined as ten percent from the highs and that's that's normal this is usually on average as you said Joe happens one to two times per year we haven't had too many lately so this is this is kind of more the norm\nBut I think there's there's a lot of really good deals to mean earnings report are coming out um within the U.S some five hundred there's more companies that have very good they're beating expectations are killing that yeah yeah\nYeah and then you look at the like Tesla for and you do you like what the hell he learned must was\nWhat's going bananas what a couple of months ago because why you're letting other reports come out the guy killed it you'd have third\nQuarter he did kill it and then we've got almost all the time or a ... a low unemployment right finally got people working\nWho got lower corporate taxes so there's more profits for companies and yes some of that goes back to the shareholders but some of that's reinvest it and buy a new machinery hiring more people more people are working\nThere there's actually you're right there's a ton of getting these rights and and the fact that what was in I mean what to me\nIf you want it to just write an article about good news you can write it and everything it'd be a hundred percent true and you go oh my gosh this is the best time in the history of the United states to invest and then you can also ... all the ... senators and the worst time always been that way always always that's the take\nAway so you know I Want this market to continue to kind of shake things up a little bit of weight people up that gives them a little bit more in tune I don't want you to freak out and I don't want you to do something stupid but I think a lot of individuals need to re look at their overall portfolios they need to reassess their goals what are they trying to accomplish\nIn and get tight get fine tuned on on your strategy and making sure that you know how much risk that you're taking on you know what types of risks are out there\nYeah I think it's true because I think a lot of folks they\nLike their four one K. for example maybe they got some kind of allocation from somebody ten Fifteen Twenty years ago and then they haven't really looked at it sense and they don't even know if this is the right thing for them and this is sort of a wake up call you got to figure this stuff that you got to figure out what portfolio is going to make sense for you and your goals and make some adjustments them\nRight if you're going to ten Fifteen twenty year timeframe I mean he wants to go down another ten percent [laughter] right yeah ... it's it's it's normal it's it's refreshing in a sense I mean if the things just kept going up at this has been the weirdest bull market\nUm I've been in this business Twenty years so I Lived you know I've got to feel any you choose that I remember two thousand three two thousand to write the dot com bust\nAnd then it was like oh my gosh and then you see the recovery on that and then that was All right so now those stocks are good and then you get wiped out again from the great recession sure but it was like it just it was like too soon\nYou know what I mean because like I just lost half my money only like five years ago and then I lose in a lose it again because the other half is still there was so much negative negativity within the overall stock market yeah and it took people for ever to actually trust the system\nAnd so they missed out on a huge game so this whole bull market that we've experienced over the past ten years what up three hundred and some odd percent right is that it's been kind of\nLike a well is it really going to is it good is a bad and then then now it's too ... uh should we get out\nIt it's it's never been like let's grab the bull by the horns no pun intended in their own lives ride this thing yeah um so I think a correction is healthy I think um you know a a little bit of a beer market every now and again is healthy because then guess what you're expected rate of return is going to be a lot higher\nYeah because the prices are lower and that's what people don't understand that when stock prices are lower your future expected returns higher so and let's define a bear market bear market as when it's a twenty percent down from ... to ... percent bear markets twenty percent\nSome somewhat arbitrary whoever came up with that I don't know but that's that's not what we call corrections and bear market\nSure but [noise] some people got to be prepared and if you lose twenty percent of your money what is that going to do to your retirement do you have a plan to take dollars out of your overall portfolio but it's not going to affect your stock portfolio share do you have enough fixed income and place do you have enough um ... you know do you have a bailout plan yeah do you have it at the same faith assets\nThat you can pull from while you wait for the stock market to recover\nSo we encourage everyone or to at

F. M. B. [noise]\nNow here's some more conventional wisdom that you know the man on a mission to retire Romero one version at a whole bunch of actors\nThey don't want the radio show today we're talking about your personal growth\nArgue growing are you doing anything about it or you're coming home at night after living this life require desperation coming home at night and just powering yourself\nTurning your light bulb off at night watching TV becoming brain dead you realize when you get off of work with every time you get off the by the time you get home and you eat dinner there still three or four or five hours left at night you can get something done\nI Would suggest to you that what you need to do is you need to start thinking about investing in yourself\nBefore you start investing money out here we're going to talk about the best money today to don't get me wrong we're going to get to that but before you spend any time going out there in investing money I think you need to invest money in education for yourself\nWhat types of education I think you need to know soap education of motivation\nYou know where do you want to be alive water you want to be in life where are you going in life you know you hear this over and over and over again but like I said until I got up the alcohol and said okay look I'm already where I Want to be that's a very easy thing to say\nI Am a piece of garbage middle class human being I have a decent job I have a decent car I have a decent home I have a decent this kid's blah blah blah I was listening to a park you ask you the day\nOr a Youtube video of the guy a public speaker\nKids blah blah blah I was listening to apply to ask you the day a Youtube video of the guy a public speaker and uh he was talking about the fact that he believed that\nPoor people in his definition of poor with anybody that wasn't rich he said poor people are greedy and selfish individuals\nAnd his definition is explanation was pretty interesting you said you know poor people are all about me me me and ah that's about as selfish is going to be what can I earn what is my paycheck\nWhere do I live what do I drive however my kids what grades to my kids get\nHe said if you ever heard any more sickening and\nCry baby ... self centered is that\nInstead of what can I Do to improve the world\nWhat can I Do to grow my resources to where I have enough to give away and he's talking about rich people are way\nWay way\nNicer than poor people now that is so different than what you believe but I'll tell you this\nIf you go to a poor person's house and you meet their kids and their family and the wife and hug them you'll find that the husband and wife don't share their financial information sometimes even with each other\nAlmost always not with their kids their kids learn nothing about finances because the parents won't talk about him because the parents are embarrassed about what they're doing with their money\nThey are not growing a family legacy they are piling a little bit of money into an account hoping that some day we'll get them by the darkest moments of their life to survive\nThey are planning for\nMere survival they're already living a life of quiet desperation now they're planning for a life of mere survival\nWe're is the abundance in that\nPoint of view can you share that with me where is there something about\nWow my family is going to have a wonderful life because I Want them because I Want to go and have the ability to help my church I Want to have the ability to help other people like it lifestyles that thirty five thousand clients\nMany many many of which you've already retired hundreds maybe thousands of them have retired uh how many people more can I help how can I make help\nQuicker faster better those are the kinds of things with millionaires get up and think about how can we do more faster and better for those people out there\nNo worry about ... comes back to me because it's gonna come back to me\nIf I put enough out there in the universe the universe is going to bring enough back to me if you don't right now have enough going on in your life to make you where do you want to be or if you're not where you want to be you're not putting enough out their guys\nYou're not out there putting it out making it happen creating activity in your life\nYour circle of influence is up there ... all\nOf the world\nNow every time you buy something and you invest in something an asset a business you now have influence over a larger group\nOf people and you make their lives better if you've ever read house do you have a nice red house or people happy there have you influenced their\nHappiness if we have an apartment complex say hundreds of people are they happy there have you influenced their happiness are you out there producing happiness in the world so that you can't a return receive your bonded return\nOr are you sitting on the couch watching and being pissed off at Nancy Pelosi which is a complete idiot\nOr any other one of the millions hundreds of politicians you could just look at right now you can go now to listen go\nIdiot idiot idiot idiot idiot idiot I don't know how we elect people I think we go the dumber they are the better chance of them getting elected\nBut what's worse is not only do you like to eat each you sit and listen to 'em like they actually know something those guys no nothing they will not help you or your family get where you want to be\nThere are out there to stop you from getting where you want to be that's what government does the government doesn't help you it stops you it takes away from you ate steal from you it doesn't help you in any way shape or form a\nGovernment by pure nature is something that has to suck in not give out\nRight so why do you spend all your time paying attention to these idiots it doesn't make any sense right so what should you pay your attention to you should be paying your attention to those things which will help to expand the universe\nAnd return those positive will bring back to you and your family did do that you have coming to you from putting out all these positive things in the world\nBut you can't do that if you go home at night and shell out in front of the TV you can't go home at night a jazz crash yourself down with alcohol like I was doing for a couple of years\nIt doesn't work there's no way you're at the end the second you pick up the bottle and start drinking it's done for the day\nPeriod you're over I Know I did it and\nYou would ask me well Dell why don't you stop all my defense was I don't want to stop GI could admit to myself as a millionaire is actually a multi\nMillionaire I'm not going to call myself a mega multimillionaire but multimillionaire and access\nUp I was very happy with who are out of that money is coming in businesses are working everything's operating and say well why can't I shifted to just sit back and relax and the answer is I'm not really sitting back and relaxing\nYou've got to think to yourself which one of these\nAnd my mind that guy that just thinks oh my God how\nCan I save enough money to maybe put some money aside how can I get by how can I create a pile we'll call Billy's college fund will called it emergency fund and we'll call it a retirement fund\nRich people do do that rich people don't have pockets I don't have pockets of money I have cash thirty right thirty\nMillion in cash that can be spent where I Need to invest it to make the money I Need I don't have any buckets\nIt may be in probably about thirty or forty different accounts because I've got it spread out so that there's insurance FDIC insurance on but the bottom line is it's there and it's waiting for the next big deal\nI don't want it there I wanted a deal I Want to buy more income so let's take a look I can take I'm going out and buy an apartment complex right now I can take a part of that money\nAnd that money right there probably are as me somewhere around three hundred thousand dollars a year in income that'd be one percent I'm actually only two percent of most of my savings account but so let's say I made three hundred four hundred thousand a year in interest eagle boy that's incredible I could live off that the rest of all I've got\nNo no that's terrible the radio return on that investment is terrible now I go out and buy an apartment complex I met in the process of buying one right now when I buy that apartment itself costs me nine or ten million dollars\nWhich I'm not expecting you to understand who's just take zeroes off of all this discussion and it will make me between nine hundred million dollars a year now what's interesting about that is it will make it for me in tax free income\n\nIn addition to that I mean and it's about fifty thousand dollars a month in income if you look at it that way but not counting the other auxiliary or ancillary type incomes that makes up a bit about fifty grand a month which would be somewhere around see fifty times twelve a six hundred thousand dollars\nBut it's paying down the mortgage another two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year\nNow what's interesting is the depreciation on this which is the ability to earn income without paying taxes on is somewhere around a million dollars nine hundred and some thousand dollars so all that incomes going to be tax free\nRight and\nIn addition to that because of the new tax laws that Trump past I'll probably get another two hundred and fifty thousand dollars worth of deductions right out of the blocks the ride off against my other incomes and other things\nSo you think about this I'm going from let's say nine hundred thousand dollars or any one percent is nine what would that be Ninety thousand a year or two percent a hundred and eighty thousand you're going from a hundred and eighty thousand a year\nTo almost a million a year in income the hundred and eighty thousand would have been taxed\nAnd the million a year it's tax free you know what on Trump doesn't want to show his tax returns 'cause he make billions\nTax free you my friend every dime you put into that a savings account you're paying income tax on that or if you're putting it in the four one K. and you're a you're not paying taxes this year\nBut somewhere along the line when you take it out you had to pay taxes on\nWe are going to avoid taxation both when we are in it and then later when we sell the property we're going to ten thirty one that forward and get out of paying it at that point also so you see what you're looking at here is the ability to earn ten times as much income\nAnd heard it with no taxation\nSo you look at a family and you say where should your money ...\nShould your money be at some places you know when you go to your financial plan is if we can draw down four percent a year and we won't run your money out until you're eight years old nine years old me they're really only earning two percent a year and then they're drawing down on the principal and the other two percent\nBut what did you could earn ten percent now I'm not even throwing in there all the other ways ... income for example\nWhen we buy properties many times we buy them in a distressed situation and we go in and we fix them up and we have immediate income from that we call that force\nAppreciation\nSupervision as massive if it's wrapped around the rule the ten twenty five one hundred rule a ten percent increase in income because of the perimeter the property critic twenty five percent increase in value since we only\nAll the ten twenty five one hundred rule a ... percent increase in income because of the improvement of the property critic twenty five percent increase in value since we only have twenty five percent down payment or equities only twenty five percent that twenty five percent increase in value means we have a hundred percent\nGain on our investment a hundred percent\nGain on your investment can you imagine if you can increase your income or your investment network by a hundred percent a year\nOh that's unbelievable\nWe also had that thing we're thing called appreciation you know rich just keep going up values just keep going up we're getting all that while you're money sitting there and it's the inflation is depreciating euro money\nWe have the tax advantage of depreciation and the other one is when we produce these massive cash or capital gains we can refinance and pull that money out tax free\nTax free you understand that so we can pull out hundred two hundred five hundred million dollars\nAt pay no taxes on it whatsoever\nYou're not doing that\nYou are living in a life of quiet desperation mediocre life and you're living by a set of rules that are going to keep you there\nThe reason you're stuck there is because you are numbing yourself out at whatever level you're living at right now whatever it is\nThat you get up today and said I Am me I Am proud to be what I'm saying is don't be proud to be you be proud to be the man you are becoming\nI Am proud to be the man I Am becoming five happy with what I've done so far I'm

[noise]\nToday's car courageous moment is really crazy business Wildwood Amish share with you\nHow I'm most people now are doing their bank deposits on their phones have the ap from whatever financial institution you're with a credit union bank brokerage whatever and you take an electronic image of yours check your depositing and deposit it in your account\nI had no idea\nThat there were people who were depositing and one account and then going to cash that same check somewhere else\nAnd sticking losses through the banking system will now there's new guidance issued by the Federal Reserve who get stuck with the law is the second time somebody presents a check it's not who wrote the check\nIn fact the second financial institution you go to the ... the ... it's the one that you deposit check with electronically according to ...\nSo there's a new federal procedure guidelines issued\nOn who will be liable in the future based on what you're required to do to not be surprised\nIf the next few weeks you get a notification from your bank credit union brokerage whoever it is you do electronic deposit where there'll be a phrase they require\nThat you are right on the face of a check you're going to deposit\nAnd that will be something white for mobile deposit only or something of similar wording but the bank is requiring and that is what you'll have to put on both for your deposit will be accepted the idea\nHurting the bank is requiring and that is\nWhat you'll have to put on both for your deposit will be accepted the idea being that will lemonade you trying to deposit fat check a second time somewhere else who knew people would try to run a game like that anyway [noise]\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n\nYou know Dr Peter how we can San Diego was a master of general dentistry with over\nThirty years experience in a support team that's be appear to me a patient service even Peters office manager Kathie is tops that service knowledge and patient guidance and now Peters announcing he's one of a few dead just in the state offering us three D. X. ray bringing his equipment to the same high level he and his team are now\nAll right so let's go to the core or something and this is something I've heard from several doctors\nMan this is very frustrating to them with the with the ads for these pharmaceuticals on TV because they all have patients come in\nAnd they're already pre sold die I Want you to write me a script for blah blah blah because I saw that it's going to do all these miraculous things and suddenly I'm going to look like those people on the TV and addition to hearing what ails me\nAnd so their perspective I've gotten from physicians is that we're the problem\nMore than anything else and that we're allowing ourselves to be to influence by these ads running on TV\nYou know I've heard the same but it's also it's important to remember that at this point\nIn the U.S health care system it's all about turnover or Catholic Haitian in healthcare terms\nWhich means they've got to get you into the office and out of the office as fast as possible so if a patient is digging in his or her heels and said I Want drug X Y Z and I'm not gonna take no for an answer [noise] a lot of doctors will simply write the script just to get things moving along and that's\nKinda why the drug industry now puts more money into marketing does into research because they know what's so effective they don't need to get everybody\nDemanding a prescription med or a brand name at what they need to get it's just a significant number\nTo make it defensible and justifiable and keep you in the brand name fold and that's where part of the problem is and let's also underline this point Clark and that is there are only two nations in the entire world that allows so called direct to consumer advertising a prescription drugs and that costs\nAnd New Zealand and that's it\nEvery other country especially developed countries like us have looked at that practice the said now we see that as doing more harm than good because let's face it these decisions are meant to be made by trained license healthcare professionals and not\nAmateurs like you and me and everybody listening and therefore it it doesn't serve the public interest to do that in fact the American Medical Association has called for an end of his practice because they've seen is just inflating drug prices and steering people into expensive treatment regimens there would be much cheaper alternatives for\nSo is it best what you and I can do is we can't change that momentum we're not that powerful sorry\nCan't change that momentum so we've got to drill back to basics and that is at the core most of us are going to do just fine with the generic mad that already exists for a condition that ails us\nI think that's absolutely true I think also\nPeople need to be more open minded to the idea that their doctor when they come back at you with a idea that well there is a generic or there's an alternative drug you might want to explore this cheaper or covered by your insurance\nYou certainly want to listen to because this is somebody who's read all of the academic papers and on all the research that you haven't done so yeah you want to listen to that person\nWould also encourage people to write to their elected representatives because indeed if we do want to try to bring the drug industry focus once again on curing ailments as opposed to moving product getting rid of these direct to consumer ads would be a big step in the right direction because that's\nBillions of dollars that would therefore be redirected back into ...\nThe consumer ads it'd be a big step in the right direction because that's billions of dollars that would therefore be redirected back into useful endeavors such as basic research and wouldn't require me to explain to my son when he he is what all watching sports together on TV\n[laughter]\nFast thing you said was that [laughter] was gosh I Can't get pass you having to explain that to your son the best thing\nYou said is that there are now spending more money on this marketing and they're spending on are indeed to actually make drugs that will improve people's lives and that is a real miss direction a national wealth\nTo have all that money go into the ads and so don't let them change your mind don't like those ads influence what you are going to consult with your doctor about\nIn fact going to pay attention to those ads because let's face it they are not imparting sufficient amount of information for you to make an informed decision and therefore they're not worth your time\nFor David Lazarus or in the Los Angeles times thank you so much for joining us and you keep that passion and by the way how did you explain to your son what he did as his family radio\nWell I Would say the things that lasts for four hours probably aren't good under any circumstances [laughter]\n[laughter] [laughter]\nOkay\nCorey with us on the car to our show whoa Corey how you doing\nHi Clark I'm good how are you great thank you [laughter] Corey you've got something that happened\nIn your life it's not a laughing matter\nIt's a good matter I mean we we were able to acquire are but unfortunately yes those after my wife says my wife's dad passed away\nWhile I'm very sorry about her loss\nHello thank you\nHow can I be of service in this situation\nBut cause us to take a look at our auto insurance because we ah we added another car we had really looked at it in a while the kind of\nRealize we might be paying too much for auto insurance and we started looking at our policy and we're kind of trying to figure out where we can save money with where everything set out as far as our coverage so we're going to be adding a\nSix sixteen and Seventeen year old son under the policy within the next six months\nOh oh oh\nOh I just have your wallet just take that and I even stab your wallet a lot 'cause that's what happens when you get a teen driver on your insurance\nYes you know we're lucky enough so that we didn't have to buy a car\nTrue so or saving money there\nAny other cars you have old enough that you can avoid taking a coalition and comprehensive on that vehicle\nYes and that's a that you know trying to sell that to my wife but that was one of the first thought so had along with um raising our deductibles\nYeah we'll I'm a ... fan and raising deductibles okay and try to raise those two thousand that's usually if you're going to have any vehicle you have has alone that may be the max you're allowed to raise it to\nBut if that helps and you were\nA hundred miles so\nYes a raise it to the thousand because you don't want to make a five hundred a claim on something between five hundred thousand dollars anyway because the insurer will just eat you up on premiums so you want to avoid that and then\nHow old are your vehicles\n... our oldest vehicle is it safe house meant for\nYeah you only want to have liability on that one\nYeah that's okay I thought so I was thinking too or the other two are newer I we have a two thousand Fifteen in the car we just got his two thousandth fourteen [noise] so\nYou're a teenager needs to be driving the ... for if your wife will permit that\nYes I don't know how much longer we're going to have the bar but yes that's going to be the one that is going to spend the most time for sure\nSo as you in this case there may be an advantage and talking with an independent agent\nOkay that you know something people really don't do any more but there are agents that are like free agents and they quote various insurance companies\nAnd they'd been there done that for a long time most of them are older because a lot of young people I have no interest in becoming\nAn insurance agent and they're very experience and can tell you based on how rates are set in your state and situations they've done with new drivers with teenagers what's going to be the thing that will get you the best overall total premium okay great\nSometimes depending on the state and how rapes tend to be set in a state it may be a advantageous to have\nYour son is the owner of that vehicle so are there and be on a separate policy and then and other places it may be better for him to only be named in additional driver with no specific vehicle assigned to him\nPerfect that's where the independent agent becomes so valuable because they know\nHow best to quote it and they can quote from many different companies\nThere are some what are known as direct writer companies are ones that you probably see pretty heavily advertised on TV they will not commission and independent agent and so the agent will not be able to quote those but they'll have enough\nDifferent companies they can quote to you that they'll be able to guide you best\nPerfect perfect yeah we've got some numbers already from friends that have gone down that path and it seems like it'd be very helpful to have some specific are still does\nAnd you got to make sure they're not what's called a captive agent for example State Farm and all state the agents that right for them or what are known as captives they only ran for those companies and independent agent is not assigned to a specific company and they can quote many different ones\nGreat so independent agent okay\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\nThe doctors that are men's health can

[noise] so I guess my question is what do I do with this money to city\nWhere do you do have the option of just leaving it and were those big companies small or in between that you were with before\nOkay so the one with Eighteen thousand is on I'm most concerned with a smaller company and I'm worried that they go out of business what happens to that money\nFor the money would be okay and the four oh one K. but if it's a small business there's a different issue and that small businesses tend to have very high cost for one case right so I was scared that all that money out\nQuickly and move it to one of the low cost providers and have an IRA with one of them the three big low cost providers for having IRAs are vanguard Charles Schwab and fidelity investments [noise]\nOkay than we have them and let me tell you something do not call the\nAdministrator of the four oh one K. and say hey I Want to um move this money out and do an iron they'll say great what address you want to send you a check never take a check 'cause what they do\nIs they would serve track thirty six hundred dollars from the check they send you and send it to the IRS says withholding and you have to make up that thirty six hundred\nIn the next sixty days or you end up paying massive tax for not being able to make that up so what you do with whoever you would go with\nIs vale do paperwork that will move the money directly from the old employer's plan straight into wherever you're going to have the IRA\nAnd an end you recommend an IRA or the Ross are it\nI'm not here but I just I hear you talk about now I just thought\nYou said the story as you can't take money there was in a traditional four one K. and put it into a Roth without having a big tax bill\nBecause all that money that was pre tax correct so you go into a traditional i._r._a. with that money not a Roth IRA okay\nAnd you can over time migrate the money\nFrom the traditional to a Roth as she could afford to pay tax on money each year or you just know you got money that they are that's going to grow over the years that you're gonna have to pay tax on Sunday then let's talk about the other one the seven thousand is that in a big employers plan or small\nIt's a very large employer or their trail the stock exchange\nSo it was a big employer the odds favor that that will be an extremely low cost plan probably lower than you could find in an IRA okay\nSo are the only exception to that would be if they have that money administered by an insurance company for them the four one K. or buy a bank\nIt's it's it's it's just through one of the three that you mentioned\nDollar and you could just leave that seven behind him move the Eighteen\nOkay and then as far as contributing to that then you're able to contribute straight to the IRA versus trying to go through back\nIn the last year a great question so let's say let's keep this simple I in fact let me let me really think about this who is the company that administers the plans for the big publicly traded company used to work for its vanguard so if you wanted to keep it simple\nUm move both of 'em to vanguard in an an IRA and just be done with the old employers for\nOne case 'cause if it's with vanguard the costs will be low enough as an individual anyway and then you've got the simplification of just having an IRA there and then at vanguard open a raw for any future contributions the if the twenty five to grow\nAnd the vanguard IRA and then you open a new account with vanguard for Ross in any current or future contribution see may go into the raw\nOkay and then those can be so just so I'm Sorry I I'm not a hundred percent up to date on all these states that Iraq is post tax correct\nExactly yeah and you're already going to have twenty five grand that center pre tax account you want to have money in a post tax accountant or raw truly great to have a mix of both but tilted more towards the Roth\nThis'll be a way for you to do it you
