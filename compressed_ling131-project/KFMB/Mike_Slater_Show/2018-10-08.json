true we're going to if he is governor if newsrooms Governor Rendell look back and Jerry Brown like the good old days because he is more in sync with the more extreme assembly and state Senate does he not that's what I have\nA right as I as I said and I you know have a college going to be on some are on Newsmax dot com\nX. dot com the fact that he is going to make Jerry Brown looked like Ronald

oh no we don't\nGo that far but but some on that side are going to be focusing not only impeaching ... but also impeaching cabinet\nSo yeah I mean it just it just shows you how far the left is gone

really ruined his his wife and his career and his reputation which is exactly what they were out to do and they're not going to stop doing that\nAnd again if you want to impeach Kavanaugh if you want

like that of course\nA lot of places to know about that um oh I didn't want to save money\nWhat you see that as far as I Know this administration has never done that what they're looking for us to see this is all the elements this guy in Saudi Arabia was a journalist and he got muzzled by the prince just like the ... president prince um do ... bought him Trump\nOver there and and that's why that's why the\nGuy's disappears why isn't the White House committee you've got to think that back\nChannel the White House is saying you can't do that we're allies and we in yes but we have oil you know how that goes [noise] keep an eye on that as well um as the\nDay unfolds I even monitoring the John Cox and ... avenue similar to be fairly Gavin Newsom John Cox debate that they don't want you to see well Cox wants to have a debate about everyday new some wanted to do one was about six topics\nAnd we're getting a little bits and pieces here and they just wrapped up to now so ... what is what does it look right so far they got into the dead anybody get any punches are I mean it it it's\nJust a lot of the same back and forth nobody's really giving way much one way or the other I mean I I've compiled a list of things mean Gavin Newsom says everything's on the table when asked about if prop Thirteen is going to be looked at in ... broader conversation about revenues to address housing needs\nA new some anew some past tangles with other elected officials throughout his career I'm going to assert myself I'm going to be bold yet he's still concede there were lessons to be learned from his previous bats and as a young mayor he said there was a desire to do everything all at once\nWay also woke up some days without one of the constitution say let's say I'll start using that a Sherman and we'll just began the day that way now he emphasizes team building ... and that's great for everything going forward is to talk more about business to being pro business I remember it was about maybe three or four years ago he was up in some\n... some place in San Francisco and he said something that sounded like a conservative new some did and it was stones silence and there was like wait a minute how so he will have moments where you think he's a different kind of Democrat he's still been on the job is lieutenant governor for almost eight years\nTime once again for another seven sixty

or say or the messages from Facebook friends going through not\nFall for it I've been getting these for years they've cycle again lately that it's kind of like when they do not accept a friend request from you know Bob named Michael berry or whatever the usually I'm\nThe first one to point out to them hey I just got this from you or you might want to check your account because I Know that their accounts been hacked\nBut see they did is they need people saying you're getting friend request and pretty much\nEvery Facebook friend ... every Facebook entity is being hacked into cloning you\nAnd the problem is Facebook says it do we trust them Facebook says there's no bug descending duplicated friend request they just want you to ignore the phony message and resist the urge to spread more misinformation I\nGuess that if you spread it did he forwarded to somebody\nIt doesn't send a bug is that some kind of malware whatever doesn't do that they say but it does drive you nuts because I keep getting these things so I put the latest reminders about how to do verification and protect yourself you just don't don't forward stuff blindly\nThere's a lot of people do because then you start going I don't even really want to talk to this person just\nBecause you don't know if that person or not so and when you overdo the Twitter feed and mark Morris and radio and you can see that you'll see the Facebook story quick on that it'll keep you protected if necessary now we've been watching and monitoring as much as we can get out of the debate that went on our\nA debate with John Cox and Gavin Newsom the lieutenant governor John Cox uh wanting to have more debates Gavin Newsom said well we'll have one and pretty tight parameters so what are we been able to discern so far fewer nugget stand though we've\nAlso been saying that John Cox says he disagrees with the new police records transparency bill that was recently signed by Governor Brown\nOr John says going after the police and opening up private personnel records creates a fishing expedition for trial lawyers and Gavin Newsom kind of countered with that and he says he likes to build up he would like to build on governor Brown's ... criminal justice reform legacy well gee what a surprise\nUh apparently John a robotic with a what they call a standard tough on crime Republican stance or ... which is one of the clear as ... a policy contrast between the candidates and the debate thus far\nOr John John Cox says he'd be open to new ways to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people but then he kind of\nHeld back when pressed on specific\nFun and we know it Gavin Newsom wants he's he's for all these you know putting number serial numbers on the ammo and all these new restrictions are trying to make sure yeah you can ever guns we're we're in a squeeze you other ways I'm sure he's fine with this\nReal ID stuff\nOn your driver's license renewal why you have to go in and renewing person or you're not going to be federally compliant with just a I have a nice driving record years my license yet and there's was fine with all that kind of stop anti gun\nSaying here's where the juicy stuff comes in a John Cox says he wants sb fifty four for those of you play in the home game that's the sanctuary state law here in California should be overturned and said he'd put it to a vote for the of the people if necessary he says the loss sends a terrible message\nThe sanctuary state debate gives Gavin Newsom a window to link Cox Donald Trump apparently a says he fears Cox would work quote hand in glove with the Trump Administration on immigration\nI mean I think if you talk to any thinking Californian I don't care what party\nIf you say hey are you okay with how this is working so far you're not if you're if you're not trying to lead them with a polling question most people Republican Democrat independent whatever undergo\nSomething's amiss alright especially if you say here's some fun facts you know how much it's costing you to provide and all this though there next time you go to get\nSome health care issue ER whatever just look at the at the disproportionate\n... level of benefits as white ... with new some running TV ads we should have clean his will care for all of it implying that somehow what kids are dying now 'cause they can't go somewhere and get some help we have more help in California for everything\nAnd sometimes especially if you're not here legally and it's also the climate but the army so sensitive and for talks in ... he doesn't Macy's courageous enough but the Republican the reason there's Republicans losing in California for years are not winning the big state levels because\nThey're afraid well I don't want to be tainted when you just tell the truth says you see and about\nAbout the issues why he's trucks and the same breath in that interview we played from Gavin Newsom were willing to work with Trump I mean it's not true in Sacramento right now it's it's everything Trump says hello if not hello it's goodbye is is is just opposed whatever\nJust absurd and that's the only debate right\nNew some as a shrinking leading the polls and Cox have been picking up now there's still some distance between them but I think it's interesting I knew some opened up the debate is apparently did last hour the debate that nobody would listen to her see mostly because they hit it um\nHe was talking about yes we need to do something about income inequality USCC sort of acknowledging what Cox's main deal is the forgotten California\n[noise] attorneys Austin\nSo new some as running on his willingness to make bold decisions and his opposition to Trump is that all you need\nNo\nAnd below say ... it's like he's running I'm expecting ads like I Believe everyone should have no cavities and their teeth\nWell if if what you're proposing is to ruin someone's career and livelihood without due process and present presentation of evidence and witnesses come under an actual investigation with the authorities then then yeah that's pretty much what all you need to run on for governor is\nPardon my grammar well and see even I'm\nLooking at a piece about

notice [noise]\nKnowing that is\nQuite high is a genius but like a musical genius you know like Joey Chestnut it's a hot dog eating genius [laughter] I don't want to hear Joey Chestnut opinion about things that aren't hotdog were later [laughter]\nI so honest question I'm not trying to be a jerk honest question is that standard the Joey Chestnut standard by like I only want to hear what Joe he chose not to say about hotdog related things and con you about music related things is that the standard just for Kanye\nAnd Joey Chestnut or does that apply to all celebrities\nBecause I'm okay with that standard if we want to do that if we want everyone to stay in their lane\nThat's cool I'm I'll do that\nBut we can't have the hey can yeah you just talk about music Joey Chestnut you're just talking about how dogs oh in a list a mulatto you can go on meet the press on Sunday [laughter]\nAlthough some a lot I was on meet the press yesterday I wasn't a joke on the list on the line now was on meet the prices and she wasn't giving acting tips so she was out of her lanes so what are we doing here I just want to know the\nRules before we proceed that's all\nWhat a tailor posted because that was Saturday Night live guy uh yesterday I don't know about it I doubt that inside of this is no ... one day noted [noise] All right so this was after the ... standard now called the Joey Chestnut standard I says she broke the Joey Chestnut rule\nSo we're supposed to do it I'll just call part of this 'cause it's on a this is Taylor Swift mouths here\nIn the past I've been reluctant to publicly voiced by political opinion but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years I feel very differently about that now\nI Believe in the fight for algae be keep the algae BQ rights and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is wrong I Believe that these systematic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying sickening and prevalence there you go she had she went all in on the social justice warrior writer\nIt would be one thing if tell us or does it go I like Phil Bredesen for governor or senator in Tennessee\n[noise] ah no no no I was if you just cute\nSystematic racism it's sickening ... she went all that with Iran I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for all Americans no matter their skin color or gender or who they love\nRunning for Senate in the state of Tennessee as a woman named Marsha Blackburn as much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office I cannot support Marsha Blackburn member or just in the last election\nUh Madeleine Albright\nWho was secretary of state under Bill Clinton she was at a Hillary rally and she said there is a special place in hell for women who don't help each other\nWell ... years Taylor\nWas just saying to go to the woman said a lot a special place in hell there's got to be a lot of places a lot of different rough yeah last year that off this is a special place in hell for people like Brett Kavanaugh for instance I've heard of that one I think there's a special place an offer\nTo vote on the other women women of of other women that's those are on their own special place\nUh\nSo what's up with Taylor supporting a white male by the way white males certainly a member of the patriarchy a and a rich white male he's got four houses with them so rich white male patients\nWho by the way afterwards after the vote or after sitcoms which said he would vote for Brett Kavanaugh that'd be where center and I wouldn't actually be a Democrat he wanted but he said he would try to get conservative votes so we have Hillary rape and we have we have it does sort of supporting a\nPro raped candidate who has four houses so he's deep in a in a given a proper Baron or\nA dark money in the whole thing call him a ... problem sure uh or call ... ... goes I think it was all my life and then uh the thoughts of houses big on global warming right big goal I'm a contributor footprint mood not only\nAgrees with the systematic racism but benefits from it sure has a white

we could probably do a million more than three with Fred Rogers is probably a tough task for you\nBack when it was just starting\nSo what kind of skills you mentioned Flora management and says what ... what does that mean that and also others thought he\nHe worked as before a manager for a couple of of renowned producers at NBC so he was the guy down on the floor who communicated everybody who is involved in a production and communicated that back to the director who is often in a booth up above so it's sort of like the uh\nThe air traffic controller of the entire show\nAnd he learned he said later that that that's how he learned to put together\nA program himself and he later he he did everything on Mr Roger's neighborhood he was the star of the show he wrote the songs he wrote the script he was a producer and he was a director he did the puppet characters\nAnd he got all the skills to be able to do everything all at once from that experience back at the very beginning of commercial television\nYeah that's around Nineteen fifty one and two\nReally important part of the story of how many years did he do that for managing job\nHe was only there for three years of our he came out to Pittsburgh and went to work for a W ... which was the first community based public television\nStation in the country and they tell us the beginning of it really started public dollars wow\nTo tell us the beginning of the show how did it all star ... why did he started cetera\nWell he he was doing a children's program a W ... that was very entertaining and sort of slapstick\nAnd at the same time he was studying at the with a child development experts at the University of Pittsburgh and he decided he wanted to create\nThis was back to the beginning of the early childhood education not what people were just beginning to learn\nHow critical the first two years or in terms of learning and he decided he wanted to do a show that would be profoundly important in terms of the education of little children\nNot just entertain them not just babysit them they begin to teach them particularly about social and emotional learning and that and then he worked for ten more years before he got the show to the point where he could get it on National Public television and get the funding to do it\nTen years ten years during the putting the working to get a good enough yeah yeah why did he have a passion for it to begin with me why do I well that that too but why did he went to UMass and\nWell he ... he had a very difficult childhood and he had a a real struggle and childhood

wanted to live and then when\nYou read ... book is called\nGood neighbor the life and work a friend Rogers masking nice enough to stick around for max why is that so good but we just supposed to do right there what what is it about that that makes it so good what\nIs it about what I saw that we just my were you able to hear it\nOh wow Oh yes I get here and\nWhy why it's so good like why does it just touch our heart perfectly properly why does do good\nWell I think it's good news they just start with he was a good composer understood\nHow to make music that was appealing a that was that was too is simple and that would sort of\nGrab you and then I think the other part of it is his his way of emphasizing\nA goodness caring consideration kindness\nWas gonna do it through this framework of neighborly yes of being a good neighbor of of being a caring about the people who lived around you who work around you and I hate that such an appealing notion because\nSometimes when you hear people talking or preaching about goodness and kindness it seems like an abstract conception who is ... Rogers it was very real and it was very immediate\n... or give us a third characteristic the first was respect that perseverance what's the third of Fred Rogers\nSo I think that that third characteristic was his human kindness or he was a guy who was a\nVery focused on human kindness all his life is is a guy woke up every morning at five AM to read the Bible and pray but what he prayed for\nWas not successful that his program would be better he prayed that all day long all the people he would say it'd be really thoughtful and kind to them and so it's you know ... he's pecan sort of\nAn example are today we we live in an age that feels sometimes pretty harsh and he's become the exempt far I think for a lot of lot of people of human kindness and and there's so many examples of that I I think of\nOf one particular one where when he and his wife Joanne and a friend went out to dinner on a Saturday Night at a at a restaurant and then in the air air and they ordered their dinner and they were talking and justice the food was served on the table\nA little face appeared at the edge of the table on this little boy I looked up and said Mr Rogers my dog died\nAnd media like Fred Rogers was down on the floor on this little boy\nListening to and telling them about when he Fred Rogers was a little boy his dog ... the guy that what it was like for him and he missed his meal entirely Chester spend time down at the little boys level ban kind\nPerfect love that I'm One of the chapters here is Mr Rogers family values are you reading about his family values are just the ones that he uh he talked about\nWhat I tried to do is bring them together in the book so it's about the kind of values that he championed but then I also use it to write about his own family a friend and Joanne Rogers had two boys born in fifty nine in Nineteen sixty one and um\nAnd ... worked really hard to be a good father because those little boy as soon to be a good husband a Joanne I think when they were very little uh it worked out very well for Fred even when he was filming all afternoon and and Vince filming into the evening to\nMake a a an episode of the neighborhood he would always come home to be with his little boys at dinner time\nSpent some time with him when they became teenagers who is a lot harder for ... and uh that they were rough tough teenagers who had sort of all the wild challenges that a lot of teenage boys can have and that was more of a struggle for Fred Rogers\nForward to reading more about that and it's interesting um do you have any insight into the maybe the most famous now Fred Rogers quote in a time of of difficulty and disaster to always look for the helpers 'cause that's what his mom told him always look for the helpers I'm giving the inside of that quote\nWell as I said a moment ago he was a little boy he was shy intended and he would hear about something bad that happened to people and he would come to his mother to tell her upset that something bad happened and his mother's advice for him was\nWell don't just focus on that dad thing start thinking about\nHow everybody in town and looked troubled Pennsylvania where he grew up\nAll the helpers all the people that came together to help the family or to whom some you know to do something bad\nWell the helpers all the people that came together to help the family or to whom some you know to something bad happen to one member of the family so she went to encourage him to look for the helpers as a way of seeing the full picture and seeing that there's\nA bright side or or a helpful and constructive size\nThat that that interaction with his mom might have changed the course of his life I'm ... I think it\nDid I think his mother was just extraordinarily wonderful to him and in a in a large way the way he lived his life the way he did his work which was kind of his way of sort of paying back or that wonderful kinder said he got from is\nNot a ... okay I look forward to reading the the good neighbor the life and work of Fred Rogers it's by a max king back thanks for spending time with ...\nA month ago you said you were going to read the book that I was told you about life never given you one recommendation one of the bad books I've talked to really like it and like\nOh okay oh I Know I'll be out of the book on tape okay maybe a different experience okay I get it out on a book on tape go because I was driving up to Palm Springs so it was like a five hour book on tape was perfect up and down to South Africa\nI think he wrote are we talking about the blacks yeah all blacks that's yes\nThat that's not that bad [laughter] I Love to read and my girl I got was about the rugby team of the all black and gold and all these [laughter] 'cause they're Jersey wow a little bit [laughter]\nThem to Charlotte a book clubs oh go on the road [laughter] the blacks have you know the all black I read the reviews all the all black that they're ... they're called I Swear they're called the all black\nI think it's very book yeah they can be a good time for you to go ahead or just a tour so from a British miles here as well so what do you wonder I just got to have that right along the way it did\nMake that he was like whoa this is [laughter] I Do I distance myself from it was a sharp Iraq [noise]\nI like the book I felt like he wrote a book and then added in the ... the all black stuff afterwards like an afterthought\nTo try to make I took coca you're not going to vote I listen to to spend a little while the two main points you made about sweeping the shed yeah of course being humble like those those are ... awesome awesome awesome awesome I was a but he does Ali the book I didn't quite get for but who am I being negative I wasn't gonna bring it up yeah how long have you been a general you know what other book is terrible [laughter]\nUh some three in a row over over three right now I shouldn't be so harsh amass recommendation I'm proud of him for making record I can read now it's a big deal\nThat Mr Rogers ... miles of watching as this Roger episodes for last couple of years to finally got to just be a this is Antonio march ...
