Muslim\nIs meeting with the president of the White House and usually we're saying during the break that he's kind of\nAll over the road how does that match with Trump who gets all over the road\nTo at times it's a perfect fit oh so do the visit like come together and then suddenly makes sense to all they're\nJust so out of what are you monitor so far where is this some of it too colorful area\n\nYeah it is to to colorful at at the moment I'm just making sure yeah ah so this is uh\nThey're having lunch they're meeting there was a whole gaggle of ... of reporters there\nFor people who thought the Kanye West was just kind of in a Trump fan mode a few months ago I found that will pass\nAnd he did he was over on Saturday Night live hosting a week or two ago right and then he he he brought it up again and he made a statement to the audience afterwards there was not real popular with pretty much anyone else on the cast\nSo he's going to the\nDoubling down trickling down to is there any take away so far that we can tell here ban is there any are they talking about socio economic things were I mean he he is making a push for\nMore ah a reform in the prison systems but also more on the fact of a mental health uh talking about his bipolar\nDisorder diagnosis or a few years ago and now he has a like a sleeping disorders that could lead to dementia and wanting more money to be put into this research study for that but ... a a big thing he ... he touched on was\nDuring the campaign season in the in the twenty sixteen election he felt he ... he says he loves everybody but the reason you know he felt like Superman when he puts on the make make America great again hat [laughter] I mean because it says it's his favorite comic book character but it really made him feel like he had an extra super super power when he put on the hat or thought you meant\nPrevent it I thought you meant the Donald Trump was his favorite comic book characters where he's Superman is how dare you argue with 'em aggressive now\nNo no no no I'm just I'm just a voice of objectivity here at times [noise] [noise] well I think I most times I'll ask the question is nobody wants to ask [laughter] um but it's interesting how long have they been meeting this has been going\nOn in about Fifteen minutes right now I think\nI always wonder who else is waiting is Dennis Rodman next on the schedule the White House scheduled who's next\nNo but he has put his name and to be the new a UN ambassador\nDennis Rodman ... no he if anything North Korea and he's got to be the cause he understands he'd be bombs with the guy was for a million little rocket man who's now pen pal with the president I don't know\nIf ... if you'd asked five years ago well there'll be a day that we're talking about a summit meeting between president\nDonald Trump and Kanye West I Would still be in the home with a straight jackets if I if I had brought up like it's going to happen that anybody predict that\nNo\nI rest my case thrown out of your ... and\nApparently CNN is not even doing subtitles on this or is anybody tweeting illegally in there 'cause they're supposed to check on their cell phones\nRight when keep an eye on all this coming up seven sixty talking breaking news um\nDreams person's gonna during this still have some insights because he uh he's a kind of efficient monitors will will will will talk to him coming up and we may hear from Kaplan Jim Lovell today\nA of pilots were teen famous Apollo away then a couple of the important Gemini mission says well ah because of the groups from the Russians ... points out\nOne American one Russian they're fine but there was a Soyuz rocket that had a major ... it's going to end poorly and they had to they had to use the escape pond if you will to get back I heard one national\nReport where they said they had to turn the rocket around no that's then that's a missile they didn't turn the [laughter] but this points out why level and Neil Armstrong and Cernan were right a few years ago when they said keep\nShuttle white the endeavor up in LA keep that one\nWhich you it's great to bring some attention to that\nBecause it is in fact a crisis um but but in any case the lead up to it had this panel and CNN and you may have covered this\nA spouting in just incredibly racist things about Kanye West and this was on the heels of the mainstream press declaring Taylor Swift their role model a national hero\nAnd just crazy in her up and down because she had done I it really was not thought through endorsement in her home state of Tennessee where she endorsed a Senate candidate who cross fast to be in support of the confirmation of Kavanaugh\nAnd she you know in the same contact center Instagram post she touted a bunch of kind of social justice warrior issues and need to issues so it it's a completely incoherent endorsement\nBy the press\nTreats them in and completely diametrically opposed ways so Kanye West is getting ... to buy the press and Taylor Swift\nIs being praised him Taylor Swift is the one who didn't interviewing twenty twelve with time and said I don't talk about politics\nI don't think you're right that is my business but I mean it's okay for the way I don't mind\nTalking about it but I also find it interesting that she was a distorting the record in my friend Marsha Blackburn um she said to vote for the guy not black woman huh that's interesting but the market is doing a great job back there in a in the Senate and Tennessee um\nYeah and she's holding in the polls\nThat ... the spread I think\nIt went up she did better once uh the Taylor Swift made the comment she actually wanted to say\nIt you know a lot of people in the industry praised Taylor Swift when she said she wouldn't talk politics\nBecause she is one of the biggest pop stars in the world is not the biggest she has a hundred and twelve million followers on Instagram for example more than the president does well and and they crazed her because she's a branch she's a product and what she managed to do by\nGetting up and talking about Democrat issues and then endorsing Democrats is lose fans now admittedly solver fans or you know twelve years old ... years old\nBut many of those kids have parents who are Trump supporters for now get a ... you know not allow the purchase of Taylor Swift downloads so I mean she has a long way to go in or trajectory to go down but she will go down\nThe American Music Awards had record low ratings and she was the star of the show\nWhere they needed a mainstream or like where like\nMiley Cyrus instead that whatever the mainstream [laughter] yeah now maybe like\nLady Gaga she's gone mainstream\nYou know what you're saying and I would tell me about the fact\nIs whenever anybody that that that is why Samuel Goldwyn purged filmmakers not to insert a message in their films you said you know if you like messaging\nSaid you know if you like messages used a telegram at time and uh so it it it ... you know it's a mistake from a business point of view for terrorists were to take that position but she's been attacked\nFor many years for staying silent ... to the point where\nUm ... the number like the guardian newspaper said her silence meant she was a Dell Trump supporter\nOh he was criticized by bloggers for appealing to the all right and appealing to whites premises they set her record 'em look what she made me do was a dog whistle\nTo white supremacist I you know I guess 'cause she wore black leather or something but\nBut they but her ... years and this is the way it is in some celebrity world are virtually all left of center there were all urging hurt cake the courageous stand of joining up\nBecoming a lemming [laughter] she did\n[laughter] well I never a dull moment a speaking never do and what do we make of the coverage or lack there are um depends on which channel you're watching on the cable channels so forth Hillary Clinton saying yet what incivility is fine\nAs necessary is that like they bring a knife we bring a gun or the ... years ago I mean it's amazing to see who is not covered this this week but\nSounds like she's she's doing your own Maxine Waters kind of thing like yeah get out there and there are all disturbances it\nIt's it yeah it really is a pattern\nYou know we have Eric Holder saying when they go low kicked come where Hillary Clinton\nPraising and civility Maxine Waters kind of started the whole thing and this is at a time where Republicans have received a rice and in the mail or that a mass shooter who was screaming this is for health care tried to kill a bunch of Republicans\nA Congress members um for Hillary Clinton to do that\nIs almost declare criminal act I mean it is so orderly irresponsible that you know she ... and and the press that you're right the press needs to can download her they need to condemn Eric Holder they need to condemn\nHolder doubled down on a two and he said he was joking or ... or ... he was joking I guess\nSo well he got laughs I guess from the audience but\nIt's just part of a pattern and if and what it what is a Kurd um\nIt is real a\nDanger to to real human beings and you know that the media is in this um frenzy of saying that a group of people who destroy property and who attacked people\nAnd who trespass and who scream and are shrill somehow that group is not a mob it's not um out well it is and so what we have is mob politics going on and the and the people that should know better\nEncouraging it like it you know so Senator Rand Paul had to come out and more\nPeople don't stop it someone's going to get hurt or even get killed and\nWas ... what's weird about this James Harrison is that Hillary Clinton can say that and and right now it appears get away with it in many circles in the same places and same circles where\nWhen Trump would say in a rally when some security threat of came up and you got some instigator back in the campaign and twenty sixteen he said get them out and get it on is that so threatening how dare he do that there is no difference in fact you can make the case it was worse\nWhat Hillary said she just delivered than the way that just sounds so concerned to me as well that's what\nThey do they yeah they always point the finger at the other side but we have a series of criminal acts that have been taking place from the liberal side from the so called progressive side um we just had a story that I'm a a liberal guy was\nPlotting to blow himself up you know two hundred pounds of national was all on election day mhm I'm now you blow yourself up and the national mall that is\nSomething that he taken from the ISIS play book yeah\nAnd he wanted to draw attention to the politics of the left and obviously we blow yourself up on the national mall people are gonna be hurt or killed yeah and this this is kind of so I\nI think it's just the Democrats have been unglued since twenty six Dane and instead of having some sort of healing some sort of catharsis there are getting worse instead\nOf on him and and the right Hedges are falling off\nRight and that's where they blame if they say well Trump is created this atmosphere uh I Would say is that I mean that's an easy way to explain it I think what it really is here is after a long line of\nA more genteel more diplomatic I yes I Would prefer it that way Republican presidents in the last couple three decades or whatever\nUm and this isn't the way you fight fire with fire was always done with well we'll turn the other cheek or whatever the difference now Trump doesn't give them any room if it does I remember Bush forty three as much as I like most of his policies and it was forty three there are a lot of times you could say something fight back\nAnd he was just don't envy the ex president now Trump as president and you can bet me the same way with an ex president as long as he has Twitter\nUm yeah he doesn't give them room to just get the narrative he fires back and that's why they're freaking out because he doesn't get him\nYou know but there there are freaking out on a number of fronts were very specifically freaking out over the Kavanaugh situation because in the past\nWhat they had done in terms of bringing up these scandalous accusations would have resulted in two things two possibilities one is that the nominee would have pulled out well because what he did and and the other one is that the president would have faded and the board of\nBasically I'm pulled the nominee which has happened so many times in the past they were counting on that well the Trump does he do that it drives them crazy and the other thing that drives me crazy about Kanye West is\nIt's Adam from palm our solar we'd like to thank everyone again
