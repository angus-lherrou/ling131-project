problem\nWell an ocean side because there was a meeting with a lot of angry people there is a new\nBoard game you know like like monopoly it'd be a board game right and I'm\nTerribly this was created\nAnd I said I still think there's First Amendment rights rights created by\nKids students at Cesar Chavez middle school the\nProblem was the theme of the board game and there was a job he offered a story\nLike right now\nA confrontation between the ocean side union school district to rent or communications and concern parents out of a board meeting after public comment on a board game lesson plan and watch some students created a so called deportation game last month that says that Chavez middle school and she is\nInvited you to the table right she wants to be there with you can do this with the\nMoments before that was a passionate cry for accountability after a group of students for totally created a game and allow players to compete across the U.S poor and reach the was flat bought ... point player\nCan handle that [laughter] [laughter] [laughter]\nOh you ... immigrants in the human rights council ocean side and the next day miracles to are demanding five actions basic like cultural sensitivity training annual public forums I teach it can be an ethnic studies and I know your rights for\nMy biggest concern when or\nLearning at home and then bringing\nTo school during her reports the newly appointed superintendent Dr Julie retaliate read from her statement\nWe will add to distract the plan of action to provide training district why the White House staff there and he didn't mean truly diverse community\nThat district and not had information on it or how it's addressed the teacher and student when\nIt comes to the ... a lot of games well but it's also when the news so\nI just I just remember back in the day before electricity was embedded when I was in a you know what was in junior high school ah we created a lot of things a lot of stuff but now I Know would send me right to censor Tiffany training\nCamp but everybody was doing it was part of the creative process\nCharlie then I I understand you ought to be sensitive but when you look at the alumni either\nAt I'm In oceanside bright\nAnd students told the union Tribune as your ordinary approach a story there is that the class teacher had approved the group's board game theme of border crossing\nIt does help a debate right so there are people now that said you can't even discuss you can't even address in any way an issue that's in the news it better just stopped to talk about it or does that lead seems to me than we educate a lot of\nPeople when they snowflake department to go to college and you know I don't know if I could stand this worse may say for him I Need a lot of much cut all\n\nSensitivity sure but I haven't seen the actual game maybe part of it is but you know if you get the teacher just said that sounds good than they do it now of course it's the thing\nSo the alumni they're immigrants and human rights council of oceanside and other organizations are demanding five actions district wide cultural sensitivity training so because one group of students created a board game that as a deportation thing the whole district needs to go through sensitivity training\nThen annual public forums a teacher committee on ethnic studies a no your rights for 'em an agenda material in Spanish\n\nOne of the mothers they're in a part of these groups are the biggest concern where the kids get this from they look this is a learned behavior server learning at home bringing it to school you\nKnow maybe they're just paying attention to the news maybe there are Trump fans regular not Trump fans\n\nThat will get to the hurricane stuff later on just just\nAnytime the governmental enter you start talking about sensitivity training and I get it in the ... world and everything else but the ... you realize there are people who say well you shouldn't say it that way I always go back to John Rocker\nWho was a pitcher for the Mets back in the day the first time and there's like ... and he said some dumb stuff was it there's a Braves then at the time but eventually

view who should understand my point of view as\nA lot of times right hey wait a I I I don't want to censor them I respect their view\nBut now we're in this ... you can have a discussion about that don't cause but deportation you can stats insensitive you need to go half camp [noise] [noise] [noise] cycles creativity there are two dozen [noise] well in that school\nSam Sam ... talk and breaking

Florence or what have you with Peter's and is there like a category\nOne um it\nIt it they're they're all trying to make sure all the disclaimer is are out there so nobody gets sued nobody gets politically burned we've as part of this do that\nWell I think that for for for the younger voters we would try to remind them that when Hurricane Katrina in two thousand and five [laughter] the mayor of New Orleans was a Democrat rainy again who's now in jail yeah\nThe governor of Louisiana was a Democrat and a woman named Kathleen Blanco [laughter] and when New Orleans was this uh this pit of despair after Katrina was all Bush's fault than the other two were like nobody's heard of them\nAnd a lot of the reporters were down there they shepherd Smith is one of them are from Fox News just to be fair and uh Brian Williams event on NBC\nAnd ... and they were they were seeing I don't know they were hallucinating they saw bodies floating in places where there are no buddies yeah that was battery\nCame part of the Brian Williams a festival of\nLa ... superdome the or as the waters rose over carcasses everywhere and cannibalism Muslim is that that\nKind of like white and black [laughter] well I got\nThe NBC at one point I Believe the death count is it it is bad I mean the Katrina I Believe it was ... was it over a thousand yeah it was nasty but\nWith thing ten thousand and they weren't using numbers from who may or may guns off and and that's where again part of what you want to say is let's be careful and try to\nIt goes off and and that's where again part of what you want to say is let's be careful and try to report these things and and but just because they pack and emotional wall up that's where all the politicize or get in\nAnd say well we can make this a big point that ah that yes Bush somehow his his her response to the hurricanes was racist\nRight and it became the narrative is what's even taught I think you make the case if you go into the high schools or whatever you'll find that depending on who's teaching a class\nNot the full story about Nagin or governor black or what have you or or the fact that they were resisting Washington help now was Washington perfect through FEMA no but it wasn't all Bush's fault and in fact I still remember was it the Senator Mary Landrieu was Chris Wallace of Fox\nLike the next day or weekend or whatever and he's saying couldn't you have called for\nFor for me look at they were all these school buses that could have evacuated people into treatment and there were sitting there you know just inundated by water because the whole didn't go out from the local leaders to Washington say hey get this and gear and her response was well\nChris all those buses underwater and it's like well there are now by you could've gotten them out and use them earlier but that that was a local issue the Bush got burned about\nWell and remember again we're ... the young people yeah Spike Lee went on HBO and said the federal government blew up the levees I mean it was it there's a lot of craziness I'm surrounded that I think it was really again one of the worst media performances of the Bush presidency\nBut now it's become a operating\nReality is it's it's taught as a new study out of your place or media Research Center this week average noise writes about\nOver there on news busters dot org but uh the whole story about the economy I guess the other thing I mentioned do here we have the hurricane and you have a rough day on Wall street so far and again you know there are people politically saying this will get Trump ... see the market's gonna fall now and we'll be down to twenty thousand right ... um\nThe ... the economic boom that has been happening has been pretty much ignored a because the Trump coverage has been what Ninety two percent negative ... what did you find in this study they're to me yeah\nI mean this is a the the latest for a month study that we've done and and and we should explain that we do this basically every night they study the the three evening newscasts see how much Trump coverage they have [noise] and then grade that coverage to say how many positive segments negative statements\nAnd neutral but the neutral you leave out when you do this\nUh but we have a it was Ninety two percent negative over the last four months that we we we routinely find eighty nine Ninety Ninety One Ninety two percent negative and and that still the case and so out of one thousand nine hundred and sixty minutes of Trump coverage on ABC CBS and NBC at night\nUh fourteen minutes on the economy\nAnd Trump or and so it's\nZero point seven percent of Trump's coverage is the economy a little bit of trade a little bit of ... I mean it's really amazing when you look at this that you know we get record unemployment and it's not a story they literally have nights where they're like\nThere's a new unemployment number or you wouldn't want from watching TV\nHuh Mm Mm Tim ...

all due respect to many not all fellow conservative commentators let me say this stop it\nIt's not it see that movie they tell me what you think this goes back to perception I made up my mind if I can see why not I can't see they don't they don't have any flags in the movie or\nThe flap over the new first manned film went viral before anyone knew all the facts most critics see nothing but a promotional trailers someone noted there's NO PLAN to go to the American flag in this big new universal film starring Ryan Gosling as Neil Armstrong\nThe first human being set forth to the moon\nThat was all it took because suddenly all of the buzz and no offense to Buzz Aldrin who is the second human being on that same mission step up right after Neil Armstrong\nIt was all about Hollywood values stamping out patriotism and intentionally editing out anything pro USA stance for Hollywood dies while he just had a lot of times but not in this case\nEven one of the Trump sons tweeted about it and the president mentioned it at a rally but here's the problem is not the full story so I talked\nAbout this and they review that I wrote about giving read it getting a private screening recently thanks to the Armstrong family in universal and as chairman of the air and Space Museum here I've been blessed to know a lot of the people who made history in America\nThat's why I Love getting into debates people say you don't know where you're talking about like I Know some of the people I knew Neil Armstrong hello\nIntroduced by my buddy gene Cernan who was a Gemini dying and Apollo ten and was the last man on the moon Apollo Seventeen yeah I Know Neal sons were dear friends knew his late wife Janet who's portrayed again very well by ms for a in the movie\nThe story is based in part on James Hansen's excellent and authorized\nNeil Armstrong biography first man it is gripping from the start I'm telling you if you if you don't go see this you think you know about the flight thing you're missing some really cool stuff Armstrong's career as a test pilot notably the\nEx Fifteen is worth a whole separate feature film found myself nearly breathless and that doesn't happen often to the movies for me\nThere'll be breathless and the first few minutes gripping the armrest the ex Fifteen the test pilots story is part of Neil Armstrong's life that has not been detailed on the screen until now then there's the untold story of Gemini aid with fellow astronaut David Scott who was also a moon Walker and Apollo Fifteen it\nIs grab your seat action was beautiful photography and editing and had that mission Gemini eight failed the U.S might not have made it to the moon best against something people are getting talked kids don't learn this\nIs a little bit like ... at least we made it there I guess the Apollo eleven launching landing a shot in a way in this movie first man like has never been done\nSee it and I'm actually if you can by the way transports the viewer to what Buzz Aldrin called a place of magnificent desolation we've all seen the planting of the flags seen over the years but we haven't gone inside Neil Armstrong's head\nWith the personal background\nWe experience through this effort story in his new film and that is the point this is a film about Neil Armstrong the man his demeanor\nIs professionalism is dedication is cool illness and he was didn't say much a lot of times it's a very human story about\nThe toll such lofty endeavors take on family and his own psyche and they did and they do to even\nTo this day still deal with some of this and the kids are grown adults they're going to see this film in IMAX if you can you'll feel like you're on the moon with Neil and buzz hoping all worked so well\nThat Mike Collins and the Columbia command module could take everybody home when the adventure is adventurous complete here some of the random thoughts I wrote him I noticed right after seeing the movie a couple of weeks ago\nRiveting new images of a story we thought we all knew casting is phenomenal historical accuracy is everywhere the ending is somewhat disturbing\nBut revealing powerful\nBut then if we're expecting a couple of nonstop hours of action is not the case you see these trailers for the movie that just ...\nBack there are stretches and the film better slow sometimes frustrating but thought provoking but sometimes like man [laughter] he's not saying much you may ask why is Neil Armstrong protected by Ryan Gosling such a man of few words poker face quiet\nI'll tell you this because I knew the guy that was Neal\nGosling and no it's not a musical 'cause you in the la la land is not an issue\nThere are some great music in it but it's a near perfect portrayal of Neil Armstrong the man who Changed History it's a compelling human\nDrama with\nA very obvious reminder that he was the best choice to make that one small step for man one giant leap for mankind and fought the flags no you won't see the typical here's they owned by is planning all glory on the lunar surface you\nDon't see those those images or that particular image but you will see a view of the lunar module\nAnd the flag planted next to it and the American flag is in many places on the rockets on the space suits and in fact if you miss it to the movie it's like I shouldn't be counting the flags I lost I couldn't count\n\nThere's plenty of leg there's plenty of us except for the was and is also in a scene where young Rick Armstrong\nBack in the day posted a flag in honor of his dad there's no subtlety the it's just like we know which nation did this and there are references to beating the Soviets\nWe and you'll see this movie throughout we were in a very clear space race with the Russians and we won period one of my favorite moments near the end is where a French woman says something like I knew America could do it\nAnd we did\nBacked by more than four hundred thousand men and women who fueled the whole space program a project Apollo and many of them right here in Southern California and by the way that something Neil Armstrong pointed out every time I was with and it wasn't about him\nIt was about us\nIt's a must see film as one of a handful I seen during my lifetime I Want to experience again and again and that that's one of those things that you know about you but you know it's a though even if there are parts that are disturbing and you think about it later that night in the wake up the next day I Am going to see that again and wonder what\nThat meant that some pretty excellent filmmaking and it is it is riveting they shot the on the moon Apollo eleven sequences an IMAX and ... is ... ... it's got to be in fact I've heard this from other astronauts were technical advisor

say\nA hundred women and twenty men are applying for a board five more positions are and they for and they could if this law force of the company to take the twelve best man let me let me just more course let's say a there's a board with five women on it only ... five women\nWhat if a law said oh you have to hire a man and the the board members say well with the man is the\nYou know\nTwenty at the best applicants here how do you have to hire the man does or doesn't do that adjusts says it mandates women to be on the board at the same thing about a mandating that a man is on a board as well and then John called in with a ridiculous question but not that ridiculous anymore\nThe question is what if there was a man who identifies as a woman right\nDoesn't that sound like a like a little bit ago I Would have been like John come on but now it's like well I don't know I don't know what to do that I don't know what ...\n\nWho's to say who's to say that wouldn't hold up in court at one point of this is the most obvious example of a law\nThat is passed\nWith the intent of helping women but actually hurt swimming is mandated maternity leave is the law that's supposed to help 'em that actually hurts them a you'll hear feminist say that we're the only country in the world it's it's awesome like Gambia or something who doesn't have a federal government mandated\nMaternity leave and when people can't put together is that we're the most\nEconomically ... there's more economic opportunities for women in America than anywhere else in the world and one reason why is because we don't have paid maternity leave\nSays how it hurts women if you're hiring someone and your top two candidates are twenty two year old man and a twenty two year old woman the woman is that a massive disadvantage because the employer knows that they may have to pay this woman for whatever maternity leave is nine months or whatever the law would say right six nine months without to\nDo any work so the company that owns the man without paid maternity leave they might hire the woman the woman I mean knowing that\nShe may not be working for a certain period of time but at least we won't have to pay or when she's not working or let the company would do whatever they want which is why most companies have paid maternity leave is is that the companies do it\nOr the woman negotiate whenever they come to terms with the mandate in maternity leave hurts women's economic opportunities\nAs good as it feels hurts women in the end\nAll of these all these government\nEconomic policies hurt people's because the left doesn't understand that this trade offs and you can't just stop things into thin air so how that works um because a couple of days ago or you know we've got to go on Alaska we've tried but Amazon increased their uh hourly wage minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour for their employees\nTo Bernie Sanders made a big deal about Amazon you need to pay their employees Fifteen dollars an hour\nSo Amazon finally caves and they said starting next month I think they're gonna start paying everyone at least Fifteen dollars an hour by the way a Bernie Sanders wrote a a piece of legislation that goes in the pantheon of obnoxious legislation names do you guys know this law I'm Talking about no so this law is called\nThe stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidies act I can get behind that okay that's easy to say no that's what's the acronym\nI'd I don't even know I write it down in America has got I got to do this what's the acronym or so we got the I don't actually write things [laughter] do you mean you don't right [noise]\nWell I mean every show and you know you got it yeah yeah the ... you know they keep us send to the real filed with the like the ... the great minds we yeah mhm all of them we can let's let's just keep moving on here okay it's the stop\nBad employers by zeroing out subsidies act\nAnd this would be against the Amazon\nWhy why did they call that why was it called the stop a bad employers by zeroing out subsidies act\nI didn't get it and say hold on let me see you got it right\nI don't even know you see it up there it's going to say\nI Want to say so in a prayer okay take off the day after\nTake off of the ... and then again and again\nAlso have to look not argue right non is pretty valuable to hate\nMail that we got the other day a fortress of raised pretty funny ah okay you got an aunt given minds about Amazon\nOh yeah is it\nA base owes I Know there's an s in front but\nYeah I take out the yes but what's the word I stand for\nSubsidies stop so oh stop okay just stop basis is essentially what it is called the stop base\n[laughter]\nBertie say that's a lot of trouble to go [laughter] you know what I'm saying is called the stop base owes act\nDoesn't exactly roll off to tell them to stop\nBad employers by zeroing out subsidies act what if what if a bass says his last name was ...\n\n[laughter] ... [laughter] a long long winded died all there but that's also kind of obnoxious\nI mean that's a doctor's like that effort that he went through I just had a lot of trouble but\nWhat I like what if it made federal government was ... I was thinking about a law called the stop\nMile table and I thought\nWell what I Do like a million people here are like what are we don't stop\nTo stop me act\nThe idea though of stopping subsidies seems good no stop base does\nStuff Jeff Bass so\nYeah there are no subsidies anyway but that's not something that wasn't my point I got to take a break I'll come back we'll talk about this Amazon minimum wage went after seven sixty gay if I'm In awe of seeing what we have a new Social Security seven are coming up in two weeks so It's Tuesday the twenty third or Wednesday the twenty fourth I'll be on the twenty fourth or do you know what you're going to do with your Social Security\nWas listening to Dr Laura or the other day [noise] course [laughter]\nDr Laura started ... out there got thrown out there my on fire progressive mom loves used to live here I was a doctor ward forever even though she was on the radio Sirius satellite radio or something we were driving what satellite there thank you very much\nUh how's it going down to southern Godzilla listen to Dr Laura for like ten minutes and someone called and you guys are the show yeah my mom used to listen\nReally well I like I forgot how much I loved it yeah\nI like a lot it's it's kind of judge Judy ... not not like I say I have a kind of that same relationship so yes you're right you're totally right very ... like a so called as you as a doctor or\nMy life is so terrible everything falling apart and so it's like a love tip line life thing like a lot of relationships as our relationship things\nOne of those women will call and other call before was oh Dr Laura my husband I live in the Florida My husband lives in Chicago\nAnd we haven't seen each other and two years do you think\nHe's cheating off [laughter]\nShe's like what are you out of your mind [laughter]\nIs this cheating on you who's been cheating on you for you [laughter] see now that I could get it oh yeah it's really good it's you know this is just\nSo this woman's all my life is about what what kind of a doctor last point that\nYou know we're also taking a calls for marital biography\nAbsolutely anybody I had five year Eric just just knocked out that one yeah last weekend and miles or so or you can give you the dating advice [laughter]\nOr marriage advice oh dear [laughter] case too I'm sure [laughter] we got a lot of vice to get all kinds of things\nMaybe this segment we'll go as well as our base segment on whether they should maybe every Friday every Friday to or does [laughter] relationship advice yeah what I don't know he's probably cheating on you that's going to be higher [laughter] so what are they going to\nLower my life so terrible everything's fault and she was all like you know like what the Swiss Lewis the thing she'll is the things that are terrible 'cause all my job\nAnd the people I work with and my boss\nAnd my job my job is no good and uh\nI really don't like my job and doctors or anything okay I got anything else outside of your jobs they are I mean I really really don't like my shop and Dr Laura ... okay you know slavery was outlawed a long time ago\nYou don't have to work there\nYou can work anywhere else you don't have to say there was this woman just can't couldn't couldn't comprehend not working at this job that she ate\nAnd every single one of the reason I bring this up is because uh the economy's getting better we started was to go right and I know there aren't an infinite number of opportunities\nOut there but still if you hate your job so much\nYou can leave your not a slave I had this conversation with miles a couple of years ago said later you're working me to death and then coming out of love and I believe it's three [laughter] I Can't take it anymore I mean when I was in college a couple of years ago I I only went to the class once a week sure\nWhat is what's the least up here I Am you're making me ... eleven right mood I covered the [laughter]\nI live with the I Can't take their anymore [laughter]\nSo bad and I really feel for you or if they if I said miles to fight [laughter] you could see they they they don't hit you on the way [laughter]\nAnd that's that's the reality that four years later and everyone's happy still right coat tail [laughter] firmly planted firmly in position right where you need to be\nSo\nThe truth is we all know that's when the economy grows not only do you get higher wages for everyone but more opportunities\nTo leave the job you have to get another job and that's all the more reason to lower taxes and decrease regulations\nAlso as my dad always said they call it work for a reason\nNot supposed to be fun to work suck it up that's me channeling my inner Dr Laura but that one [noise]\nUh let's move on yeah added a group of ... about it but the ... um [noise]\nOkay yeah ... well yesterday Eric you asked a question and I gave a insufficient dancer and I wanted to come back and give you a ... ...\n... a member yesterday I think at the time we talked about astronaut Scott Kelly does mark or something\nAnd give you a ... ...\n... a member yesterday I think at this time we talked about astronaut Scott Kelly\nDoes mark Larson though Scott Kelly could of course never I've never heard I've never heard my garage to talk about Scott Kelly\n\nEveryone on Mars or Scott Kelly [laughter] they're such good friends sure\nOr some are Scott Kelly quoted Winston Churchill and then a bunch of Churchill prime minister of England during World War two and then had to apologize for quoting Winston Churchill\n\nAnd bow down at the altar of progressive ism with the classic I Will take more time to educate myself line I Love that line\nMake sure I never ever say that\nOh yes I'm so sorry I I Will take much more time to educate myself about the ... the not\n\nSo Eric asked why the left hates Winston Churchill so much like why is he an offensive figure who you can't quote so there's two reasons that are given\nSo the first is that Winston Churchill advocated for the use of chemical weapons against enemies know when I say chemical weapons what are you gentlemen tank of\nGas ... during a way of bone and all of them I mean gosh Saddam that's all right very good uh\nI'm with my like I like the effects of the gas give me the effects yeah the whole like disintegration almost yeah your skin yeah Melanie monitored gas in the trenches yeah you have you have any of women and children gasping for breath Churchill was advocating for using tear gas\n\nThey called that chemical weapons tear gas\nLike used every weekend in Chicago [laughter] gets brought as if I got mine are deep down they're also the theory that there was never proved to be used but that's the way that they never used it I think I think it was approved but they never used was Nineteen twenty Iraq\nThat's what it was a question that's the first claim to use chemical weapons okay\nSo I can claim is that he forced to a a a genocide on the people of a bank all\nRight\nSo there is a famine there and this is the land that by India and there was controlled by England at the time they were a colony of England and the people on this this place there was they were super poor already and then there were a bunch of that this was Nineteen forty three so there are a bunch of natural disasters and they had a growing\nPopulation and they couldn't feed every one in Japan occupied Miramar is the beginning of the war rights of Japan occupied Miramar which is near the end or Japan occupied Miramar which cut off rice imports so in the end up to three million people starve\nTo death in bank all three minutes horrible right and people on the left they blame Winston Churchill because\nHe didn't send he did not send enough food shipments Tibetan gall but here's the thing he didn't not send food because he hated the people have been gall\nHe had a limited supply of food right there with a well into the war at this point in their near decimated by in other words estimate that were decimated not proper to a decimated means to be to cut by attempt so he was ... it was mostly destroyed by the Nazis close to being completely taken over by the ... as far as the ones who don't offer any one\nSo the food shipment that they had he decided to send it to the British soldiers who were deployed in Greece to fight the communists\nSo to make this stretch of an argument that a leader who's faced with a very difficult decision in war time to either send food to the people then gall or to send it to the soldiers who are fighting for the survival of the country\nJust adjust that that decision is the same as ethnic cleansing or genocide or forced starvation\nI find that to be unfair\nSo there's or to accusations Eric forced starvation is people men go\nAnd use of chemical weapons in Iraq that's why he had to apologize that does Scott that has the astronaut today I Do apologize for quoting went singer Oh thank you for the clarification I quote was something like we all need to come together right I mean I was actually it was a coup by Yahoo quoted you could possibly Abbott how dare you sort

into the thing was I didn't know what I wanted to do um I went to\nVarious phases where I wanted to be something else because I I thought I couldn't play sports for me yeah so um I was even trying to be a record producer one so [laughter] you know our winter manager and\nEverything else and then um I thought about that one day and not say whether I really wanted to do and I wanted to go back to school so the music thing when left for me um [laughter]\nI started to find the interest in school started getting my grades together and I was thinking like I'm gaining like so much weight so my I'm\nA matter of fact she prosthetic right how that affects your prosthetic right it's effect of prosthetic but I wasn't even thinking that way I was just thinking of before the XML was slender and yeah\nYou know it was just a different face for me to or that I wasn't I didn't want to accept yep I'm so\nVocational rehabilitation ... um you should try wheelchair basketball and the first time I looked at it and laugh and mess that you've\nGot to be [laughter] because obviously able bodied bass I Am\nAnd I thought after my accident and I said you know what basketball ... ship but I said I really got started getting active again so I went out tried at one time fell in love with no\nIn love with it and to wheelchair basketball I met so many great people ... and it brought me the family\nWell in ... in the fall in love with it and through wheelchair basketball or met so many great people ... and ... the family\nBudget here on the San Diego it was good if I if I can ask about the camaraderie again because I think that's so important so you're in the middle of freezers obviously grew up playing sports will tell you go in the military and there's probably there may be nothing that\nHas more camaraderie than that right I mean that's my life in your hands you know the guy that she writes that's like the the pinnacle of camaraderie and if not and then all taken away gone right none of it so to have that again that's got to be pretty soul transforming right and\nThis is funny you say that because it was like I was I was in the unit and everything before the accident but when the accident happened\nIs this kind of like the fucking swaying this where you can understand this like I was with a bunch of people that I was with them and I can move and I could do whatever they do\nAfter my accent rehabilitation I go back home\nIf they're my family they love me but their first to tell you that you're not the same person that you were so and the thing that you look for after that if\nYou want to find something that you love and when I found will true basketball I started to find\nPeople that were like me different world for life but we had the same struggles same ambitions same goals and that if that ... ...\n... energy more to be better at what I did to me like I actually went to um University of Texas at Arlington as study like if you finish my degree and play wheelchair basketball for the for the college thing\nAnd I met so many people there and I\nWhen I was home I start\nMy accident with extreme ... but when I got around more F we've like myself yeah I was like wow\nI didn't like it was a while because we've we're no life is like ... like I'm a\nPair of ... a little bit for the you know and they're moving they're living their act the ... been making that work and I'm like and I look down on my leg again and that was right [laughter] okay [laughter]\nAs long as the founder so [laughter] very awesome man [laughter] but also to pretty great\nSpokespeople for this uh we'll we'll we'll fact that you started\nThere I had no idea either um but I Do know that\nYou know these guys report to boot camp and their shoulder to shoulder they go to war their shoulder to shoulder\nThey sometimes lose each other they're buried crossed across shoulder to shoulder and if you can get that Brotherhood going it takes away that dark dark place that they go to a lot of times if you can get the family developed back at freedom station or up at the hospital\nUm it really truly makes a difference for these guys and and isn't that what we're all about as Americans taking care of our warriors especially here in San Diego area so we're very blessed to have them come we're\nVery blessed to have your support everybody that listens\nTo support among the cry [laughter] um but at any rate I truly appreciate what our team does and I'm going to tell you a real fast story so they one division two in Kentucky they came home with it all\nSo they were invited to Germany\nAnd so I thought okay can we afford to send them all to Germany well we figured it out we got a plane that would carry all their gear we got 'em over to Germany and they Germany Netherlands and France where there that was that the teams that were playing to win this championship\nOur guys get there the first thing that happened is they lost to Germany by ten points so\nEverybody back home was like OK rally the guy's rather they wiped the floor with France [laughter]\nAnother land out pretty easily\nPretty handily left one more event they had to play Germany but to win the championship they had to play Germany and win by ten points that they had lost plus one yep they came home with the ... [laughter]\nUp had not left Germany since two thousand three and when they won the entire gymnasium full of German citizens went dead\nThey couldn't believe it so our warriors being the American warriors that\nThey are and took the cop and the first place they landed coming home was Ireland they took that ... put it in the Irish ladies hands that were flying in the airplane took a picture of it and send it back to the German guy had leaving their kind of guy to LAX they found all ramp\nFull of luggage put that cup on top of a bunch of the guys standing around it sums are joining so I have no idea and the next year while we have this got where it will make its appearance in fact in Germany but I told them they better be careful 'cause they do have to go\nBack to the top of planning [laughter] probably\nThe greatest morale booster that we could have so in February up at the elbow uh no not the hospital but double a municipal gym where everybody can come we're going to have a big tournament with twelve teams ties are warrior foundation team will be there are a wolf pack\nAnd uh we'd love to have everybody ...\nYou're all see it because if you've never seen wheelchair basketball trust me I'll never be able to watch regular battle [laughter]\nI'm not even just way too slow after that\nOnly got two minutes or I Want to emphasize one point here that that uh Perry articulated an Anthony spoke of and that is when something bad happens everyone thinks through things or they think\nI'm the only one and we are maybe the isolate ourselves everyone doesn't and wheelchair basketball brings brings us out of the things which is that right so does\nFreedom station and that's the way around has been for two years so if you can lead to that rather for a second like the family in this ad freedoms Asian and now freedom station to growing so we can grow the family more", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mike Slater Show", "city": "San Diego", "day": "10"}
