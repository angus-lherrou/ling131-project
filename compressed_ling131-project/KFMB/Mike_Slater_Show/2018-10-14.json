on one of the deep discounters which we have three in the United states spirit frontier in a legion\nCharge you know the way the business model works is they may sell you a ticket for twenty dollars one way but the baggage charge will be more than the cost of the ticket even for a carry on\nSo there are now a variety of sellers selling jackets clothing items that you can stuff\nWith um close in them and you know or whatever electronics chargers whatever and nobody charges you for wearing a jacket\nSo I'm bears the biggest seller of the the one that's best known as Scott ... vast S.

I'm a variety of clothing items that inside have all kinds of pocket you can stop it and I have a puffer jacket that I bought from their outlet\nHas nine pockets inside that I can ... a ton of stuff so um last flight on spirit I flew with the big puffy jacket and this micro carry on I have that I got at Costco that Costco sells for twenty nine dollars\nAnd so I had no baggage charge at all\nFile and all that work to tear up out of the internationally as well oh yeah All right\nYeah so ah people stopping stuff in clothing is something Europeans have done for as far back as I can remember because there's a giant airline and Europe historically it's been one of the most profitable airlines in the world called Ryan air\nAnd Ryan air was the one that originally came up with the idea of charging people separately for everything and so Europeans have been way ahead of us on wearing clothing that you could just stuff everything in the pocket so you wouldn't have to pay baggage charges

since so many people farmland orange now owning\nFrom typically one to five properties and it's hard to know how to do the background checks how to collect out and all that and I lived\nOn the

so many emails you put in your email address and they'll send you\nA priceless for the things they do charge for like you are allowed on a background check you charge the tennis for that [noise] and do\nSo these services white cozy dot CEO and another one I'll mention that it's owned by trends union called my smart move\nDot com they're set up these guys ethically for you as part of your

what you'll find as you look\nThrough different sites if you want to find a list of a lot of them probably you could look at ... dot com which is kind of a clearinghouse of information for ...\nBut the what they consider to be a background check varies from site to site like some of them fall they do basically as a simple credit check for others will do a more thorough background check to see if somebody has been in trouble with the law and that kind of stuff\n[noise] so what what level would you recommend as far as how would you do a background check on a potential to\nThat is impossible to
