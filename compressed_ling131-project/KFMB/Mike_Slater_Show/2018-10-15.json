someone sends me as I say to people that send me text emails or text that go to my email\nI don't know what that is I don't know how to what the deal with\nA there's a law in California I think the past two years ago if you\nBuild a development near a transit center so a trolley station in this case is that there are no density limits\nRight so in a normal development and you can only build so much space so many apartments so many office him so much of an area right the density limits\nIf you're near a transit center though there are no dents and you let it so you could build hundred storey buildings in a certain area around this Charlie stop\nWhich would be a disaster for traffic but that's all you could do that now ... said he could come in here and say well I yeah ... it's going to be a ... it's going to mess traffic that's obviously not in their interests because they want people to live there and go there and be there and I don't want to travel to be that\nIt was like I said he said well we're not going to do that we're not we're not going to just build a ridiculous amount of density without improving the current infrastructure there so we're going to redo all these roads were gonna build all these new on ramps off ramps I'm going to do all this new development of at the structure to keep\nThe traffic below I forget what the level as they have some metric for this by
