story that Hillary Clinton is the best thing ever I can put a fake news story that say she's awful and terrible\nAnd everybody can see it and everybody can kind of Duke it out [noise] um you know fake news is not new we've had it for a long time we had yellow journalism a hundred years ago fake news is not a problem the problem we're talking about with Google and Facebook is\nThat we don't know what we don't know in other words they are actually suppressing information I this was very clear on the twenty sixteen election\nTheir academic studies that support it\nThey were suppressing negative news stories about Hillary Clinton were running up to the election time\nThey were pushing negative stories to Donald Trump and what they want us to say is that the algorithm the formula that determines what stories you see is just sort of this objective\nMeasure of information out there which is total hogwash and that's one of the things we address in the film so\nThis is a problem much more serious than fake news which we can kind of debate and said this is that's a good article that a bad article this is actually hiding in suppressing what we see and we don't even know what is being hidden from\nPeter Schweitzer within the government accountability Institute president offer books like the best selling Clinton Cash and a ... in his spare time cranking out the important movies like his newest film that creepy line that his screening in San Diego this week on November first\nAnd again the film focuses on Google and Facebook ability to manipulate and censor users and search results as well as manipulated elections while they're saying\nWe're not doing that no there's no way we're doing that so why shouldn't other was doing a uh\nUsers and search results as well as manipulated elections\nWhile they're saying we're not doing that no there's no way we're doing that so why shouldn't other ones doing a a\nYou know one of the website the creepy aligned dot com the creepy aligned dot com um\nI I just don't do that again during the break and it is chilling I mean it makes you want to just disconnect that's not where we need to go is and then we want to know what they're up to my staying connected and\nYes I think well I think we need to be connected but you also need to be a sophisticated a consumer and what that means for example is I don't use Gmail anymore Gmail is a give Google the ability they scan all the emails use and all the emails you receive and they even scammed the draft of emails you don't\nPay so matter news room service like maybe you use Cox dot the number ... ... or what have yeah\nExactly I mean there are at the point is there are alternatives I'm at the same thing with Google Chrome same thing with the Android operating system even when you turn off the Android operating system you think it's off it's still tracking when you turn it back on it actually a low it's all the information of where you've been while the phone was actually off\nSo it's very very the point is there are competitors out there and you are to use those competing products I use ... for\nExample instead of Gmail which is a a Swiss are encrypted email system um so you got to be critical consumers and you can't just believe because she was ... something that that what Google is putting at the top is the best\nAnd the most true information that's not\nAlways the case in fact a lot of times it's not whether you're looking for commercial information about restaurants for services or whether you're looking for information on political candidates so it's consumers the where\nSo is it safe to assume you're Peter's right through that when we hear executives from Facebook or Google out there talking about how careful there being and they're just trying to get rid of some of these people who are just totally fake news and so forth that that in a way as a smokescreen for what they're doing\nIt's like don't without doing back here behind the creepy lined up to the ...\nAbsolutely I mean you know you look at the stuff that was posted on Facebook for example that was supposed to be this sophisticated campaign to you know scare votes to Donald Trump on some of those where they were actually means they put out I can remember the smart there was one it was a medium of Hillary Clinton arm wrestling with Jesus\nYou know and and find out how to actually have another plausible [laughter]\nAnd you know and and the oldest is anybody actually saying that that is going to persuade anybody of anything if you didn't like Hillary before that you're not going to lecture now if you love Hillary before\nThat's not going to persuade you so yes it is absolutely Amos direction and what they are essentially saying is look at these problems over here that are minor and avoid the problems that\nWe have created because we're choosing no longer to be neutral platforms when they were organized as they are regulated they're supposed to be neutral platforms which means they're they're kind of like the old telegraph they're sending information from Peter Schweitzer some article arson\nAnd there's no editing there's no editorial control well the fact of the matter is they edit all the time they're less like a telegraph they're more like a newspaper\nAnd that's part of the problem they are trying to hide the fact\nThat they are pushing certain stories suppressing other stories and they are hiding things from us that they don't think we should have access\nTo so that's really explains a lot of things but it explains it was sometimes I'll think wow look there's Google or building some the giant new and it is filled with more people and the people working on it and\nYou've said think thinking what are they doing or what is it I mean you know using the search or whatever what are they doing now you know more of what what else they are doing that gets a right to the edge of the creepy line as Eric Schmidt had said earlier we just go right up there and we're not by letting at least for now ha ha ha\nI'm Peters rights are with us and the producer and the writer of the film and of course the film Clinton Cash based on his book in twenty sixteen and a lot of uh and same director MA Taylor in this um [noise]\nThe um the San Diego connection is pretty cool you got a couple of people in the mix here right\n[noise] yes absolutely we got ... Dr Robert ... Stein or who is a Harvard PHD psychologist former editor in chief of Psychology Today he lives just up the road or from San Diego or he is going to be at the screening um and it's really fascinating um because she is\nOne of the most cited a psychologist or doing peer reviewed academic research out there today and he really latched onto what he calls search engine manipulation of facts which is the ability of search engines and companies like Google to manipulate what we think [noise]\nUm and they're very very explicit about the power to do so and\nFor that sign has basically done is during the twenty sixteen election he had people\nThat were on getting search results from Google\nThey were monitoring the results that people got from Google\nOr that they got from bang and that they got from Yahoo and what they found was in the twenty sixteen election was systematic bias in favor of Hillary Clinton\nAnd they were doing it by doing two things number one they were suppressing negative stories about Hillary and they were pushing 'em a negative stories about Donald Trump and what the research shows is that if you're searching on a politician\nAnd you look at those first five results if there was a negative story in the ... at the top\nThat will get sometimes twenty times the click that a normal story a positive story would get the point is negative stories attract information to attract attention are and what they were doing twenty sixteen was was aggressively pushing negative stories about\nDonald Trump um and the point that that ... makes is that this company has an enormous power to determine or what information we have access to and how we see candidates out for people who follow politics are interested\nIt may not influence them as much but for somebody who a week out from election is trying to decide I don't know who I should vote for I feel like I should vote\nBut who's a better candidate there's an enormous potential for influence there so\nYou know that research was very troubling ah it's important to point out that a doctor have signed was a Hillary Clinton supporter and twenty six team is not a you know Trump advocate who you know it was screaming about the biased media he actually was a Hillary Clinton supporter but he feels that to give one company\nYou know Google dominates basically Ninety percent of search\nUm to give one company the power to suppress stories or push stories is is just simply not\nIs showing your cat or the creepy line dot com has redefined Peters writers are important new movie the creepy line dot com eye opening documentary\nThe creepy wind reveals the studying degree to which society is manipulated by Google and Facebook and as soon as somebody who uses Google and Facebook\nAnd the boy was the lid off the remarkably subtle and hence powerful manner in which they do a jacket a book creepy wind a comedy can also find out how to see the movie that's all up there as well but the Newport thing is to you and you'll probably one of the idea of a few things\nWhich they do it triggered a book creepy wind dot com you can also find out how to see the movie that's all up there as well but but at the port city of and you'll probably want to tie up a few things you do online surveys for you to appreciate its face a affects much facts aren't either Schweitzer and then there's a special screening of that may already be filled up\nI'm there after tomorrow in Hillcrest landmark theaters the all the information is on line at the creepy align dot com am seven sixty talk and breaking news\nYou are listening to mark Larson on AM seven sixty talk and breaking news\nQuiet for the time being for your drive hand or a little something in San Marcus on the Seventy eight less than San Marcus boulevard everything is off to\nThe right shoulder and really affecting your ride much your trip on the eight looks really good having a sponsored by my C.

talking about the executive order part of his\nExecutive action is that your regular can't do that that's part of um [noise] but the uh what what Trump's trying to get out here with ending birthright citizenship it's an absolute a no brainer need to do that one and a should absolutely be done\nAnd it wouldn't be anything new we would just be returning to the original intent of said fourteenth

there are debates exempted temporary travelers kids\nOf like ambassadors foreign investors who who are living here and people who own their allegiance to a foreign country\nThose people do not apply to the fourteenth amendment slaves and that's it this is why when you give the oath of citizenship the very first thing you do is renounce your allegiance to the country that you've where you were born in\nThe country that you've been on a ... a U.S citizen out for a subject that you must do that first you must renounce your foreign allegiance before you can then become a citizen of this country\nBut over a hundred and fifty years that part's all gone away and now it's just you're born here or re congratulations and that's not a not appropriate ... and it's not the original intent uh so do not listen to any analysis or if you're reading about this news\nAnd they quote the Ford first of all most most a new sources won't quote the fourteenth amendment which is troubling I'm In the article they're talking about\nUh some will quota but they'll leave out a couple of words and the words are will they could do a full court is all persons born or naturalized in the United states and here's what they'll leave out and subject\nTo the jurisdiction there up that's what we're talking about here and so if you're if you're a hunter a citizen of Honduras or Guatemala you're not subject to the jurisdiction there of oh you're not subject to the jurisdiction of American when you're coming\nSo that's the part that some it's where the executive order and we'll talk more about it I Want to move on but\nAll all the executive order I guess would do would be clarified this point it wouldn't be changing the law it would just be clarifying the original intent of it so I'm not exactly sure

half hours each way to drop off favorite ... favorite a pizza to a dying man\nAnd beautiful story and the first comment is are you serious that isn't the best pizza ever looks terrible but that just really ticks me off so here's the deal this is why I decided markets there really is you know and he said\nAnd the first comment is are you serious that isn't the best pizza ever looks terrible but that just really ticks me off so here's the deal this is why I decided markets there really is you know and he said there was this all about what you choose to focus on that's my point you can either be a inspired by the very nice story or very ticked off by the goon so markets are really a sad\nDo away with the opinion I Am harmed and the harm is cast away\nSo I can choose to be annoyed at this guy and that's my instinct ticked off at this guy for totally missing the point to the story or I can be filled with a little bit of hope and joy at the guy who drove seven hours to deliver pizza to a diamond and whichever I Choose to focus on just puts me on\nTwo different paths right I mean they're gonna be ticked off all day because of this loser or I'm really inspired and hopeful and very nice because it is very nice story and that puts me in two different places at the end of the day so I'm choosing to focus on\nShe's like well that's weird and she wondered if there was it was a right wing thing so she created a new YouTube account and started only watching Hillary videos recorded videos\nAnd sure enough she started getting recommended videos about secret government agencies in\nNine eleven truth or stuff in communism is awesome and all that crazy far left things\nSince I got maybe this is just a political thing so she started another account as she started watching videos that have nothing to do with politics so she'd watch videos about vegetarianism and all this suggests videos were about ... that's a vegetarianism wasn't enough\nGot to become a V. she started watching videos about jogging and all the recommended videos were about running ultra marathons\n\nShe says it seems as if you are never hard core enough for YouTube's algorithm it promotes recommend a disseminated videos in a manner that appears to constantly up to the stakes given ... billion or so\nUsers you to maybe one of the most powerful radicalizing instruments at the twenty first century so as professors writing this article the New York times I should've said that the being right about that sort of you to maybe one of the most powerful radicalizing instrument to the twenty first century and it's because the algorithm and it keeps driving us further and further to an extreme whatever does seem to be political\n\nWise to do that what's the business sense by this\n\nWe talk a bit on the show about the outrage machine\nAnd how important it is to be checked out of that game\nDon't play the outrage machine game don't get stuck in support for your soul and your sanity and free family to knock it stuck in it\nBut\nThe businesses the powers that be want us in it because it's really good for their business outrage is good business\nSo here's the New York times author she says Google is an advertising broker\nSelling our attention to companies that will pay for the longer people stay on YouTube the more money Google makes at what keeps people glued to YouTube its algorithm seems to have concluded that people are drawn to content that is more extreme than what they started with\nOr too incendiary content in general\nRight so it just gives us more extreme things and it keeps us glued and then they make more money and this makes sense right so it appeals to a natural human desire right we want to dig for the truth and then when we start in one direction we dig deeper and we tried to uncover more and YouTube is happy to send us down a rabbit hole\nAnd before you know you spent hours in this rabbit hole and they've just racked up more ... ad sales\n\nMy concern is kids who are growing up only knowing this is the only world there now and this is\nWhy everything for uh the the younger generation everything has to be so extreme right everything has to be it's just blatant says Robert he can't be\nA fascinating man with many interesting aspects of his life and why did he make certain choices they can't be that he has to be a race a slave owner we've turned out on a Saturday or whatever right million different examples everything has to be the most extreme version of itself\n\nBut of course we see the same thing in politics too but I see it getting much much worse before it gets better\n\nAnd I mean one thing that's that's\nOne of in a Twitter is done that and specially but Facebook to well you know that that the ... would you say it's really good example it takes away face to face connection\nOne of ... especially but Facebook to well you know that that the story would you say it's really good example it takes away face to face connection\nBecause the things that we say on Twitter and Facebook we would never say to someone's face so Steve Sebelius writes the squeezes the congressman who was shot at the softball game a couple of months back when the guy went in there and attempted to assassinate twenty four senators twenty four Republican senators\nSo ... says he's the guy got shot almost died after the synagogue\nShooting he put it on Twitter he said my heart is broken and my prayers are with the members of the tree of life synagogue the brave first responders and all affected by this despicable act of evil and hatred right fine great thoughtful little pie already but what ever find the good little sentiments great medical\nEasiest who's a very prominent\nProgressive\nCommentator or he wrote back do you respond to that sweet David Duke who's the head of the KKK David Duke without the baggage\nThat was his response to these leases sort of like what is that what are you doing man\nI don't think he would never say that just deep
