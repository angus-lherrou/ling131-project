some good some bad in some probably in between what what's the best stuff no most of the [laughter] it gets ... okay well that's good so famous and then we have a few things that are that are in between that and most of his death you know it is that time of year Alan well it's getting there any way\nYou know we're getting towards year end and that people think about the holidays they start thinking about gosh maybe I've I've got some charities organizations I'd like to give to and then sometimes Joe it's it's like I Want to give and but I also want to get a little tax break there's probably some strategies that I may or may not\nKnow I think most people don't understand the strategies they just cut attracted yeah correct and which is great yeah but well we we want to get into here for the first part of the shows just a few different strategies that you might not have heard of\nOr just explain how to go about implementing some of them right because if you look about Seventy two percent of charitable donations are by individual yeah so\nThe majority and and the total for two thousand sixteen was about three hundred and Ninety billion so that's a that's a big number that's where the be Seventy two percent of three hundred and Ninety billion yeah his vigils they're like you and me and our list and Warren Buffett and bill yeah most people do [laughter]\nWell they give to their foundations and that's Fifteen Percent of the charity comes from foundations\nGot it on a plane than a charity golf tournament last week with Warren Buffett no that was he was not feel as in the field um but you know that was fun yeah you get back a little bit ... yeah yeah so so first things first out what should people do to thinking about giving\nWell I think that the first things first is to figure out what what your own goals are what your needs are and and I say that because a lot of our listeners are either working or they're retired or they're close to retirement and it's like I Do know some people ties so that's like okay ten percent of my income I going to give that regardless which is great\nNow for the rest of us that we tend to kind of take a look at All right what am I making what do I need in terms of saving for retirement or I'm In retirement what I Need for my cash flow expenses\nAnd then what's leftover and do I want to save that for the kids or do I want to give some of that the charity so I think it usually starts with yourself Joe and and your overall goals\nI Would agree with that even as selfish that might be I think it's important\nRight now get big

com forty three nights already forty through\nI don't know what you're saying I don't know either I was just thinking about be holding up your head kind of miss Taylor mega bringing [laughter]\nUh okay forty three blue doors dot com yeah hello I Love your part guessing just finishing listening ... episode one eighty eight ... unrealistic we have that many I think we got a lot more than ... we started titled them by the number for some reason a couple of years ago but we have actually now\nThat is the beginning of two thousand Fifteen when I came up in ... because we have a hundred and eighty eight episodes ... shows it's two thousand ten yeah only life into one even do that now at one eighty one yeah because I said well yeah going to be prior to add six sphere so anyway\n[noise] alright well thank you for listening Bonnie or she blissfully episode with uh your boy cue per se the debt that was kind of fun and um then you mention I'm not sure who uh she's referring to hear that everyone who makes money in real estate leverage is loans that sounds like a big statement\nBecause they were they said I don't know there are a few of us who did not do it that way personally I don't have that much risk tolerance why pay cash for all my rental properties and now fire on income from them like it\nI view them as diversified investment thankfully I have them so I don't stress out as the market falls again love the show things while the great information\nRelevant comment Bonnie I agree with your comment if you can I Love putting all cash down that what happens in a couple of things is your rate of return is less generally and appreciating market because you're using all of your own money instead of borrowing other people's money\nBut your risk goes way down to and so if you can buy properties without cash I'm I'm all for it I think that's a great way to go most of us cannot but they cannot in San Diego yeah because average property prices probably six hundred thousand dollars right hand a lot of the homes you that you're looking at would be a million dollars\nOr more sure you that would be a probably not a really great investment for rentals they're obviously not the reason for that is that let's say you get rent that it was it let's say a million dollar home say three thousand\nRent yeah yeah maybe something like that so that's thirty six thousand for the year what you really want to do to make this work out as one percent of the value per month so one percent of a million dollars is ten thousand dollars per month as a hundred and twenty thousand that's where the math really works well on these and so there are twelve thousand\nOne percent of one million or one person I'm Sorry yeah it's ten thousand times twelve months there's one guy like out there with a somewhat yeah OK so at any rate\nIf you live at a part of the country where you can you rent or one percent of the value than to accent you're able to keep buying a proper sure yeah and there's a ton of areas there in the country where you can ... where he can do that at Texas has kind of known to be an air and not so much red Austin but but to maybe some of the\nDallas Dallas maybe ... Houston yeah Amarillo\n[laughter] see what else there though it takes a set of values to say I have found uh\nHouston that Amarillo [laughter] see what else there the Texas that used to say I have a town I Am so\nYeah if if you have multiple properties that you've paid cash for and then you got to cap parade of three or four or five percent yeah I mean then they had a really good casually as property\nIn Texas that can be ten percent Nevada that yeah some owner yeah yeah someplace Florida that ... percent to Iowa Minnesota for sure [laughter] Alabama [noise] um\nBut anyway it's got to do your homework and research and so I I think we hear with um real estate investors is that okay well I'm going to buy you know in my area\nWell okay that's great because you can go look at your property but when you live in some areas I mean you know New York for ... yeah what if you buy you're not going to be buying a bunch of failed by kind of cast for three million [laughter]\nSo yeah so I think we're on the same page as you and I think ... are comment was with lead bridge you're using the banks' money and if you have time in the lab cash flow it works\nBut ... I read stinks remember this very well okay what is that I thought ... was going to blow himself up well yeah because he was all liberate up I didn't we assume that yes and he's like I'm fire [laughter]\nBecause I got all these properties and I'm leveraged up and I was like this guy's going to blow up you've got to be just like the video games\nAnd I think I mentioned on on the air that the problem with that is every girl that I read the book son has gone bankrupt at least one threat and because they bought the property a they ... up to buy property deal ever to have to buy property say next thing you know twenty properties and the market turned and they couldn't afford any of them but\n[noise] so I'm Bonnie a she's a blogger at forty three blue doors so yeah I think we're on the same page there [noise]\nYou know if we're talking investments hum I Believe one of the most important investment you can make it's an investment you making yourself\nI really want to give all of you that opportunity right now but this investments are going to cost in nickel for very small him pulled listeners on our show today what we're a free meal is a full personalized basically retirement assessment in this personally review you will discover how long your savings will truly last let's take a look at how much risk you're taking on the overall portfolio\nIs it designed to crate highly effective strategies to transform that portfolio into income\nI'm also mitigating your risk how he can increase your Social Security benefit income and potentially aren't even more benefits that you'll never see understatement\nWell look at strategy to reduce your taxes in retirement to keep that money for yourself\nPlus defense moves to protect your life savings from the skyrocketing costs of health care in the ... that we're seeing right now on Wall street\nIf you do one thing this year to take control of your money in their retirement I Believe this is it to get yours you must college though but then the next five minutes here's the number eight eight eight nine nine for six to five seven eight eight eight\nQuick note see when it comes to walk four one K. withdrawals\nIs that if you're taking withdrawals from a raw form when king be careful because if you had a company match within that route four one K.\nThat is going to be pre tax in that would fall from the match is going to come out as taxable income yeah that is a tricky thing and it's going to come up to ...\nYou know what that means is that let's say that you have a hundred thousand dollar rough four one K. total balance of the plan and you believe All right well great I have a hundred thousand dollars all tax free but potentially if you had a match a hundred thousand dollars might not all be tax free ... if that's the total balance of the plant\nRight because your employer if they're making contributions than they got a tax deduction so that piece of its taxes\nSo let's say twenty thousand dollars is the match eighty thousand dollars is your contribution of total balance of a hundred thousand dollars in you pull one dollar on that plan eighty percent of it is going to be tax free twenty percent of who's going to be tax that ordinary income rights what yeah\nAnd and going back to your question that part the ... what are you will be added to your provisional income and may affect how much of your Social Security is tax\nWrite and then so when you get in these weird thresholds Allen with Social Security ... if you add one dollar income it could add a dollar eighty five\nOf tax well of up to about ... of income tax is correct yes yeah so and that's the weird thing be and why is that so here's why is because that extra dollar incomes tax that your tax rates\nOf income tax is correct yes yeah so and that's the weird thing be and why is that so here's why is because that extra dollar income tax at your tax rate which normally wouldn't when you're in the twelve percent bracket when we're in the student for the ... example\nBut all of a sudden our none of your Social Security was taxable at least ... dollar now all of a sudden eighty five percent tax both about tax will at twelve percent too\nRight so that's that's another call at nine percent so you're you're you thought you were in the ... percent bracket but it feels like Twenty one percent because now all of a sudden more your Social Security taxes All right\nSo ... and ... but I Would see it another way if one dollar is now included in taxable income\nYou're going to add another dollar right that was not taxed that ordinary income now that subject to Social Security tax up to eighty five percent yes oh eighty five cents of that dollar would be subject to pack soap I added dollar it's going to add another eighty five cents on top of the dollar tax cut to ... you think your explanation\nIs clear enough listen I suppose like when I got an area of sticking their shoes it's like it's just that but I Know that sort of ask so bad kind of felt like you [laughter]\nI've been treating everybody I say you are exactly like me I Know that was that was that I felt I didn't say that's right you know that's right Alan your point B apparently I Do that too much TV chefs I got to stop them\nLook at and you're supposed to smile and that's where the other problem that's going to cause them sit next year I'm just give us the sweat you already has posted there it's like I'm not for that that's right you already are\nBut we got Bob about from uh San Diego I'm I Do have a question thank you bumped your program last Sunday was another TV yeah right the fans were trading on the part gesture a you made um what is that\nWe're ... empathetic empathetic emphatic addict I mean that means aggressive that'd be wrong I mean I'm very strong point without\n... when in order to be as exercise the percent of withdraw must come from each separate I recount\nMy aren't these starts next year and I have two accounts I'm being told that I can take the combination of two accounts form one account is this a new rules they're an Irish documentation that you can prove your nonsense from out of that yeah that's ...\nGet out so Bob I'm so maybe maybe misunderstood what we said because uh if you have I raise you can aggregate all the Iranians as if he had one account and you can take one are empty however\nWhen you have four one K. is for three days four fifty seven you have to take a required minimum distribution from each account separately and and you may have several if you've worked several employers and never role to an IRA\nSo he's right but I think sometimes when we say four one K. or for three D. or something like that people think that Iraq right now it's a retirement account of IRA whatever but now it's very specific yeah when it comes to arm and that's\nThe maddening part is it seems like an ad they shouldn't be this complex building at the end all fit at apathetic precious mad [laughter] I like the verb it up [noise]\nUm yeah yeah so hopefully that cleared that up have we got another one yeah we got a couple of more but I I'm just looking at the clock here that we're all the time to see All right well let's see uh uh Carol she's from San Diego's well you picked it 'cause it's a short question is yes you'll have a right answer okay\nI'm a divorced woman in her seventies when my former husband die use\n'em well oh okay when he dies will I be eligible for part of his Social Security payment we were married for Twenty years he now has another wife [noise]\nAlright well Carol as long as you have not remarried\nA yeah if the passes than you are entitled to the survivor benefit of that account as long as you were married for ten years you were married for twenty as long as you never remarried you are entitled to a both\nA spouse will benefit ... living while he's living so he's still alive so you can you know it it hit half of his benefit is larger than your own benefit\nYou're entitled right now to the spousal ah and when he passes then you'd be entitled to the\nSurvivor and guess what year former husband does not have to approve this yeah even living as a matter of he has another wife or not yeah or he had several waves Twenty years the hundred and fifty years old\nSo Carol hopefully that\nMakes you happy because yeah I Would figure it out\nUm but I think what you would need to do is get a Social Security number which I Would imagine you have because we were married to the gentleman for Twenty years that I Would think she has one and I'm just go to the Social Security ministry shouldn't just here's my you know marriage certificate ... divorce decree and whatever and just to give a little bit of proof surf\nAnd say yes I was married to this gentleman um can

... right now and have to now if I can tell lay gratification and famous trailer asking\nPeople who consistently spend a little less say why\nWhat do you think people can do because I Know there's been studies I think Merrill Lynch did this a while ago you know they saw a picture of themselves Twenty years in\nThe future that there were a little bit older a little bit gray or a little bit clearer than all of a sudden they would see a little bit more money because they were taking care of that future\nSelf ... what are some tricks in tips that potentially you can give us to think about our future self and not be so concentrated on our today self\nVisualization really that's how I don't know if you ever did that now Lynch exercise where you ... yourself\nI think that apple is called photo booth or something like that but I did it it was really very scary um\nYeah you said everybody I cause I I called the researchers and ask them\nIf I can just look at a picture of my mother 'cause I like my mother my mother you know I kind of look like my mother and they were like no you have to look at yourself so I did at a lab or did it again if\nThey can use techniques like visualization in other ways you can ... your goals I mean it does make a goal to\nBe able to have them ... you know when you want them that said nothing works like our nation and automation is full bath talk that we have for financial success\nIt works better and money that it works and house decorated and\nHas me convinced that you actually can automate some of their ... you can figure out a couple of breakfasts and a couple of launches that you like well enough on a regular basis and just keep them around and this is why you will always type thing and the other end I French cuts\nI can eat it for pretty much any of the day I can like it pretty much any time I ate it and it's rather go\nIf you automate your financial decisions\nAutomate your savings for each and every goal and put that at the top of their priorities last\nAs long as they're satisfying your savings calls it almost doesn't matter what you do at the rats\nYeah that's so well said because I think people get at the opposite you got to appear so first and spin everything right you don't need to\nJust hovering stress over budget if you figure out what that savings goal is due that spin everything else and I think the more people will be financially secure but we ended up you know see the last it's like well everything else has to be paid first and then we put herself last\nSo if we can just flip the switch they're a little bit you're right I think more and more people would find that it's not as difficult as it is to save 'em once they've just given that habit\nAnd and the nice thing about\nUm getting in the habit if the getting in the habit is and I have a tougher confident the stark tell one of the things that I Do that I find I take a lot of joy is visiting my say that I I go on a grand\nI I'm I'm a big believer in preparing and and what that little in my life as that I said separately for a lot of different goals I just had\nBut I'm I'm a big believer in mental accounting and and what that means in my life is that I said\nSeparately for a lot of different goals\nI just had you know your bank will allow you to open and many savings accounts as he won't want to have that your minimum balance they don't charge you extra cell I just open them for my various colds and and then I visit up and it's it's nice to go on a tour and say oh my five twenty nine is here and\nMy um my four oh one K. is here at my role over IRS here and just to um take\nHeart and the fact that you're making progress toward whatever your goals are I ended up big survey of money and happiness while ago for a book that I wrote and what we learn it and the research\nIs that we're getting to the goal is in some cases even a little bit of a let down it's the process of going that makes people really happened really satisfied\nGene I Would like to ask you a little bit more about your presentation I think on where you talked about the big money ideas for the next five to ten years specifically I Want to talk to you about work that really works can you tell us a little more about that sure\nSo I'm ... I was focusing on um the fact\nThat Ninety percent of the increase in jobs I'm over the last decade has been in\nAlternative forms of employment or talking about gay quirk and freelance for a temporary work that the problem with that as our whole social safety net\nUm grew up around the idea of a full time work he jumped came with health insurance and retirement and training and training and maybe if they were lucky in that second the company and\nToday we've got all these gigs that don't provide those and um and when we read stories in the paper about income inequality I think what we have to step back and remember is that the gave it a ... is it that um that income inequality is a year to year\nSince town but wealth inequality because you don't have an employer who is nudging you to put money in a four O. one K. and matching your contributions um is it is a longer lasting\nAnd growing problem um and what it means is that you're not unless you're doing these things for yourself you're not building\nFoundation that's going to allow you to tell them from one job to another and so what I Would I think we will\nThin and it's funny right before fend on there with a story in the paper about air being be and how they are considering giving shares a shock to the people who run ...\nAnd that's that's what I'm Talking about they were going to have to start to see a transfer not just of income but of ownership um if the economy is going to be sufficient to actually uh support it below her\nYou know I'm just thinking back you know of them you know you got the gig economy where All right well maybe I'm very successful with him I ... you and I make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year\nBut then I have to put together my own for when the plane or a ... at the put together my own benefits plan which is just another layer sophistication because maybe I'm really good at a certain activity but not necessarily the finance aspect of it and I think you're absolutely right because we see ... individuals\nYou know you you you got to Tom in Harry or Julian gene they worked for you know very similar industries they make the same amount of money there they are the same sophistication level but if one person has a fairly cheap land at their employer and the other one does not in the next Twenty years of these people with employer who's going to have more money saved\nIn most cases the person with a point when key plant because it's so easy it's just out of sight outta mind a just check a box of the money goes in\nFor the other individual they have to do a lot more legwork workers some work there might be uncomfortable or maybe and maybe for them because they're not very comfortable with money so you're absolutely right is I mean I Love the gig economy\nIn a I'm not saying hey if you're a little bit driver you can't make hundreds of thousands well that would be pretty hard you'd have to run all the time but um but you're right that the you you get a little bit more ownership in some equity in in and build that well\nYeah I I think that's that's very very well set in and they were our service companies that are stepping up to sort of fill\nThat gap that that er I I see them advertised on I take the subway we can be are backing benefits provider right\nUm so what else that was three minutes [laughter] what else do we have I have um some email questions that we still have to get out okay but I sent you guys\nWere talking over at that that was some some interesting use it to our listeners yeah yeah of course I'm All right so we got an answer a few more and then we'll switch gears because L Z list is just getting in the hole and it's probably got a great lesson yes and I don't care for the officer [laughter]\nBut [laughter] at\n... but it's it's a list that you will be important to you if you're one and three hundred million\nDollars to let's say to him for that is correct research there uh Joan now we're not going to go with John what are we doing Gloria Gloria in San Diego All right so if I ... I'm Sorry Korea if at age fifty eight I retire after working Thirty years and then claim Social Security at age sixty seven\nIs there a penalty for not contributing to work up to the time I claim Social Security [noise]\nSo let's assume glory as full retirement age is sixty seven and she's retiring ten years earlier approximate right so is there a penalty Allen well\nThere's not a penalty but but I've got a caution for your Korea because if you're looking at your statement and figuring out what your benefit is at age sixty seven that's\nFiguring that you're going to have basically the same salary at what cost of living adjustments up until that date age sixty seven so if you retire Nineteen years early then you may you may have less benefits than what you're expecting it's not a penalty per se but it's how they calculate that the total\nBenefits so yeah you're not going to receive the benefits that you see in your statement um but it's got to I'm I'm repeating\n[laughter] usually tell me that's wrong and you're right I don't know I don't think that's right and he's saying you're renting wrong out most of the time it is and I have to spend most of the dynamics of well not when it comes to taxes now but social that now are you are so ... I mean 'cause you ... ... are you going to be\nProbably one third accurate two thirds enact now probably at least over fifty\nI think you're good yeah [noise] um this is it only half or is there one more\nFish you need to continue in the ... we didn't answer you know what was the man see she's from San Diego Hi Nancy I'm if a husband passes away prior to Social Security for his Social Security benefits\nFor weight wired wired ... let's say ... what did I did I read these amazing [laughter]\nA husband it'll say Hi to them and I that Nancy I'm not sure if it was your husband maybe you're talking about for your neighbor freight um it's a husband passes away prior to filing for his Social Security benefits\nWill just surviving Wang's benefit on his social Social Security record increase if she waits until age Seventy to file for it\nOr would hurt benefit be fixed at the amount it would be at his full retirement age\nBeforehand she wouldn't be collecting under her own Social Security record at ... until she turned Seventy hope you can answer this one on your TV show that I\nThink ah we we did and well and now we're doing it on our podcast so you've got double duty\nBecause we love ... way they are but it's a very good question is um and because of that I'll let you answer All right let's break it down a couple of different ways now because there's two different benefits if you're married that potentially could qualify for one is a spy also benefits in one of the survivor benefits\nAnd they get confused because if you claim on your own record right there's different rules\nIf I have my if I'm going to claim on my own record in let's just assume I benefit at my full retirement age is one thousand dollars okay and if I Do claim it early which I can at age sixty to my benefit is going to be reduced by roughly twenty five percent\nYes so now you're getting seven hundred and fifty instead of a thousand right\nOr I can wait until age Seventy in if I wait until they Seventy I get about a hundred and thirty two percent hires yeah Thirteen hundred bucks correct okay\nSo that's on your own record and so I think a lot of you understand if I wait or if I take it early I Know that there's going to be variations within the overall benefit if I Choose to take it rather than my full retirement age ... but\nA lot of times we're using that same logic on ... or survivor benefits All right\nSo we get this question is hey my spouse is full retirement age benefit is a thousand dollars if I wait to take that spouse will benefit until my age Seventy well I increased my overall benefit and the answer is no\nIt won't be reduced if you take it early but it will not be reduced if you wait\nSo the spouse the benefits based upon half of your spouse's full retirement age benefit it doesn't grow after age sixty six or sixty seven whichever you if that works for you\nSo if you claim your spouse or benefits early\nRight it's going to be reduced ... if you take your supposed to benefit at full retirement age you're going to get that full amount if you wait to take this also benefits after your full retirement age you're not going to receive any increase in benefits\nThe reason for that is that the increase in benefits is based on your own record and it's called a delayed retirement benefits\nSo when I'm claiming a spouse or benefit I Can't put a delayed retirement credit and he's also benefit right makes sense it does\nSo it's always going to be based on full retirement age OK second question was ... or second benefit that people are entitled to if they're married is the survivor benefit yeah which is what she asked if so what the question is is that the spouse or the deceased died before full retirement age right\nAnd so they're like All right well I'm only claiming my benefit\nThe deceased my spouse deceased I'm going to wait until they Seventy to flip to the survivor benefit because what the survivor benefit as al is that it's either your benefit or your spouse's which ever is higher right so if the spouses benefit is higher you would switch to the survivor benefit\nSo the question is hey I'm going to wait until like Seventy then I'm going to take that benefit because I'm going to increase the benefit or the assumption is will that benefit the increase was delayed retirement credits and again the answers now you're going to receive the survivor benefit it's going to be based on the deceased full retirement age\nSo forward Sanford age even though they've passed before for retirement age\nIs that correct that is correct yeah now if she takes if he would have survived\nAnd made it till eight Seventy event claimed his benefit and then passed hurt benefit would be based on now the higher benefit because he was alive or she wasn't like whatever the deceased spouse is not no no no longer deceit using race and they were able to get those delayed retirement credits so then if they passed\nWith those credits the surviving spouse now is entitled to those retirement credit so they would get the higher\n... so what about when your spouse's age sixty nine and then passed away and didn't claim benefits you're still stuck at the fourth time and age\nI Believe so because they didn't believe it or not claim that benefit I if they would have had to claim the benefits\nThey sixty nine and then passed away and didn't claim benefits you're still stuck at the fourth time and age I Believe so because they didn't believe it or not claim that benefit I if they would've had to clean the benefit to get the higher the two\nI'm I'm Ninety nine point nine percent of that is a really good question that means there's thirty percent chance of\nFifty fifty we can just set it up [laughter]\nAll right we've got to take

apartment complexes going after a few more right now and\nHas been helping people diligently even before he was on the mentor a\nTeam so Scott I'm going to ask could probably the hardest question to ask any mentor and I\nDon't know sixty days enough for you to come up with a robot answer ... maybe just you're eight years of helping people's friends throughout lifestyles may give you a good sense of where I'm going with this and that is what I bring new mentors I say ... you know how do you grade yourself as a mentor\nAnd [noise] it's really difficult because you know he said well I Want to grade myself to do whatever has failed deal\nAnd you can err on that side by saying OK I'm just going to say no to everything the easiest thing for a mentor to do is to say no to everything\nOh you'll never be wrong no one will ever come back at you and say you were you man you were wrong and this one I lost about but uh uh the other side we have the other kind of mentor to Scott a we have a few of these guys that are just um I don't come the right word for word suicide insulting up there they\nReally really really really really want to help you get what you want to the point where maybe they're not using enough of their own personal um ... conservatives\nMaybe they're not using enough of their own personal um ...\nConservatives ... to ... them from making yeah restraint and and being able to see how you look I Know you really want this I noticed when really you know you really liked us but there's quite a few things that ... you know the red flags go up to her in the back of my next going up this just doesn't seem like the right deal for you\nUm you know there's that balance in the middle were Ninety nine percent of the ... people put through deals end up doing good ones the other one percent of people that don't listen to how to do it why don't you tell them how to do it [noise] uh that's the perfect\nAnd then the final indicator is okay how many people by retired and make millionaires out of that's good that's a good score card\nAnd how many people that I've consulted have become national park association winters so I haven't had this conversation with you because you've been so busy since you got here and I've been so busy last couple of weeks also have you thought about any of those parameters constraints as to how you would grade yourself personally\nAs a consultant\nWow I really haven't thought of that you know you hit on a lot of things there that I have seen it sixty days and I thought about sixty days but I hadn't thought about the overall kinda what do you want your legacy of big a deal and and this and what I'm doing now [noise] um I can tell you that\nWhen I Am working with people and I've done this and this is part of the lifestyles culture that we try to\nKind of pushed through and when and\nIf if you talk about people who are doing exactly what we doing syndicating deals buying deals whatever outside of lifestyles so many times I was in this conversation yesterday\nThose guys make all their money up front on fees and things for putting the deal together and they really don't have a vested interest in what the long term successes or any particular deal\nBecause we invest in every deal that we do in addition to taking other people's money I really look at this and and Curtis does a great job in the multi family orientation session of talking about the family office and that's kind of a new thought that he put in my head\nAnd really figuring out how to maximize my net worth and in fact grow it and so I look at every deal that way whether\nI met her or not in it now that I'm a mentor and so the two smaller deals are that are meant to hurt people on there were no brainer sin and when I mentioned before sometimes you've got to give them a little shove off the cliff that's\nWhat these war they were first deals for these folks but when I looked at him it was like guys if you don't make a decision and do this I got twenty other people behind that I Know we'll do this today and uh and then they could potentially jobs and they're going to be great [noise] um the hundred and sixty four ...\nScott Scott ... you're just so you have the ... that are using the today I called the cattle prod mood\nYou know you got what do you do with someone won't take actually hit him with the cattle ... what does that and I used to say it all the time is if you don't do this I'm going to do it or I'm going to give it to somebody else but we're not going to let those wouldn't get away so I've always called that ... move okay started a hundred\nOr a hundred and sixty four year deal was one that we had to finance a little bit we had to do a little deeper analysis it wasn't so obvious a good deal\nUm and we ... we had to work at a little bit before we came to grips uh fortunately Roger having run his own business and being in six am ideals are so far he's very smart very good at it analyzing the numbers\nAnd uh we got through that but it took a little bit of work then that brings us to the the one that I'm working on this afternoon which is the out of town deal\nUh this one doesn't help that it's not in the Houston market where I've been ac or\nYou know active for ten years now and I pretty well known sub markets and things like that there's one I had to do a little homework on and when he first brought back as an initial analysis I found some things that\nI thought he was trying to favor the deal a little too much and I did have to pull it back and say you know my job is to keep you out of a bad deal and here are the concerns that I have he's gone back and massage some of that we've gotten a more farm loan quote which can substantially affect the deal\nAnd so we are going to take another run at it this afternoon so I have seen a little bit of the spectrum I guess and how deals develop I haven't had a deal yet are we had one on a a acquisition road trip that a few people were\nPretty heavy on and I did I we didn't get very deep into it but I came out on the road trip\nAnd I said the skills to rich there's not enough upside to this deal to make it worth a while and we and we pulled a couple of people off of that deal um but fortunately we didn't get all the way down to the diligence and get everybody's hopes up to invest it in a deal but that's that's the biggest problem sometimes you get people that are doing first deals and they're emotionally\nInvested and the and it's hard for them to let go and and that's where I Do see my kind of position here is to make sure that people don't get a little too anxious or lose some patience and make sure the good deal comes along because it took me\nNine months before I got my first deal on her contract and I was completely blocking the gray line between unemployed and self employed for those nine months so uh I was definitely anxious and Emory a Jacob had to hold me back from doing a bad deal at that time so I've never forgotten that\nYou're not remember during the rise and so forth you were you have an interesting personality your personality fears nothing\nBut yet you're very analytical and I've had conversations with you and you know after our conversations where it's been like man the worlds coming to an end and we better be careful that hurt other conversation with you you know what I'm going to go do something way out here over left field we'd never done before because I just think it's interesting and it might might really pay off\nSo you you got a lot of ah versatility and your personality for being able to consult people\nI Want to ask you next question knowing that is this\nUm about a year ago maybe six months I Can't remember a time flies you know the last\nCouple of months we've gone very quickly but we were sitting over gee Alexander's one day and you were kind of like you're kind of pulling back saying you know I don't know\nI'm really kind of at the point where I might not do any more deals and uh I might just start buying partners out in in you know changing my position more like yours do ... more of it\nAnd then I'm looking at your your your work upper today man you got like one new deal you just closer to more deals you going after\nWhat did you do do you do consulting changing but we've got to go to a break so I don't want you to answer is talked to the break but I'm just wondering did you take some new go Joe juice or you take it or you are new vitamins or was helping other people got you back out there going\nAnd ah yeah it's it's just been a a re commitment and um and at the same time I'm doing more of the things that I Know that I used to enjoy helping people tending road trips things like that I kind of falling off the bat ah for the lifestyles are things for a while there and\nIt's got to be reinvigorated re involved and uh and deals are coming to me so it's not like I'm really out there looking for them it's just that being more active again things kind of pop up and I just had my eyes open and\nYou know decide which ones you wanna do\nHave slowly now I'm going to throw the curve ball at you along those same lines and\nI'm going to put words in your mouth which are knows when sanitary but look at it from the point of view about the time did all this came about you found this deal out of eased back where you used to live and it was a good excuse for you to go visit your family\nAnd friends from the past um we started really taking off nationally lifestyles we started doing deals all over the country and then the concept came to us for the first time ever to you know what all these years people have been coming from all over the country to come to Texas to buy\nAnd we own quite a few properties in Texas I don't know what percentage I'm not going to even guess what percentage I don't know how many units I'm not a good guess but it's a lot of properties along units and\nWe thought about you know what we're doing now is that we've we've created a very sophisticated base of investors in all taxes\nAnd then we started thinking what would be like to take the money and the sophistication and the experience that we've accumulated in this group and taken some podunk town has no money no sophistication no nothing or\nWithout being insulted at least they have less experience than we do and to be able to throw that these properties in these markets outside of the Texas market area\nAnd ah you nailed one we've had four or five others have gotten nailed and the last couple of months\nAnd all of a sudden I think what you're going to start seeing in fact I've already seen it is it instead of people coming to road trips in Houston people are flying out of Houston and Dallas and San Antonio and going to Michigan and going to Detroit Michigan are you going to Atlanta Georgia and going to Phoenix and going\nTo uh you know all these different places we have these deals and they're now saying we've opened up a new can of worms here Scott and I know you see that I think you're feeling that and I think that might have been part of the reason you got invigorated again\nIt absolutely so ah and you're absolutely right my wife and I\nFirst two and a half years that we were married we lived in Cincinnati, Ohio when she got out of grad school that was where best opportunity was so we moved there for a little while before we moved back to Houston and beginning of last year\nI had went on a big junk mail a\nCampaign and so I started on subscribing to all these things that creep into your mailbox overtime for signing up for various things and I'm sitting on the couch with a a football game or something on she was on the other end of the cash deal whatever she was doing on her laptop\nAnd I was an subscribing and deleting all this junk mail and one of the things that happened they are a which is one of the big brokers here in town and they are national\nOr had gotten bought by Cantor Fitzgerald\nAnd when that happened I had been on their website and I had set preferences so I only got deals and the Houston metropolitan area at the time that I started doing this I said why would anybody have to leave a city like Houston there's so much opportunity here to do any of this\nAnd I had I stated rule that if I couldn't drive to it and be home by the end of the day I Need to do and\nSo ah anyway as are sorting and and I didn't batch delete I was just hit and delete delete delete scrolling through the subject line this Cincinnati deal pops up and I went huh and I clicked on it and I very quickly from looking at so many deal sized up that if this was in Houston, Texas\nThere was a no brainer and they would sell for a lot more than the price was on this a posting that I saw\nAnd so yeah I asked my wife what do you think about buying the steel out of town and we've got a business excuse to go fly up there a couple of times a year and see all those friends that we left behind Twenty years ago when we came back to Houston\nThat she sent out whatever you want to do if you want to manage it I said but it means that I've never had to do this but I'm probably gonna be gone at least one night a month going up there just to make sure things still running right\nShe said asked by our our two girls were out of the house by this time and we just have one kid left there so things are manageable if you think tried to it so we ended up doing it um I went to my three a kennel largest investors that have long term vision and I said guys this little bit of a flyer but boy you back you know the steel and they were all in\nAnd we did the deal it's been phenomenal the ah we bonded since August of last year we're on pace to return Nineteen percent cash on cash and our first year of ownership Brennan interest only period\nYeah ah we bonded such August of last year\nWe're on pace to return Nineteen percent cash on cash at our first year of ownership ... period so things are\nObviously cash along really well but it's a fifty five and over high you'll play a property not not a a value play that we're having to fix up\nAnd we kept St management group in fact it was a it was run and we're really well so I saw no reason to shake things up up there we put it a little bit of cap acts and we're making it even more efficient so that when the principal kicks at our cash on cash probably won't have to do\nWill just a cover it with our increased rats that we're getting out of this place\nSo uh that's a great place I was actually up there about\nThree weeks ago I guess and they really wanted one of my investors who was from Battle Creek Michigan founded the lifestyles on the radio show and came down here to invest they wanted him at the Detroit road show that you guys had\nThree weeks ago and he couldn't be there so I got to go up and be surrogate and help out and really kind of tell his story and how we met down here and now we're investing in other markets up there and I got to tell you a J. B. David Durham\nHad a phenomenal presentation and not only walking around Detroit we were staying downtown walking the streets at ten thirty at night from a restaurant that we went out to the night before the event and\nI went into Detroit with a bad attitude and walked away completely changed they've got a lot of metrics that look really good up there\nAnd I think they are probably a pretty well poised to to have some great things going on and we have members as as you said that found the show uh most of them came down to Dallas and so it was the closest place to fly into her drive to\nAnd I did their their studies they invested in some deals there and now they're doing deals in and around Detroit Michigan\nI'm willing to take that off places we're gonna take a break right there Scott when we come back we'll finish up on Detroit and the other national stuff you've been working on right back to Scott in offering the Dell ones radio\n[noise] usually\nDoing to the radio you know
