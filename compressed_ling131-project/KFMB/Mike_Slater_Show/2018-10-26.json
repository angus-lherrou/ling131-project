there's a vote the community to train them\nSo what's your co CERN what do you think would happen to this area if why did not pass\nBoy it's pretty clear to us there was one project that basically precipitated this\nAnd it was between seven and a thousand homes on agricultural land next to this and a river\nThat the planning staff in oceanside\nStrongly recommend that opposition truth and the ocean's shy planning commission voted against it project but three individuals out in the city council and that's all that to a certain oh let's go forward with it so\nIt's moving forward in the process and it was a clear indication just that they were going to give up agricultural land that identity development\nIs this and that structure there is this north river farms that you're talking about\nThe project I'm OK so much out what do you make of that concern that the the yes on why for a\nWhile I understand that that is their concern in the north river red project has sort of triggered a lot of conversations and concerns about what's going to happen to that land to have out there I think the fact that that farmers can no longer farm land or find ranchers to rent it brings up what is the future of that land and why they should be you know a conversation\nI guess are concerned as a farmer out there is if the dentist smart neck and his group is concerned about that project\nWe wish that this initiative focused on that project and didn't come out and blanket you know it's a hundred acres at blankets thirty five hundred acres with this sort of hand coughing\nSo that becomes are concerned that now that group is basically out there saying what this one farmer wants to do is put seven hundred to a thousand homes on their farm\nThey're basically saying our family wants to do the same and all these other farming family wants to do the same and where in bed with developers and we're all you know if this goes through all we're all going to go through and that's not true and I think\nYou know again if we could focus on one project which it's not going forward it's in that process that we talked about going through city council and planning meetings and you know it's it's not a done deal um again\nWe're just sort of being penalize for a concern about one project and we wish that Mr Martin neck and his group but the focus this measure on that project what are you saying that versus what does that are that dentist but\n... ... from the city council that are ready to charm Eric oh Joanne yogurt to identity development\nChange the whole process indoor affect the the farmers that currently doing this or\nThat planning commission and a ... a a building apartment did they don't support the high density is out more of a hill\nAnd those three members of the city council isn't that something that is their identity\nDevelopment and felt more hills and you know they obviously have have something else yelling out they're not listening to the taxpayers and the city\nI guess I'm going to show this present I guess my mom let me see what Michel ... what do you make of that\n[noise] well I mean I I you when you talk to Laurie when you talk to a dentist when you talk to these people who actually live on two and a half acre estates in that area I I understand their concerns um\nBut again the city council is elected if we have concerns about that area than let's visit the general plan I think that there's processes here where everyone to be coming together and figuring out the solution that benefits the farmers the neighbors the city everyone to basically put a voter initiative\nAnd lock in an antiquated general plan that like I said for any changes that we have to make have to go to a vote of the people\nTo ensure their views from their two and a half acre lots or to lock us into farming\nPractices that are a hundred years old versus modern farming the way farming has going does not preserve agriculture it preserves basically what's going to become fallow land or a two and a half acre estate area out there it preserves\nTheir property rights on two and a half acres it doesn't preserve our property rights to farm\nIn the way the industry is heading or what we need to do to stay in business on his route and all of the issues that we're faced with making that argument that in the end you actually hurting farming\n[noise] yeah that's the you know that's not true\nThat farmers and do anything under the prison general plan related agriculture and promoting farming they can build the bars they can build a processing centers that can carry on agriculture so they have all the property rights\nThat are designated under the law and which I support it we shouldn't\nChange the general plan a judge for a handful of people who want to develop\nAnd our opponents are opponents have been subsidized or been a paid over half a million dollars by that developer who wants to go the project so it looks like the development community is getting a special treat but\nUh compared to everybody else in the community\nThat farmers don't build Barnes anymore Barnes we use that fifty or a hundred years ago we need modern facilities for hydroponic and for processing and things that are much they look much different today than they did before\nAnd so they'll give you an alarm is they're trying to get our message out there asking people not to lock us into an antiquated general plan but to leave us the flexibility\nTo be able to do what we need to do five ten years Twenty years from now and not having to go to a vote of the people each time farming looks a little different or something different is needed to keep us in business and I think that's\nThe hard message what are they are\nYou're locking them in the lock in the agriculture and making it harder for them to actually say is\nNot true they can do those things under a measure why are all day\nSince you're locking them in the lock in the agriculture and making it harder for them to actually say that\nIt's not true they can do those things under a measure why are all that it was applied for the same as they do it out so long as it goes out of bullets agriculture they could do it it's allowed under the weight of\nAgriculture via the general plan that's antiquated otherwise under measure why we go to a vote of the people\nWhich ran on voters' rights and it's just difficult jobs back and everybody in this up in the city of ocean side has a right to vote what we do on our property versus a vote in the proper people on the city council planning commission to get where the city needs\nTo be on that point that is why not like I mentioned the war why not focus your concern on these three council members who you think are not voting according to the majority of people which may not be true right they might be voting according to the majority of people just not what you want but why not go out to the city council members want to change the whole plant the whole process\n... problems for some time in oceanside as ours listening to people that they've been heavily influenced by the development community built spend more time in their offices where developers than they do going out to the neighborhood\nSo do you think that that don't you think it's better to work focus on them and getting them out of office put what did you want in their office as opposed to change how we change the zoning which meant\nWell dish it worked so well in Ventura County is that people in Ventura County renewed or another Thirty years it's been in effect for Twenty years so this is a better product\nThat much like\nYou said if you speak to the farmers in Ventura County they're going to tell you a very different that's actually it's an example of why the farmers don't want this that people just keep voting it in because they don't know any different and again they don't understand the struggles of the farmers and in the meantime if you go to the farming community I mean\nGo talk to the farm bureau the farm bureau opposes measure why it can't imagine putting farmers issues to a ballot box to a majority of the\nThe people that don't understand agriculture Ventura farmers are devastated by this property values their crops limitations of the things that we're we're voicing concerns on our the Ventura farmers concerns pretending to say it's so successful because the people just keep voting it in\nWell that's that's actually are concerned people vote in\nWhen you say say and agriculture save well sure they're going to check that box but if you really I'm not sure how it's affecting your farmers\nGo ahead and then it will give it does you got that voters are ignorant and that's just not true very very\nHard to understand farming just like I don't know how to run a radio show so I don't want to vote on how you are have to run your radio show\nBut I Know how to farm and I don't think the average citizen as ignorant I just don't think they're educated on what it takes to be a farmer\nToday in stay in the last word yeah forty five seconds ... go ahead\nSmall farmers in itself oh it was the agriculture area strongly support measure why it's because they see that they want to maintain agriculture and the way of doing it is to have something where\nA small group of city council people who are influenced by developers don't have the final say so\nThat it isn't always lawyer is Alice the owner that's not farming as a business they're farming it as a side to their career or in their retirement there's that I think the confusion with the yes you started off by saying they both say say fine if you want to say the two and a half acre estate home like Denis says who also happens to grow an acre to of trees\nIn their face that's a different farmer than saving a commercial farmer like ourselves who's out there growing our crop to run a business and pay the bills and pay the market along\nThe ... I don't even live on farms most of the county has made up of small farms and you'll find that small farmers out very creative and they want to maintain the agriculture they don't want high density development on agricultural land of the citizens want\nGotta go Dennis ... is a no online oceanside shows a no and Dennis is yes okay I feel good I feel good Michele Dunne is thank you both very much very appreciative of that I came here knowing nothing you know and feel good about\nMichele Dunne is thank you both a slate of sleuth is next to Jim sure about what we got the headlines her\nAttorney general Jeff Sessions says he doesn't know why pipe bombs were sent a prominent Democrats and CNN but says a Florida Man charged in the case quote appears to be a partisan sessions and other law enforcement officials are declining to speculate on whether the current divided political climate in America\nIn President Trump's rhetoric in bowling the man man is a registered Republican and ardent Trump supporter who pushed far right conspiracy theories on line\nA federal prosecutor says the shooting at a Kentucky grocery store that left two people dead is being investigated as a possible hate crime fifty one year old Gregory Bush has been charged with murder and other crimes in the fatal shooting of to shoppers at a Kroger shore on Wednesday both victims were black Bush is why\nYou're never more than Fifteen minutes away from the top stories of the day on the Mike Slater show am seven sixty talked in breaking news\nAm seven sixty KF MB\nHey I'm can't hardly a phony partners in power but still or solar and I'm a conservative\nOn Michael powers also a partner at sun bar by sellers solar and I'm a liberal and I'm Brian ... the third partner and as an engineer I'm politically somewhere in the middle despite our political differences the three of us are celebrating Twenty years of working together providing solar to San Diego homeowners held lower their electric bills like us our customers have political\nViews that are all over the map but they share the same goal not giving their money to the power company every month with zero return\nThe point is going solar is a smart financial investment regardless of your\nPolitics pays can't hardly chime in and all you conservatives out there going solar gives you a free market choice and it's one of the best investments you can make\nAnd Michael powers you're reminding liberals that besides helping you save money clean solar energy can help save the planet to to whatever your politics solar is one of the smartest investments you'll ever make I'm Brian Graham's son powered by solar solar along with my partners and Harley and Michael powers inviting you to check out solar for your home or business seller solar dot net seller solar dot net", "show_name": "Mike Slater Show", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "26"}
