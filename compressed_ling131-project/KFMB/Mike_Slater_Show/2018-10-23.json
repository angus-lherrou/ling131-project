voted for it before I voted against it right or or what David Oliver as in the city council had one of his proposals that came up lately and it was his proposal when he voted it down it happens it's politics it's weird\nBut it happens so on the short term rental deal this was the decision made\nBy the council majority of the council back in July to limit short term rentals like air being be and so forth in the city of San Diego there is also money to be paid to the city you know what kind of like license fees is kind of thing more regulations and with the best of intentions and worries that\nTurned out to a there wasn't a good day for Lori on this issue because she felt she decided to dissent so in the eight to one vote she was the one with dissent mess because she said I Want\nThe voters to decide but Scott Sherman is in the middle of all that kinda stuff while loving every mode of how many how much time left on your term on the council Scott German\nSeven hundred and Ninety four days buddy and how many hours I haven't got\nThat if you're just you're enjoying every moment of every more so when you are kind of the happy warrior even when it's not a good day you find a way because you've been in the real business world you have some sanity in the middle of ... so what happens a lot of people voting I mean did you vote for it before you didn't know you didn't vote for July remember that right\nYeah no I didn't vote for it I thought it was a a big town government overreach and restricting private property rights so sponsored the a referendum out here on came before us yesterday on Capitol voted to wander ascendant\nSo was this because I Know ... one day and then I agree to disagree with her on those things I Believe in private property rights but uh I understand some of the challenges in her district there but\nUh what was the big thinking for those who did change their vote and become part of the eight majority saying let's scrap it because if it went to a public both parents being besides all those entities would come in and spend a ton of money and probably still it would it would probably have the same result where are they just pulled the plug on a yesterday right is that where the farewell\n... will be coup years oh no chance for any kind of regulation waiting for a vote to happen and quite frankly I think we've probably seen the calls where the polls show that the majority of people believe in ... it's a lot of\nPeople who are really screaming about ... is a beach community people wear\nShort term vacation rentals have been allowed forever so I think we saw the writing on the wall I\nReally like to see some kind of compromise get on the book I think will be\nWell a compromise is this is the question you've got a lot of factions are at city hall I mean you're not trying to run for something else at the end of your tournament believe you're going to go back to the real world which I think is healthy\nLaid increasing use that

is we've we found some are\nUnder the back seat the more the more ... ballots right near where you go and what your chance to win coming up one of the more interesting things going on with San Diego people in the next few weeks\nIs what's happening with my friend Robert dealer rent those 'cause he just decided to be raised around mid December so to hop in his airplane and fly from the north pole to the south pole or the south pole to they're not well I mean it could be a lot of different things\nBut he's been working on this for a long time you've done something similar in in recent years sets of records and he joins us in Studio right here watch as much as I Am a guy who loves flying and just taking flying lessons everything else it seems like a way to get a really bad headache so what's motivating and\nYou know there are a lot of things motivating me Mark I'm one of them is that it's an opportunity to connect the south pole to the north pole and everybody in between and it really is a global peace mission if you look at it\nAnd detailed because at the north and south poles there's never been more the environment is fully protected and scientific research is a priority so what grade are way to draw some positive attention you know into people's lives especially at a time when when the world is becoming polarized mhm\n[noise] and one of the things you do you call this kind of a citizen of the world thing I'm idealistic Sherman you wrote the book about the ... the flight of passion and the dream within ... pilot Robert dealer industry can find a at a website or on the Amazon\nDot com but you've always had a sense of adventure and I'm actually living that a little bit they decided to take flying lessons starting last last January and and being on the role for that that still\nMystified as even some of the family ... ... you're doing what\nWell because if I don't do it I mean they're not going to do it and they said you're kind of it in the same mode you've just taken this beyond and you're not going to be going poll to poll without any sleep right so there was a U.S some stops there's some good will that will happen along the way which is kind of an aviation tradition we've seen that with others over the years to through history right\nYeah the thing that's interesting is that on January first is one of the longest days of the year and warm is at the south pole but it's also one of the shortest in darkest days at the north pole so it's in my interest to go very slowly as I head north bound and\nMy intention is to stop at um different locations lecture on the trip lecture on world peace and there's a group of\nPeople called uh the explorers club I hopped up and some of their locations as well it's a great\nGroup and a lot of significant the hero types and ... and so forth and been in the mix right on that show south pole the north pole right track and it'll take you how long once you start\nWell you could do the trip and about two and a half weeks if you uh had very little sleep then decided to go\nAnd ah it'll take you how long once you start well you can do the trip and about\nTwo and a half weeks if you uh had very little sleep then decided to go as quickly as you could but I'm going to do it in about three plus months I'd say ... expected a return date is march fifteenth of ...\nSo the the longest stretch might be how long\nWell I can tell you exactly it's four thousand four hundred and fifty seven nautical miles\nAnd that's going to be from the tip of Chile which is the terrain us all the way down to the south pole will turn around cross over the poll a second time just to confirm we have it for the speed and distance records were setting now and then had directly back and pray to God that the winds and the weather continue to be favorable\nAnd you've got the citizens of the world aircraft as your modified Nineteen eighty three gulfstream turbine commander nine hundred that has been specially outfitted I've seen this thing over and you're hanger and\nIt it's just I mean it's pretty phenomenal you got more stuff in there as you should have if you're doing this kind of thing that people might call crazy softball the north pole property other at this\nYou know the citizen the world is one sexy plane and it's very very well outfitted with all the latest aviation safety and technology of the day but you know ... year is new so it's a little bit risky just in that regard because when you introduced that many changes to an aircraft\nAnd you know you have problems and the first ten percent of their life or in the last ten percent\nAnd you're not exactly nearby or you know some fixed base operating facility where you can just pop in gas up and\nWell that's the heart sauce [laughter] that's one of the jokes that if something goes wrong with the work that these people are are done on it I tell them that they should be ready to take a dog sled through the south pole to come get me out of trouble so what do you say people\nSay property of rent so this is nuts why would you do the street sets of records when it spreads some world peace if you do this right I mean that was done by the guilt herds when they took their ah their flight to South America back after Lindbergh where the plane on the air and Space Museum it's you know I'm ... it's\nBecause it does seem dangerous right people said but it isn't that that's life isn't everything's dangerous\nYeah there's certainly a lot of risk in this but you know what I Believe the risk is worth it one you know there's this world peace mission there's the aviation safety and technology mission it's a one hell of a good time to to be flying around to different countries meeting new people operating the aircraft experiencing nature\nUm it's also what I could come up with as the most impossibly big dream and\nYou know short of leaving the atmosphere\nOr the south pole to the north pole is probably the most ambitious trip that you could take ...\nYeah well and when you did this similar thing a shorter flights a few years ago and what was the most harrowing moment we got a short time here but what was the moment we thought maybe there is one of the best idea or does it happened\nIt happened about five different times quite honestly but the the most challenging was fourteen thousand feet over the Strait of Malacca mhm I lost a little pressure the engine sales\nAnd I had to dead sticker coast Nineteen point six nautical miles over the Strait of Malacca over the dense jungle is the Kuala Lumpur into Kuala Lumpur international too\nAnd there was oil spraying on Fifteen hundred degree exhaust overloaded with six hundred extra pounds of a\nHigh octane ... fuel and the cabin with me and you know scared to death while\nI'm Robert dealer rent a set his book if you want to check that out of this fascinates clubs and pilot light of passion and he's doing the south pole to the north pole starting\nIn

going to be doing and you can follow along check it out what's the best website portal for people you got a few of them here what's the best\nThe best one is WWW poll peel alley to Tio poll one more

with me on a ride when I get back on about that yes or be fantastic ... come by seven sixty talk and breaking news hey if you file your tax return is a sole proprietor you're paying too much in taxes you have no asset protection you risk an IRS audit\nBut have a nice day I mean that's that you got to know how to do this and why a financial group knows how to do this for you they designed the legal intact strategies of your personal and business lives prepare your returns and the legal strategies you need all in one office my friend Sam ... who was an attorney and CPA is the president a lawyer financial group\nSalmon as professionals have years of experience developing the right legal and tax strategies to help you cut your taxes protect your assets to keep more for retirement that's exactly what they do it for me so don't wait 'til tax time\nCall my friends had loyal financial group for your free consultation\nUm\nIs the bigger thing for me and I understand the sensitivity and this this whole thing that you hear from those than the African American community they'll say well you know just walking while black and some people take off your suspect\nBut if somebody was there and actually working threatening and who knows what's going through her head in the description but the biggest so there's all of that and the racial insensitivity and everything else and fine have conversations\nBut we're down to the point now that if you have something let's say you have um somebody Rob a bank which is to end that tends to be what they do was the old bank robber Willie Sutton why'd you Rob banks because that's where the money is still people show up and they were all banks\nIn a while or a convenience stores right so\nThe convenience store you and banks to you have the uh the white church so they can tell how tall you are going on whatever she can't say if somebody I guess I'm a rhetorical you can't say that if a man or woman comes in and Rob something you're giving a description you can't describe if there\nWhile I guess you can't if they're white but if they're\nAfrican American if there are any other a race creed color whatever you can if you know what you can include\nThat no this is how bizarre it's gotten I guess you just have to say somebody came in and robbed the bank or whatever because we go beyond that you're going to offend somebody well he or she was this poll well you've offended the people who don't have altitude the altitude deprived community\nCommunity was basically what it will be\nJust a few years ago one of the local TV stations wasn't this one it wasn't 'til you aside but then there was somebody else a they they said that there is something where there was somebody was wanted for a crime and they said police are looking for six foot two man\nAnd I couldn't stop laughing it's like well that narrows it down but I guess maybe that makes some of the point of the sensitivity over this story but one of the point now where ah yeah we can say merry Christmas again but everything else is suspect but it gets it everywhere so we're told I say I say merry Christmas even on a day like today is the twenty third October\nNo deer used how dare you still have a good name that is Thanksgiving let me be the first to wish you a merry Christmas yeah well he was a second because he said so yesterday I did well I'm just in a festive holiday mood\nPut a bomb that little bill just building anyway I'm just watch it I I'm just concerned we're not going to be able to report when you do have a substance is just the specific I just getting educated\nUm when you have something that happens and you are you say hey there's somebody let's say there's eight per hanging out outside the uh the the elementary school and the ... there every day with a cell phone whatever you can't\nDescribe that individual unless they're white Caucasian because everything else to say I just I don't know where that goes\n\nThen there's this um I'm sure she was about three weeks ago so the whole issue of race and it was happening with the Caribbean and all these other stories right like clockwork right up to the election and\nEarly voting has been going on for what two weeks\nSo here are some of the brilliant people on the viewer Dr joy ... her doctor Whoopi Goldberg gold presided over whatever that\nIs and this was um this is their latest little rendezvous I'm Talking about where we are as a nation\nHe also blames the town man on a Democrat and now\nI is it straight up their mind going I mean why why did he start putting a middle Easterners and they all are you walking he well\nKnow why he makes everything he'll tell you is Osama bin Laden is march ...\nAbout everything I mean you look at it and adjust and I was watching report on good morning America this morning and it's heartbreaking not gotten into the states\nAnd there was a young girl that collapse in his arms from heat exhaustion so I always approached this from that humanity first\nAt any human being and that's how in the ... ... everyone in this room is an immigrant yes somewhere\nWhich is part of my problem with the way some of the things we all live in the end and nation of immigrants obviously yes through proper\nLegal channels my problem right now going forward it I thought a lot of time in town halls across the country and let me tell you even going back out again there was this rumor on the Internet of an international superhighway immigrants that we're going to come through America up through a on a Canada and that was something that literally my father\nHad to say that's not happening it's not happening and so when you see these images conservative fever dream and I guess in mid term elections because this is exactly what conservatives think people on the last one that\nHappening to this country I'm not saying I\nThink refugees thing not accept legal immigration what what a lot of people want to watch the say no one on the table is the one open waters and no consequences mhm\nThere was more than we have more believe we have more security more of the ladies on the view\nI Wish that the then the people on the right to tell the truth about what's really happening and immigration because the largest number of I'm Out here because we have not no no no I think people in the right idea right here on the right but I'm not talking about you for you and I don't\nThink I well I I'm more extreme on that issue then I think than I think people realize I come from a border state and I think when you hear stories like that happening timely shot and killed by an immigrant who is in a a A N San Francisco which is one of the\n... states where you can go there now that\nThey acted angler and thanks very but let me just say that it's something you have American forty one percent of undocumented immigrants are from Asia\nFrom Asia a large majority of of a link to undocumented immigrants from Sweden there from\nCanada they are ... and I will enable on the right point that out of that always about brown and black\nProblem is the politics out this and this that this connecting flight that does help President Trump does when he campaigned on he's been consistent you know where he is on immigration Democrats have got to figure out what their ...\nI don't know you find in right now I Know is that\nThese people are not coming to take your Social Security or Medicare and the Republican [laughter]\nI still got some a tiki torches and go out on storm out on the streets of New York that's the\nLevel headed ... people on

I told the recipe and he laughed and laughed and laughed and walked away laughing and this was like and then turn around the corner I just got here of laughing at all and that was it via to hang out and bought yesterday but it was real real nice so I brought them in front to try and that's where I get it was oh pretty good\nThing going around a than Arizona they pulled the original Twitter eight Tucson six year old invited thirty two of his classmates to a pizza party for his birthday over the weekend\nAnd no one showed up wow All right so they have a picture that his parents took up him sitting and basically Chuck E. cheese giant table with a plate and an African on every chair and for pizza's in front of them\nAre on the table Harper and just the six year old sitting there with a sad face looking or none of\nThe none of the kids from ... not a single one none of them drove nope no one kid so this is why I think this is fake uh\nThis this happened like a couple of years ago I remember seeing a couple of these and without fail and here it is here Phoenix Suns how 'bout you get a couple of times our game coming up this weekend little boy and all the sports teams at all these celebrities like the rock\nWill be like hey a a trolley here knowing what your birthday party don't worry man here shout out to you do that and you get all these celebrities coming out there and lifting up the little\nSix year old who didn't have anyone come to his party fake\nWhy would parents if this really happened it was a this is a careful how you guys are doing this what I thought you know I I I could see right okay I was saying is dangerous game I've got a different ... okay go ahead ... if this really did happen I met this does happen other kids who have birthday parties and no shows up to what\nIn their right mind would stage the child to sit on the\nChair with all the pizza is an empty plate in front of them and say hey kid I was really sad and it didn't look at the camera and then put that picture on life why would you do that if we're not to try to get free tickets to the Phoenix Suns game\nAnd other benefits Eric ... well it got kind of goes along with that same losses\nJust probably a total ... ... miles his point was this gets probably a big loser in all I Would go to is totally what are the game but mine that's inappropriate sure there's a six year old okay cut out of Iowa but I'll get it probably is ... it's like yeah you know the guy\nHow long have you with all along the same lines as the parents would they do that my theory is if that's real than the parents suck\nDon't really\n... the kids will always go to a party kids will show up where there's candy where there's cake where their soda\nSo there's no problem that a gene Chuck E. cheese is so long it's gonna be a kid is there the parents suck who's the kids' parents are all the other parents and all this kid's parents must suck yeah and then I other parents want to round them oh I see\nI I kind of and I can go off of that too and say that really when you're sick really before you're like a teenager you don't really have for it and it's like your parents friends you know I just want to hang out with yes so everyone hates these parents\nThat insurgents are unbearable sorrow not going to do\nSix yeah so they've been through five previous birthday parties and the ... [laughter] right [laughter] right\n[laughter] already the school year they've been ... birthday parties and they're like gosh these Charlie's parents\nYeah last year they were terrible yeah and what I mean\nBut now they're yours and they want us now by the U.S this party huh and\nI and so I think it's a fake give it a day and uh let's see if it turned out to be [noise]\nUm [noise] uh this is the fun sentence in political because we're talking about\nImmigration and nationalism that Trump said the other day yesterday to take ... or is that all those this is political although Sweden is known for its commitment to child welfare\nIs failing to extend those same protections to its immigrant population\nBecause what are they talking about and so the sweeter known for its commitment to child welfare\nFailing to extend those same child welfare welfare protections to its immigrant population what are they talking about you know the articles about child marriages in Sweden child arranged marriages Sweden is failing to protect children from arranged\nMarriages wise the Swedish government not stopping this because they don't want to be seen as\nCulturally insensitive the sweetest ... health and Human Services department released a pamphlet called information for one who is married to a child that parents\nThere's one your theory that\nInformation to for one who's married to a child with a nice helpful guy to men who are married to underage girls and helping them navigate the sweetest welfare system that's a great health and nowhere in the ... does it say it's illegal to have sex with an underage girl which in Sweden is under the age of Fifteen but it does say that it's\nInappropriate isn't diversity awesome\nThis is why I really bring this up Sweden Denmark we think of them is one of the same relatively similar places right next to each other Sweden has taken the clearly very soft approach to immigration a and for the sake of case study Democrat or Denmark has taken the heart\nSweden has taken the clearly very soft approach to immigration a and for the sake of case study Democrat or Denmark has taken the hard line approach towards immigration rights a sweet and very come on in your married did multiple little girls that sign here's a pamphlet\nDenmark is taking a much harder line so this is the New York times article ah\nTalking about Denmark starting at the age of one ghetto children they're called the immigrant children who live in these immigrant ghettos right ghetto children must be separated from their families for at least twenty five hours a week not including nap time for mandatory instruction in Danish values\nIncluding the traditions of Christmas and Easter and the Danish language noncompliance could result in a stoppage of welfare payments as New York times\nDenmark currently has twenty two proposals in front of their Congress a regret regarding immigration is one of them is a it would double punishment for a crime if it's committed in any twenty five\nImmigrant ghettos right so any particular areas of the city were immigrants hang out or if you commit a crime within that area of the crime is automatically doubled the penalties double\nAnother would put a four year prison sentence on immigrant parents who forced their kids to go back to their country of origin or which they call re education trips to the point here is an ally oftentimes that happened to go back to the Muslim countries so that you can get married\nTo your child bride and then come back right I'm to the point here is the reason they were passes laws if you want to live in Denmark you live in Denmark\nI you know you'll go back and forth you don't live here you say hearing integrate here\n\nNow some of these things and then it got to go on but we got to take a break fears of uh some of these Denmark things seemed like a little much and this was never anything that was necessary in America because immigrants here always wanted to assimilate\n\nCheck out his latest from another New York times article about Denmark Johnny Christians in based out in silver west screwed retired blanket bank employee always thought of himself as sympathetic to people fleeing war and welcoming immigrants but\nAfter more than thirty six thousand mostly Muslim asylum seekers poured into Denmark over the last two years Mr Christians in sixty five said quote I become a racist\n[laughter] oh that's an I become a races now so my point of bring this up as it's all very\nVery broken and with sweet and is doing is wrong and no doubt about that and what that mark is doing is probably missing the mark a little bit but at least ... Denmark is doing is based off of the reality that there are different cultures and it's based on the reality that immigrants should recognize that fact and assimilate accordingly to the country they're moving to\nWrite it's sort of like ... wife who not only wants Eric to vacuum the carpets\nBut wants them to want to vacuum the carpets and thing we don't have carpets [laughter] that's right [laughter] immigrants should not only assimilate they should want to assimilate\n\nSo we're gonna have an interesting ah they get an interesting case study here Sweden Denmark right next to each other similar cultures are taking very very different approaches to immigration and we'll see what a hundred and sixty K.

suspected terrorists from coming into our country every day so it's just inconceivable\nThat there would not be individuals or from the middle east as a part of this growing the care of it and with the president's determined to do is put the safety and security the American people first and I know the president will be addressing this in the coming days about ways we need to close the loop holes\nThat human traffickers and other dangerous individuals used to entice vulnerable families to make a long and dangerous truck norms by\nThere are errors\nWhat I can say to you is\n\nIt\n... the leaders in the United states very users\nLet me just say let me just as\nI spoke with border patrol this morning\nI spoke to him last savings that I spoke to him the day before speak to them all the time [noise] and they say and you know this as well as anybody\nOver the course of the year over the course of a number of years they've intercepted many people [noise]\nThey've intercepted ISIS they've intercepted all sorts of paper [noise]\nThey've intercepted good ones bad ones have intercepted wonderful people for the middle east and they've intercepted bad ones they've intercepted wonderful people from South America\nCentral parts\nFor theirselves they've intercepted a lot of different people but among the people they've intercepted\nAre people from the middle east\nSo you can't be surprised when you hear if you've heard that before it happens all the time and I spoke to literally last night I spoke to another one the ... very good relationship with border patrol and I ...\nAnd they say happens all the time from the middle east but it's not even saying bad or good\nWhat some real bad ones [noise] but it'll be interesting during the ...\nIt was all the time from the middle east but it's not even saying bad or good\nThe real bad ones but it'll be interesting is they could very well be [noise]\nThere's no proof of anything [laughter] like they could very well be if you look at what that\nWas building you know they were talking about five or six thousand people in pretty good at estimating crowd size as you've probably officially [laughter] to get a little bit off the real number last night as an example [noise] that was a record setting self what [laughter]\nWill tell you let me just say that I really I Believe that that was pretty ... pretty impressed\nBy any standard and these are great people and to and by the way you vote\nA vote is a\nAnd this could be bad or indifferent for Democrats or Republicans but the amounts\nIs at a level that they've never seen before so I I like the Trump finally ended up\nLet's talk about Trump's or the from doctor this is the foreign policy of Trump no doubt about it uh so the other day this is in the news now could yesterday at the tigers rallies that\nI'm I'm a nationalist so everyone in the leftist fanning outrage all what do you judge coated dog whistles remember if you hear the dog whistle\nEric [noise]\nThat means your the dog remember when the dog whistle was\nYou were a nationalist\nWhat does the now no no in the sense that\nThat was the secret code\nThat that meant that you were a nationalist ... well it seems that it's it's come full circle you know a national ... did they painted it to be this this crazy thing and now Trump's like oh yeah\nI Am yeah national so he's kind of flipping into on its head yeah that's what he said in his speeches that got use it right God use it take it\nWould you take it back right you argue that use the term\nSo these are to this press conference he was asked about it a few times and he's doubling down on as they should um [noise] this is what he said at the un speech ... during the cabinet hearing so I never got any attention I'm married this line of science for the point I'm\nThe only long term solution to the migration crisis is to help people build more hopeful futures and their home countries\nMake their country's great again we\nWill never surrender American sovereignty to an unelected unaccountable global bureaucracy saying this directly to the face of the unelected unaccountable ... America is governed by Americans\nWe reject the ideology of globalism and we embrace the doctrine of patriotism so this was a ... a month ago almost exactly a month ago they said that at the un and and nothing's changed the speech that Ted Cruz's rally yesterday nothing at all the same thing same message\nOn the line we use earlier uh this is the one by one of the fundamental differences between global lists and nationalist global is saying that the way to improve America\nIs to improve other countries and if we improve all the other countries and that that's better for us I call a rising tide rises also raises ships\nNationalist things that the way to improve other countries is to improve America I Believe that\nWhen we're stronger when we're more free one more and more prosperous\nThe rest of the world is better off we are of course to for the rest of the world it proves to\nA couple of the things from his un speech\nA departure made headlines because we live in a ridiculous media culture is he said one sentence and and uh there was some chuckles and the and the audience when the general assembly right and left out of the headlines like Trump gets laughed at that U.N General assembly\nHere's what he said he said in less than two years my administration\nHas accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country\nAnd they laughed at him\nWhat President wanted to say that I don't [laughter]\nWhat what would it less than two years my minister Asian as accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country who would not\nSay that let a lot of course not all that stuff that you would laugh at what is it what President we got there and say you know and after two years\nWho would not say that but a lot of course not all it's something you would laugh at ... warns that what President we got there and say you know and after two years\nWe really haven't done much of anything [laughter]\nNot really a whole lot I've been a huge disappointment in so many ways I just like that's not going to have it they didn't say more than he didn't they weigh more than any other president is that we've accomplished more than almost any administration at the perfectly fine sentence\nHe talked about Venezuela as un speech he said not long ago Venezuela's one of the richest countries on earth\nToday socialism is bankrupted the oil rich nation and driven it's people in the abject poverty true\nHe said all nations in the world should resist socialism and the misery that it brings to every one he called out Russia and the speech\nHe said reliance on a single foreign supplier of energy can leave a nation vulnerable to extortion and intimidation this is why we congratulate European states such as Poland\nFor leading the construction of a Baltic pipelines that nations are not dependent on Russia to meet their energy needs Germany will become totally dependent on Russian energy if it does not immediately changed course\nBy either is speaking out against Russia hey rest of the world stop buying all your energy from Russia yet he's still considered to be a Russian stew or something\n\nSo these are all fit into the Trump Doctrine here back to nationalism along we\nHaven't been around and we believe is that isn't a lot of time but I think it's worth once a month reminder\nBecause it makes sense of ... old enough to make sense if he realizes the left the media they take Trump's literally but not seriously as why they laugh at him all the time uh and they still think he's like a clown in the White House Trump supporters and I think most Americans take Trump's seriously but not literally\n\nSo when he says for instance uh what was the one of the opening lines and then when he announced his campaign right that Mexico they're sending us their worst from\nThe left they take that literally like\nLike the Mexican government is rounding up the worst people in Mexico and shipping them here purpose or either take it literally\nBut not seriously I think conservatives in in terms of ... and other people they take it seriously but not necessarily literally right we're like yeah you know what we should have more control over our border and the type of people that we are letting into America so that we can have better assimilation in a more United country right like that's a serious interpretation of what Trump is talking about\n\nAnd if you understand that and I know you do then makes sense why the left freaks out all the time and the media freaks out all the time 'cause they can literally but I seriously\nI think we are and what should take them seriously but not necessarily literally so would this nationalism thing I Know and you know what nationalism literally means like an academic land there's entire college courses based off of solely this concept of nationalism\nAnd there is that what I'm really I'm not going to this five types of nationalism having a bore you with all this uh but this is something that's been very well thought out if you want to dumb down to the very very simple concept\nTechnically patriotism is love of your country nationalism is love of your country and the hatred of other countries and people that's technically kind of a girl to boil down into one little thing\nBut that's not the only definition and that's not even a super Farah definition and that's how I feel\n\nWhat I think of nationalism I think of it as more of a synonym for patriotism\n\nSo the question is do you think Donald Trump truth genuine question do you think Donald Trump is a national is like more like George Washington\nOr more like an Adolf Hitler I think Trump is more of a George Washington type nationalist than Adolf Hitler\nBut a lot of what's going to frame it as if he's a new Hitler and that's why this is also just silly game\n\nThere's also a big difference between I think my country is better than yours so we're going to take you over\nWhich is an old nationalist of mine said we think what you were better than you so we're going to come and invade you and take you over and make you our country now\nA big difference between that and we think our country has the best and soda you obviously\nSo if you want to come in here you have to do it legally in order I clearly seven thousand people from Honduras you think our country is best soda way\nAnd if you want to come here we have to do it in a in a in a more orderly way if you want to come out but\n\nThe national isn't that I I think of the most is uh so we talked about last week with our common culture or we talked about a one thing in our culture today that unites us what is one thing I can only think of one actually miles thought of this when I can only think of one when you have five hundred channels and you got Netflix everyone watches what they want and\n... there's there's no even shallow there's no even shallow unifying cultural thing nothing you know unifies anymore on not only that it may be the super bowl maybe\nPrivate sports can't even really notice any more so the only thing I can think of as of miles came up with a Thanksgiving\nYeah 'cause everyone does that sound religious used to be religious thing but now ... used to be called a day of Thanksgiving appraise a a needs to be a day of fasting as opposed to a day of gluttony right [laughter] that's ... that's changed a little [laughter] right so\nThat's maybe the one thing that we all kind of do it can unite behind and and stores are closed right they do sort of are used to be [laughter] even that's less of a thing now but\nThat's the point where we can't even even other one written nothing that can you notice anymore which is why I think we need a more nationalist mindset and that's okay\n\nOne of hundreds seven sixty K.
