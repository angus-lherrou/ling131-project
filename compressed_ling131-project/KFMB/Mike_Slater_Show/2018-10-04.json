see this on an endless loop [noise]\nOut there saying is that we just saw that such terrible Oregon Schumer it's some of this was laugh out loud funny again they are assuming and they're probably correct\nThat most people don't know how this works most people don't know that there were hearings you out and do a man or woman on the street interview do they judge Kavanaugh do you think the chargers you think it should be heard and investigating sure they won't say you'd only just investigated again for the seven time\nHe was vetted it doesn't matter\nI feel you hear that a lot by the way many people on the street\nMost people would say well I feel that it should be like this and other people say well the ... so the facts are the facts Gavin Newsom who would like to be the next\nGovernor he was lieutenant governor has been lieutenant governor for years well a lot of the state has had a lot of problems under his watch and governor Jerry's\nRight but he's running these

going into the calculator on my phone when I started going\nWho's going to pay for that plays well election time though doesn't it so that's the very base if you will that Schumer and Feinstein our plane to Schumer say we were only given one copy to look at\nThe same kind of stuff they do on the Democrats' side do what they found the politics where this is my\nPeople hate politicians and people say well how some of the like Trump with all of his Trump Trump Trump said in his Dell the weirdest stuff or whatever how does he get elected because of what they knew\n\nLisa Murkowski the Republican in name only or from are from a Alaska says she's made no decision I'm Kevin off\nOh cure the street theater protesters are marching either they are they got the memo I thought that was gonna be more last weekend but they're waiting till today\nWas looking at some stuff out of Washington area looks at the beginning of a really really great resist whatever it is hey hey ho ho failing blanks you gotta go senators reviewing FBI report\nAs protesters marched in opposition if Kavanaugh is looking for those sci you shirts yeah there and there there there's the cabin dope or they've got some like the whole poster clever and wait to hear the chance yeah\nSo Jeff Flake or well he has covered because you've got an investigation\nBusy road for or against Kavanaugh when they started voting tomorrow and Susan Collins making sounds like maybe okay this appears to be a pretty thorough investigation meaning maybe she'll vote\nFor him [noise] Murkowski see the problem again with the Senate is that they're all like one hundred little fiefdom Z to say there's often but it bears repeating 'cause I think it's important what am I think it's important because it is it's a hundred\nDifferent little fiefdom ... opponent tapes named potent tapes\nAnd what do they do they love their moment where they can just be this star oh please tell us to think\nLiving up to your name which way what do you go to share some of your honesty Susan Collins pretty well I've got 'em all this over the cameras on animals there's over a little more\nBut they're not talking about the fact there are some Democrats Heidi Heitkamp up in the Dakotas I forget what you're Dakota yeah she's she's a Democrat who's in a more of a Trump friendly state\nShe could vote for cabinet that just a which Republicans are going to go to Joe Manchin of West Virginia same but I have a feeling mansion if he can win this this Senate race because he's up after six years or if it was an incomplete term I forgot how short\nAnyway he's one of those guys that I think at some point he wins again I think he becomes a Republican or goes independent at some point because um I think he's staying Democrat but keep an eye on the underside\nWhite House says are fully confident that Kavanaugh will be confirmed after receiving the FBI's report well we'll see they need fifty one votes\nAgain there's a lot of starring roles for next to this is on some of the senators you don't usually hear about are going to say I want my time time white\nHouse says we looked at it no evidence against Kavanaugh and again early signs of satisfaction from Republican swing votes weekends will be the final vote on the weekend right\nThey're starting in fact we have this little bit later on starting to see even like Don Lemon on CNN they're starting to be grudgingly accept\nThe fact that this is probably going to go down where Kavanaugh is confirmed\nWe'll see\nIt's up to the tip you talk right on top right now do the other thing they're doing they'd been boosting we're paying for this our tax dollars boosting six\nWhen I talk with James her some Newsmax dot com about all this coming up and ... there's some new things the

a tradition first of all we have a presumption of innocence but second of all\nWe don't believe witnesses on their face we only believe witnesses if they've been subjected to cross examination\nAnd if they've been core operated and that's the word we keep hearing so there was no crime operation for Christine afford and the Republicans very gingerly kept saying you know we respect her and\nShe's sympathetic and we believe she shared many of them said she's credible but as time passed and you know Rachel Mitchell the prosecutor questioner came out with a six page report\nAnd an ex boyfriend came out with an affidavit if centrally but statements under penalty of felony her her statements look inconsistent they look\nTo be a artificial and the at the end of the day anyone that looks objectively at her testimony a closely comes to the conclusion that it is not\nCredible it is not credible and certainly insufficient\nTo ruin a man's life which is what the Senate Democrats were trying to do and they're delay tactic has backfired on them because the delay allowed to all of these things to come out allowed the president to broadcast when his megaphone\nTo the public and then allowed this canary in the coal mine in North Dakota\nHeidi Heitkamp poll numbers to\nYeah she's a Democrat who's one of the senators who might lose their gig do Republican now she may who knows she may come over to the pro cabin outside now to this report so may mansion in West Virginia and sounds like Susan Collins is like sounding may be okay with this so maybe she's not going to lay out like\nSusan Collins is okay and I understand that Jeff Flake or what you know basically there's three people\nThe Republicans need to get too out of three that's played out ... and ... column reality seemed to head so they have it\nAnd run and hide camp and Joe Manchin or what a what they would prefer for the Republicans they have the votes so they have covered that they could jump on the bandwagon because otherwise their own party with\nYou know castigate them if they were deciding vote but it looks like they do have the votes but Heidi Heitkamp is down double digit I mean it's a real\nHuge drop in a very short time and the internal so the poll say that uh the reason his cabinet ... it's ... percent of the voters say it's Kavanaugh said this is\nThis is back firing big time on the Democratic party and it reminds me of the Wellstone memorial Colorado which the Wellstone memorial on steroids\n... on the other one remember that this is when he was a senator and er what Minnesota and the Minnesota and the memorial was basically like a let's go out and storm the streets Maxine Waters fueled\nA political rally very movie was just unbelievable\nBelieve there was a turning point in America at the time\nYeah it was over the top insulting cruel and it it particularly in ... in a way I remember specifically to the majority leader Trent Lott appeared and he walks out and they soundly brought him off the stage\nAnd the next day John Kerry ... apologized to him but the damage was done and it had a huge impact on the mid term elections and the ... I think this is happening or at least the Democrats are afraid but this is happening now and it's ... there's something shakes\nThey got ahead of their skis or a little bit maybe that's part of James ... dot com attorney by trade among other and find things that Newsmax dot com as well I'm looking at some of the uh the the Twitter tantrums\nAnd you're also seeing people who say hey Kevin O's grade but Jennifer Granholm it used to be but she's a commentator and elected official back in Michigan she's been on this for the last few hours even before the report\nMan I don't think she's seen it either a she has the leading are the leading line on all of our tweets sham GOP investigation and then there's a quote dozens of others said they reached out but received no response from the FBI was and this is the other thing they're doing is say well it wasn't brought enough the White House wouldn't\nLead or wouldn't pass the FBI is they go here go there and go deeper so do they have something there again there was a little\nLate they absolutely do not it's the seven investigation of cabin up there as I said they would never be satisfied no matter what they did in ... here's a real hell\nThey you know you know that a Christian afford lawyers and counselors are all these hard core expensive damn strategist Deborah cats who was the vice chair of a group that is funded in part by George Soros\nThat uh is poses Kavanaugh and Michael Brown which you know an Obama appointee a Clinton appointee a guy who was a lobbyist on K Street and Deborah cats comes out today it says wait\nWe have corroborating witnesses now\nNow today today yeah we've we've found somebody in a preschool cabinet made a made somebody put their parents in preschool because he looked at in the wrong way and it just it started with the rest of his I that's how they're going to the\n... and ... the operative word as fresh relieved when it happened in those hearings I mean it was and I think you know it's\nIt's amazing I mean there are polls that show that women that there are women all over this country particularly you know in in a central part of the country where you and I come from\nYes um that are thinking about men they love and boy they love and thinking this is not the right way to treat\nI see this is the bigger deal I found a tweet here from somebody in the opposition to cabinet and this is all\nThe trending hash tag FBI report reaction so somebody a Amy at bunny huggers Seventy five [laughter]\nSays I have I have blocked a lot of it says I blocked a ton of people replying to my earlier tweet Ninety five percent of them ever graphic of the flag Bible and the gun a make America great again there's such a brainwash called her earlier\nTweet was actually very revealing from this opponent to to have it on and obviously somebody can stay on Trump either she writes Kavanaugh's confirmation isn't about him it's\nAbout Trump and his sexual assaults he wants to make it clear that women are not to be believed he wants to rally all the ... men around him\nWell she's on us and that's what it is it's about a ... it's about the women it's the it's the feminism debate versus the old uh you know the patriarchy that's the real thing and just fine have that debate you can certainly have that it's a valid debate on many levels many places but that's not what this is is it\nWell you have any ... to shorter choice to talk about\nA a you know a cult\nAnd some someone that's not thinking and then spouting facts that aren't true it's it's obviously the left and it's particularly the Hollywood left like Rob Reiner tweeted today he said that\nTrump's refusal to allow Kavanaugh to talk okay that's already a false assumption to talk to the FBI means that Kavanaugh is guilty\nOf capital\nAnd I'd I trust uh you know Dr Rob rayner a that's a yes yeah one of the great I joined her doctor Whoopi Goldberg go right up there I\nI said to call in meat head is an insult meat [laughter]\nJames Patterson dot com H.

I I think what happened on social media was social media loves the intersection of politics in sports and I think it's easy to get seduced if you and it's particularly walk the left wing\nOr intersection of politics in sports and the thing I say about social media and the book is it is the equivalent of trying to judge your dietary habits while standing in front of a carnival fun house

derailing part didn't work cabin I'll Fight back and he'll get nominated and false accusations might have actually inspired more Republican and more Republican women\nTo be inspired to vote and a rally the troops which would be good soul mate that full argument coming up at two o'clock\nA la de dah dah dah dah du like two minutes of this press conference just wrapped up a minute or so ago quite by the\nRepublicans up here [noise]\nLady that ah that ah there's one document know copies made a a and a and not\nReleased to the public so we can't do that now there is some suggestion in the

let me see if I can I can back it up to do so we can get some more of that because I Do believe Orrin Hatch was talking for a little bit and we wouldn't want to miss that no other favorite\nIt's a interesting to watch actually the Republicans are gross by my wife two days ago I think she was watching um\nIt was the turtle or Mitch McConnell watching Mitch McConnell speak and she goes she says she said a\nMan\nWithout a super said gosh they were terrified of John McCain\nWeren't they all of them were shot again passes away and then suddenly Lindsey Graham unleashed and even\nMitch McConnell Chuck Grassley and all of these guys coming out here and speaking out strongly as we've been wanting them to do for decades\nSpouse or especially with something as obvious as this um\nOh that press conference is a little bit of a downturn but that's okay I Know or as a let's give something away here and then we'll come back with a an article from Emily Yoffe in the Atlantic short article about uh the problem with hash tag believe all survivors and the Atlantic of course is a a\nMagazine an online website on on the left or but I Want to give away a apprised ... the hundred wave challenge prize back so this Sunday\nBecause of boys are into the poor boys have been mentoring one of my favorite organizations they put on a big fundraiser which is like a walk a thon but surfing right so you

of\nSome dial I'm here to talk to a full day of a ... or to put it on a second congratulations Michelle empower\nGulf Gulf clock in the background I think it was\nA so there's like some people are coming to their senses are some people on the left\nComing to their senses about this we don't call yesterday from a liberal who said this is all gone too far and I asked him if there was a few where senator I think it was ... would you vote for Kavanaugh even though you disagreed with his judicial philosophy and I said yes uh this is as a sensible people aren't coming around this\nIs Emily Yoffe in the left leaning left leaning very left Atlantic ah about the problem with the hash tag believe all survivors\nSo the articles about something\nWe touched on a while ago and that is that we saw these farcical kangaroo courts\n[laughter]\nOr cough or cat grew course\nYou could just the imagery of the kangaroo with the white way because at least on the spot [laughter] black\nDoes have a black guy yeah okay Dr Robert De Niro yeah of I'm a I'm a yeah I was up there and the ... the chair out there a gamble but if the judge for the whole thing oh you're judging yet but it's ...\nIt's a total it's a real good [laughter] [laughter] 'cause it's like I go to court a keg or records on\nCollege campuses so have you ever have you've never seen a kangaroo\nCourt it's because you've probably been out of college for a long time right but they have kangaroos courts in college and also in Israel yeah us where we got it from there\nYou see the stuff on colleges all the time you get to students they get drunk have sex the woman regrets of the next morning and accuses him of rape we've shared stories over the years of women\nSo these accusations even at ... and I I Can't even said they were minimal\nThey were nothing isn't [laughter] I said when America was that we did our crossed I said if one witness one witness that any of these women have named every one of them said even\nOh yeah I remember that party it would be a completely different ...\nWhat's interesting about the ... you brought up about um the you know the girl having sex with a guy and a couple of times and then changing your mind about how she feels about it it's almost like you're skirting\nThe ah maybe\nYou should do some regret came along and so she doesn't want to take accountability for that regret sushi places the blame specific to that comment that you may\nEnd might actually again\nConvince herself that she was indeed raped or taken advantage of or manipulated because all men are awful that she's been told her she made genuinely believe she was raped when clearly was a threat to the accusations\nThat Kavanaugh's faced has gotten male students kicked out of college and they're just trying to use that same standard to kick Kavanaugh that tried to uh get cabin off the sprinkler\n[noise] anyway here's the article a Patricia Hamel who is a Philadelphia based attorney who represents students in title nine cases\nLike sex but pick on college campuses sex assault cases told me the hearing was a very recognizable to her know witness to what happened she said no way to corroborate other than looking at the emotional tenor\nOf how they answered the questions which is not a good way to judge anything I've interviewed many accused the students who say the ... or so men who say the allegations against them were grossly unfair I've yet to talk to a single accused student even one who was eventually cleared whose life wasn't profoundly damaged\nEvery one is told me that at some point he considered suicide because these accusations here's the are the key line or many Democrats in keeping would believe survivors\nGet as a left leaning the Atlantic magazine or many Democrats are taking their certainty about four to count and extrapolating it to all accounts of all accusers\nWe said from the jump day one of this that the problem with is is that it's not Christine verse Brett remember this what are we say stock receivers Brett is feminism versus the patriarchy these two people these two individual people have become symbols\nAnd that's all they are they're symbols\nAnd this is why you gets women screaming at senator saying look me in the eye and tell me that\nYou don't believe my story\nThe Jeff Flake right and just like a proper response would have been oh a ... okay but your story has nothing to do with this story\nBut the activists all the same and that obviously was going to be a complete disaster here's this clip from a Ben Sasse who are right All right you know what I'd been fast you got from no no\nProud I got what am I bring up is that I was like oh I ...

you know we're talking with Katie temple she is from friends of STDs used so they are in\nSupport of measure G A kid he thinks the sticking around so uh you said before the rate that they're going to go here measured you used to expand the university\nAnd this may be a nasty su question but will this expansion be undergrads or will it be research expansion\nRight again I probably want to talk to San Diego state but that that high level answer to that is that it's probably going to be more research and upper grad and because you don't want to have a ... even though they can't this will be close you don't you want to make it easier right the logistics easier for the good that they don't want to have\nYou tried to stay away from a freshman having class back and forth at various campuses each day even as a trolley ups are pretty short that they're going to\nOrganize that where it up for grabs graduate students because as you've probably heard they want to have the space for research park\nWhere we can kind of collaborate with the students and research and and businesses and and things like that so they want to keep that that Britain easier logistically for students\nI asked that because it is the position of friends that as the su that having as the ASU researchers in this area that that's better\nFor the economy or is it just the more\nThe higher a noble goal of academic research is better than a million square footage of retail [noise]\nI think there's a couple of answers there I mean I think first of all let's talk about the hell is the biggest traffic nightmare and that a lot of retail that they're proposing and yeah\nFrom from the friends that that the uh the when the initiative that education is and it's that the long term investment if they get that keeps on giving their studies that show that ... you know I graduate generally make higher salary and\nUh we just believe that education is to get it keeps on giving and that it will continually grow the economy for generations to come\nMore specially like we talked about before there's there's research showing that people that graduated from San Diego state want to hang around and you can't argue with that number\nIs ... that would be as I don't I don't really care if you're an FDIC grad\nOr not right does that that doesn't matter does it\nEvery year\nYou know buying a house spending money working I don't care before I come from Colorado and you graduated from nowhere or if you're from San Diego and you've graduated from San Diego state ... they they\nStick around right that we want ... and we want to fight\nWe want to provide that support right we want\nMore people locally to have the opportunity to go to San Diego state because this is our reach and there's only eight percent that are able to get in because it's impacted that there's so many people that are local that had been here for their families have been here forever and we want to give them the option to you know kids and grandkids the people that are from here to go to\nSchool here but right now they can only accept eight percent of applicants because it's ... at the scene so we want to expand that to get the opportunity\nFor more people especially local to have the opportunity to go to San Diego state\nRep so what you mentioned traffic was starting to see what's another problem you have with soccer city\nI don't I'm not talking about my problem with soccer city I I'm just telling you that the ... the point that we have with the initial kid is that we want to create if expansion joined open and transparent process right in other words\nFull incorporation of environmental review and public input and I think that that most important thing we want to make sure we will make sure he put\nHer so that we can protect the natural that like the rivers\nThat's all that like the river park and so the thought about when you were talking about it we're talking about a lot of rain hell with the soccer city initiative and one of the big problems in the valley right now is traffic is you know\nAnd I and when when you think about how we tell us that they get traffic issue and with expansion in San Diego state and but when we got the trolley dot\nAnd they're they're encouraging live work alert and play area\nThat the U.S you know king that he would support an effort against soccer city and support and expansion of as the as you so gee I don't know [laughter]\nSo you could ... your college at all [laughter]\nJust jumped in front of their I'm Sorry about that could drag out a little bit I
