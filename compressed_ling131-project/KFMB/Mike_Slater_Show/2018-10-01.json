sixty nine hungry\nIt's never enough the goalposts keep moving or it's like oh we're not playing football we're playing parties you know it's a whole different different things so and now they're already starting to say we saw some of this over the weekend well we hope this investigation and give it a FBI investigation is deep enough is broad enough that he has his his seventh\nFBI investigation folks sevens he is past the first\nSix with flying colors FBI agent to ask the exact same questions in these types of interviews and they ask about drug use and alcohol in the prior six so if he hasn't had a problem in the last twenty five years uh and he only had a few beers in high school that we're talking about it's this is outrageous\nYeah but this guy Chad flooding than this guy the professor associate professor in North Carolina conveniently yesterday after the SNL bit with Matt Damon or as cabinet\nComes out and says well you know the couple of years I was with him he ... he drank a lot and I saw him get belligerent and I just felt it was my duty to share isn't that convenient\nSo while it's convenient but it's also doesn't matter what what one of us is perfect one of us in high school or college your formative years ... ... you know look [laughter] you you you you get to a\nA do things at Eighteen and Twenty one because uh you know whether it's a driver's license right to vote you buy alcohol you name it ah there's things that come along with a maturity in age so to say that somebody was sixteen or Seventeen look\nSexual assault is one thing that has no age limit right we all understand what we're talking about here this is the Democrats running a political campaign to destroy a man and his family for their political outcomes and I'm not gonna sit here\nAnd let them do it so whether they want to move the goalposts whether it's that type of argument I I don't want to hear it whether it's the the FBI investigation needs to be brought in those uh ... and ... and no time limit that's ridiculous whether it's a you know now oh look at the hearing he he didn't show good judicial temperament\nYou were trying to assassinate him in is in the Senate hearing and he angrily defends himself so now you want to change it that it's about his temperament these people are despicable\nAnd somebody's looks because the SNL thing they had a bit and there's a line and they're like you know make that little tiny mouse thing that you do this kind of creepy or something to that I looked\nAt these people are unfortunately ... bringing America to the edge of the best and that's what we're doing here because\nThey have thrown the rule book out the window that the rules of decorum in comedy in the United States Senate or now gone they are going to report they show and that is unfortunately where we are as a as a country because\nPeople like this get to do it without accountability and so you're going to get Dianne Feinstein get reelected you know in in in seven weeks time and you're going to get\nSome of these others who are up for reelection but let's you know you got you got the Dianne Feinstein has the Chinese spy on in her employee feeding information to China for the last twenty\nYear and that still is not the greatest right not address those things where they've come up we've talked about um a lot and still somehow that's not an issue but\n... what am I tub or a senator from Delaware is it is they knowledge wife beat her okay one senator after the other Richard Blumenthal is a higher about serving in Vietnam it's it is what these people do is despicable and they shouldn't be allowed to get ...\nBe allowed to get away with it unfortunately they do so this is where we are in in our politics today they want to burn this city down over judge Kavanaugh will see where the FBI investigation leads us but then he's going to get through and then they have a problem on there and that's when their problem begins\nWell this problem that they create in the resistance and this could go both ways of right now it's the left\nWhen you get to a certain point and the whole landscape changes and all of a sudden you can't defend yourself if you're innocent just because well the rest of the environment or in this case the me too movement which was a very serious issue Wednesday and everything else\nBut they you know this became litigating uh I wasn't a quarter law but in the Senate they kept saying it's not not a court however it really wasn't about Kevin on Ford and still is it it's the bigger picture of gender it's it's the feminine versus the patriarchy given that what's going on here to solve it does have a bigger let's\nTalk about the presumption of innocence okay that\nNobody has that little thing that there's nowhere in America\nOkay whether you're a in California or in Iowa or New York that any American wants to remove the presumption of innocence I understand\nThat emotions get carried away and some of these people on the left a cannot see what they're destroying\nBut by but by trying to make the ends justify the means here\nYou you are destroying one of the basic tenants of American society of our culture and that is the presumption of innocence innocent until proven guilty there's been not one shred of evidence has been one person's word against another that is that doesn't even get you to court let alone when David\nBossy where does this do to accept when when this report comes in the end of the week again I I I think you would agree with me that it's not going to be enough but then what I mean they either ... cabinet they'll say well try this delay\nWith other tactics obviously the guy said but another few days oh but we need to do this and now it's another few days I ... I Hope that the Senate will look at this and say okay there's been another investigation does seven there they've come up with nothing new if they come up with nothing new they come up with nothing new and we're having a vote and we will we will vote on friday\nA ... and he'll be in the United States Supreme court the following week that's that's what should happen if there's any common decency left well\nBy the way for those are are they were just talking about there's not many comedy in the Senate of course there's comedy you were talking on the uh the the almost archaic word\nC O M IT why because there is comedy is that if there's a lot of hype\nLady alone as a whole treasure trove of\nOwn right off but I Wonder if he drank and college well anyway he was there All right David appreciated stay safe like I thought David ... who is the head of Citizens United that Citizens United\nA no shrinking violet he\nFormer deputy campaign manager for Trump author of let Trump Trump and that's the latest on that front of him seven sixty talk and bringing his by the way coming up\nNext our San Diego's top cop they've ... chief there's going to be here with us at eleven thirty five also John\nCox is running for governor and he's all wound up he is I don't know if it's the coffee to their what base fired up and in fact there's some talk like well why is he putting his money into the yes on proposition six the gas tax repeal thing but we're going to do that John Cox coming up after the top of the hour live and local am seven sixty talk and breaking news\nYou're listening to mark ... am seven sixty talk and breaking news\nSign of Santa Fe dump trucks cell block in the right lane and part of the excess ... thanks\nMany attend friday I she'd come out of and send need as much a test that same now it's going to get a whole lot center and then once you've looking pretty good ... you're always funny San Diego Honda dealers have San Diego and that they yellow on balance around here San Diego Honda dealers and he's made in the shade sales event is on now\nFor sale details as it has to be on the list that huh how long I later today at noon on hand seven sixty ... rise and singing hills memorial\nVis a branch will see the president of will see Asset Management and those are the smart investing show on Saturday mornings are you concerned with the ... the market maybe you're not getting the investment returns you would like at will see Asset Management we use a proven strategy for investing that delivers that returns\nAnd lower risk don't worry about any high pressure sales tactics all the office eight five eight five four six four three oh six eight five eight five or six fourth Rios ... you're a free consultation or visit the website smart investing two thousand dot com\nBusiness needs vast secure networks to be efficient and profitable detail can help you keeping your data secure your business seats and connect\nWe've been helping San Diego businesses since Nineteen eighty three they can provide expert solutions for networks voiceover I.

was that there seems to be this thing in Sacramento that every chance they get it's like oh let's release some more criminals onto the streets\nWe'll talk more with chief Dave is light San Diego's top cop and he joined us eleven thirty five or one of his periodic updates with us about crime rates and so forth But Jerry brown signed last night when no one was looking without comment Senate bill fourteen thirty seven\nWhat does this new it scales back I'm In Sacramento Bee news report scales back prosecutors ability to use what is known as the felony murder rule to charge accomplices to a homicide\nIt also allows inmates locked up for a felony murder estimated by proponents of the bill between four hundred and eight hundred people to apply for re sentencing\nSo in other words what it does is they could get strong under\nCalifornia's law signed by Jerry Brown without comment every chance they get an a part of it started with the prisons are twofold so then we went to the too many people are held for minor offenses so non violent offenses let's let them out prop forty seven\nRight the problem is they look at your last defense not the next to last defense your last advance may be fine Coby free next to last event could be assault so that adds\nTo the homeless population all the other problems but it's just [noise]\nNever ends\nJerry was busy though over the weekend John Cox would like to be the next governor he's the Republican candidate going up against Mr knew someone would love to debate him at any\nOn the street corner anywhere one measly debate coming up there should be more ... what do you have mark\nGreat to be with you and you're right that Mr Brown is out of touch and clueless are letting criminals out of jail and Mr this is even more on it a ... and I\nI agree with you or he doesn't want to debate may because he doesn't have any answer for all these problems that they've created the cost of living this data and as you say a link criminals out the

the guy I mean real real estate down to brass tacks or something here a lot of fiber up there that's that's a big big problems\nSo I says well the problem is that this has been the last few years maybe with the best of intentions let's eliminate prison overcrowding don't make people worst criminals when they're in for lesser offenses ...\nBut in practicality if you talk to people talk to cops talked to business owners I mean I Do I over the red bank they ah wants to buy them every week or two or whatever the urban outdoorsman suddenly are there and a lot of them are prop forty seven releases and then they started hanging around and then they deter business from being done and\nIt's it just doesn't take a lot just to run into her literally stumble over it but I guess they they don't have the problem in Sacramento is that why it makes no big deal\nI I maybe not but the rest of the state is exhibiting law or a increase in crime and and not surprisingly because they've

Ford Broadway nice main el cone for dot com\nYou don't yes we we train a lot we talk about the escalation and the escalation and everything we do but what people sometimes forget this de escalation takes two parts is the officer giving commands and asking somebody to drop a weapon or to show their hands and that takes the other person to follow those commands to have the escalation\nAnd so you know one of the community talks about the escalation I Want them to understand we always try but these things happen sometimes in split seconds fractions of seconds\nAnd do you have a better\nDialogue now with this whole process after you weren't the only person in law enforcement say wait a minute what his bills I mean as a\nCondition his work out there for some time in the future yeah ... is there more back and forth now maybe put something together because I I don't I don't understand I guess I understand their motivation but if you're not talking to the people who actually do the job that seems to be ridiculous\n[noise] yeah I that's what I'm hoping I'm hoping this will bring everybody to the table all the concern parties to the table and let's talk this through let's you know make certain that\nIt you know provides the safety for the officers for the for the public safety members doing the work in the streets but also for the community and I'm I truly believe we all sit down and we can crafts something that will be a good solution\nSetting of waste have they been with us here in the mark Morris and show am seven sixty talking breaking news one of the other big stories are no there's even a piece in today's newspaper in the union hyphen Tribune formerly the daily up\nAbout this bail deal and again this comes out of Sacramento are going to wipe out but I think what about three hundred jobs in San Diego October next year a and and other jobs across the state people who were in the bail bonds business and there's a lot of companies have been busy doing that for a long time I'm hearing mixed\nLaw enforcement reaction to this um ah because they would eliminate bail money and it and and the whole system changes is that gonna create more criminals on the street and seems like that's a byproduct of maybe what makes good intentions in some way but how do you see that as big\nAs it possibly could now you know one of those things that I personally been a time that kind of take a a wait and see on it I still liked the fact that there's discretion with the judge so you look at the type of crime that the person committed\nYou look at their history especially when you you're talking about weapons violations in violent crime it goes back to a judge or a commissioner to weigh in on whether that person should be released and so I like it for that reason but there's a lot of parts of it that they do cause me some concern um but it's one of those things that\nIt's one of those things that we're just going to have to wait and see and then if we need to make some amendments and law enforcement will call for some for some changes\nOne of the big things across it continues to be in pretty much anything and we hear about true love is there has been your jurisdiction different from city versus San Diego but you certainly compete for for new potential police officers there with the department of their department but they have a new half cent sales tax that kicks in as of today\nAnd it's supposed to be I Know that the way that it gets sold is supposed to help hire more police officer so wherever we look with his police are border patrol there's always yeah let's hire some more\nYou made that a big focus as you became chief here a few months ago said listen we're going to get the the pay into gear here we've got some new things and city council approved that's got to be helpful that was kind of a July a whole new way of doing things where where are we now in terms of recruitment are you seeing\nAnywhere near what you'd hoped at this point I don't know it's still kind of early but are we seeing a flood of people coming to to consider careers as a cop for example men and women\nYeah we're still you know the last two academies we had one that started a you know right after my start date in March and then we just had another one started just early June we've had seen the class size increase for the first one we had was forty nine in the last one we had was forty three [noise]\nBut we still would like to see more applicants we're still seeing a little bit of a decrease in the of the applicant pool\nAnd so you know we recently hired low media which is the local marketing for him to come in and they should be pressing go with some of their different digital media that will be going out here as early as probably this week\nAnd we'll be doing some media here on this probably next week so I definitely think we're training in the right direction for law enforcement and specifically for San Diego police department and will continue to do that you know I'm very appreciative of the pay raises that we've all gotten across the board for the next two years and [noise]\nYou know that really goes to the the city council and the mayor and the police officers association you're really sitting down and doing great work and getting us competitive because that's really the big difference was we were not competitive and now we truly are and so now is just\nBuilding upon that and and you know it takes time we only have four academy is a year and so it was going to take us a little bit of time to get out of this but I'm definitely seeing is treading and the right direction\nAnd you've had made some stretches because you are shorter where you'd like to be in terms of number of officers men and women so um I I guess when you're taking community based police work now sometimes you've got people jumping into squad cars and spending more time responding to calls so everybody's in many cases with some expanded duties or that proves that with that\nYeah so we had to make some some slight staffing adjustments so we've asked a couple of our you know whether it be that the gang suppression teams you have those services team and our crime suppression teams to to help out patrol even our motors now or or assisting more on radio calls when they used to\nAnd that's just for the short term just to get us through this next academy until we start to see some of these bigger academies graduate and [noise]\nYou know we get the recruits through the training and then they go out so what people don't realize there's a lot of times is from the day we hire you and you start the academy it's about eleven months before you're ready to go out on your own\nAnd so we need to by that time and that's why that some some minor staffing adjustments were made that we're going to revisit here in four months\nAlright jade de ... there's light appreciate your time and I are very busy appreciate your carving out even a a quarter of your world today and I feel safer as long as you're not telling me on this frenetic I was I think I'm clean they appreciate the later ... chief from San Diego police department but yeah we were thinking about a career that is a noble career\nI'm not easy or by any means but\nAnd you know there is competition you know if you're looking at the San Diego police department and say well should it be a cop there are some city where maybe it's less intense or maybe there's more benefits I think they're brought that up to a better competitive level now but depending what two three hundred more so a\n... and you can't get logged into submission by the crime rates when some of them look these are the lowest their next number of years because bad guys are still bad guys and they're still out there going how could make your life miserable you have something I Want to steal or will create mayhem or what have you\n[noise] one eight hundred seven sixty KF that'd be crossed

never drag you in yeah 'cause I was expecting something ...\nYeah uh so I'm In a something I'm very excited about it or\nNot super healthy well you're not saying it's going to go great for Kavanaugh that's not what I mean by excited I\nJust um captivated it's better when right\nBut just like we talked about early last week which pace ourselves give me a long week with us\nGoing to talk about this sixty minutes story was that being said we're going to spend this hour talking about it [laughter] I forgot to talk about I was just a one time about sixty minutes last night featuring Republican dish Jeff Flake he's the guy who came up with the one week compromise and the Democrat Chris Coons\nA oh a guy who is a it's I think some time we're going to talk about Jim Cole me that a tour of the New York times as well\nWhich of course he had to\nGet his he's got to get back because why we need a new player\nHold on the spot like sound to me right now\nIn my book [laughter] proves as biased decided to oil was coming up\nAnd let me just get this out a way to before we get to the sixty minutes at the end of this week you will hear Democrats say one week of an FBI investigation is not long enough for a thorough investigation or you're going to hear it wasn't a criminal investigation which is what we really need\nYou'll hear some people on the further left to say that Trump withheld certain information from the Senate committee because the FBI does they're investigating and then they write a report\nAnd they give it to the White House and then the White House gives it to the Senate so you're gonna have people say oh the yeah the White House took stuff out or whatever and then the biggest talking point that you're going to get is that cabinet doesn't have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court\nBased on what he did last Thursday doesn't have to temperament I find this to be a ridiculous accusation because\nNo one can be expected to be calm and an emotional when dealing with their own\nCase\nThis is why judges recovery recused themselves when they are involved in a case in some way because they can't remain calm and an emotional right this is why they have recused goals to begin with\nSo just because he's not calm during his own trial says nothing about his ability to remain\nJudicial in other cases but you're going to hear that not stop that he doesn't have the temperament\nBossy but that's going to be at the end of the hearts of sixty minutes or if I were teaching a journalism class this would be my first exhibit of journalistic biased not because it was so blatant but in fact because it was so subtle\nThat we could spend all showing it not super important but as someone who has followed\nEvery single aspect of this story the bias is collaborating we obvious\nAnd if you were just catching bits and pieces of this last week of Kavanaugh like most people because people have jobs and they're working in the busy they have other things to worry about\nSo if you're just catching bits and pieces than you would watch the sixty minutes report and you wouldn't know the things that were left out and you wouldn't know the perspectives that they'd never bothered to provide when they clearly could have and chose not to so this is a really perfect example and I love sixty minutes\nBut as a great example of um of by\nThe way I Want to talk

don't want to talk about that exist right there to going back to Nineteen Ninety this guy named layered Wilcox what are they gonna name layered [noise] [noise] wow I don't like it layered\nDefamation in retaliation\nFor the real or imagined attitudes opinions or beliefs of the victims so in his case he is a a conservative originalists constitution anti abortion got\nSo that's the retaliation reason for retaliation with the intention of silencing or neutralizing his influence and or making an example of them so as to discourage similar independence or insensitivity\nAnd so that's why and this is how Kavanaugh's being ritually destroyed and famed by the left so a layered outlines how all this all works as a couple of different steps but the one that stood out of step number six in order for a ritual defamation to be effective\nThese victim must be ... to the extent that he becomes identical with the offending attitude opinion or belief and\nIn a manner which distorts it to the point where it appears at its most extreme okay it's a good example that or if someone makes a a slightly racial joke\nThey're not just racist there a slave owner of the war there you're as bad as a slave owner if someone is against illegal immigration than they are characterized not as someone who is against us for sovereignty there characterized as Hitler leading people to the gas chambers\nSo we've seen a lot of this in the last two years so a cabin on the accusation is he groped a woman or a girl in high school but within a couple of days he's a gang rape is\nSo ... so you have in the scale of sexual assault do you have groping right I think we alternate lesser on the scale of severity all bad lesser on the scale but we can't just accused them of groping we have to use them of being a gang rape is that's where we are\nRight so that accusation was made up as a part of the ritual is to defamation process all I have an ... he had to do with throw out this idea of gang raped the women women then came out and said well he didn't gang raping but he was at the party where I was\nGang raped and but that doesn't matter because the popular imagination now he's a gang rape is the worst version of what he's accused of doing that works\nNow back to the basketball team this is Frank Rich but the New York times\nKavanaugh was bragging about coaching girls' basketball is now troubling in retrospect\nSo now he's not just a gang rape is he's also a pedophile\n\nSo at one point during the original hearings he brought his girl his daughters girls' basketball team into the hearing and this is time magazine Ford's charge shattered the image that Kavanaugh projected the role of young girls legs bear in their private school skirts looks different now\nPretty sick right and that's sick but that's the ritual decimation\nWe could see some thunder storm activity for each county locations ramping up this afternoon now down to the question scene isolated downpour west of the

inquiry\nAs a farce Democrats denounce limits on FBI's cabinet inquiry as a farce so we got to go into the seventeenth paragraph\nSeventeenth paragraph before you get us it's not unusual for the White House to specify the scope of a request for additional background information on a nominee no evidence has emerged that the White House has forbidden any investigative steps and President Trump says he wants to agents to quote interview whoever they deem appropriate at their discretion\n[laughter] sort of that light is Democrats denounce limits you had to go into the seventeenth paragraph before the New York times is that there's no evidence that there's any limits on his head like Democrats called investigation or a farce Seventeen paragraph Trump says the FBI can interview wherever they want at their discretion\nI liked his new game where you can put up one headline just changes sort of an article of a couple of good discoveries are going to ... miles\nI'm promos for TV and you see where two people in in the TV show have this major conflict and one of ... someone tells the other person off\nAnd then you're like whoa I get to see the episode you see the episode and it's nothing to do with that at all so I asked him yelling at a dog\n[laughter] so the real housewives coming up next on ... and it's ... seconds of\nBig bang bang for whom this person said no you know I'll go on the uh the break room and like divorce court is on or something and like next on divorce court [laughter] like one a couple of words here and there are of every person and then if you were actually watch the segment but it's not it's not even\nClose yeah you're looking for the part that they promo did yeah and it's nowhere near as dramatic or exciting\nThat said that this article it's Democrats denounce limits on FBI's in Korea as far as you know like oh what are the limits I Can't wait to read what the limits are and you get to the Seventeen paragraph no evidence has emerged that the White House that's forbidden any investigative stuffed\n\nOr the Democrats have revealed a list of people that they want the FBI to question and you know that if the if if the FBI\nDoes not talk to every single one of these people than the left is going to say that it was not a thorough investigation this is the New Yorker ah I thought it was going to be an investigation already were uh uh one working day into this I thought it was going to be an investigation Gail classmate of Brett Kavanaugh said\nOf the FBI's renewed inquiry but instead it seems just an alibi for Republicans to vote for cabinet so this is the this classmate does your classmate says he's this is the quote he's a ... one hundred percent certain that he had\nHeard an account that was practically identical to Ramirez is the second woman thirty five years ago but the two I've never spoken about it so that's\nThat's what does that he's got a hundred percent certain I heard about something similar to what this woman\nIs talking about a hundred percent certain\nThat that's not a witness and not a witness but for sure find go make your thing but you make your claim but just because you talk to the FBI and you make that claim what do we want to do you want them is just\nThe FBI doesn't want the left doesn't want an investigation they want to public hanging\nAnd nothing less of that will do\n\nNo matter what happens at the end of this Friday the left is still gonna freak out say it wasn't enough whatever this is Jim called me and my gym called me\nWhat a guy gosh\nAre simpler back then drink yeah this is a talking about the soap opera that is\nThis whole thing called politics a\nGym called me was a character that you know moved out of town\nOr something or killed off his character but if you will like he's gone now you had contracted view yeah but it's like the guy that dies and then all of a sudden back to life the way [laughter] I thought you were done no back to your back okay he's still back\nA you wrote an editorial in New York Times we live in a world where sitting federal judge channels the president by shouting attacks at the Senate committee\nConsidering his nomination and demanding to know if it if a respected senator has ever passed out from drinking okay here's the moment the club I just said you here's the moment that Jim Comey is referring to\nThe one thing about CERN is about truthfulness and in your written testimony you said sometimes you had too many drinks I was there ever a time when you drink so much that you couldn't remember what happened or part of what happened the night before\nI don't know I remember what happened and\nI think you probably had beer center and and so\nYou're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before are part of what happened\nIf you're asking about yeah blackout I don't know have you [noise]\nCan you answer that question catch and just the ... that that happened is that your answer\nYeah and I'm curious if you have I have no drinking problem started my last call if we say the ... trial much drivers factor and respect for what she did it the last year and she has fair question at the end that I responded by asking her a question I didn't sorry I did that this is a process I'm Sorry about that\nAt ... said that I Would like to add when you have a parent that the alcoholic I you're pretty careful about drinking and\nOkay so that was the exchange that called me was talking to and which he came back and apologize for 'em\nAnd we can go back to the transcript I have an added it all up and I'm pretty sure that was the twenty six thousand at the time that he was asked about whether or not he's blacked out from drinking and he got frustrated sets of the nation and apologize\nI actually think that exchange that back and forth to that conclusion at the end was one on one of the more hopeful moments of last Thursday's hearing I'm certain that something that Kavanaugh would like to take back what he said\nI'm disappointed and call me taking the worst moments of the day and something that he apologized for right after and characterizing Cavanaugh a\nAnd taking nothing else into consideration but just taking out one moment to ah to judge them I don't even hear similar stuff and call me a unless limited in some way by the Trump Administration the FBI can speak to scores of people in a few days if necessary so again throwing out there the\nTrump limiting the investigation Trump is not living in the investigation the ... that we just did the times article just zero evidence no evidence whatsoever that they want houses is living in the FBI investigation so why even throw that out there\nAre again ... or this is I'm Jim Comey is idiotic to put a shot clock on the FBI\nMeaning a limit\nOr we don't have time to do is maybe and come back in the next segment but I have a list here from uh uh this is a list of all the times that here to\nBomb\nA all these senators saying just need a week when you're one week seven days when you one week that's all one week one week one week one week one would just give us one week\nAnd now Jim Comey say oh that's idiotic to put a shock and just an echo everything I said on friday I think at this time this is entirely Dianne Feinstein to doing she's the one that made a shock necessary the FBI could have done this had an investigation weeks long\nIf she handed them to let her when she first got it she did this and she's not idiotic she knows exactly what she was doing a last part of you for Jim Comey yes the elected incident occurred thirty six years ago but FBI agents know that time has very little to do with memory\nThey know that every married person remembers the wedding this isn't remembers the weather on their wedding day no matter how long ago significance drives memory but they also know that little lies point to a bigger lies\nThey know the obvious live by the nominee about the meaning of words in a year book or a flashing signal to dig deeper wow okay so to kind of is the first\nHas very much to do with memory very much you may remember the weather up your wedding day maybe ... weddings are known to be a blur and most of life and you go back in your memory bank it's mostly a blur time\nTime absolutely is a major factor on memory and here's call me they are not doesn't matter died of any different now you have or maybe the biggest difference and then here's ... a company talking about saying the cabinet lied about the meaning of the things in his yearbook\nHoly cow\nLittle lies point to a bigger lies they know FBI ages no that obvious live obvious lies by the nominee about the meaning of words in your book obvious lies so this is the

year\nPerhaps for Germany at the time\nEight months what does I'm One of the tunnel operation then\n[laughter] so they the this Alcatraz prison like prison called ... than than was was purportedly inescapable it was essentially a prison inside a prison instead of prison and the the these escape artists tried any number of ways to get out of couldn't couldn't do couldn't do it\nAnd eventually you decided to take a tunnel a roughly Seventy yards long a underneath the camp underneath the walls out into a field um and it was a huge engineering operation um they were taking about a foot a day to cave in this and and all the like but they eventually pulled it off\nWhat were these POW's doing during the day that I'm sure my point is I'm sure where they are they're exhausted starving all the rest of the visual image my visual correct on ...\n... ... your your image is correct they were you know they were officers so by the rules of war or they couldn't actually do any labor so they were largely a standing around or the camp they were able to work about three hours a day when they were given sort of yard\nA time and so they disguise themselves as as workers and and entered a sort of secret tunnel a or a secret chamber in which they started the tunnel\nAgain so that so they didn't start at where they were they had to pretend to be laborer so that they could go to where the tunnel was\nExactly what you couldn't you couldn't just to start the tunnel in the middle of the the open yard so there was a a they started actually underneath a stairwell or in the ... blocks or that they created a secret door to sort of entered 'em in there they could a gig in in secret\nOr this may sound like it's a question but why did they feel the need to escape what was that drive within them to even attempt it is [noise]\nWell I think it was it was a couple things first the the primary motivation was to get back to the war or to get back to their squadrons get back to the five I think the other sort of motivating factor was just the sense of uh as one prisoner called ... that was kind of growing on them this sort of idleness\nOr nothing to do a their whole lives scripted by what the

that every Senate voice matters and there is there's time to get to the bottom of it even if it's seven days\nAnd then ... said that uh\nWith Anita Hill the FBI finished it's working three days she said let's give this one week so these are all the Democrats calling for one week one week one week one week and a in a week you'll say oh needs to be much much like\nA final point here do you guys hear this on friday that the American bar association decided to call for an FBI investigation saw that big news because it was the bar was talked about during the during the trial or whatever the Lindsey Graham and his Braveheart yeah talked about the the ... so it turns out the president of da da da\nDa da da da da da da da ... that actually\nTalked about the the ... so it turns out the president of da da da da da da da da da ... that actually approves these kinds of things so one guy sent out the letter\nWith the way to forty of the entire\nAmerican Bar association behind it so the next day the ADA came out and\nSaid no we did not send that letter and judge Kavanaugh's rating is quote not affected but doesn't matter damage already done already served its purpose by the Democrats in the media because I even the American bar association says that they should have an FBI investigation onto the next lie\nAs one out of seven sixty ...\nEarn it would come up next with a a very very unpopular thing to say probably the most popular things to say this week\n[noise] ah because I Want to quote Dennis ... Dennis ... wrote a story quoted the head of the school that Dr Ford went too so the principle of the school that Dr Ford went to a nice day to for some reason felt the deemed to comment on this story at all\nBecause again the currents principal was not the principal in Nineteen eighty two so that seems to me to be a very loose connection rights of I was accused of something or I was on trial I Would not expect the current principle of my high school\nTo comment on the case that seems bizarre anyway the principle that school said as a school that empowers women\nTo use their voices we are proud of this alumni or for using hers and Dennis ... responded empowers women\nEmpowers women\nYou wrote about how his mom was groped by doctor and his mom and dad told the dock that if you ever do that again and get a break his hand\nAnd prayers wife was groped by the manager of a restaurant she worked at and you don't get lost and avoided being alone to them\nSo he told those two stories and when he told those stories people attacked Prager is being a rape apologist are blaming women are ... are belittling trauma which I'm going to be accused of doing here too but his point wasn't about any of that is specifically about the word empowerment\nAnd that's what I Want to focus on hears the word empowerment you hear a lot in our empowerment\nSo Prager says I Believe as I wrote that feminism is not empowered women nearly as much as it has weekend than\n\nI used my mom and wife and he explains how the the two strongest women you know I use my mom and wife as examples of the ability of strong people whether man and woman man or woman to withstand noxious behavior\nAnd move on with life rather than wallowing in self pity victim mode anger contempt for men lies and in gratitude that has permeated feminism and gratitude he says for a living and one of the best countries if not the best country that a woman can living in the world today\nHow we react to life vicissitudes unlike that were either\nOf us has to be a or unpleasant occurrence so how we react to life's unpleasant occurrences\nIs what defines empowerment the late columnist and commentator Charles crowd however was a rendered quadriplegic as a result of a diving accident while a medical school from the day it happened he decided he would live a life as normal as possible\nAnd incredibly went under graduated with his class he never defined himself as a victim\nBy using Charles crowd however as an example of empowerment of I negate the seriousness of being paralyzed from the neck down\nOf course not\nNo more than I denied that men who grow up to my mother and wife acted like pigs\nSo we're not commenting on the act\nThat's disgusting\nReaction to and then what feminists described as empowerment that's noteworthy parts so empowerment is about becoming stronger and more confident that sort of ... literally means becoming stronger and more common\nAnd I think feminism and victim of a culture in general has taught women and men but women here to become weaker\nAnd to live like a victim no matter how slight the offense\nYou become weaker and to live like a victim no matter how slight the fence might have been and what do you mean flight offense or an adult woman a college student adult woman at uh what was the college up in a bread or a\nA mouser than like a Washington Oregon and ... oh yeah I'm ... ... so when they adult at evergreen state tells the president of the university\nThat his hand motions while he's talking or triggering or\nWould you call that an empowered woman like I like the empowerment and strong and confident would you say that that your hand motions or triggering me is that empowered is that it is that a strong person or is that a weak person\nSo this I literally saw this ten minutes ago this is BBC clapping has been banned at the University of Manchester student union\nTo avoid triggering anxiety and improve accessibility whatever that means students are set encouraged to use jazz hands to express their support which I'm sure one day we'll be labeled as races but no more clapping alright clapping so would you say that these people\nWho are triggered by clapping did you say that these are strong people or these week people\n\nThis is not empowerment when you're not living in an empowerment culture right now we're living in a culture that celebrates and therefore encourages weakness\nOne out of seven sixty ... and victimhood one out of seven sixty ... are a ... point number two\n\nOf them making next we'll talk about what they're calling us to one hundred seven six to ... do you want to enter seven sixty\nFive three six to Newman replacing windows so I went to my mom's new house moved around a couple of weeks ago and uh it's a new house\nSo we were walking around and watch his album and beautiful great love it I'm so happy for you and then where you're walking around and we went into the big room and a tons of light really open area and nice there we're going to the ... the stairs were bright and went upstairs is like a little off when you get upset and you're like oh my gosh it's beautiful

a study from the inside and outside our the windows and you could replace the windows in your house you don't need a brand new house you can make this dramatic improvement for very little money and
