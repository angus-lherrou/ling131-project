B.\nWhen it had her seven sixty five three six to and I look forward to a half hour from now you can be here we were talking about eyewitness testimony and how it's really like I I Know I'd say things like there's a lot and I don't know I feel I got back him up always but when you hear someone given eyewitness testimony you should really [noise]\nGive it to five\nPercent credibility that's about all it's worth and really even your own Tibet alter\nSo talk about that's what I under seven sixty Camp David Epstein and Bradley white they have a Social Security seven are coming up in just a few weeks here so please RSVP It's Tuesday October twenty third or Wednesday the twenty fourth I Will be there on the twenty fourth\nSo if he may even either or love to see a one day I'll give you a copy of my book I wanted to hang out for a little while before I Am a little about Social Security the government\nTakes money from your paycheck every paycheck has sincere near tire every paycheck you've ever seen all of this promise of giving it back to you and joined sixty five and isn't that great there are so many variables at play here ah and you need to know what they are and then you can make some different decisions and\nBut at least ... I'm In Florida oh yeah yeah so or even writes a letter with their name on it I guess that's the other here we have\nAnonymous sweater no return address yep no details just Brett Kavanaugh raped me and now we're ...\nFront page of the union Tribune ... literally the sentence that stuck out to me the ocean side letter is on dated an officer offers few ... clues about where or when the alleged assault occurred as a boy don't worry we're going to put it right on the front front page [laughter] this could be some guy who wrote this\nNo you guys are ... she signed it Jane Doe da ... California there it is oh it says this is Jane do I know Jane\nOh well the while you're telling me it's not fine that's what I'm trying to figure out what is it misses it misses do or doctor do [laughter] I Know Dr Isabel it says ... okay never mind I Apologize to hear from your Jay Mrs do sorry\nAnd in relation to a John Doe from no\nJohn do end up in a ... a ... you know an officer in current events I think John Doe Mayer and now I don't see different do different do a lot of those\nThings but it's a big do family tree now\nEric where we're talking about doing this during the break but we're not really going to do it comes out of trouble\nOkay if we um\nJust say okay I don't know how safe is now it would I Would because not it would because oh you're belittling the\nActual accusers okay but I'm saying we could show how stupid this whole the hunter paying how fake all the news is that if we had Eric right now three minutes we all shut up and we just like Eric do a a little diatribe about being raped by ... or ... or ...\nA brick ... recalls and or maybe he witnessed he died cost me whatever sure gutter or the way for someone to call to make it a ... well they are calling the are going to cost me oh you know ... you were Julie sweat next you were you were one of the people who were in the room\nDuring the gang rape and Brett Kavanaugh yeah waiting you just got you I mean without that you are you calling you say it we acted totally I'm like hey let's go to a John Doe or in the sea\nOr whatever I Want to be New Haven Connecticut ah and we'd ask John go pushed that audio out share your story as you do it which three minutes\nPut it on SoundCloud yeah my gosh can you believe that we send it out to CNN wherever MSNBC I guarantee you end of the day oh I'm On cruise Cuomo's CNN show tonight talking about this phone call hundred percent ... are you getting at all no I'm not if you were saying that\nWe've got audio so it leads to validate it quote unquote ...\nOh oh so what's your name sir I don't feel like saying where are you calling from us not\nWhere was this party had I don't want to talk about that when I was a house doesn't touch and talked about that either\nTell me about yourself no no that's better we don't do that okay\nGreat perfect front page and then we are so so see we're not getting because NBC aired the Julie sweating to interview that they did the other day I literally the it was like a Fifteen minute interview the start of it the reporter says the interviewer says to the camera before they cut off to the interview\nThe reporter says we've been unable to contact or corroborate any of them\nHave you ever claimed we've been able to contact anyone that she names\nBut here's our story anyway or it is so why is this any different no different no different which is\nThought I Would literally say it's fine if we just all in the media and I just said it wasn't just publish whatever we get and you've got to figure out if you believe it or not there that's a good point if that's the yeah and then that's more fulfilling sit here and say well we do with his integrity is just around and we are able to corroborate but anyway yeah come on\nA so why do this why would this person to this whoever it was this is Joe or a female person or a hyper partisan or someone who mental issues are who are who\nAre two reasons to purposes that deserves a first this person is being called accuser number six\nSo now we have here is you could be seven my mom lives were throwing her mom's under the bus or a ... a mom or we were talking about this\nTwo weeks ago with an R. twelve hour car ride a average vowed I tried so hard not to talk about politics are they are ... are there yet [laughter]\nAh she said just you wait more women will come forward\nAnd now if I if I call my mom and talked about this issue ... told you that there are six women now six accusers were zero regard for the fact that this was an anonymous letter no day no time above all by doesn't matter the sixth accuser and where there's smoke there's fire mhm well the most interesting\nTo me about that was when he talked about\nHow you reason with her and said would you want\nYou know my brother to come out and accept that these sort of things could have happened\nIf the he was being accused of them just admit that they could have happened\nAnd she said oh no that's my son's Minnesota's actually real quick or said mom\nOr\nIs it what if someone accused me of doing something like that and she said well that wouldn't happen because you don't drink [laughter] okay what if someone accused my brother\nOf doing this she said oh well she would never do that he's my son [laughter]\nBut Brett Kavanaugh that's a filthy son of a guide and no doubt he would do it now\nCompare that to establish leads to call them the other day who said I have signed up she was a Thirteen year old son right so like I have sons and this terrifies me and I think my conclusion that phone call was for every woman who here's doctor Ford's testimony and has moved because of personal experience whatever there was another mom who was moved\nBy Brett Kavanaugh because they have sons whose life can be pilloried by some anonymous letter sent a camel Harris's office\nWas suddenly someone today and I know it's I mean there's a hundred percent how would you date right now if you were ... ...\nYeah\n... is a ... ... is it is it written contracts mhm\nNo I got a story we never got to start a New York times what was the kicker the story New York times story the woman the guy she was having sex with from a tender boutique all kept coming over\nAnd Everytime he would touch or he would ask for permission every single move right what a dream Boatright guide you this guy does that and then it's like the movies what why did she get upset she [laughter] she got upset days\nLater oh because uh she tried to\nText him again to have sex for a third time third one I okay I had her apartment and you can\nOrder a got upset got upset that he or she ... that he would ignore her and now she's upset about it so she could very easily come back and say what are we took advantage of major bubbles on\nTheir own lawyer guy I'm sure there's text messages of what kind of bad if she says it that way you know season so I'll give you an answer if you really want to answer a answer is how do you what was your question how do you date how do you date if you are I don't know twenty year old maybe a little older I have no idea biblical e\nYeah but\nAt the super super about do we have a oh I Know there there is a viable ... well ...\n... years\nAre here for\nBack [laughter] you should inside your sons and daughters not engaged in the film ever does not have\nSexual relation and actually [noise]\nMaybe not even be in the house or a room alone with\nThis guy by the time so you couldn't even be accused of [noise] you know who am I to me and that shows that limo suffer\nVery nice very good there's a book all about out of date set avoid\nThis kind of stuff and that's why him and said we should tell girls to dress like prostitutes and drink as much as the boys our talk as much\nFreedom that's\nFor up\nTo that one out of seven sixty K. F. it'd be real quick second reason why are they want this letter to go public and the UT what\nPrinted is I'm a because the FBI investigation will not include this dog story so often incomplete investigation Chafee either doctors did it do they do they\nInvestigate this person going along with the address is ... ... well I Know there's no address but uh you're gonna go figure personal I don't know yet but it's going to take some time\nIt would take some time I know but I didn't follow up on that so it's an incomplete westerners that's why they're doing this one out of seven sixty K.

conviction where people have spent years and years in prison for crimes they didn't do\nThat is a major cause of those wrongful conviction is faulty memory somebody can have a false memory or distorted memory and be confident detailed and emotional about something that's wrong\nWow confident detailed an emotional\nAbout something that's wrong so her very first sentence was we all know that as time passes memory fades but Jim call me and the New York times editorial the other day said\nFBI agents no time has very little to do with memory so which is the time had very little to do with memory or is it the number one factor of memory and really dramatically ... ... or hurts our memory it's somewhat or the other\nOkay here's what they did it took the witnesses put 'em in a courtroom or if they're testifying a here they're talking about what color coat\nThe woman who was wearing the younger woman who sues distracting the older man what color code is she wearing and uh they're saying the code is read some guy says it's white um someone says his multi colored they're all over the map they're all saying different things\nBy the way we've heard conflicting information about the hat she was wearing some said it was ... set of said it was greenish and tea or member that cat yeah I mean I think that that's what's crash crash yeah okay and they had it all seems to me it is\nAnd this actually did have a fellow when she started to discriminate your [noise]\nHow 'bout that line I think it was definitely [laughter] a little soft talk 'cause\nIt was definitely I think right so it was really I definitely I think I think you hundred percent ... okay perhaps could have been right I've ... certain though that's what it was a\nSo these are the are these are all the things that the witnesses are set to state and sometimes when you hear one that isn't true [noise]\nThe woman's coat is read\nThe man rotten to the camera on\nThe camera is silver\nWoman's coach is why\nDid you say stop\nOh what if we told you every single one of those statements his phone I was going to\nTestify because I saw the young lady white blazer on\nI'm actually adamant about the fact that her coat was either ... or ... of light will come and\nBefore you know what another guy came and he ran off and there was an object dropped misshapen piece of empty after\nAll of that was real avid a week ago\nOne week went by and every single thing that those those people said there was great confident one woman said she was adamant adamant she was wearing a white coat\nShe was wearing a great cook totally different adamant we're going to take a break come back we're opposite next one after seven sixty KF empty and then of course will relate this to a cabin up but I think you already are vibrant water oh how about this your whole house every faucet perfect\nBought a better than bottled water pristine\nSteen water by awkward for water purification systems family owned company and a manufacturing right here and ... have been around since Nineteen Ninety four great for your health great for the plants\nAnd also for your appliances I Am so you're awkward for water systems in a double life span of your appliances that's all you had the the dirty water\nComing into your I'm washing machine and dishwasher and water heater and coffee pot and it's just going up all the pipes and everything inside of those over not very long time he gets a new clean water from the Oxford pure water purification system of those things you got lost twice as long as pretty good\nPoint and there there was a good or right there yeah so it was a a tall guy wearing a black shirt miles probably a majority want guidelines [laughter] famous thank you for your eye when does does do I really appreciate it or so miles just out of it as an article about nine eleven\nA system do researchers took three thousand people and seven different cities a week after nine eleven I didn't interview with him where were you when I wrote down all the ... the next year came back talked in the same three thousand people the stories where were you when\nWe're only the same sixty three percent of the people to forty percent of the wood sixty to forty forty percent of the people\nAt a completely different story than the original one only a year ago and then every year another four to five percent of people's stories change and now we're Seventeen years later change that's occurring\nWhere were you know I was a at my friend's house or oh I was at school or oh I was at a\nWhich changed totally change because I could almost understand the I don't even gosh that's been a while I don't really remember\nPeriod right yep buttons but no like us here now and then they\nAre yeah so so the first time you turn on the show the story um I was ah I was driving and I heard it on the radio\n... years later I was at my friend's house and I watched the planes ... ... what is [laughter] a series of the researchers that people tend to be particularly bad or remembering their emotions from the time of the attack\nIt's hard to look back at an emotional event without coloring it in hindsight again tape or your um memory is not a tape recorder to compete page you can throw stuff in there are other people can put stuff in there after the fact hindsight\nThe researcher remark that many of the respondents were adamant that the researchers must have changed their original response is because they were a hundred percent certain that they were correct some of this if you're in the study you come back Seventeen years later and they say where we are not eleven you're like oh I was I was at my friend's house and I actually he and I were\nWatching the news that we saw the first plane fly into the tower I'll never forget it it was unbelievable I'm\nSeventeen years ago we asked you where you were and you said you were driving down the street and you heard about it on the radio\nNo no no no\nI was at my friend's house [noise] whose whose house yet Charlie Charlie's house we were watching the news together\nBecause I was going to go pick up my daughter from schools around like they make make up its complete I'm sure\nI like I as I Know you're ... you made that researcher you must be confusing me with someone else while hundred percent sort and I was at my friend's house no Seventeen years ago you said you could listen to it right you know I'm ... I was like that's crazy\nYeah that's right\nOkay so same thing happened with these people back to the story so uh the game is a show called brain games but the video on our Twitter site or radio so they uh had twenty people\nRandom faster buyers are and they set up a little card game little three card Monty on the a ... square in Central Park to twenty people are watching the three ... suddenly a woman this is for everyone was just doing it so sorry if you've been following this for last hour I'm\nA woman about you know ten Fifteen feet away starts screaming at an older man and it's so loud that everyone including the guy planning the cards and does all set up a they all look over at this woman's screaming at the man's mental everyone's watching\nAs this woman is screaming in a different language to this man some guy comes up behind the man pulls open the flap of his bag pulls out a camera and then handed off to another guy and the two guys and the woman split run off in different directions we got a good old fashioned pick pocketing\nThe twenty people thought they were eyewitnesses so what would play it already are them saying immediately what happened\nThere were all wrong what language they were speaking what was it that will language there speaking what race the woman was what she was wearing\nOh that was wrong then they took the to the people and they did uh the old police lineups saying all eight of them picked the wrong person all eight of them picked the wrong person no one picked guy number three which is what was the all picked two to four or five so they were all hundred\nPercent wrong about that ah and then now we're playing a clip of them all in a courtroom and there are testifying about details of what they saw and again they're all wrong about everything they're saying now here's the best part it turns out that there were two of the eyewitnesses\nIn the courtroom or plants\nYes that's they're actors and their job was to prove how easy it is to plant false memories in the other jurors\nNow why am I doing this we'll do this whole topic because James Comey former head of the FBI said and the FBI as the New York times he said yes the alleged incident occur thirty six years ago but FBI agents no time has very little to do with memory\nYou play the beginning a cook one real quick\n\n[noise] let me start to fade right away okay so so which it\nIs it to call me time has very little to do with memory or is it memory starts to fade right away and gets worse every single\nDay that goes by it's one of those two I contend it's the second ... so that's why we're doing this whole thing about eyewitness testimony to begin with but the reason I Want to play this clip here is because of miles can you pull up the second accusers line about six days sorry I should have done this during the break\nUm it is very easy to have\nOther people or\nCulture like yoga is just a barn and you would stuff to take these things or what other people are telling you and then plant them into your memories shockingly easy to do this\nTo be there to do that to other people or to have it done to you will move all added on to us\nYou yeah I Do you have to uh the individual in the piece came forward only because Senate Democrats came looking and he even then the individual went on the record only after six days of carefully assessing her memories in consulting with her turned five or\nSix days of carefully assessing our memory I think we've proven that that's a possibility that's how that works and then consulting with your attorney that's how I met him for a member of thanks thanks to all we'd go to school I used to I was like hey attorney helped me a hard time what was it that happened again what did I study\nOkay so uh there's two actors in the jury hear planting false memories\nThroughout the conversation but it's got to the ... uh\nThey've in show all the jurors what actually happened shown video what happened [laughter]\nWhich by the way real jurors don't get the benefit of Fred sound like in a real courtroom after they make a particular like OK Now let's see what really happened and then I don't know they blew it then they laugh about it that's how it works in real life to go to jail if they're on a here's here's the after effects AS number eight early\nLake witnesses land fake details about the woman's coat and men can run into the minds of the real witnesses witnesses can pick up information from each other that they incorporate into their memory and it can cause an alteration contamination a distortion or even just adds to somebody's memory [noise]\n[laughter] well my oldest will\nCheryl does [laughter]\nAlthough I I was off I don't know what to say I was sure it was like absolutely find\nI don't think I Would testify\nKnow it's Christmas goes than justifies as I saw the young ladies wise laser\nMulti color [laughter]\nI mean nobody think gray\nSo the woman at the end and it was a multi color code and it was a gray coat and then that guy twenty minutes before he was showing the video they've just play that said I you know I'm certain that into the white coat the white blaze was wearing a white blazer and it turned out to be a great code\nRight but the shell is the best part Graham ah so the first to audio here she is the guy to day\nAnd then it cuts into the same guy a week earlier so right after it happened does make sense so so the first clip is the guy today and then it goes back to rate after this pick pocketing happened what he saw it happen to good\nDeals mission succeeded [noise]\nFor you know what another guy changes he ran off and says object drop it seemed like it was a camera back from\nAh I didn't see\nLike he drops his ... as well as has happened cases empty after almost looked like she grabs something of his and went running\nSo there's two witnesses who at the time right afterwards did not mention anything being dropped or said\nNo nothing was dropped and then after they had this memory planted in them by a fake juror they both said yeah the guy or the Goldman dropped it and then someone picked it up and ran right and they ... they were both certain that that's what happened and it didn't\nThis is the ability of all of our memories\nAnd it's pretty terrible so do this what you want as it relates to cabinet all put keeping\nIn mind as people talk about the certainty of something that happened thirty six years ago while drinking go to Kent in San Diego what's going on ...\nHey Mike thanks for taking my call Deborah what are you
