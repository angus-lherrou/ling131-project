on the show and it's not because of just like talking to you it's not 'cause I'm a C. F. A. and see if it can be or do that\nBut we've had a little volatility in the overall markets we have a little bit oh as fact really hadn't noticed so let's talk about that are two things I Want to do I want to talk about current volatility and the overall markets\nWhy the heck knows what's going on and then we'll recap a little bit of cute three okay um because I Want to get into the numbers a little bit more\nBecause I think what the media he or the media likes to put out in what individuals here are ... indices the Dow Jones the S P five hundred the NASDAQ which are very important indices but they're also just half the story\nYou know if a globally diversified portfolio is the U.S in the five hundred them up you know that I'm confused [noise] most people I think should have money across the globe\nIn half bonds and have stocks have real estate how precious metals\nAnd so when someone looks at their overall portfolio they're diversified they might not be as happy to hear the news of their portfolio versus let's say the S. and P. and on the flip side they might be really happy when the U.S and the tanks so\nWe're we're kind of a running into this weird dichotomy in a sense of All right well how can I be happy as an investor first of all you need I Need to figure out what my expectations are\n... yeah I mean I think expectations are key um and I agree with you that globally diversified portfolios make a heck of a lot of sense um I'd push back a little on precious metals as being an investment a not a big fan air for reasons that we can do until later um\nYeah I I think it's all about expectations and in my experience people want relative performance on the upside down the upside they want to outperform whatever index or whatever their neighbors getting and then on the downside they don't care about relative performance any more than one absolute performance and so I always try to move it away from performance to some arbitrary benchmark which is like the S. and P. five hundred it\nBack to performance to plant but if I look at the U.S and people have hundreds that gives me a good decent indication of what the hell's going on in the markets right well it depends on what market\nYou're talking about right I mean we're talking about the ... heck there by the way\nEx termites controls termites while you stay home they're licensed inspectors are

talking about markets today a little bit later on in the show we're going to have a good friend Larry sweater all on a you don't want to miss big lair I'm sure he's got some comments and\nUm she's always fun when markets get a little jumpy on just to put things in perspective\nA but let's do a little bit more of a recap of cute three\nWhat happened what was good what was bad I'm In ... and then we can talk a little bit about maybe what are some ideas that people can deal to position themselves maybe a little bit more defensively I think we've gotten complacent I think recent see by is alive and well over a what's\nDoing well in the past will continue to do but now we see some ... maybe that will spark people to actually take action on their portfolios\nYeah I Would agree at a time to position your portfolio is always before a particularly large correction right and although people get nervous because we haven't seen it recently and they think that Wednesday's eight hundred point down moved three and a half percent was a large decline in reality we're down about four or five percent from\nThe highs and we're still up on the year and so this has not been a particularly volatile market if you look over any kind of reasonable time for him I mean it's almost been dead quiet it it really has I mean\nNow two thousand Eighteen hasn't been as quiet as two thousand Seventy two thousand Seventeen was just a straight move higher with record low volatility she'd on Eighteen we I've had a variety of corrections and what I find interesting about two thousand Eighteen is that it's really showed the schizophrenia nature of market participants in the sense that late January and February the Dow fell almost ten percent based on fear is that the economy was overheating\nThen if you look at march we fell nearly ... percent based on fear is that the economy would slow and now again here are falling on fears that I don't know if people are afraid the economy is going to overheat because inflation is a little bit higher or if they're afraid that the economy is going to slow down\nBecause of ... I think it's a little bit of both in some markets are all over the place causing a little bit more volatility well I mean what is inflation right now you know two and a quarter percent something like that so still historically low um there's a number of forecasts going for it to go a little bit higher\nBut does that have CPI that you're referring to yeah what's the real inflation people say like Eighteen you know I think it depends\nI mean do you want to eat and driving stuff obviously oil prices have gone up but the the reason and we get this question all the time as why does the federal ... talked about core CPI or corn ... without food and energy and the joke is nobody needs to eat or or drive right\nThe reason they do that is because energy prices are really volatile and food prices are really volatile a hurricane or crop report can can changes quickly\nThe Federal Reserve that believes that there's a six month lagging monetary policy so if they raise interest rates are cut interest rates it takes six months to trickle through to the real economy\nBecause of the volatility of the food prices if there were constant react reacting to let's say their most recent hurricane they would be doing monetary policy that by the time it took effect the effects of whatever prompted despite let's say an energy prices would have far far since dissipated\n[noise] so there's fears on inflation spears on China was trying to do [noise]\nWho knows a I think China's sometimes the old\nWinston Churchill quote about Russia about a rental inside of an enigma inside of a puzzle or or whatever to paraphrase that is similar to China um it's really hard to know what is going on inside the the country I'm particularly because I have I my belief is with their economic statistics a lot of times they pick a number they want and then they figure out how to make the data fit it\nUm but by all accounts and a lot of anecdotal evidence is that these tariffs wars are beginning to hurt China and that there is concern inside of China about the fact um trade is more important to them that is the United states and so\nMy personal belief is nobody wins a trade war but to the degree that there are relatively larger losers I think that in the long run China's going to suffer a little bit more\nThe U.S is actually a pretty closed economy as as a percentage of GDP we don't trade that much with the rest of the world to such a big economy and such a big country and we produce a lot of what we need still in the long run I think the idea that will try to quote when the trade war um but everybody suffers when this happens\nSo rising interest rates rise inflation\nAnd then China anything else that's cousin about him\nYou know I I think the other thing is right we've had markets at a relatively fully valid and you mentioned earlier the S. and P. five hundred right the the big us stocks and this technology stock they don't really really well for a number of years right where\nSome of them were being priced not so much on earnings or fundamentals but more on hopes and dreams and reminisce and not quite as bad I don't think is the Nineteen nineties but you remember the Nineteen Ninety eight people were what we think this company at some time will make money so let's value added a hundred times some mythical earnings that it's not that bad these days but still\nI mean look internationally and some other sub attic classes things are not nearly so expensive so value stocks for instance are significantly less expensive relative to historical norms than growth stocks international stocks and developed countries are less expensive relative to historical norms and emerging markets ox are quite cheap they've been cheap for awhile and they had a horrible here and now they're now they're very cheap\nBut the problem is is that no one wants to buy stocks while they're cheap we want to buy everything else whether cheap we want to buy more expensive because it's based on performance so what she means is that it has legs and performance in so we want to buy yesterday's winning\nOffensive because it's based on performance and if so what she means is that it has legs and performance in so we want to buy yesterday's winners today and I heard on Wednesday when the market blew up is that vanguard totally crashed\n... mostly do it yourself investors\nAnd so they're going to end and they're like oh my God I got to sell like what the hell's going on here and it you know if I think that's always going to be the problem\nIs that you would have international stocks that are down but no one wants to buy and that's why I'm an American stocks which are great but because we're an all time highs but then we see a a three percent drop in that one of the largest custodians website blows up because ... and then of course they're not saying because everyone wanted to sell it was just like oh there was of\nTrying to clip or jump in there [laughter] well\nI mean go to them or nobody goes to the mall anymore but when people used to go to the mall right the Wednesday before Thanksgiving attempt Dana friday people are beating each other up to get on the doors because people love a sale financial markets everybody hate the sale and I can't tell you how many times somebody said to me\nI'm waiting for stocks to go up so they're less risky and I'm baffled by that statement if you think about it the value of an investment as a function of the price you pay and what you sell it for the less you pay the more certain you are to get a good return in the more likely already got higher returns so when stocks are on sale you're going to have a far more likelihood of getting better returns and they're far safer\nI I think emotion comes into play so much and uh so that the way to do it has had to have some sort of discipline to have a strategic allegation and in rebalancing some sort of disciplined way because what that does it that makes you sell what's done well and then by what hasn't\nDone as well I was great subprime one last quick question private equity like\nYou know I think a different world right I mean I think a lot of private companies don't necessarily want to go public and so what do you think you know I\nI think the private equity probably has a place in the financial markets if you look Twenty years ago there were seven thousand something us public companies now there's about thirty five hundred so there's a lot more companies staying private\nUm the the problem is it liquidity and then large initial investment so for investors with a higher networks that are okay locking up a portion of their money and can afford to get in there\nUm it it can make sense that the one thing I Would say is that that space is very crowded right now so on a cyclical basis I I think people would want to evaluate whether or not this is the time to to pilot the private equity there's a lot of money chasing a finite amount of deals\nI mean if you could imagine your retirement game plan was no longer about just a number or just about your investments imagine if you could fill in all the gaps in them all the answers to a rock solid retirement plan that everything covered from a to Z imagine what kind of confidence that would bring\nFor a very small handful of listeners on the show today what we're a free meal is a personalized retirement assessment\nYou might expect to pay hundreds if not thousands for the first lesbian announces but for our listeners on the show today is not going to cost you anything in this personalized review get this is what you'll discover highly effective strategy to transform your savings in an income in retirement while minimizing your risk\nAnd that's a tough ... to it it's in some ways those folks are in worse shape than the first group because they're spending is so high relative to what they've saved I mean they're going to have to have a dramatic lifestyle change and a lot of those folks they figured that work forever\nRight right of ... there's a gentleman that I Know he's\nConstantly got a new gig and he's in his final now he's probably low sixties\nRight and he used to travel CEO CEO this company and then the last about the ... the c._e._o. and and so I don't know how we continue to get these jobs either a really good sales guy\nHe hides it on his real you know they just sort of the year for Twenty years ago right how many companies got fifty yeah right it was you know a specialized and start ups and then my blow 'em up and then I started another one up\nThere hasn't been one that succeeded I'm Still doing exactly but he made several hundred thousand dollars a year right doesn't have anything does it hasn't\nSaved and that's that's not uncommon but the third retirement crisis is not one that we talk much about which is what we're sat and talked about so he said okay\nHere's the group of people we made pretty good income son was made a lot of income and we saved a lot and we've partly did that because we're frugal and now we're retired and we don't know how to spell right and so that's actually what he talked about because we all sort of know about the other two\nBut that's I I'm not sure I call it a crisis I guess if it's a crisis it's a good crisis have\nNever the less he was lumping himself in that category so I guess he\nDo it on ... pretty well try to do it then but I I got millions said he said I fall into this third\nSo he was talking about himself and he drives a twenty two year old car and stuff like that you and I have seen this quite frequently to people will have in some cases millions of dollars and they're still clipping coupons but\nEr and stuff like that you and I have seen this quite frequently to people will have in some cases millions of dollars and they're still clipping coupons but and it's like they're one luxury is going to McDonalds what's the ... I mean\nThat's why they have millions yes right but you can't take it with you know that's the thing and so when he was talking about is with this group of people it's sort of as a crisis in a way\nAnd that's where an advisor or it could be it self directed to but it's where it's where you kind of need to look at what is this money really for because it's more than whatever you're going to need service for the kids then great then you invest a certain way if it's for charity great\nAnd a lot of time so we talked to people now I don't really want to have the kids get too much because they'll be lazy\nAnd I don't necessarily want to give it to charity so and then we ask him well what are you going to do and they say well I'm just going to spend it and you and I know that it doesn't happen or not spending it yeah so the point of this is is whether you would call this a crisis or not it's something that you and I have seen many times and trying to encourage someone to spend money is\nAlmost is difficult to encourage someone to save money right you know if you look at a bar bell ... that's the group right now it's like I make a ton of money but I'd love spending I Can't save a time and then you've got this other group it's like man I feel so guilty spending type of dollar yeah yeah\nYou know and so he was talking about the old car now his wife she wanted to get a Lexus\nAnd he kinda ... yeah we we can't tell you that after that ... with us something we do [laughter] but\nAnyway she finally talk them into it and I guess he got like a lower model Lexis and he said I Would never drive that I don't need that for my but therein lies the issue now\nIf you have these charitable interests and and you've got all this money that you want to go to a charity then that's awesome but then why not come up with a lifetime strategy of gimmicks so not only do you get a tax deduction but you actually can see benefits happening while you're alive because a lot of folks will say\nYeah it's all going to charity when I die and it's like well isn't there a little bit smarter way to do this I mean you're not going to be around to see the benefits of all that savings and you missed a huge tax deduction\nYeah there's a lot of other things I think that play into it in maybe what we found is that the problem with people spending is that they just really don't know how long your money's going to last that\nIs the problem and and he identified that none of us know about health care and what that is really going\nBut it's just in case mentality direct cases that happens or that happens or whatever\nBut his contention is yes that's out there but it's not going to be that big humongous expense for most people\nUm you want to be like ...\n[laughter] I have lots of money in that category I but I mean if you could imagine\nIf you're a return to game plan was no longer just about a number right or just about your investments imagine if you can fill in all the gaps in have all the answers to a rock solid return to game plan and have everything covered for me dizzy [noise]\nI mean what kind of confidence that would bring\nFor a very small handful of listeners on the show

can roll over four one K. into an IRA correct\nYou say you don't want to buy a house can I just rolled my four one K. into I'm Alone right\nAnd the answer is no\nAh I'll just tell you that because it's a different it's a different kind of thing that was I looked in the camera Sylvia with us for go anyway [laughter]\nAnyway so you're right so you can you can roll over a four one K. to an IRA and

different things\nYou can't take a four one K. and roll and it's your your home can avoid tax ... so what happens is that the entire a distribution is taxable and we see people make this mistake they

are we making this stuff up [noise]\nNo no not even real yet All right these are legit so to wane Denver, Colorado the high high city\nBy you know maybe they started with a high high kilo Dwayne I'm I'm fifty three years old looking to retire at age sixty Mary Y. fifty we currently have one point five million dollars in retirement accounts I envision eating a hundred thousand dollars a year\nMy question is given those broad parameters what would be a current or a appropriate amount of bonds and ... now and the next five years also we have only a what remaining home dead of about a hundred thirty five thousand dollars which will be paid in full in seven years thanks [laughter]\nAll right uh so do the wings fifty three great question it looks like to retire at age six things at one point five million dollars once in a one hundred thousand dollars from that account what should be his\nStart ... that's a great question so I'm just kinda sorta paraphrase it looks like Duane you're planning on having your mortgage paid off\nI guess by the time you retire which is fantastic so and I don't know ... ... you have to go to the mail yeah I'm really I'm Freda with us today [laughter]\nI says I visited ... needing a hundred thousand dollars I'll see him that's that's over and above her that's not including the mortgage because the markets will be paid or I'm going to make that assumption right now\nWhat I don't know Dwayne is how much you're saving currently so you've got a million and a half and and so the million and a half and we see your calculator record yeah you you calculate while I'm Talking about a million and a half and if you're let's just say you're mixing of four one K. twenty four thousand five hundred dollars and maybe Joe put in six or seven percent something like that what what does that come out to be\nSo if he's got one five and he's got seven years\nUntil you get six percent of the money and Kevin twenty four or five yeah\nAll right let's go with that and then ah so that's two point four million bucks to put for a million dollars in that way and we just got you two point\nFour million I got there was a mix all your four one K. and get six percent over the next seven years and we sort of we sort of want to get her take four percent on that that the Ninety thousand but yeah we'll call it a hundred or more rounded boom yeah there you go what a bond allocation does he need well I think\nYou can play conservative now because the taping it it'd be targets of six percent rate of return yup then he's home free\nNow pie as pensions of Social Security that's going to be gravy on top of that but he's sixty years old when he retired so we've got a bridge that gap chair right so he's got to look for sixty sixty seven potentially to get Social Security or if it's going to push up to ...\nRead to Seventy so so based upon our some ... I Would personally would probably do it sixty four sixty percent stocks forty percent ... yeah I think that's right on the line I think anywhere between forty percent stocks in sixty for ... you probably you probably don't need more than that in terms of stocks and and if you want to play it safer\nAnywhere between forty percent stocks in sixty for ... you\nProbably you probably don't need more than that in terms of stocks and and if you want to play it safe or go fifty fifty and I'm not even opposed to forty percent stocks sixty percent bonds are but I agree somewhere in that range based upon what we know about your situation\nRight because he doesn't answer should for the moon here right he's already done a really good job he's fifty three years old wives' fifty they got a million and a half said\nAnd that's not even including Social Security or pensions so a lot of this as you said Joe might be gravy\nBy it so I think doing congratulations I Would not say All right well a hundred percent stock portfolio or a hundred percent bomb portfolio I think you still need a risk in the portfolio yeah get a target rate of return you need six percent\nYeah there's something else you might think about is if you want to go sixty percent tax now as you get right to retirement you might dial it back a little bit maybe fifty fifty\nMaybe forty percent ... sixty but you still need stocks because chances are you going to live and to when he was going to live in the early nineties so that's Thirty years\nSo it's it's and that's where people make mistakes shows they think OK retire so I Can't take risk anymore because I Can't make the money back but yeah you definitely want to make sure you have a portfolio that she can draw upon in bad markets\nBut the fact of the matter is you may live for another three decades or more and that's your time horizon it's not like one year it's Thirty years or more\nRight and with the amount of information that we have I think that's the best way to kill\nOur advice could completely change if the wing you have um you know a pension at age sixty that's paying you eighty thousand dollars a year you know and you want a hundred thousand bucks so you know now you only need twenty thousand dollars from the overall portfolio then it gets into a little bit different types of the ... well it\nDoes and so now I I think we'd have a more or less more latitude so you don't need to take a lot of risk so if you want to be conservative ten twenty percent equities then fine on the other hand because you don't necessarily need this money what's it for is it for the kids is it for charity maybe take a little bit more risk because you can't afford to write\nIt in ... or maybe you look at it you say you know what I don't know maybe a hundred that's the that's the baseline yeah maybe it is it's going to be a hundred and fifty 'cause we went on a cruise or we want to know it is an honor to listen as soon as the arm and you probably need thirty million [laughter] because you have a catastrophic event that right or is going to happen to you and you know\nI guess the point is there's a lot of variables and we don't really know your situation fully but just based upon what we know probably the forty to sixty percent equities would probably be a good place\nTo go now to wane now let's just stick to ... to the next level here Alan Weil okay we're going to be [noise] yeah because you still have seven years he's fifty three years old he's got a one point five million dollars in retirement accounts you'd never specified alright what type of retirement accounts are these is at all I raise is that all four one K. is is there any ... in here\nUm or does he have a brokerage account that he's labeling for retirement or is everything in a retirement account so if he continues to save the twenty four or five in their retirement accounts it get six percent over the next seven years we just did the calculation approximately roughly it's no guarantees blah blah blah of about two point four million bucks right\nWell if that's all in a retirement account that's all going to be taxable income if you want to spend a hundred thousand dollars a year All right well and then now hey you're going to be in a little bit higher tax bracket if you want it will versus if you wanted to spend that say sixty thousand dollars a year\nAnd then you're going to have Social Security on top of that and if you have any other pensions all of that kind of layers on top of each other or that could pop 'em up into even a higher tax bracket then to use now\nSo that's where the diversification of tax has come in you have seven years so twenty four or five is that savings number or how much of that is he going to be putting into retirement accounts how much should he be putting in a while\nTo the ... conversion makes sense Kenny Broad and at one point five million out to get a little bit more diversification tax wise because if that's the case well then he he doesn't necessarily have to accumulate that much because a lot of it is going to him not to taxes\nYeah and that's a really good point because right now that the twenty four percent tax bracket goes up to three hundred and Fifteen thousand dollars taxable income for a married couple\nIf you had that kind of income last year two thousand Seventeen you're probably subject tell tournament of attacks and you probably weren't a thirty five percent effective rate so this is eleven percent lower tax for many and so and then you think about well\nYou know at this tax law at least at the moment it's going to sunset so two thousand twenty six would go back to the old rates where you might be in the twenty five or twenty eight percent bracket or worse so it's like I totally agree with that it's like make sure you got tax diversification in addition to the the savings plan\nRight so he needs a savings way not much is going to say where's he going to save it right from attacks perspective in then from there what does that elocution look like I think he's given a beef here by saying we'll show me the allocation first well\nThere's no way we would have had\nAs I mentioned over a thousand times of events that have occurred at ten times a year on average in hundred year period where you get reasons for markets to move over three percent and this case there was absolutely no has\nEverything that the pundits are pointed out trade war rests with China rising interest rates the fed had been saying they were going to raise rates four times this year likely three next year everyone knew that for a month\nThe yield curve quite already anticipated that the problem is that we as human beings have this hunger and desire and need to try and find explanations\nOr find patterns when events can be truly random in nature we see this when investor love said some money manager and sees three years of great returns and think that means something when it's highly likely that's purely around the math on\nThe same thing happens here I used to run a foreign exchange trading room for a city ... one of the largest foreigners seems treasures and the world and we used to get calls of course in the media\nWhen we add big moves and the foreign exchange market and we wouldn't laugh about it because some days me coming in the morning and write up a brief terrified bullet points for why the ballot went out and he has five went down in whichever way when we would read it there was no explanation off into flying things\nBut people have this neat and literally as you said there was no news markets happened who knows why it's easy to try to explain things after the fact that often there are no good explanation\nYeah you Larry you did an analysis recently about five percent drops over the last eight years and it's interesting I think our emotions would tell us okay the recoveries coming time to get out of the market but yet in your research at least ... recent research that's not been the case the next six to twelve months I've actually been pretty good\nYeah I look back just to provide a reminder to investors or attempted to panic and sell here to see well let's just look back since the great financial recession ended in March of two thousand nine that bear market ended their eyes look to see how many months we had\nReal losses where at least five percent in the same page that's roughly what the law was over the today's Wednesday and Thursday this week so we had\nSix of those episodes of the average loss\nWas a little over six percent the worse loss was in May of two thousand and ten\nAnd it was eight percent on average the next six months or a turn sixteen percent\nNot outright that's fifty percent more what sixty percent more than the average compound annual overturned and they were turning over the next twelve months was twenty five percent\nObviously two and a half times the Ninety year average and what's interesting as to what these episodes occurred back to back\nSo may twenty hand with a loss of eight percent was followed by June with a lot of five and yeah it's you started from June won the return over the next six months we're still lost nine and a half percent we saw the same thing in August\nOf ... eleven that was down ... points for and September of ... eleven was down seven still if you start six months from August\nKnowing that September ... down and another seven the next six months or so up to Thirteen and the next year was up Eighteen when you look at evidence like that it's no wonder Warren Buffett I by the people that have never tried to find the market\nBut if you can't avoid timing is at least be fearful and others are greedy\nAnd being greedy when others are fearful\nYou don't Larry with this little shake up [noise]\nPeople do get fearful but I think good things happen here I think there's been a lot of complacency with people's investment strategy over the last several years where they might not really realized how much risk that they were taking um maybe they were chasing returns and then all of a sudden you get kind of see the sharp dip\nBecause memories are short it wasn't that long ago where the market imploded\nBut then we get over confident and then all these science has come out and then when you see that short dip maybe it might motivate people to really take a second look at their overall portfolio to make sure it's really doing what it should be doing for their specific goals\nTo raise a very good point now now meaning any point in time is always a good time to your investment strategy taking a look to make sure that\nYou haven't become overconfident make sure you don't have more risk in your portfolio then you have the ability to take because the job security or your investment horizon it's now gotten shorter you're getting closer to retirement maybe your stomach acid is rumbling\nYou thought you could deal with dropped like we had in the last few days but now you can't sleep even if you didn't panic and sell life's too short not to enjoy it\nAnd lastly the last ten years have been so good that many people I've earned returns\nWell above their expected returns so now they have much less need to take risk because they're much closer to their goals and they expected and so we do on a regular basis is Ron\nMonte Carlo simulations and we like to say the least say Ninety percent odds of success and maybe someone ten years ago needed to be Seventy percent equity to get that and today they only need fit the\nWell we want them to take those chips off the table so they can enjoy life and not worry about their markets this is certainly a good time to do it I'll add one other important thing whenever you get drops like this it's really important to take advantage of them\nNot only by rebalancing the portfolio but also looking for opportunities to tax laws father\nBecause for example what happened just in two thousand and I we had massive losses and ... and early on nine we were harvesting Washington having Uncle Sam share the pain especially short term losses\nWhich are more valuable but if you waited till the end of the year which is what I Know many individuals do it on a calendar basis\nAnd advisors do it once a year we don't we we check daily literally to see if their opportunities\nAnd you want a Harvard cells losses because by the end of the air they may be gone and you're miss that opportunity\nTo save in some cases thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars in taxes\nSo great opportunity to reexamine your investment policy statement and also re balance and where opportunities exist harvest losses especially short term\nHey Larry we going to take a short

[noise]\nComeback show you some more soldiers measurable wisdom that you bring the man on a mission to retire early Americans\nOne version and bombs\nSpoke about go do on the radio show today we're trying to cover\nThe sad sad story of why the common person out there or can't get ahead in life and what we're perceptions they have about the world and weaknesses they have the human being to keep them from coming successful\nWe're doing a case study on an email the gentleman sent me about how from his early youth life he's changed his\nHis skill set over and over and over again to try to stay ahead of ah of societies\nWhich were protective logical advancements and he has not been able to keep up now my pick it back up where he says he just became a programmer and he says since there was a lot of demand for programmers back then I was making a lot of money and figured I finally found the courage to rely on those stop right there for a second I was making a lot of money whereas all that money\nWhy Disney on five ten Fifteen houses water on the on the part of a complex where's all the money see this was the thing\nNo matter what you do you think you're going to get ahead because you have a good job in a better job with the best job or an incredible job it's still a job and you earn and you spend in you earn and you spend your earning used bending you're not building any wealth\nYou're not getting anywhere in society and yet you think the world is wrong because they show you up and spit you out\nThat's because technology will always change if you were a guy that made saddles two hundred years ago you probably had a pretty good business or really a pretty good job now you're broke right if you shoot horses back then\nAt a pretty good business or really a pretty good job now you're broke right if you shoot horses back then you had a great job or business are you bro see everything changes constantly\nYou either have to change with it or you have to get out of line of change I'm an advocate you through this show today that you can do one or the other you can either change with it or you can step out advocate away from it by just becoming financially free and not have to worry about where society goes\nBoth of those items work so it goes on and says that was until social media became popular\nNow people can share their ideas on line without needing a programmer or hire a cheap one which I predict would happen some day in the future so I got out of this business so he ran again\nAgain it wasn't a business it was a job I change jobs again I'm a something for nothing instantaneously gravitationally diseased\nGuy that likes to hop from job to job to job or basically type a personality to not be so brutal does you know what uh type a personality as it's somebody who will throw mud on the wall and hope something sticks he changes\nHis mind or her mind over and over and over again they start a thousand project finished none of them right these are the typical Taipei People\nThat are up there just always looking for a way to make a fast buck there's no investment in the future in this type of mentality none what is it done to invest in his future and why should he deserve do not have to work hard for the rest of his life he's done nothing to change that outlook\nGoes out and says I figure I Need to have the skill where I Do not have to compete with the whole world that is high demand\nTo think about that statement I now figure I Need a skill that I don't have to compete\nWhile\nIs that not complete and total giving up\nI mean that's just I gave up I Need your skilled is so low that no human being would want it there's no competition for this job right and so because there's no competition for the job to job is so terrible\nThat I'll be safe and [noise] right\nSo what did you do then became a truck driver\nPush I'm currently doing a lot of it except now I hear about how they're making driverless cars and semis which I'm sure we'll workplace our job one day\nYeah one day they will and when they do you'll still be broke\nYou'll see still be looking for another job\nAnd you know until they make guys that clean toilets there's going to be a lot of janitorial jobs around maybe they'll make a robotic ... Sunday then you lose that job too but what have you done to invest in the future and by the way why does he like driving a truck I'm driven trucks before\nMass of solitude no competition\nNo argumentation nobody to deal with\nYou just sit there by yourself in total solitude don't have to interact with the world boy nice job great job do you make any money no we have a future know what happens when you can't drive anymore yes you'll be out of work and broke\nIt goes on and says here's the reason for this email I hear you on the radio recently stating that you are expanding nationwide and opening up new officers in other states that's a good thing for your business since you're already successful and say that you have more money than you will ever need\nI just wonder if you grow so large and add thousands of do preferred members that your second deal\nThat the second a deal comes available it will be gone within two seconds due to so many people doing going after it\nWell my friend that's already true\nGood deals don't last when there was an opportunity to make a hundred percent return it doesn't matter if we had ten people or ten thousand people the deals are going to be sucked up right but the reality is that what you're talking about is you're talking about the abundance mentality or lack there of you believe\nIn a zero sum game reality of the world you believe for me to have a dollar I have to take it from you for you to have a dollar you have to take it from somebody else that that there's not enough dollars to go around that simply isn't true\nAnd I'm going to cover it after I finish a paragraph here says or worse a multibillion dollar company will see what you are doing and duplicate your business model and spent millions advertising worldwide to point to the point where no houses or apartments will be available as investments since they will be bought before you can even see it\n[noise] uh let me tell you a little secret no one's going to duplicate this business because lifestyles does something that no corporate America company could ever duplicate\nIt gives back it has the abundance mentality and believes that doesn't have to have all of the business\nIt believes that can give it away to its customers lettuce customers become rich instead of it becoming rich in other words I could have been Donald Trump I could have said I Want to own all of us real second talk people investing in me I get on billions and billions of dollars of apartment complexes\nWith all the members I have but I was not interested in me being a billionaire I was interested in my members becoming millionaires and so instead of meat taking all the millions and adding up to billions\nWe taught people's go out and burn the millions and we help them do that\nNo corporation in America can be founded on that kind of generosity it's impossible no company could ever survived that business model except my why\nBecause I've already rich before I started in ... I'm not greedy and you just won't find that many people that are that way right most people go to work because they want to make money that you you go to work every day because you want\nTo make money I go to work every day because I Want to help people and I don't go to work every day that's the beauty of it I own a business that is out there I go to work on the radio one hour a day I go to work\nA once a month or two a two day just so I stay involved with my members and know that the message is still tight\nSo\nYou think another corporations can allow somebody to do that I don't think so and so your premises wrong from there but it's even more wrong in another way which I'm going to cover when we come back from this next break because that lack mentality lack mentality that you're carrying is so absolutely\nYou say the real estate pies big enough for everyone but it's not the whole world is confident and educated enough to spot great deals now it's not if everybody can spot the great deals what he's saying no you're absolutely wrong\nFirst of all the deals that we do it lifestyles many of them could not have been done most of them could not have been done if they weren't done his partnerships so if it wasn't for a group of people being educated light mindedly to are they all understand the investment in a business\nThey're not working in the business is not a job they're investing in a business that is an ongoing concern that as a product is pretty hard to outdated self because think about it for just a second\nWhere did they get in that way for us to vaporize ourselves to go to bed at night and sleep we have to have a place to lay our head down at night to eat our dinners et cetera et cetera so until they have vaporize Asian\nWe have housing that where the vapors Asian guess what I'm going to invest in vapors Asian\nRight but until then\nHousing has been around forever and probably will be around for a lot longer\nOkay so here it is the guy saying do you could steal all the deals no I couldn't steal all the deals because if I didn't have a group of like minded people we wouldn't have enough money to go out and do all the deals\nNow the next point he's making is once we teach all these people all over the world how to do this there's not going to be enough deals now here's a reality\nI've been doing this in Houston, Texas for Thirty years\nAnd we're still doing deals at a higher rate than we've ever done 'em out before\nSo that part is why we went to Dallas we've been doing it there for Fifteen Years\nStill doing deals at a faster rate than ever before San Antonio Austin the same thing but now you have to understand is for twenty six years in Houston I've had lifestyles\nWe still have even touched the market we put a dent in the microwave scratch the edge of the market\nBecause there's so many apartment complexes there's like three thousand apartment complexes in years to three thousand in Dallas three thousand San Antonio and Austin and that's only just Texas\nThat's not count middling\nNot counting the nine and we own down in Corpus Christi et cetera et cetera so here's a point when we expand to a new area like Atlanta where we're going\nThat whole city has Thirty Years' worth prospect of action for us we haven't even began it just like when they told us when we were in high school when I was in high school the stupid idiots told us there was Twenty years of oil left\nTwenty years and that's it would be out of oil\nThat's the lack mentality now there's a hundred years of oil left in each of about five countries out there right in each of fog and in fact there's probably a hundred years while in two or three states in this country just one state and yet\nWe still believe we have an oil ... you know\nWe believe that there's so many apartment complexes that if we signed up as many people as we have in taxes in every other state union they're still being a business for them to do that and that will be ten lifetimes before that happens\nBut my point is is with all of that said where they're being true to disguise totally miss the mark with his email my point you is how sad is it for him\nBecause Syria is now thirty six years of age\nAnd here's what he believes it seems like the only secure jobs for those who are not already rich are the ones that take many years of sacrifice and credentials such as being a doctor or lawyer which is something that everyone is willing to do that is the demand will always be high\nThere it is the only thing you can get rich doing as being a doctor a lawyer\nA thing that which most of us are not willing to do both he just nailed it for himself didn't ...\nHey I'm happy that I'm not rich I'm unhappy that I haven't been successful my whole life but I'm not\nWilling to either go do something that would put me in a position that couldn't be copy or number to stick with anything and get better at it like I should have got better at electronics I should have got better at program but I didn't I didn't I didn't I just kept running and now I'm a truck\nDriver wow he goes on and said I just wanted to see if you could perhaps way my negative way of thinking about this says it's a very since it seems that every money making opportunity will eventually go way of the buggy whip\nThink about it every money making opportunity he spoke of was about work there\nWas about labor it was about doing something to somebody else\nDoesn't want to do and it's that belief system which is killing them think about it if you would have started investing when he was Twenty years old and real estate doll houses that I bought twenty six years ago are still there\nIt would have started investing when he was Twenty years old and real estate\nDoll houses that I bought twenty six years ago are still there\nPeople are still living in I don't know because I'm like this guy I progressed in my knowledge of my business so I went from houses duplex is the four Plex his small apartments to medium size apartment the large apartment\nI progress much skill set knowledge base right now I'm trying to do class a apartment I'm pushing myself to progress my skill set because I Know that the old stuff will eventually be old too old to using the new stuff all have to understand so I have to be on the cutting edge ... got to be on the cutting edge of the business\nBut this gentleman doesn't want to be on the cutting edge he doesn't want to do anything he wants to go backwards he wants to trade time for money secondly he has no assets the businesses will have assets\nAs inflation occurs our assets go up and ... as income goes up rents go up the acid value goes up\nWe keep growing he keeps having to pay more money his job income gets watered down by inflation\nOr asset values get increased by inflation by friends this gentleman's life has been lived behind the prism of the negativity of failure and we don't know if there's any\nPossibility that you can never be saved she's asked for help and I took this email today live this morning and I'm given to it back alive today I Hope he's listening to a short break

later\nAnd I want to talk just briefly for I get to your phone calls about the data breach at Experian\nIf you're not aware\nUm experience I had a flaw\nWith how people log into their accounts at Experian that specifically affected people who have gone to the extra steps of putting in place or credit freeze\nAnd so the problem with it is that the pen code that you use potentially is exposed\nAnd so when I had been recommending and what we recommended at Clark dot com is that you go if you do have a security freeze in place with Experian that you go on their website and that you change your security pat\nAnd it is\nA quick pre seizure to do so it means that if in fact your number was expose ... he'll be able to change it and put yourself back solidly and the deep freeze the danger is obviously\nBut we we actually talked to them about that and they're just she um she didn't finance I'm In banking and and it just wasn't any opportunities like that um they invited her to come back once you know she wants to re enter the workforce but they just don't have any positions like that available right now\nAll right you said you said some in key there her expertise is in

little bit and if she was working ten to Fifteen hours a week and working from home doing that\nIt deals with a lot of the costs squeezed because you don't have the daycare costs great deals with some of the loss of income so a little bit of her saying active in the workplace and bring in income peak creative on that because that's where I'd really like you know what\nI mean when you start looking

might have to can that for now right\nAnd that's kind of what I Would\nHow would I Would think yeah if you if you have to do that you have to do that for now but I Love the idea her staying
