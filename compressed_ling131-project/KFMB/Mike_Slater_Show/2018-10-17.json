of course deliberate bottles of this is always yes but he's the president well guess what he got to the presidency by being exactly there [noise] so stop with this expectation that Trump isn't going to be Trump\nA ... because I Want to I Would like a more Bush like president\nI didn't get to vote for a more Bush like president in the general but guess what when we've had a Bush like president these same media outlets have bludgeoned in Philly they won't be the you know they they wouldn't be you wouldn't get credit\nFor his kindness and decency just like my parents this is Mike Pence be he was he gets ridiculed\nSure about it about pretty much anything they interesting story about parents so I touched on this last half hour some Marc Short who is the legislative a senior analyst advisor to the president up until a couple of months ago we went to new university gig he'll be back he'd worked for parents\nUh back when he was governor and and so forth came on during the campaign and as a as a really great guy got a lot of legislation done even with all the supposed chaos and the administration so we had him out of one for young Americans foundation yesterday\nFor key supporters and he was talking about how he did like the tweets either\nYou know he was like I was cringing a a vice president Pence or what candidate bounce back into that or you're not going to do this but Trump does and then he kind of grew to I'm\n... to understand that not necessarily approve of it all the time but a case in point he told his story of this meeting yesterday about when the production of the Broadway show Hamilton happened and Pence was there with his wife remember that and the ...\nThis meeting yesterday about when the production of the Broadway show Hamilton happened and Pence was there with his wife remember that and the ... they turned around and addressed life president tests and then they lectured him from the stage\nRight so after the show is over\nYeah so that goes on and so some of my front Marc Short is with the president when that happened and he sees this\nHappening they get the the news report about the vice president being shamed publicly in the theater in front of the attendees or by the cast lectured about everything and Trump reaches slowly\nOver into his pocket of his jacket polls up the phone in March or and saying oh my goodness\nThis is and he gets this the president gets his big smile on his face and he starts typing and dictating out loud like\nHamilton a third rate or whatever was a Broadway show shame the vice president and then he just he was just having ... when he did he know exactly what he was doing\nIt was like this whole mess with their heads and it also take a stand and draw a better line in the sand in many respects to the media than Trump or than Obama withdraw for Syria and the sad\nSo he does this and then apparently one time he told them he said he said ya market I think a myth that nine out of my ten tweets are are accurate so okay\nSo that that that reveals I think what is really going on it's not that he's crazy like they want to portray and he's crazy sitting on the toilet at three in the morning and setting out tweets it's different that I don't have to like it\nBut it does the it does what every president's been trying to do since the first president change the narrative control the story\nLike it or not well and I think they would say uh\nSomehow that he is he's making a mess of it and that's what they find so intoxicating about it\nIs they all launch into this and nobody in the news from ever goes you know he wants you to do this right he wants you to get all upset about horse face because he knows that his backers are going to laugh\nAnd then they're going to laugh again and how upset you get I mean the the reality is again let's recall Stormy Daniels was welcome down to the set a Jimmy Kimmel live where Jimmy Kimmel held up a plate of little orange mushroom penises and said which one's the president\nSay yeah yeah yeah I sort of a sudden I missed that episode yeah so\nHow is she on deserving of abuse\nOr she of course picked a tiny squat little one and they all laughed\nAnd then Jimmy Kimmel said I think we've gotten farther than Bob Woodward so while I'm you know the idea that these people and of course the here's the important part\nYou ... you know most people haven't heard of this I mean obviously it aired on ABC it a twelve thirty in the morning but none of the you know the way all the networks jumped on Jimmy when he was going to talk about his son Billy getting heart surgery and thank God for Obamacare everybody covered that\nYou know it didn't cover him being a jerk with Stormy Daniels ... so they're that they're you lack just at least a little bit of context about how they would make fun of her appearance I don't think they need to make fun of her appearance or I'd rather make fun of the parts of her appearance that she had sculpted in an operating room\n[noise] right and there's real well if you went there to enjoy it I Can't believe I'm saying I Can't believe I guess I said that I'd rather have been been good there yes he said that well at any rate um yeah that's a double standard in and instead you get the effect here's a clip this is that your body Don Lemon and\nAt one of the Cuomo's which are which ... Chris ... is talking about this it's over a news busters dot org is you know 'cause you're the executive editor there but the asking hey what about the way Trump which I'm sure glad they don't go low they go high there are CNN here's what they said in this all after this this particular\n... barest to say that we you know the men and women who are in the senior pardon my team we had to keep adding things and taking things away 'cause we kept for getting\nOf what he's already said because he's flooded the zone with ... pistol\nAbout women and we couldn't even keep track yet nine out of ten Republicans love him anyway\nYou know when I I'm a couple of times on on this show when I interviewed him I said oh my gosh I thought his chances of even becoming a nominee or or because you remember the quote who's doing the raping Don somebody's doing the right thing\nGot past that one and then when he said about making Kelly said blood coming out of her eyes coming out of our wherever that was on this show and I said okay well I went home thinking I've ruined this man's chances because it came on the show and he said that soundbite didn't happen\nSo listen we know this is built into\nSauce uh for\nAnd I think people know that but it's that we have to keep pointing it out it's awful but here's a bigger question okay and I don't usually like to talk about people's look\nDesigned them near the CEO has he he keeps talking about people gaining weight\nAnd how people look has he does he owned a mirror that doesn't have as a lean over it or a or a ... I mean all you have to do is look in the mirror Donald Trump is no prize and if I were him not that I'm One either I Would keep my thoughts about other people's looks to myself\nAnd let us talk about it on CNN that's done lemon the person of interesting haircut well the well and\nThen run it they had just run to to to add some context so they said just Cuomo just run like you know twelve clips\nIncluding you know two thousand five the Access Hollywood tape a bunch of this stuff from twenty Fifteen ... it with a lot of it was this was was old stuff in ... and most of it pre presidential\nUh and and of course the devoid of context that when he says the leash a shot to put on a bunch of weight well that's one that scientifically true she got the prize and put on like fifty pounds which for any beauty pageant would be a ... at least an issue\nUm but they always leave out the part that what was that we remember her Alicia Machado had like a drug lord boyfriend and there's all kinds of like horrific stuffing and her background and CNN interviewed her like she was Mother Teresa and never you know they didn't want to\nDeal with that sort of stuff but you get the I Love the part where Don Lemon says I thought I destroyed him on my show\nBut ... and that's where the rise of nuts that's what ... what they're trying to do and that's also why they'd rather talk about that than for example\nTalk about the what seems to be increasing number of Republican candidates getting allegedly assaulted by a left wing protesters which are which is being ignored by many of the big networks you read that story it's at the top of news busters dot org is well return Graham is the\nExecutive editor thank you Jim stay safe or a Shia determine hey I'm ...

...\nAnd try to try and again he's a he's busy he's cranking out to ... maybe ... beautiful during the fall season\nA micro just posted moments ago the or they just started a couple of years about the New York times offering a confused indictment of the Trump empire which is nothing new for the times but the opening line as Democrats these days are heavily into archeology\nAnd we don't think it's because of their leader of the house represented Nancy Pelosi of Seventy eight\nMore because they're digging into the past means they can interpret any evidence they dig up pretty much as they please stop I'm the same issue you have the same kind of thing with with Trump people interpret things is the truth\nOne moment that it's not a it's worse on the other side I think\nAnd it talks about how the latest investigation that they're afraid Trump and well Trump's father he's been dead for how many years\nAnd so I'm\nNancy Pelosi as ... talk more to Mike Reagan above them just a little bit as we find him in the ... century or\nA Nancy ... she was quoted as saying so she's she's training in on this Stormy Daniels um the tweet fest back and forth is that it\nUm she says she's talking about the border wall\nAnd she said in her briefing there was this her audience were they came out last night uh-huh uh you can and you have a right to do that now see we don't hate America you can say any ... anything you like\nProblem I realize you don't offer the same thing to the opposition party many times that's alright magnanimous so she said this is roll call dot com and a report on this Nancy Pelosi the house minority leader who would like to be the speaker again should they get the house back heaven forbid in the fall\nSo there's nothing that she would trade for President Trump's border wall\nI thought they keep saying that north shore will come out and say we're willing to work\nTogether and then and then right\nExcept which normally means if we're willing to cooperate if you give us everything that we want we'll give you nothing you want but then we'll call it cooperation so this is where she's turning the smell sounds like the talking points are out there not because you're talking about Trump's manner so she was discussing this ah the Harvard\nKennedy School Institute of politics than close he said it happens to be talking about the border wall it happens to be a man who they shoot for the president building a wall and I'm not interested in that she emphasized Democrats do support border security really prove it but they ... some do maybe\nDefinitely learned some

E. G. W. A. Y. us these are the ones with the average you describe ... they've got the band like it's a bicycle that stands up straight\nYeah stands up straight and you look kind of dorky when you're riding around on 'em and they were all the crazy hours don't make fun of people who writes ... he's a ride one last week anybody does it's one of the it's like ... and Michael Dukakis back in the day running for president getting to a tank with a helmet I looked like Snoopy alive Snoopy but Dukakis wasn't there I Know Snoopy\nSoup is a friend of mine Michael Dukakis your nose Snoopy but it looked dorky is what he did with all due respect I'm southern\n... I have not seen the same ways to be that much of a problem I see them in groups of people you don't see people like with one scooter or one for one of those by\nWind bikes or whatever so David Derek over the union hype and Tribune and breaking this down San Diego plants to crack down on local segue tour operators all this because the lawsuits see that's the deal so as soon as we find out who was tripping over which doc was vehicle then then that's when just give it time\nThis is after the one point seven million dollar injury settlement in June and another lawsuit filed last spring claiming they protruding sidewalk caused the death of the Segway rider two years ago\nI again anything you do can cause the horrible things to happen right if something comes up like oh there's a bad sidewalk and then I guess that's ... yeah I'm a bad speaking of the infrastructure realize how many sidewalks they can cause injury are out there are trees that can fall on your heads are\nSo the ordinance is proposed by city officials so I guess that's probably why I became a media because it was about death and destruction and hey we're getting sued again I've asked the mayor actually about this I asked how many we have a lot of lawsuits over these ... contractions that's a big word and\nAs they are getting sued all the time so I don't know what the number is but you know there are some\nWalk out of a business and somebody just dropped the stop and you're on your face\nSo the ordinance proposed by San Diego officials would require segue tour companies says to UT to apply for special permits follow safety procedures and obtain commercial liability insurance at least two million per case for a million per year so they got into this and the budget discussions yesterday at city hall\nThey think it'll shrink the number of injury crashes by again where's that shouldn't be uniform for any of these things not just said ways\nBecause you know that's that's a problem up there to happen plus the I Know Dr spike scooters whatever\nI still think if that's OK to just go ahead and do that what other stuff could we rent just start putting appliances out on the\nCourt\nUntil they dismantled like we see some of them were enterprising urban outdoorsman to\nBreak into small groups and discuss what'd you seven sixty talking breaking news Mike Reagan will join us after the bottom of the hour

I'm not saying it's wrong for him to do that but the fact is that the Democrats lied and they never stop why they're always lying and unfortunately there's too many people who buy into their up into their lives\nAnd Mike Reagan was that Reagan world on Twitter is where you can find my ... sixty talking breaking news you know Trump said in this interview on sixty minutes the other day and a lot of things\nBut that talking about do you trust that he just said do trust everybody in the White House I don't trust everybody says I think that's as honest as you can be the White House is a lot of people who are technically in the White House around the White House a lot of staffers\nTo here comes another story this is um the Treasury Department which is right next door to the White House is you know a treasury employee\nOr as Fox News dot com treasury employees been arrested and charged with leaking multiple reports about financial transactions\n... he's a former Trump campaign T ball men of foreign campaign official Richard Gates accused Russian agent uh Maria what's her name but Tina and the Russian embassy federal enforcement officials said today\nA Natalie Mayflower sours Edwards is\nAccused of illegally photographing suspicious activity reports which are sent by banks and other financial institutions to uh to alert law enforcement to potential illegal activity and then we can them to the\nPress so once again that proves the point you can't I don't think your dad ever\n... trust that everybody in the White House when he was president right mystery only\nThe only person my father trust in the White House has one but he went to bed with every single night dancing I mean and that's the only person\nThat you know Donald Trump I trust are members of his family other than the members of your family no nobody's trustworthy 'cause they're all taking notes so they can All right the books\nYou know before during and after what happened you of of the Trump presidency and they're all they're all kind of doing that so\nYou know it it is what it is a it's Washington DC the home of the leaks and people who you bring in a get caught up it also follow the money when there's a lot of money available\nPeople will turn on you instill ... yeah\nUm there's also the ah\nThe question about where things go with the Saudi Arabia deal which sounds uglier by the minute this ... I Would probably became well according to one report like ... literally unfortunately\nUh when he went into the council of that and then why anybody that's a whole separate thing why anybody who knows the Saudis don't like what he's been writing would go to the consulate in Turkey and then figure that's all going to end well that just in that ... it doesn't happen that way but\nIf all of a sudden we find out that this was known this is determined by the Saudi Government than the top a member of the royal family as culpable\nAgain you can't you can't blame Trump for that that's more of a Saudi issue but how does the handle is ...\nYou can't blame them for that but you can say about Donald Trump to eat quite you know what happened in the last couple of three weeks with the Supreme Court nominee to to say and and and\nPlay the same card with this outings are is his was just wrong with the United states I mean the fact the matter is these new Supreme Court justice had no history of doing these\nAh remotely wrong in his entire life except maybe drank in college which\nEverybody except maybe one person listening to your show getting rank and file\nAnd what's the name of that one I Want to name who's that one person\nMisses the larger [laughter] well that's the only person I Know who probably didn't drink and God Knows what\nThe reality is that we know the Saudis had been deep into trouble for a long time and we look at nine eleven how out on balls and that so\nFor the United states go out and make the statement that he made equating you know what went on with Supreme Court nominee and what's going on with Saudi which Willie\nOff ramps so what if that turns out to be that Saudi Arabia knew this from the very top and Trump says hey let's not be too hasty and whatever it is a very delicate obviously there are ally and they're also the ally were Nineteen twenty hijackers September eleventh two thousand one and I came from various extreme pockets of\nSaudi Arabia is this like go work in both worlds kind of like Arafat did the middle east and to say one thing one group or another thing to another\nPet a China does that now as well um but then it's a diplomatic crisis ended and there aren't a lot of our friends in that region so then what\nWell ... states has to figure it out it's in his court there that's where the ball is used to have to figure out what he is going to in fact has to do because you have to punish Sally in some way for what what they have done\nI mean the United states does offer reporters and fake news all the time\nBut you do not close your eyes when a reporter even though the Washington Post is\nMurdered as this person\nIs reported to have been murdered unique to stand up for that and that First Amendment rights that they have even though you don't like they read and what have you in our country about you\nYou still stand behind you know the press the media and those and those reporters too many of them are dying in this war that we've been happening since two thousand and one and for the smarter take place and it's the Saudis knew about it\nAnd you know something nobody walks into a Saudi embassy in Saudi doesn't know about it or they're gonna have to pay some kind of price uh for what after to show my\nGreg and with those at Reagan world on a on Al Gore's Internet on Twitter as you see what the nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan said about and this this has to deal with the same neighborhood talking about middle late in the middle east and support for Israel or not he had his um\nHis big gathering in Detroit on Sunday and then he has now been tweeting since then some of these coming out twenty third anniversary of these so called million Man March which was a stretch but he went off in another attack on Jews calling them well what are you said was I'm not an anti tweeted this Farrah Khan did I'm not an anti Semite I'm an anti termite\nAs it is is right there he says at one point he said then the speech that he posted quote to members of the Jewish community that don't like me thank you very much for putting my name all over the planet I'm\nNot mad at you because you're so stupid when they talk about Sarah can call me a hater you\nKnow they called me and as I say I might stop I'm an anti termite I don't know nothing about hating somebody because of the religious preference\nWow what yeah you're actually give any more for essay but he also giving that's thank you thank you very much well I got Louis I ...

E. L. S. Y. S. dot com\nOr another you know\nThe only\nWay for me to talk with your fever here this is talk talk talk about listening to\nReasons why was automotive also we're twittering where we are listening to the um seven sixty\nDays ago a game on call on his running for office was you know someone who's running\nFor office told them calling and I were going to be doing this the old shortly so start off with a missile Rebecca Jones who's running for the mayor of San Marcos for a Buckeye are you today\nI'm great how are you today wonderful good to talk to your eye or live near San Marcos travel through often so I got to bring up selfishly the most important thing for me a grown up to Fifteen getting on the Seventy eight Rebecca what are we doing here what's what's the deal I was ... hard to go there and do things in ...\nWhen you can't move\nI hear you and I hear this every day when I'm Talking to citizens so the Seventy eight all those dollars uh to uh work on that is all decided down in sandbag but you know it's a regional transportation and planning agency so\nIt's important to have a someone on that board representing San Marcos that has a relationships with other elected officials because we're going to get that done recently [noise]\nWe're actually moving forward right now I'm with the dollars on the environmental impact report to Lance of HOV lane one from the Fifteen onto the Seventy eight and one from the Seventy eight onto the Fifteen which will be significant\nAnd so we are moving forward with that and then comes a after the environmental done then we can move forward to actually securing the dollars to uh work on that and get those ah to come to fruition and the great thing is they actually land right around a I'm a ... valley road so that'll be a significant out for a city\nOf working on that and I do have a lot of support 'em regionally a down at Santa with a lot of the mayor's so that's an important a relationship or to have definitely having the support of those other um agencies or\nYour mayor or you want it to your point someone said their city council members\nGenerally it's the mayor and so yes I Would be I'm actually on the board of directors right now because I Am the I'm chair of north county transit district though I don't get to vote or I get to be kind of part of the conversation\nRobert Gray argue there's when you're ready to hit the ground running with that I Am and that's a that's a big one so the cat is a U.S one more Rebecca Jones from ... what are you going to present martyrs\nWell I have a lot of well you you talk about traffic that's actually one of my main focal points because that's what I hear from residents\nIs our biggest challenge and I'm all about the solutions I don't think that um if you don't have a plan if you don't have a plan you're not going anywhere so my plan is to implement a dynamic\nSequencing lights which is artificial intelligence I've been working on this about a year and I'm very excited to hear that now when I was at the U.S\nAntakya meeting this past friday we were talking about that dynamic sequencing life which is smart lights uh the artificial intelligence so now that we're talking about it than that gets very important because that's how you get the regional dollars to pay for this technology\nIt's not cheap it's about thirty five to forty thousand per intersection how yeah but you know the great thing is actually one of our last a land use a decision that two hundred and twenty ... subdivision I was at the council member that\nSaid to the developer hey can we get to the pay another over two hundred thousand dollars that you don't have to pay to implement this technology they went in the back spoke about it came back and said yes we'll live for it and will do that\nSo it's being able to show 'em that you've got a plan being able to ask the difficult questions and finding you know partners that will work with you on that on implementing\nThe technology I live in an area where those and that is a total game changer and it really is and and you know I'm\nReally excited now that said that's talking about that because we can't just put in a bunch of the lanes and take people's property that's eminent domain I I don't believe in doing that and uh it just doesn't it doesn't work and so really the technology is how you're going to\nA a really work on that\nYeah you could never get a certain percentage more people on the same amount of roads right now with ... just wing it um what is a really got started what's your background I actually\nSaw their homes are real estate and then I also uh uh started a company with my ex husband uh and tooth I'm Sorry in Nineteen Ninety seven uh that became very successful and we had about a hundred million dollars in sales\nLast year and a you weren't doors by the Republican Party is that right\nI Am and also the deputy sheriffs association like I said many marriage throughout the county a lot of a community members that have been around for a long time to ah pass city managers the current mayor a current council member and then also to pass Maris court case Smith and doc Britain\nBeautiful Rebecca Johnson you very much for your time for sure thank you so much to have a great day as well Rebecca don't know I was in door by\nA Muslim but if you can also\nGot it so who's the current person in this Campbell Harris used to have that job right\nThat's correct um Jerry Brown appointed a hobby of Bush Sarah who is a or was a a a relatively obscure congressman from Los Angeles who had the practice law is a state ever as a the current attorney general\n... give us a one thing a judge Steven Bailey attorney general would be a priority you would have over here\nAre the number one thing is to light fare and objective ballot titles\nSome good ones I like\nThe poster child to that is what they did to proposition six on the repeal of the gas tax you read their ballot title and some I Know you never know what the actual intent of that and\nIt is known as if I can pull it up exactly so that so the attorney general who writes those rights\nRights and has according to the courts now I'm we're exclusive authority to item any way they walk\nAround here to California proposition six voter approval for future gas in vehicle taxes and twenty six twenty Seventeen tax repeal initiative\nYou find that not enough or know\nWhat it actually is telling you is that you are going to be removing money that is going to fix roads and bridges and the reality is um that there's not a penny that's earmarked for new roads I'm ...\nPercent of the money in ... six a lower and lower SP one which is what we're attempting to repeal is even a dedicated to a\nA road maintenance and balance of it is to a higher bureaucrats and um you know five Parkland supports the bullet train to know where\nYou know I I that's a great point the we haven't really talked about that the attorney general bias Lee writing the props and titles ah two quick questions real quick um I I ride my bike magic mirror Second Amendment guy\nAbsolutely\nAnd that's why is that if I get a man that\nIs fundamental protects you in in the constitution\nFor all of us and what's happened in California is that the current attorney general and the politicians Sacramento\nSpend all their time chasing after law abiding citizens by the way there's a list of ten thousand gallons um who are known to cause as firearms that are not a priority at all for this current attorney general\nHe's the sole person responsible for going after those balance he's not doing his job\nSecond question is about pro life uh and this is actually an important thing for an attorney general because the most recent abortion Supreme Court case was called ... verse but Sarah probably just the one that had to do with the ... center in Oklahoma and uh and fall broke here so what's your position on uh on on\nAbortion strong pro lifer um believe that it to um [noise]\nThat you know I think well versus Wade probably as the U.S Supreme Court's going to continue the dog but my preference is is that we would have no abortions\nAnd they are uh I like it where it's not what's the website judge\nW. W. W. Bailey for age ... dot com that's be why F. O. R. A. G. dot com\nPrimary things just appreciate you thank you have a good day judges endorsed by California pro life that's why I asked that question um I I haven't\nDoor St judge Steven Bailey\nWow wow later so indoor ... we you know listen judge or if you want we like we do like judges like um a lot can get a set of some trouble um we will endorse you speak on behalf of American miles and miles show guys triple and don't do\nWell we'll for two hundred bucks that's right to hundred bucks is that what the price and I don't well it will give him was the two hundred a piece or we can do a package deal and do ... miles in every show\nFive hundred fifty fifty dollars three fifty for it to for okay now\nI don't\nTake the lower your shirt or from a legal well sure listen hardly ever Sarah could indoors if I may okay All right well we'll see how this works out to be harsher Nordstrom is running for San Diego Unified School but Marcia how are you\nGreat good to talk to your Marcia a Sin City of Unified School board uh this is a if nothing else I take\nEric's uncle who is your uncle approach with my grandpa was your grill\nUh this is the ... if nothing else I take Eric's uncle who is your uncle approach with my grandpa who is your grill a lot of stuff going on as smart as young as ... please excuse the language for kids but ... miles which was a was a\nA no on everything and vote in the hell out okay now that's starting [laughter] that's all I'm saying I'm not saying that's always true I think that's always true so Marsha who\nAre you running against the San Diego Unified School board\nSo thank you for having me on your show my wife and I am running against my book worry\nAbout is\nAh Marcia where are you I'm sure you were as ticked off as I was at the San Diego union Tribune\nFor writing for interviewing all the candidates for school board and sit right in this big three paragraphs of how Mike McCurry and and buys are are no good and they've been at the job for too long and there's not a terrible job and Sandy ... is a mess and then they ended it with\nNot for the last we still endorse Mike McQueary and and Kevin ... what the heck was that about Marsha\n... you know what I Want to know the same thing I Want to know what was that all about I I thought the interview went really really well um and I have to agree with some of the things that they said about like and\nAnd Kevin [laughter] so yeah they do I want and doorstep\nWild uh okay Marcia I think one reason why they did not endorse Newt is probably because your view on charter schools Iraq and so what's your what's your take on charter schools\n[noise] I like charter schools because they offer a choice and a ... and that's one of the big issues that we're adding to the school board is is that you know we have more choice choice in the curriculum war I'm involved with the parents but the curriculum but also for school choice\nSo I like charter schools because parents out there now have another option is a their school is not working for their child\nWhat do you think is the biggest failure of the San Diego Unified School board\n\nI have to narrow it down to one I Know that's what I saw how about that [laughter]\nWell you know let's start with the budget [noise]\nYou know this is this is the second largest school district in this state they manage over a billion dollars\nEvery year in their budget and yet they still continue to have this massive deficit you know last year they had a forty seven million dollar deficit now it's down to forty one million they only managed to shave off\nYou know ... you know not quite eight million dollars I don't understand how it is it the board continues to run the district and and not be able to tell us how they're spending the money\nWhat do you think about these props that the last ... problems email profit double why for a unified\nSo we got three ... that have already been passed an improved that the taxpayers are paying for it I'm into those three they're still to point one billion that has yet yet the alec yeah I'm I'm Sorry that has yet to you yeah well now they've got ... why why are they asking for another three point four billion dollars\nSo you know on on my way\nRight now I Know what why why I like bonds I think that voters have been very generous and supporting our schools but I have serious questions about why they need this three point four billion dollars and what is it going to be used for I Would like to have some some some answers to that and I think that the voters are entitled to that\nNo matter how are you a write in candidate to people to write your name in\n[noise] you know like I was a right and I was a write in for the primary uh and\nThe great Mary yet okay beautiful so now you're on the ballot I Am on the ballot you can do for me Martian Nordstrom\nA beautiful marsh appreciate the call very much best of luck to you take like\nYou know what you know what everybody my Spanish on doors would\nWalk away or you may have so much as you are very well good well deserved Marcia hope you and\nI Hope you do now have you back when I when\nI Know that's what I'm Talking about Mars out who porridge that isn't as we've never talked to school board member neutral on ... and he hung up on us\nAnd that was before they arrived it was years ago like seven years marshal you come back yeah [laughter] now Marcia I Will never hang up I was talking about now a Erica miles yet to make an endorsement listen\nUh what was the guy is Kevin ... new crew of how we are not huge fans of so we're kind of leaning we liked what you were talking about their Marcia two hundred bucks or ... or ... or ... hours gives you don't listen to these guys are a bunch of phone these bright by going door something about it you got it\nThat was OK still you guys are going to be [laughter] like give me on your argument over a bridge or they don't\nDo it on the dollars each three fifty for the fact

qualified based upon my legal knowledge and my legal experience has an attorney\nBut that they heard anonymous they received anonymous reports that I was a racist so therefore they are going to find me Viking qualification so I put them in touch with a whole group of people who don't me for decades all Hispanic\nWho knew not only was not a racist but that I spent a lot of time during pro bono

a betting if for lack of better phase having been that I was going to lose sixty to forty I've won by Seventeen hundred and thirty nine votes out of out of about four hundred seven thousand cast\nA I I I don't believe that line someone said Christians can't be unbiased Christian judges you\nKnow Christian judges or teach Christians are too biased to be judges is what\nThey told me that the number of its who could have said that\nAbout eight of them in the meeting with cruising retired judge\n[noise] wow\nThat's yeah that's what I mean what are you say back to that\nWell they're wrong I mean there's a there's a number of good Christian judge shows that are on the bench but they're all the poor appointed so that they haven't didn't have to go through this process but at the bar so she made it very clear that Christian shouldn't be judges so okay that's their position\nOkay we'll give us one because we got around here but give us one particular issue that perhaps the Democrats in the bars of the Asian or whatever would not like you to have that\nYou know somebody's idea of how to unify downtown and you know it's this prior prior regimes oh\nIt was probably download wasn't it

John ... miles do you remember where the guy called in from where they added like\nThe crazy bike lanes and got rid of all the parking\nAnd like we were heading north Santa Barbara with us we're going to get in and it was like a total disaster yeah it was like a one way road sometimes in the I'm Talking about John like they did like a crazy new California thing when it came to the downtown and all these businesses are going out of business because of it\nYeah you know I haven't had heard about that but there are some pretty crazy a you know I guess what you'd call forward thinking designs for ... bike\nFriendly um you know mobility and and the problem is is what it does it really just shut down traffic and and you know I don't know what the percentage but I'm fairly certain it's low of you know people riding bikes to restaurant\nIn downtown the shah uh you know they want to drive their cars so yeah yeah we need to think long and hard about things like that one but but that's a big push you know that uh you know bikes in transit and getting everybody out of their cars that's the same deck and pushing that for years and then what do you say that I never get me out of my car\nAll right John\nAppreciate the rather do I need to hear that you know what John is the first person we've ever talked to pro parking never know about the issues of every time a provocative and I like it a lot\nYou know what yeah I've enjoyed all my did you move to my district cat or what you're talking about looking for a house on my district but yeah ... it was\nIt was around okay you don't get my vote you get my daughters than either the only guy I presume they're about I was in\nA city council\nThat's where it's at each one of those ones where it's a pretty good it's like hey ed gallows on the city council\nYou which show he's and he actually is in a tough race really yeah mhm they're like ... like a very yeah only won by like fifty votes last time or something very small okay we got to get that we get in on the horn okay\nBut all of them right it's like a bad how did he would like why is that how can you do like the super bastion of conservatism\nAnd will they don't get to yes on because you got to have all the way I Would ask if you don't got going on so it keeps on math and on the on the team also John Madden story we get back what I Want to go to Jane here DJ\nUh I Apologize on behalf of our producer miles actually know what I'm going to live miles apologize mom hey TJ great to see the form the other great a forward to seeing the liquor too too unbelievable I\nGot good up to ... I got a little problem here uh so I Am in the power Unified School district\nAnd I'm looking at my sample ballot and I don't see any I don't see you or any of the candidates on my ballot what's up\nWell the problem isn't that you're on the power in our school district up the great thing for you and your to stop this sounds like you're not in a truck area that have the trust me up for election\nUh okay darn it I was looking for drug route for a for a boon for teachers and aren't so how's this work do you deal with the new districts and why is this a good or bad thing\nI've never been a fan of a dividing up the school district of the truck to begin with a ...\nYou know a number of other governmental jurisdictions are where they got threatened with a lawsuit forced to move into districts than the though we we are where we are and we've got a three year old is up for election this November\nAnd uh I Am running and trustee at the\nWell hold on one on one general thing about trustee district so see there's a credit is wrong I think there's a local measure that would make no no no no no you're right I take it back there's talks about making San Diego unified in the district as well and I thought I write that idea because it's\nSo crazy expensive to run district entire district wide and that benefits the unions and the people with a ton of money because they can afford to do that as opposed to just ... you know knocking on doors in one district there what do you think of that\nWhile the inverse is true as well if you want to make it easier more cost effective to take over a district by district\nUh that's how you would do it right to say you wouldn't have to have you on the agenda they go overboard a conceivably do you do it the target a couple of districts every election cycle to have to run a campaign dishwasher regardless of the jurisdiction [noise]\nThe other problem I think that the Iranian it frankly is that at least the balkanization a governmental entity a you know you've seen that happen in the city of San Diego\nWhen they moved to a city council district south divide horse trading it's what can you do for my area of the city to that I can how can you something on your area of the city about what's good for the city of all\nYou bring up good points that you're saying interesting okay and let's get to your deal so um you went into the tower unified district or a porn a rate after all the bond mess right so what are we ... what do we done to to sweep this up a little bit\nWiser relate specifically to the Capitol appreciation bond that there's very little uh that we can do many options disposal as you might recall those hundred million dollars worth of bonds it's going to cost additional ... billion dollars over forty years\nSo that will go down from ... I Want to make sure I'd want her to so hundred million dollar bond he's going to cost ... billion dollars that's correct that's correct\nAnd the problem with those bonds that they were there were no call up all the bondholders really have no incentive to sell those bonds back\nTo the district a last ditch racial draft a cast poor and they need the cash and they're willing to sell back the bond a at a discounted rate um\nBut we've gone out we've done a little bit of serving as some of the bondholders and there aren't enough in that situation right Mitt to make it worthwhile for the distant to refinance those bonds or it has tried to buy them back I should say uh you know I I hate to say\nUse the word only in this context but it but only say the district a couple of million dollars over forty year period\nBut the cost of restructuring them et cetera it's just not worth the difference is negligible you might as well just let it\nRide lane okay so I live uh within a bunch of different schools and some of them are under the new age like design thirty nine right and so it would why this model working with Powell unified in in you know different types of schools and whatnot he liked is good when we take\nA deep thirty nine is his receive many awards and uh that's a great number of people who like it is the only the only change\nYour weight school or in the district so I wouldn't say that all of the schools and probably in a fight or following that same model um but you know doing very creative things and uh the reviews are great\nAnd that is a great on it and that but that kind of a lot of the it's a little under additional no model right is that is that a good thing do you like that or would you do the more traditional [noise]\nWell I think it's about what's in the education well\nUh I I agree that the value and became a tried and true but there's also value and seeing if there's a lot of things that worked well ah because you know things are changing a friday economy workforce a war cabinet so where do you work what you do for work all those things are changing size so\nTo the extent that we have a school that's ... that's approaching a instruction a little differently or you know remains to be seen how that's going to look in the long term but I'm so far so good\nBiggest difference between you and your opponent well\nHere's the thing I Am the only Republican candidate and the Republican endorsed candidate in the race\nOr to Democrat opponents and uh on the doors to not just by the party but the ... Howard joined us taxpayers association or as well as the San Diego police officers association for my focus\nOn campus in school safety or people tasty and uh you know it's an interesting situation I find myself in now a very much like when you see happening at the national level a patently there are some allies Democrat opponents who are dropping\nNegative a hit pieces on me into\nThe trust the area uh a and unfortunately there's no way to tell who's paying for them because they're doing this uh you know in secret and they're not just\nClosing its bang for the beaches are and it's really a a at a tough spot there to to combat the allegations that even though he's paying for them and and there's no basis for a third of the borderline slanderous really\nWow I I don't know what the allegations are and what a weird question for me to ask you what the allegations are but what are the allegations\nYeah yeah sure I can tell you the two of them are one of them at this ridiculous allegations that I'm using taxpayer dollars to fund a personal legal defense\nA ... and I think whoever is putting this out there is under the impression that uh uh because I had another trust in the school district\nWere sued by constituent with the assistance of the uh the tourists Corey Briggs violence filing similar lawsuits like this across the county elected officials Percocet your two are claiming that there are civil rights have been violated for blocking them from the social media accounts um", "show_name": "Mike Slater Show", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "17"}
