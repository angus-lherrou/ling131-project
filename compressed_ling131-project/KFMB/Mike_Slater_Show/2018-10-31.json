Duncan Hunter the incumbent versus the challenger America but a jar\nAnd if you haven't heard the interviews with both of them are the ones that I did hear a both candidates weren't crazy about them 'cause ah I asked some questions they didn't really want to talk about what you can listen to those at seven sixty K. F. it'd be dot com and\nTo look for the audio right there it's pretty ... and five but this survey usa pulled that just came out\nA it was taken October twenty fifth through twenty nine so it's really recent\nThey surveyed five hundred forty seven voters and I don't see word in here that says it's likely voters isn't just voters normally would say the likely voters here you could say I'm a voter\nBut it makes a difference in the land of surveying and sort of likely voters and in this particular poll or five hundred and forty seven quotes voters and the fiftieth\nShows the race has tightened there were Duncan Hunter is forty eight percent markup in a jar has forty five percent undecided eight percent I still think hunters going to win that and then we'll see what happens in this trial and then if it goes the wrong way for him and there would be a special election so I think that's a better way to go\nHe should have the trial before the election but at any rate it but they're they're margin of error is almost five percentage points\nMaybe wishful thinking by survey USA and then maybe the union Tribune more than that coming up Tim ... news busters as well in just a moment

incitement they they have made that have triggered and radicalized these crazy people it is delivered in in pet\nAs deliberate has that guy's Steve Schmidt who used to be a Republican is is very friend Max Boot\nWho led off that bunch a now big time anti Trump or but the throne news busters into the mix there to assist Tim Graham is the executive editor of news busters you worked there at the media Research Center and\nBring both al and the whole team for a long time I I find that just really irresponsible for him to say that but it doesn't matter because they're supposedly they're they're the truth tellers here so what what is that\nYeah we have no delivered intent to inspire violence of any kind we have been very explicit\nEspecially when it comes to the news media that a reporter should always not just be safe but feel safe when they're trying to report things um [noise] I have in my own personal life had a tendency not to harass liberal reporters when I'm In their presence and I always\nYou know you feel like trolling on them or what and the closest I got was that was on the elevator at the Heritage Foundation with Cokie Roberts many years ago and I said who was the victim and she went and\nWell yeah ah we've [laughter] it's just it's not going to stop those well they went up after the election or is this is all part of the talking points to van or where does this go\nWell I think this is some it's obviously inspired by the uh by the these pipe bombs sent to\nJohn Brennan at CNN even though he works at MSNBC hoops [noise] uh I you know I think this is something that they do the MSNBC and CNN or welcoming all of this and I think we all remember it wasn't that long ago it was twenty Seventeen\nWhen James Hodgkinson shot at a bunch of Republican congressmen and you could easily go to his Facebook page and see oh he loves Rachel Maddow he loves Bill Maher\nUm I don't think Fox went on the air and said Rachel Maddow caused this with all delivered intent you know and that's the difference\nSo which once they're responsible news network and which one is a pile of trolls so I mean I I just think that conservatives generally blame the criminal first liberals have this tendency to always blamed the environment or their genetics or some kind of bizarro\nTheory that doesn't involve any more responsibility for the criminal\n... and the other thing is interesting here as predicted this whole cabinet story post the confirmation and now that he's on the Supreme Court and of course a doctor for it and so forth\nThat is such an old story of Mollie Hemingway over the federalist as a piece today I've got that retweeted they're connected around the Twitter mark Morris and radio why did the media and the Democrats abandon their investigation into Brett Kavanaugh without me because it's no longer necessary a on a new things you can talk about what was it uh\nOne of the commentator said there are a bit of it as Max Boot about the only care of him was not I mean it is a caravan doing phony about it's out there but throughout the new things it's just way yesterday's news is that it didn't\nYeah I mean ... I was making fun of this yesterday where Trump a cold Andrew Gillum who's running for Florida governor I a thief and all the network headlines where Trump calls Gillum the without evidence\nAnd I said let's now try to imagine CNN and MSNBC and the Washington Post saying\nChristine forward charges Kavanaugh without evidence they wouldn't do that because she's on the right side\nShe's doing some good for America by making charges that she can't back up with any evidence and that's again this is where\nThe first thing we have to try to impress upon these liberal media people as you are not the facts you don't bring the facts you're not good at the facts you don't you know you you bring us a narrative not the news and that's\nEverybody understands that now that's why there ... popularity is so low and then they think democracy is in peril when they're on popular it's like no democracy has never been more vibrant than when everybody realizes your trolling\nYou have a democracy dies and dark as didn't you say has some page of the wall street or the Washington Post\nRight up my I mean I think\nThere are you are yes I've been through that again is sort of democracy dies in dark that was Tim Graham that was using that as a as a drop and we're running out of the clip well yeah absolutely you're alive proceed dies in dark that's right I just feel like saluting something [laughter]\nIf you live out here and they deserve and oh you're not getting residuals off of that I'm not real clear right now so how how does have CNN\nI Know who does the other CNN and one of my own MSNBC they're just trying to beat each other\nYou know they're bringing on Jake Tapper has this um I offer whatever name is on the other day ... who's a who's who is going crazy about how Trump and his uh uh ... you know Trump's worse than ISIS and just and then she later on kind of brings back when I was a little\nLittle forceful and then let me back off on that just\nIt was a a ... you know Trump's worse than ISIS and just and then she later on kind of brings it back when I was a little\n... us little forceful and then let me back off on that just a bit so uh yes I Believe\nWhat she said was Trump is radicalized more people than ISIS ever did\nAnd this is the kind of incredibly reckless\nFalse HUD where you ... for them to for Steve Schmidt or any of these are Brian stealth there to go running around seeing the conservative media is going to get people killed and their daily diet on these networks\nIf Trump is Hitler trumpet style and Trump is radicalized more people than ISIS how does that not\nThreaten the crazy people take it the wrong way\nWell if you could make the case and a boat as you go back to even say Reagan\nWas shot and uh that that whole incident with John Hinckley right he was doing that they're supposedly a driven to impress the actress Jodie Foster him is always people out there who will do crazy stuff the guy goes into the synagogue\nDisavowed Donald Trump on Twitter before he goes in still doesn't matter to some of these talking and the media so ... is there it it only apparently happens when any sort of Republican in any form even a you could say unconventional form as Trump\nI'm mixed bag 'cause he can sometimes be ... and ... anything to distract and the fact that the economy is a is to it's a big thing is that the story today's Wall Street journal by consumer confidence is that an Eighteen year high the market has been rebounding again today you know well up three hundred point plus\nRain so anything that keep having to report that they'd rather go into let's get a round table to Fifteen people well let's talk about how Donald Trump is sending crazies in to use guns or whatever 'cause his fault and and now people die because of him\nAs throughout history politically no matter which side people who are just crazy or or just evil have decided to use it or whatever means or or reason but to blame it politically read this new level now where it's really pretty frightening\nBecause I don't like to see that that happened to either side or either side politic well this\nIs where I Would say that we need to ask her liberal friends when of the conservatives ever done this to you when did we ever suggest that Rachel Maddow is reckless rhetoric killed somebody you won't find it you know you certainly won't find it on news busters [noise] um and this is this is a\nYou know as as odd as it sounds I mean obviously we're not going to try to say Trump has been a president's civility that's obviously if not who he is and it's not how we got there and we just have a bunch of liberal news people who get up every day and they're still upset Hillary loft and ... and that motivates\nEverything that comes out of their mouth I mean when Allison come around it comes on today and says Trump's uses all the same language as the synagogue shooter I mean what kind of reckless crap is that mhm\n[noise] well if you can live on in the ... and\nNever has the guests on who really call them out they all have the CNN pro Trump analyst that or get a paycheck from CNN so they can't really rip into these people\nOr their former

smart is I I'm sure there are just a little rate loans that may work for people to certain situations but because every situation is different but for the most part if you've got one that keeps going up because the said keep jak and the rates up and they will it's a good time to take a look at that\nRight out of the time and I play score face time and place for adjustable and it's not a one size fit all somebody has been shopping for a home all the numbers they were running was four four and a quarter percent that thirty or faith than all of a sudden that's closer to foreign three quarters thirty your face\nAnd they're like oh my goodness I don't think I can afford it that's a good time to go into an adjustable with some security like a five year you know fakes\nAfter five years that

am seven sixty talk in breaking news [noise]\nRead this morning talking about why millennials don't vote to one of the biggest reasons is because\nUh they don't know where to buy stamps [noise]\nKinda stumped the hosts of boxing friends because like I said I don't I don't think they\nAre most of the country doesn't think voting and mailing in anything like we do here in California which is because it's more common are so here's the proof from New York magazine we talked about Tim a second ago mailing stuff gives some anxiety he said that I hate mail and stuff it gives me that this is Megan she's twenty nine and San Francisco I rent and move around quite a bit\nAnd want to try to get absentee ballots\nCheck out this hurdle this is the big when they meet they need me to print out a form and mail it to them no more than thirty days before the election but no less than seven days before the election\nTypically I check way before that time and then forgot to check again or just say blanket because I don't own a printer or stamps anyway\nSo you go there's another girl millennial stamps\nI should add this because you know politicians always talk about the youth vote we gotta get the millennial turnabout this blue waves based off the millennial but\nHave a tough time believing this concept of a blue wave based off of the youth vote when buying a stamp is a hurdle that yeah can't be jumped over blanket I don't own a printer or stamped anyway the twenty nine year old says this is Anna Twenty one to the New York\nI'm trying to register in my hometown of Austin, Texas it's such a tedious process to get registered in taxes there is no notification service about the status of my voter registration there's a small outdated website where you can enter your information and check\nWell yeah there is when I was at the ... when I was at the post office to register this poor girl clearly also a college student like me didn't know what post marked meant and had no idea how to send an important document by mail\nMost people my age of zero need to go to the post office and may have never stepped into one before honestly if some of the ... the forms printed for me and it was willing to deal with the post office I'd be much more inclined to vote\n[laughter] okay this is a serious concern here\n... this isn't one kid who can't figure it out\nHow about this on this girl had no idea how to send an important document by mail me here in the post office what else is there to know if you go to the lady of the you go to the person behind the counter and you say like this needs to go here [laughter] really I mean I gather or what else could there you don't have to do anything you don't do anything else\nJocelyn twenty seven from Massachusetts\nYou were sent things in the mail but at the twenty eight year old I read everything on line I loved that literally everyone is promoting actually registering to vote but it's never how to vote or the steps to voting or what you do next after you're registered to vote after that I just kinda it just kind of drops off and you're left in the dark like I don't know what to do next you know\n...\nThere were a couple of weeks ago we talked about a focus group in Virginia\n\nFocus group of young people and this is the person who led the focus group one thing that came as like a month ago one thing that came up which I had heard from my own kids but I thought they were just nerdy was it the students will go through the process of applying for them for a male and absentee ballot they'll fill out the ballot\nAnd then they don't know where to get stamps\nThey all agreed that they knew lots of people every one of the people the focus but they all agreed that they knew lots of people who did not sending their balance because there's too much of a hassle or they didn't know where to get a stamp across the board they were all\nNodding and had a very spirited conversation about oh yeah I Know so many people who didn't send there's then because they didn't have a stamp\n\nWeird okay I could take a break and come back on TALK about how this works in California and just so we can all be on the same page because you know we don't need to have lives in San Diego\nI'm but what the heck\nWhat does this what what what what what what\nAre we got a lot to break down next one hundred and seven sixty gay of envy one hundred seven sixty five three six to stamp all the youth of oh they're so passionate there's no firing up about the future and they're going to like the next ... the United states but they don't know what do I get a stamp\nOut what to do was telling me how what do I do next jeeze rapid transmissions forty six years they've been in business how 'bout that longest\nOr who are older than the oldest person but whatever who cares well sixteen thousand of them voted in twenty sixteen ...\nDedicated you're focusing on ... ... oh my\nGod and on on a lot you're not\nWell thank you my God thank you that it gated oh wow\nWhat a pond water upon what are you saying like hey you got me dying over here\n[laughter] that's all right\n[laughter]\nYou know one of those on Fox and friends this morning that where was that a million little how ... Halloween but [laughter]\nYou got to work them in there you know\nI'm such dogs berries on Fox News before that's pretty good so I start that upon as a as a whole different level I'm not qualified [noise] ah so wrap up this or that it uh what are we talking about the huge they use a lousy we're going to make a comment\nI was gonna say I mean you know you said sixteen thousand uh all people older than the oldest person living and we talked about the youth vote Angie tomorrow they're going to talk about it how important it is but I if I was running I Would focus on that older than\n... percent boulders that a hundred and twelve vote yeah plus one twelve sure mhm\nBecause clearly there's a there's a significant population of housing I can swing some elections absolutely uh this is another millennial he's twenty five years from Atlanta Aaron I look at it this way this is different than a this is a different person then everyone who's complaining that they don't know where to buy stamps as we are done with the stamps analysis which is what I said a ... a friend this morning\nSo now we're moving on to another excuse I look at it this way [noise] that report just came out the other day about global warming talking about how we have twelve years until this radical change occurs unlike unlike this world's ever seen did you guys do that twelve years twelve years wow [noise]\n[noise] um he has it until\nShe raises and the hill newspaper just put out an article about how the Democrats do not plan on making climate change big part of their platform\nI just do not understand why I Would vote for a party to this person died but why not voting\nI don't understand why would vote for a party that doesn't care about me in any way they said sure we'll lower student interest rates but I don't give a blank about student interest rates if I'm not gonna live past Thirteen more years on this plant wow now which is ...\nBut I don't give a blank about student interest rates if I'm not going to live past Thirteen more years on this planet wow now which is valid points to a great point yeah if he genuinely believes what she does that we're all going to die and Thirteen Years\nBecause of climate change run\nThe credit cards start spending who cares about your interest rate\n\nAs of this kid he doesn't vote 'cause he thinks we're going to die and Thirteen Years because it's going to get a little warm out\nAt any end to this is I think is the saddest excuse of all these millennials here there are people that are exciting Bernie was exciting Cynthia Nixon\nWas actually the sex in the city or I don't need to tell us America you know think about obviously should have been ... and voting for her Cynthia Nixon was exciting Alexandria Ocasio Cortez is exciting\nSo would I vote in the future I don't know if somebody came along that was exciting like that yeah probably\nThis is the one that bothers me the most just bothers me even more than the I don't know where to buy stamps this bothers me even more than ... we're all gonna die and Thirteen Years from Tom Ridge anyway this one bothers me the most that this kid needs excitement\nNot truth not wisdom not wise policy\nExcitement\nSurprise he didn't vote for Trump really sad day writers that are really exciting factors qualifier\nThere was a kind of half the reason people did vote for well this is why the rock is going to be president sure this that's what he's waiting for yes I think that's right Eric let's talk about the ... or you don't usually misses opportunities I feel like every time we talk about the rock we should play some cyber from the rock ... oh okay like a you know can you smell what the rocket score\nSmart or something like that well\nFirst of all it's now lay yes the smack down but yes sure Eric you're on the right track with what I'm looking for us\nSo we are big triple each guy yeah ... actually a\nA so millennials especially but a lot of people are desensitized\nAnd we need the excitement is we need instant\nGratification here's another twenty seven year old I have ADHD and it makes me it makes it hard for me to do certain tasks or the payoff is far off in the future or abstract I don't find that intrinsically motivational\nThe amount of work logically isn't that much fill out a form mail it go to a specific place on a specific day but those kinds of tasks can be hard for me to do if I'm not enthusiastic about what what is this this is weird this is interesting\nThis ... this need I Can't do anything unless I'm super fired up about\nWhat is that most things in life you're not going to be super brought up about and you got to do it I got a bill\nJacks recent a doctor's appointment ... got to pay not very fun back thrilled world's going to end soon excited\nThat's true why am I paying it anyway wrong and what is Jack and start pulling his own way and what I found it very much yeah what's this been a couple of years two years in like ... what am I still buying a Halloween costume yeah well that's what kind of arrangement of this now\nI bet you that even paying rent energy\nWow rent free rent free board you've already your car I'm sure it doesn't feel it I'm never fails it up yeah eat sleep shots on credit cards you know what do you honestly does\nFortnite racks up money like buying extra coins and yeah ... was in fact you can play your Fortnite all all night long right if you want when you come back home if you're out in the bars with the boys are held back what you want to wait for that there was a morning show he played for another essay\nBut don't go racking up extra guns and and schemes or whatever they call on my credit card jak [laughter]\nOutrageous that's outrageous I think you know a guy totally that's the worst part about it disappoint him as a dad but\nSo this is a this desire that these kids have for instant gratification that's what really troubles me 'cause one of the secrets to life is delayed gratification you put the working now with no pay off no pay off maybe there'll be something later that is what Eric's doing here\n\nReally ... yeah [laughter] really putting the working hard well my ... pay off nothing no benefit for him but there was a little bit of a something what's that\nWell but I I look to the future and uh hopefully I'll end up on Fox and friends there and on one of your coat fat see that ... that\nThis is a glimmer of hope it gets up and he puts it in the ... you know this is the grind get up and grind as they say and I'm not after today coat tails\nOh why did you

Michael ... was on after me out of their job on it [laughter]\nRight so you do it you just do it because you could you do it that's what you got to do is to do it and it's it it's not fun as my dad always used to say that's why they call it work that was one of my dad's favorite lines ...

S. a couple of months ago\nWe had dinner with some new friends at my house last friday his mom has a a less right now her dad has some\nRare bone marrow cancer that has no cure and then a friend of mine's wife\nJust got diagnosed with Parkinson's this is within two weeks stay away from Slater [laughter] stop about the moral of my story taller than two weeks super serious life altering slash ending gotta stop\nAnd my family's had a great health string of health for a long time now\n\nBut some things are just just starting to begin to maybe scratched the surface right so like I was the last Monday I had a migraine I've got a handful year they're not the worst ever write I take some pill right away and it kind of takes the edge off so I can I go to bed for a couple of hours and\nThen kind of suffer through the show that\nSome people I Know with migraines are out for a day if not longer and it's horrific and horrible in the worst\nAh two nights ago was the first time one of our kids ever got sick and she ... grace barely ... throughout the few times instead of like ... threw up and it was the middle of the night and we woke up or we're there for thirty minutes\nOr like I was going to be one night put it back to bed she went to sleep and she's okay but that does that look like I barely like we're like oh man this again\nAnd it turned me nothing right so my migraines nothing Greece getting a little sick because you just started eating solid foods probably that's what that is right uh we went to the ER when we go to yard Monday\nYeah whenever I there was Monday we went to the our cars jak couldn't moves arm without many broke something or something turns out his elbow was dislocated and the nurse the X ray technician popped back into place when he was getting X rays done a thousand dollars later but I'm not bitter about that that's fine [laughter]\nThey own point for just great thank you miles or just grateful that does that mean that aren't\nSo sure because so around the yard\nFor like thirty minutes with grace my I barely kind of I don't think God's\nGetting me ready for any serious illness in my life where my family that's not a I don't know if that's what I\nMean it's all taught me a little bit more empathy\nFor those who are going through actual health difficulties because I was under the covers and pain with a migraine last week but I had a light at the end of the tunnel like I knew I'd be better by noon and the next day would\nBe kind of a bummer but then I'd be All right the next night ... so like I like to dance on what's happened before but I'm under the covers and I'm thinking jeez what about those who don't have a light at the end of their ... there's no there's no end to this illness in sight\nThat's\nWay harder than what I'm doing right now so grace was throwing up for a couple of minutes she had no fevers right so I thought gosh what about those babies who do have a fever and they're really sick and how hard is that to watch your baby\nHave something like that happen to these slight ... says with illnesses have really touched my family's heart and I have no other point to this other than to say that if you are are sick or if you're in\nPain or if you're not a hundred percent in some way\nI bet that's really hard and I want to acknowledge your pain\n\nBecause you might feel like no one understands the pain or worse no one cares and the truth is I don't understand at all but I just want to take a second to tell you that about what you're going through really sucks\nAnd for those of us\nWho take our health for granted like me have you guys ever had this I have a literally this morning got an email about the ... ... in the tow\nNotes rate here this finger right here for the call after he was at the ... index finger\nYeah I think who would think being no I don't want her finger\nIs that the index finger in the same do rarely rarely mentioned rarely talked about the old index to ring finger which I Can't even see your finger so that is a ...\nYeah there's a rumor is that the same as you know what's in there and they do use it a point to your point out of the foreigners appointed foreigners hand held on not right away the second one is going on here and it's clearly the index why would that what was it called the index\nFinger the finger next to the okay hold in the index finger the finger next to the thumb\nThe for finger you tell me it's called the index finger before finger and the pointer finger got 'em all\n... went down to the ... definitions of things yeah you've got three names and this one only gets named based off of the thing that has on it the ring finger here this is not what if you don't have a ring\nCongratulations and went oh wow wow [laughter] what I'd do our job to make on Halloween [laughter] the first\nSegment we had today after that segment yeah kind of ties and what I'm Talking about here if I was talking about\nWhatever you got an email or something like you know what I'm never going to take this my house for granted ever again then when they're saying now is gone I Am going to thank God every day ... my finger by ring finger isn't perfect health ... forget gone guy on\nThe second you're back to health totally gone so don't take for granted was going to be my point to the rest of it or maybe it shouldn't take your wife for granted why\nDo all that salt now my ... my wife or the would've laughed at that one something about oh\nYeah it's a great for valor matter right on that you're getting a great\nIf you laugh at it and it's a funny joke a panic I don't do better than divorce because of that\n[noise] 'cause they teeter but if they got they got to be really really good impact yeah the problem is when they taught her
