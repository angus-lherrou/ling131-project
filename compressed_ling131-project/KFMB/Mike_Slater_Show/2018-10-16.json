real estate real solutions for your financing needs aramco purchased refinance reverse\nBut that hasn't stopped a whole lot of people from doing just that on the state level and nationally for years\n[noise] yeah well actually uh what I emphasize is not legislating from the judicial than it is the legislation that is actually coming out of the administrative agencies\nThat the ... branch has not stopped\nA burn act that he was a required or expected by the frame ers who college [laughter] or race and the powers right and as you know and the separation of powers of the bombers the legislation\nHas to come out of Congress not it's not the we a jacket branch is not permitted to make any laws\nBut what has happened over time and this is what book about is that the executive branch has received tremendous amount of authority from Congress added as a unit that authority to make rules that are\nThe same as laws that are covering the uh all the American people who have it actually voted for these things and that is that we're a democracy and if a if they're supposed to be a law or something that\nForbids is to do something we have to have at least had some involvement\nIn electing the people who do it and then the case of the administrative agencies what we call in Washington or others elsewhere to call the administrative state is that they have got\nA garden from Congress very very broad authority which enables them then can make all kinds of rules that Congress never approve\nAnd and that's why there's such a big battle when we get people who are true to the original thinking the frame or isn't tamper with the constitution and they got on the bench and they go wait a minute there's a lot of stuff that has to be unpacked here and we'll we'll see where some of that goes talking to Peter Jay wall of a sudden you're on the mark Larson showing him seven sixty talking breaking news a new book out today judicial\nBut it has to be unpacked here and we'll we'll see where some of that there was talking to Peter Jay Wallace and\nYou're on the mark Larson showroom seven sixty talking breaking news new book out today judicial fortitude last chance to rain and the administrators states do you look at this I mean the EPA alone you could take any agency and look at how these either we certainly have these in California to regulate smothering level of times\nAnd people don't you don't really know what's going on until you go oh what's when did this happen well in right we have we have eight hundred laws have come out of state who signed by the governor or ignored\nEvery year they start with thousands so there's no shortage of this kind of thing\nThat tried actually um since Nineteen Ninety three every year the administrative state that is the administrative agencies of the United states have issued\nThree fat over three thousand regulations and rules every year so the total is something over a hundred and one thousand right now and that is it's impossible to imagine that the Congress has passed laws that permit\nThe issue in of over three thousand regulations and rules at every year [noise] so uh we have to have a way of stopping this from happening\nSo I don't want to do that out because it seems like it's so the genie is out of the bottle it's a big fat bloated team is a big problem how do we put it back in or change course or is\nThis now impossible because\nWhat my book is recommending is that the judiciary get involved in that and the reason that it's necessary is that the the frame hers assumed\nThat the judiciary was going to keep the the uh Congress from providing legislative authority to the executive branch and as you know the reason they were separated the is that there was always a great fear that the executive branch got legislative authority it could both\nMake the laws and enforce the laws and that's exactly what the king was doing when the framers were trying to set up a assistant here in the United states that that issue at liberty for people but\nAs overtime what has happened is the the courts the particularly the Supreme Court has not attempted to stop\nThe legislature Congress from delegating authority to the administrative agencies have the executive branch and that's how this whole thing has come up come about so what I'm recommending in the book is that\nThe Supreme Court stepped in and do what it was expected to do by the frame and that is just ... it looked carefully at these laws that ... the agencies are using and\nInterpret them strictly so that the agencies don't have what seems to be the legislative power to make rules for the American people\nRally to keep an eye on this and the book is important to navigate this I think it should be must reading in many many of the various branches of the three branches in Washington DC and maybe they'll come to their senses with the help of the book it's\nJudicial fortitude theater J Wallace them

troubled preemptive\n[laughter] Trump's gonna jump all issue a preemptive court packing plan and stacked the courts in his favor the very dangerous game\nI any any trick or tactic that the Democrats to use the first use dues to hurt Republicans and Republicans and go back and use it against them or they say they're gonna use it to the Republicans to use it before the Democratic it's a very very dangerous game and there's no winners here\n\nSpecifically on the Supreme Court we can't have every party who's in office pack the court with another twenty Supreme Court judges in a few years won five hundred Supreme Court justices and then the whole thing devolved into chaos and the natural human nature thing to do when things are in a state of chaos\nBut obviously there's gonna be the natural normal course of events in all of human history when things spiraled into chaos is for everyone to say to act with it all let's just have one leader who decides everything\nThat's where this goes\nThat's the normal state of government one guy does it all\nWe don't have that we have a republic if we can keep it Ben Franklin said and proposals like this from influential supposedly level headed and smart Harvard law professors are a fast track on the no we cannot keep it highway\n[laughter] no no this is pregnant thanks for everything these last couple of hundred years but we cannot keep this republic\nVery very dangerous game\nAnd again this is the stuff that gets us towards peak crazy much much faster than any goofy political ladder\nLawsuit against people who resemble horses whatever filed who said that\nIs it appropriate boss yeah that was sorry Tom horses last ... owner sure\nI was offended um [noise]\nOne less thing on a court in Toronto is there is a Ninth Circuit court of appeals as we all know there's twenty nine people on Trump has nominated three judges to the Ninth Circuit who are like Kavanaugh\nI don't know if they went to a beach week eighty to ... [laughter] I Wish I Wish I was at\nSure each week Nineteen eighty two sure my one of my high school friend fix me last night and said remember follow wait [laughter] is I mean these judges are like original is\nNeither and their members of the conservative Federalist Society and Dianne Feinstein and capital Harris don't like any of them\nAre this is Campbell instead of working with our office to identify consensus nominees for the Ninth Circuit the White House continue to try to pack the court with partisan judges who are blindly support the president's agenda to notice she uses the word packing the court this is not packing the court\nRight at three members of the of the Ninth Circuit retire and Trump replaces three of them that's not court packing\nBut that's that's the normal process of replacing old judges\nBut it's a left who's truly talking about court packing and that would be adding ... ... people on top of the twenty nine\nSo is the camel Harris's saying what Trump is doing is packing when there's not really that's all laying the groundwork for oh well they they packed first so now we're going to court back\n\nDon't fall for this what if it just is I don't want to get out of ourselves but what if Trump wins again or pans\nAnd we get to the Trump gets to nominate so many people have denied that the Ninth Circuit court of appeals becomes conservative\n[laughter]\n[laughter] okay here I just I guess not go that far my under seven sixty games I mean I I Want to come back with stories that are available negative Nancy or\nA miles I sat and I agree with them we do but you know to not do what we say oh you know ... gonna be that's going to break California's background like what are the gas tax is going to do all these horrible things and it will but it's not enough to help people maybe back either before leaving but not this huge X and this is a mass exodus thing\nThis is a big big problem and it will\n... will what were your ... or the Ninety eight percent chance that happens yeah and then the next step\nNot businesses but oh sure sure yeah yeah yeah so not Ninety eight percent chance as fast as um and I would be a huge problem so sure that story next one out of seven sixty KF MB don't realize this morning I've been talking about zero and I've been using this example that last week we started potty training jak\nAnd I realize that that's not a\n... how many people listening now or in that exact situation sure I mean probably not that many my mom she yeah ... ... maybe I'll show you what is it one small nice for people maybe it's not super relative but I was thinking this morning a\nSorry and I forgot I read this did you say you are saying yeah okay that's what it was that's why I woke up in them or I Can't go to sorry should have done it this morning I was gonna say thanks ... so I ... I got a bad mood I woke up this morning I couldn't remember why and then I was like well maybe it's these two story so uh we'll\nLet me hear which before you even get into it this is like a new thing in the election\nWe are now getting and this is the third thing I've seen yeah but the things that will be on the ballot in twenty twenty I haven't heard it on ... what are we doing the convention center expansion that's going to raise the hotel tax is already on the ballot for twenty twenty wow what do we do have to release wait ...\nI don't even have why don't you [laughter] so two things that before I even get to the store a mile send me that's the ... the ... ah so yesterday the city council San Diego city council voted to ban Styrofoam containers\nJust you know a friend of mine made the point yesterday or\nThink about how much debris was washed out into the ocean from Hurricane Andrew\nOf that one hurricane polls more debris into the ocean then we can ever put in the ocean by people throwing their Styrofoam containers out the window\nThat sue now me in Japan remember he assumes washing up here you\nTo give it like when it's not even close\nTo ... I did all as much as the you know back in the aftermath here so the two thousand lemon tsunami miles talked about Japan a poll that estimated five million tons of debris into the ocean five million tons Americans produce\nTen million tons of plastic waste every year since the ... I'm not saying all the positives of the ocean and waterways as all the plastic thing that we use is ten million so one\nNominee\nBrought half of all of that into the ocean in one day [laughter]\nI don't like it would panic Styrofoam containers because we think we're ... we're saving the plan was to the same same thing with um a C. O. two one forest fire one wildfire puts more C. O. two in the atmosphere than every form of transportation combined\nOne yeah so we do all this that Trump did he wasn't even going to the other day do some sort of gas regulates yelling or whatever it's cement around it or I think he did that got covered a lot yeah so uh I was oh it was a [noise] a transportation is probably about law one wildfire\nPete's all of it ...\nIt's the same thing was stupid ... now that's again like a tiny little thing is the ... second story a\nSan Francisco San Francisco is going to vote on a raising taxes on businesses\nTo help homeless homeless services\nLike guys [noise]\nThis is the same head tax it's called the head tax same thing that they did in Seattle a couple of months ago and they passed it in the Amazon threatened to leave so they ended up getting rid of it but I don't think I didn't know anything about this and this is why I'm so down in California about this particular thing\nThis is how lazy this this is so lazy\nIt really is right hey we've got a problem with something how do we fix it you businesses over here tax the rich give us more tax die so busy oh great idea\nLet's say what's wrong with us also do we have to do this when are people going to realize if you tax something you get less of it and this case you were businesses less investment fewer jobs when you subsidize something you get more of it in this case more homelessness\nAnd if you're making everything in San Francisco more expensive which is what this tax does your driving up housing costs even\nMore and you're making more homeless people this is a literal insanity and I got really down on California this morning and then a couple of hours later I realized oh this is why I'm Down it's because of the the mile sent me\nTwenty twenty ballot measure\nIt's called the split role is made it onto the ballot and it will pass\nA promise it'll pass like we might as well just do it now [laughter] yeah why wait what it on and like two weeks they put on a Twenty one days and there's a Democrat so this will weaken prop Thirteen\nOr so split because businesses and splitting between business at a property taxes residential property taxes that's why it's called split pack split role so businesses are gonna have to pay higher property taxes much significantly higher property taxes\nAnd who's going to pay that you are of\nCourse always always\nAnd it's got to pass because they're ... they're going to frame it as a greedy businesses they haven't been paying their fair share and the money's going to go to schools\nAnd stupid California's are going to vote for it\nAnd the end is going to lower wages can decrease job opportunities and it's going to her family even more and that's the part that bothers me the most I think I finally figured this is this is why I like so like sick like truly sick to my stomach about him\nI Want to be honest with this and I don't mean to offend anyone I Am super glossed like beyond I thank God every single day for a job that allows my wife to stay home for a couple of years\nBy the way he could survive on wanting to go I Know a lot of families were both\nA couple of years\nBy the way he could survive on one income I Know a lot of families were both parents have to work and they drop their kid off at day care at seven AM and pick 'em up at six PM\n\nAnd I don't want to get to this whole thing about it ... sent some\nPeople want to do some ... parents want to work and that's and they want to do that but I Know a lot of families who don't want to do that\nBut there's no other way for them to live in San Diego and make ends meet\n\nSweat point to bring this up raising taxes on\nBusinesses whether it's Styrofoam or assault homelessness or I split roll with property taxes all of it makes it harder for one income to provide for a family\n\nAnd they all pile up ... you hear this I just wanted to my Lisa argument annoys me so much people are like wow it's just a few cents here the gas tax that we're trying to repeal prop six oh it's a it's just twelve cents\n... cents\nPlus it's twelve cents\nA ... there's a San Francisco there's a CEO of a sales force in San Francisco who's in support of the attacks and he he called it a modest\nHalf a percent tax increase it's very modest okay sure ... percent\n... percent ... percent ... percent ... percent happens it happens it happens that\nPretty soon we have the highest taxes in the country by far\nIn this property tax this isn't this is thousands of do the big money\nHundreds of millions of billions of dollars a year\n'cause it is it a reassessment is that what happened as a couple of different do you go to but it's yeah it's uh it'd be a constant reassessment and if the business changes hands then they're going to pay all your life oh thousand dollars normally and you'll be paying three hundred thousand I'll do a few today like ridiculous or so in the end billions of dollars\nSo that's billions of dollars that the cost of everything will go up just no other way to slap it the only way businesses will pay those are increasing a crisis or died getting rid of costs\nMeeting firing people that's the only way out or leaving town called ...\nAnd all these taxes that up\nAnd both parents have to work and the second income most that's going to pay for daycare\n\nOr the family again completely moved out because they can't survive in San Francisco a family of four\nHundred and Seventeen thousand dollars a year is considered low income underneath a hundred and Seventy thousand dollars you that's not the average income that's low income you can't make ends meet and San Francisco to hundred Seventy thousand dollars a year that's a bit of an outlier San Francisco\nBut it's not too different here and all of these progressive policies in taxes it's making it worse and worse and worse and it's sad it's sad because it affects families and that's the part that I never really clicked for me until I think this morning actually\nHow much it because it affects the amount of time that moms and dads and kids get to be with each other and no I've never heard that argument before\nBut I see it now maybe it's because I'm Around a bunch of other parents have two year olds and seven month old so I see it all the time\nAs he moms and dads both having to work driving their kids off at seven AM picking them up at six PM just to make ends meet in San Diego and I know a lot of families who have picked up back in the left it was like I don't live that life meanwhile these progressive politicians parade around town\nAdvocating for just a slight taxi crust oh we're just going to have the greedy the rich pay that for about ... but I and then it gets even worse and worse and worse and are hurt families and our hurts kids\nThat's a major consequences of higher taxes and this split role tax is going to be other twenty twenty ballot guarantee it's going to pass and this is not going to be a straw that breaks the camel's back this going to be a brick that breaks the camel's back in California\n\nAnd people are going to pass up for it to get tricked\nOnce again gosh it's frustrating when under seven sixty chaos and be\nOn our seven sixty five three Sixers rapid transmission is a good example that right to forty six years have been a business they started rapid transmission started when California was the best place in the country to start a business now it's the worst place in the country\nTo have a business and they have three locations it's a lot of property taxes prop Thirteen split roles comes in and I opposite on the numbers in front of your but you see how much the tens of thousands of dollars of property taxes go up what are they gonna

okay I Know [laughter] perfect black beard [laughter] um\nOkay let's do measure see cities or San Diego ballot measure will start with the San Diego wants a measure see what does that\nSo measure the county measure which establish a pension stabilization fires in the city and what the county of doing it is essentially saying that any\nAnd can only be spent\nOn pension costs so you couldn't hide money and this reserve to pay for other ongoing cost or dads or what have you but they're trying to be good stewards by establishing the stabilization fund and they're also saying that measure that\nAny ongoing cost\nPartially in any bonds that are are there issues cannot go to pay for ongoing cost so it's a\nPretty basic a practice in finance municipal finance and government funding they don't have long term debt pay for ongoing cautious\nYeah so they're just spend all that language and their city or county charter that sounds like a yes yeah very very straightforward\nTo the county is pretty good with being fiscally conservative overly stays that way and made the budget doesn't get on there that's not a crusade comment that as they might Slater commented on a lot of\n... ... ... so this is protecting against maybe it's as any changes have there been any shenanigans or as a Ernie ... said oh I beg your bank he has a baggy panicky that needed this is\nNot a ... yet but it's it's a good practice ... we did about a year and a half ago at the city when we establish our pension reserve fund as well to essentially said that we see kind of the writing on the wall when it comes to\nInvest in earnings and the costs of pensions and we want to be good stewards and they just in case we're going to set aside money when we can to help\nOffset any dramatic increases and pension costs that that may come whether it's downturn in the market or what have you we might be prepared and because then\nYou know we start stocking away money now uh when that time does come to\nTo have a large increase our pension bill we don't want to say we have to cut services and do it and I think the counties in that same boat saying look if we're going to\nBe good stewards want to see if we want to make sure we're fiscally conservative and and have good practices\nAlong it measure de this is a big one here what is the general election mandates\nMeasured the big one is so similar to what the city uh went through in November of twenty sixteen and essentially says that the current practice of a candidate for a county office who\nGets to interrupt you real quick aren't so that last one I misspoke see as a countywide vote right correct the city before he doesn't count and this is another county one correct correct\nShowed the gentle past the county and it was that the city previously is that if he or a candidate for office and you receive a majority of the vote in June\nAnyone out right and you moved on you were elected we change at the city a couple of years ago or something like

Ito Miramar near ... valley ... and ...\nObviously vote for Chris Cate everyone in those areas are gonna keep going so local measure el\nSo Eli is a measure in the city of San Diego that makes her vision to a different rules regarding elected officials here and in San Diego so steak house members mayor or city attorney a lot of different reforms but the one thing that is included in there is a salary\nA critic big time bucks if I see what it is critical line in your own time and that right now\nSo I mean I I pose it that you're putting on the ballot than they did that difficulty part is that the way of current charter as I get is that uh they counseled in charge of of giving us all our increases\nAnd uh you know I was you don't do this for the money but this would in ink include a salary increase tied to a judge's salary beginning and\nI'm twenty twenty December twenty twenty\nWho determines the salaries\nAre I guess that by state law and so in other official to county ... other like it's in the in the region the same thing it's kind of the most um I guess they feel neutral way of doing\nThat it was out of your hands is the point in the ... the city council and no longer be determining the city council say\nCorrect correct so they'd rather than a third of reform and there but it's something that tempted a number of years now and\nYou know again um people who they were removed Carlyle in because you're going to salary increase a mid does have some reforms saying that you can't lobbyist city uh two years after your your mood profits right now it's one year so there are some that are formed and there but they also tied in the salary increase in this one and\nSo I'm going I'm a I'm a yes on this what do you think you know I did not vote for this and you know we had when\nWe go we go to Chris All right it's about time why why are you know I Want more money\nI don't I didn't do this for the money you know I don't I didn't run for office to give I ran for office knowing full well with the salary wise for this stuff this position I'm and I'm not doing what I'm doing it for a lot of the city and then I don't think I bet you do for the money\nI like the idea of taking it out of the city council's hands\nTied on the degree that whatsoever I don't disagree with that\nBut I also have the car a lot of never understood the power lines that always annoyed me\nYeah and\nAnd that's already part of the reason rationale for and I can see that I Know we don't do a crime because they give you a salary increase now you know you can't take it anymore so you know there's some different for me that there um but the salary increase issue with as a as a as a bit of that deal breaker for me\nWow okay let me know to a criminal case you know either a big fat maybe on that one okay alright that's we're getting very good I think I think I'm a maybe a yes for you Chris I may be giving you a little race every ... kick back home ask for no big deal let's go to a ... W\nW is only for the the national city but I think it's going to be a bellwether measure for the rest of the the region depend on how proposition ten and\nA and a wreck control issue statewide goes so I'm not study the rent control measure was initiatives that Iceland ballot that would essentially Institute Frank control in the first city in San Diego county\nAnd this is a a a terrible terrible\nA response to our house and affordability issues and the region and across the state and he would cap rent increases it would establish a rent board that would determine uh than out of a threat increases all central decreases it would roll back rent to\nA an amount that would that's nine months ago and let's see if there'd been increases in the last nine months for your place of a of of of a French and you would have rolled back it's just a terrible terrible\nGet a response I was at a conservative meeting and a conservative person running for office got up and he said I'm for this conservative thing in the crowd cheered it I'm for this conservative thing like lowering the gas tax and the ... I said and I'm against rent control\nEveryone booed Chris is so ... like\nThe rent control people are winning big time on this one what's your number one argument against rent control\nIs the fact that it has one has not working any locale it simple to look at me or look at San Francisco and the cost of housing plus it doesn't address the issue of supply and the the need for the increase to five hours in a region and we've seen it work other states where it's a it's a market\nWhere Spock supply and demand works to find a man doesn't stop because it's just how is the issue\nWhen you have low supply and increased demand costs go up and the one thing to to address that to reduce tight where he was caught it to increase supply I mean we learned about this and basic economic econ one oh one they'd get used to find a mad just because it's ... doesn't mean it doesn't apply to\nA okay we can do the things we can do two minutes rapid fire or you can stick around around you like yeah let's stick around because there's nothing I Love more than going after a San Diego Unified School bus\nAnd I don't want to rush that alright that'd be drawn to go back and forth with you on that one but it's one of our one of my favorite\nPastimes here I I if if if you do nothing else\nThis is not dramatic reinforced against why why I Am okay if you do nothing else I don't I don't care if you don't even know the president is this is one of those things I Would buy lots of people I go to different states\nHere you go out I'll give you a legal how I'd go to wanna hypothetical so I don't know I Would I go to if you want to get a bus she'll vote of no wild all day\nAnd I would sleep soundly and I just find it because of that back yes\nI'd help [laughter]\nI saw that the book predictable hypothetical one in seven sixty can be pow Lamar so we're going to put a voter got out what's what's what looking like here what are we talking you got you're shaking your head what's what's the deal for weeks later give us your voter guy give us your body but\nWe're we're we're getting there were getting their lucky we'll switch really God gave it two years ago it is yeah usually there's no way to go against recommendation\nChris was getting ready to\nPower or solar uh same thing it's so expensive to live in California I was going to get even worse if why why passes\nSo and I have all these other\nSo there are the same thing it's so expensive to live in California I was going to get even worse if why why passes\nSo and all these other things ... one through four are more tax increases I started is gonna get more expensive so you got to do whatever we can smart now to save money so solar panels may prefer that doesn't make sense anywhere else [laughter] maybe there's a few other locations in the country like Phoenix maybe it makes\nA good site\nBut it makes even maybe that's even make sense of Phoenix because I don't know what the electricity right down there but it could be
