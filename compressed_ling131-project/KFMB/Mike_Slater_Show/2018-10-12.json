the movie there's some funny things in there too [laughter] I mean he smiles and laugh and then you know carry the surrounding those other stuff\nYou read the movie get you know try to show different facets of you know\nHow accurate is that when a in a very moving scene or set of scenes when Apollo eleven is going to happen and your dad Neal Armstrong is going to leave the buzz Aldrin them and then\nMy Collins and your mom Janet who's really\nI'm pressing him just like hey you know is this coming back or not answering them to go talk to the kids um you know you guys as brothers you and Margaret asking if you're coming back or what are the chances I mean there was a lot of added again that's a very dramatic kind of a slow part of the movie but it's it's gripping\nUh so how accurate is that\nOh well we definitely had that meeting a you know they got that information from us ah the lie that Ryan says uh as dad are pretty much exactly what I remember\nUm you know I don't think that I asked in the I think they're coming back because I was sure he was coming back uh I I I thought that you know whatever happened they figure it out\nA\nForce nice being a twelve down because I was kind of old enough to know what was going on but maybe not really old enough to understand all the complexity and the risk so it wasn't until years later that I figured out that ah you know maybe my belief system at that time had a few flaws in it\nBut uh no that's fine that's that yeah that that meeting happy\nAnd also it was kind of like I mean to be in the astronaut community in those days um it it was in many respects kind of a day at the office the dads going to work but the abduction of doing next Fifteen test flights or whatever you've got all these\nLegends living in the neighborhood and whites are the first American to walk in space would eventually parish in the Apollo one fire\nOn the on the launch fan I'm just it it is so much of that is probably hard for an average American to to get to you at an average average kids up bring it just happened to a very famous fathers working on this\nUh yeah I think we're we're you know we just thought of ourselves as a normal family and and\nYou know dad had a you know extraordinary job but it it's still being just like a chopped us\nWhat was the most excited that you can remember or one of the times in the family environment where your dad came home from work or maybe it's after months of training or what have you know and what what are you get excited about when he did get on the ... and and what does that look like because I\nKnow I've been having to blow the pleasure of knowing your dad for a bit before he passed away back in the day and getting that then is why I think Gosling plays him so well but he he didn't really get Exxon got amped up with me a couple of times on something passionate but then that was that was seldom\nPretty rare you know pretty rare he was pretty even killed most of the time you know he did you didn't have a good sense of humor yeah uh he like he had a kind of a dry wit and then you need like to tell jokes sometimes and then he'd laugh at him or whether they were that funny or not or\nWhat what kind of one example as a kid or something that really sticks with you where it was I had maybe had nothing to do with it you know what I'm doing we're working going to the moon and we're working the Gemini program whatever's just being bad what was a\nOne one thing we like to do especially when my when my uncle who was his\nAnd my uncle who was his younger brother came to visit was we play the marathon gangs of risk so uh you know a board game where you had to sort of conquer the world yeah and and and these games will go on for\nA you know and so I think that was a good\nBe a good down time\nFor him [noise] so what do you make about training ... ... and again\nThose kinds of things are moving through this you can't tell the whole story in two hours and Fifteen minutes or ... of the film but they do a pretty darn good job and and I'll tell you the next Fifteen opening sequence where your dad the alarm strong is up there\nOn a test flight as they all were having debt is grab your seat you ain't seen nothing yet kind of stuff the Gemini aid sequences or how they they give a different perspective to the Apollo eleven landing but in in between there's a lot of drama there's\nThe your parents dealing with the end of the whole family dealing with a lawsuit her sister and a very young age I mean that becomes a subplot but it helps you understand Neil Armstrong and it helps us understand what\nI mean what that was like here you are going off on three hundred and sixty three feet of in terms of Apollo\nA liquid fueled a hope it all works built by the lowest better rocket in Idaho and there's all kinds of stuff you know it's it's pretty incredible really\nYeah I think that the story that movie does a nice job of showing that you know ... home life was like even if you know it felt like we scripted out all the uh the seemed at home especially where there's not really any dialogue\nRight and Arizona liberties because it yeah they could it could have happened mhm they couldn't read to you know the exactly\nWhat your dad was thinking but as you can surmise that and they take some liberties and there's a part of the movie uh I don't want to be the spoiler here but there's a part that I remember I I talk to you about after I saw it a couple of weeks ago is that really happens on we don't know that it didn't happen so\nThat you have to kind of sort that out too but this whole idea of there was some some effort to make it look like a generic nation went to the moon that's just baloney and then I mean this this this last for people haven't seen her happens India\nWell I mean I I I understand there's people out there that you know the flag planning was very important to them uh and and maybe they remember you know the vice magazine cover\nMhm uh you know are saying this picture of than that but you know so that took that picture\nRight as he did and people don't realize most of the pictures are abuzz taken by your taxes which is another right your dad wasn't going to pose no\nI don't know I I'm a you know I I don't know how you can come away out of the movie feeling anything but you know really good about the let's say\nYou know and it really is it's a it's a it expanded telling 'cause I think part of the reason why people are saying well I Want to see that ending the way I've seen is because that's all people have seen\nAgain there's plenty of flags there's plenty of reference to beating the Soviets there was a one of my favorite clips is at the end of the movie when you're seeing reaction in these news clips and there's a woman and I think she was in France who\nSays something like you know we knew I knew America could do this I mean it's not a exactly it's not like they're trying to hide this but it is a different type of different telling\nOf a ... a broader telling about the nature of your dad Neil Armstrong and what's really are and again it's out there it's going to win awards and you're gonna have some people as as the case with any movie of significance some people you know some people going to say it's the worst thing I've ever seen all those people in my opinion\nNeed to go see it again until they figure at all I saw yesterday you were in Washington DC as you know Rick Armstrong and there was the end boiling of this design for a commemorative coin that's coming out this has been a big deal coming together and this will be coming siding with the fiftieth anniversary of that first moon landing on Apollo right at\nThe U.S ... commemorative coin um than that I mean the good thing about it for me is a form of the some of the proceeds are going to be available to the astronaut scholarship foundation which I'm a trustee of\nAnd you know I Love we're going to have to it's a great organizations I Know you do you run the gamut and then uh yeah but that's not an easy project because again if you think it's fun with the I'm just saying this the listeners think is fun determining while how much of the flag this and that new show in the movie we're going to design a national coin [laughter] it's just like\nYeah everybody's got an idea in some of the designs I saw earlier like what were they smoking on that one you know but this has ever\nThere were there were there were some good ones and the ones that you're like out there that get through but uh but yeah I think what they ended up with is pretty good idea to curb coy which is the only the only the second time the makers ever done that\nThere'll be a big ... and again with astronaut scholarships foundation getting some proceeds to help the fire the engineers like Neil Armstrong engineers are the future and is a very very worthy of a thing to support so we'll keep an eye on that and go astronaut scholarship dot org 'cause that's not been only have the pricing said yet or when the official\nCoin release date will be but just in prosecuting\nJanuary are kicking off a year and\nYou know way way actually goes on sale of don't quote me on that but I if I as a last I heard it was toward the end of January\nRight well a great job and I know the historical accuracy the not only you and and the family or your brother mark and so forth being involved in first man and and just the fact that are a lot of the Apollo Astronauts and and others going through the process to make sure that there's a lot of accuracy and they're it's it's a world where it is certainly a lot better than the other movies out there so I Would check that out\nThere they they went well beyond what I ever expected them to do in terms of uh the the historical details so\nGreat stuff they ... and happy travels 'cause they know the press drunk at is underway good luck Rick Armstrong of the sun one of the job market is his brother mark\nAnd Rick Armstrong on the ... what's left the Armstrong family\nAnd talking about the first man movie in the new coin coming out as well which brings me to the San Diego air and Space Museum

real economy is very strong\nYeah better but there's some stuff out there though like I see a story and just right in front of me or one of the stories about China not buying as much of the stuff from the term I ... I mean\nThat that that is a threat there is no doubt about it I mean you're right about that and\nWe need to get this trade or you know one we have to win the trade war against China and I think ultimately will we will and I don't know how long that's going to take but I think\nYou know my point is like we're gonna have to confront China soon you know and at some point we can't keep taking these abusive practices that are happening under under a under China and we can't allow them to keep building up their military in a in a way that is threatening to the whole of peace and prosperity of the Asian\nOr Asian continent and so what better time to confront them then what we when our economy is run by the way you know we've seen of south saw in the stock market but what people are talking about in China their stock market is down to almost twenty five percent this year\nSo that's not proud of all those fandom a city is there with buildings I just kept building for the sake of saying look out great we are and there's no people in them touching up on them\nWell there's a panic over there and Beijing and they they don't quite know how to deal with dropping my point is I think Trump is going to prevail and that some and it's not like don't forget my we had the big Canada Mexico trade agreement that that was um you know are arranged last week\nAnd that's a huge huge game for Trump because it means that the likelihood of a big uh you know a trade war now ... with with our allies is substantially reduced so\nYeah let's call me polish you know I but I I'm going to stick with my prediction ... continued strong stock market and we're gonna she continued high growth\nFor at least for next Eighteen months and that's not to say there aren't going to be some ups and downs of peaks and valleys but you know you you cut taxes you cut regulations you cut the price of energy good things happen for the economy\nWell let's not forget where the Dow is a lot of times is this report oil horrible day and I know it dropped by over a couple of days five percent or whatever it was a big number but still\nThe Dow averages up a grant us fear here and I mean compared to I still remember years ago people said well the dollar twenty thousand not a chance never going to happen and then then it happens and then we're well above [laughter] so are these are factors too\nRight [noise] yeah\nI mean that's true and and I am worried I as as Trump is about the about the Federal Reserve bank\nInterest rates are a factor that's a problem right\nWell yeah I mean like why is that every time the economy does well that the fed wants to choke it off by raising interest rates now I'm not so concerned about the last couple of interest rate\nRises I mean those are probably justified given how low rates have been but they're talking about taking these the the founders right up to over three percent and maybe three and a half percent well that's ridiculous inflation is only run again\nTwo two and a half percent so I just I think there's a there's this idea that the fed has to take you know what's the old cliche take the punch bowl away from the party every time it gets it gets rolling\nAnd you know Trump is basically saying look I don't see inflation out there I mean there's now it is true gas but I Am worried about energy crisis because they present I pay three Seventy nine a gallon a gallon to\nEither you're almost don't our neighborhood now well the color of their eyes are going to say hey you know as we're acting\nThree Seventy now you're going to start paying for Seventy and\nWe've been there before I just say that the uh worked for the week the crude oil prices in Seventy one thirty one well I don't\nYou know I don't like seeing you know a money taken from people's pocketbooks from in paying higher gas prices and you know a year but there again I was just on tax is about three or four weeks ago in the Permian Basin meddling\nI mean my God everywhere you can stick stick on the ground there drilling for oil and gas out there so I even think that these high energy prices are are very temporary I think they're going to go down again so like I'm an optimist I mean you're not going to take that away from me Mark I'm I'm sticking with my story which is\nWe're a miserable sunshine boom is right and and you take ... and knowing where we're getting less of a break because of the new tax law here in California but I Know you like that you're you're just to basically say fix it or leave I I Know that's a Sunday after most of the well\nThis is the kind of economic boom that even the number ... schools\nAnd I and in Sacramento can't screw up down\nWell now they dry up that challenge they'll find a way to do the one\nCar parade and it's even more with his Heritage Foundation and the artificial economist than the author co author with art Laffer of the new Trump ... ah\nYeah thank you for the advertisement comes down to two weeks so I ...

[laughter]\nAnd so I was on the phone I don't see who you are are you good I don't want this preliminary research it's not about farming\nIt's about save at a hundred years ago it was about saving money\nOn candle wax so if we changed the hour we'll get a little more hour of daylight another hour of daylight so we wanted to spend as much money on candles to light our homes at night\nThat was the original beginnings of daylight savings [noise] think that that I got to do or is there but I think that's\nWhat's going on and that's interesting I was like I was like I I always or you can go back about I always said that it was a farming something related but it looks like if this is the case then it it's not it's not farming okay I don't think I don't do a lot more okay\nSo it's a bigger thing than we think it's a much bigger thing with lots of implication wow I'll give you this example that provision\nDuring the summer hours when we do the same thing right ah and if they get darker later I swim more yeah somebody later under the value of a summer thing people do more stuff uh yeah yeah I could cut more than ... ... there's something about a late you know eight nine o'clock\nK let's go out to eat let's go golfing sure let's go wherever let's go let's go shopping still a lot of late at night I'll never forget I was up in Seattle went to a soccer game an eight got out of ten and it was still like it was like five o'clock at night and so it turns out one of the biggest lobbying groups to\nPush for daylight savings that actually started earlier in the year our gas station convenience stores because when we go do things later at night we drive there oh so that they found out that they have over a billion dollars in extra sales\nBut hold on yeah just during the daylight savings time\nThey calculated it just because of the shower just a specific our gets it gets convenience stores and ... billion dollars in sales what I'm saying I could have been out on the street there's money to gas stations follow the money you could have been ripping on everyone totally all the money to big daylight saving you got to go after\nCommon protests may yes he's in the course of

ones do have physical impacts those is just that we really wanted to concentrate our firepower\nNo there isn't as I understand what you're saying okay let's see what ... what uh what is prop one\n... of four billion dollar a housing bond measure authorizes bond fund\nSpecified housing assistance programs for low income residents veterans from workers and others uh your typical housing bond\nThe question I think people need to ask themselves number one is more debt advisable for the state of California and the second controversy that you don't see in the uh in the arguments is that this is a under the purview of a veterans bombs and we've often\nAre just kind of stood on the sidelines on veterans bonds because of the service that they provided to the to the country however this is not limited to veterans bonds and some people have alleged\nThat they're using the kind of flag veterans to do other things here and that is that's kind of par for the course in politics using veterans are using other props police fire uh so I Know how I'm voting against this one I don't think we need the additional debt\nUh but that is a that people ever decide for themselves I don't know if they want four billion dollars worth of additional debt\nAnd the I so I really like how does the bonds of our rights and when it's four billion dollars it's actually way more than ...\nIt's a it's a lot more you know the rule of thumb is if it's four billion dollar bond it'll be eight billion dollar costs because you'd be used for in most instances you about double it\nFor the repayment costs and of course there's a whole industry that loves bonds the bond underwriters the bond lawyers the wall street Wall Street loves California bonds because you know we're we're pretty rich state at least for now and uh and uh they make\nA lot of money on these things so that's that's the bottom line on that one I'll get a prompt too is another few good title yeah another\nOne this is you know puppies and now this was authorizing bonds to fund existing housing programs\nFor individuals with mental illness this is a little controversial I really don't have too much of a take on this one this actually simply diverts\nThe prop sixty three millionaires tax allows a securitization meaning bonding that revenue stream and and putting it into the housing programs um [noise] uh what can you say about this one it's another bond\nBut local governments have been very uh have been sitting on prop sixty three money\nFor a long time and they these people will argue they need a swift kick in the parents to

keep going John and listen I'm just excited to get to prop seven so it's everything I can to not to get bad to that but let's go and order a prop size what does this one\nA prop ... we support this this is a under\nProposition Thirteen property is reassess the full market value when you move\nThis has provided a disincentive for a for older people who have been in their homes for a long period of time\nTo move out of their homes because if they move here in California\nThey're going to be the taxes on their new places are going to be a lot higher\nWhat this would do would be to allow people to take their prop Thirteen base with them to a new residents under certain wow if if they're fifty five years old or older or disabled\nThis is not only good for seniors who are a lot of our members are seniors I'm this also would be good it's not a complete panacea but it would help a little bit with the housing crisis because\nA lot of empty nesters are living in homes that they mean that are too big for\nThem but they ... that they feel like they're trapped in them so what this does is right now you can move to a different home within your same county\nAnd take a prop Thirteen base with you this would actually open it up state why this is what we call the portability issue the the ability the portability of your prop Thirteen base to a new place\nAnd we very much support this um there's some were political stuff going on with this this has supported and drafted by the realtors they're\nThey're backing down a little bit on this or not funding it like I thought they they wouldn't be they think they can get a better deal than next election cycle but we're we're fully supportive of this anything that in the hands just portability is supported by the Howard German\nTaxpayer loves it actually so are you saying that this is already the case in San Diego county if you move from\nYeah if you move from one you have to check with your county assess er and er I think that's\nEarning earning you know what you already it's already drawn to ... probably the greatest county assigns or in a country song writer he came in here and where he's one of our favorite\nGuests when he came into became counties that's what he said he got rid of all the hanky panky down at the county says his office his words yeah he's\nHe he uh you look he's been on the board of equalization he knows this stuff inside and out so if you have any questions about that go see his office but a ... anybody who moves within the county and doesn't apply to take their base you you're missing out on you're missing out on a lot because you can save a ton of money\nOh sure oh got great love that and I'm sure the Democrats have made it so that's the only reason to ya okay let's go out quickly prospects are this is the gas yeah probably\nSix I don't you know we don't have talked about\nThis well yeah there's a lot of his kitty yes there will be a I think this is\nYes yes yes prop six repeals the gas tax\nOr up on the heels of the guys I mean we have ... uh\nYeah uh no well not all of\nThem going ...\n... that's part of the disinformation out there um if proposition to six passes this repeals the gas tax that was imposed last year via Senate bill one if it passes we will go back to having the fifth highest gas\nAmerica so\nAll these people who say that western civilization we'll grind to a halt\nIf prop six passes that is foolish we will continue to have more than enough revenue to ah to maintain and expand our current road jokes are so the I mean they're out there with firefighters saying that this is a safety issue\nAgain nonsense if if they were truly a safety issue we should be using general fund revenue a not a not taxing\nMiles an hour laughing at the top six out this morning where they show it says about bridging road safety and they show the corner bridge like that in danger of collapsing at any minute John as we don't have the gas tax you remember well have\nYou seen them have you seen the mail or with a firefighter on the front turns out that guy is made last year three hundred and twenty seven thousand\nDollars\nI didn't know that actually has real firefight out or the other thing that that\nWas that was a state wide mailer and the guy that they put the they named him he's the head of the union and they named him in somebody went on line on the California transparent website and ... and so how much he made last\nThree hundred and twenty seven thousand dollars so my advice to the no one's six side is if you're going to have a poster child arguing against a repeal of a punishing tax it might be a good idea not to use someone who's cleared more than three\nTimes out of all the firefighters but I think a lot of religion that guy out of all of them you choose that guy\nLet's do a cool well listen I where I have about ... but it's actually super fascinating I think still go ahead what what are your thoughts on\nYup yup but basically this would be the first step or getting rid of daylight savings time she'll conforming to fulltime daylight saving times say savings time would require a federal waiver this\nAllows the legislature to apply for the federal waiver I Am personally voting for this I Wish we would go on full time saving\nSome hard living so oh ... oh yeah I mean like why would we need a federal laborer who doesn't like Indiana not habit or something\nYeah well they got the federal waiver\nWow that's a federal could we got a federal labor\nI I think so I I think they were used to the to to the voters I mean I I don't know where most but some people say they don't like that they like savings time at all some people they want it fulltime other people say keep it what it is I think it's a kind of thing that we need that first step though even have the discussion\nThat we need that what do\nWe like why can't they just go do it why can't they discussed it in Sacramento why do we need ... well well be\nBecause the the the time zones again are set by federal law because of the interstate commerce things like airline schedules get all messed up and everything like that so you need some degree of federal oversight on on conforming\nSo we have to do so we have to do a proposition first\nNo I I don't I don't feel it let's see what it said give legislature the ability to change daylight saving time\nAnd time period by two thirds vote so it would take a two thirds vote of the California legislature which is probably not a bad idea because I think this the kind of thing you want some degree I sense sure hum so they could do it would not none of you'd be put to vote but it would require a pretty good consensus\nI mean the the politicians would have to have a pretty good sense of where they're considered you know why are you so for it [noise]\nWell I I think what they want to do is to make sure that the facilities are staffed by a union personnel um it's it requires rebates and penalties of churches exceed limit requires ale reporting to the state\nProhibits these dialysis clinic from refusing to treat patients based on payments or physical impact overall annual effect of state and local governments ranging from net positive impact in the low tens of millions of net negative in the tens of millions so physical impact is a big\nUh but it is it is something that uh it it would be more government intrusion into health care and I'm not a big fan of\nYet and Republican parties against the Democrats are for that okay we'll do the ... years ago now and that one's it seems odd a prompt does\nA prompt ten I'm horrible this would uh this would make it easier for local governments\nTo enact rent control ordinance is a we have taken an official position on this we are a strong no on this we we we do not want\nA five hundred and fifty local rent stabilization boards telling people how much they can rent out their homes for how much do how much they can rent apartments for every jurisdiction that has rent control\nHas a massive expensive bureaucracy that goes with it this is a strong\nThat maybe before the election we can just do one segment on this one and on rent control but maybe give us a couple of sentences on why philosophically rent control your you're opposed to it\nOr philosophically it's it's it's government telling which you can sell for a product I mean the economists have for years said the two most effective ways to destroy a city is is through carpet bombing and Lincoln for\nA ... you know this is this is a a a it restricts the market we understand that there is a housing crisis but restricting the market and trying to regulate the government the government is not the answer\nTo your saying to the little old lady who's been living in this apartment for X number of years and it's going to get rent it out because landlords are greedy\n[noise] I I I Would tell her to go to the city council and say you guys need to start building more housing ... ...\nUh we'll talk more about that one and we get closer to supply and demand issue yeah yeah I wanted I wanted a deeper that 'cause that's probably one of the most ... like a lot uh where was I oh is that some conservative\nGroup meeting right like\nTea Party kind of right and some guy got up there for office\nAnd he said I'm against the gas tax and everyone's here that I'm against this and every once you're not again that's against the rent control and everyone so this is a weird ones were even concern real any conservatively are for rent control\nYeah yeah I I you know it's a how well the price controls work out for President Nixon ... you know it it doesn't that doesn't have a problem in\nAll right this is a an another territory for territorial I'm a ... excuse my language\nBetween private sector and ambulance services and public sector\nThe law entirely hourly employees to breaks without being on call would not apply to private sector ambulance employees so ... what a yes vote on this would mean that private ambulance companies could continue their current practice\nOf having their technicians their employees remain on call during their meal in a rush breaks so uh uh because there was a statute passed it says no no no you guys can't do that\nUm [noise] uh I I think uh this is a um I'd have a free market guy so I like this this is a a yes vote for me 'cause I don't think government should come in\nAnd order private companies to say what their terms of employment are particularly\nFor for personnel who have to react on a moment's notice if you've got to if you provide a private ambulance service and you've only got one ambulance in a particular geographic area in there at McDonald's and there's been billed as a traffic accident\nYou got to be able to see you got to be able to send them and you can't be able to say oh I'm Sorry he's eating it's big\nIt's a Big Mac you know that doesn't work so uh that that is\n... so a father's such a there's got to be a weird back story as to why private ambulance employees like ... and why not why them and why not other groups as well you don't have that\n... well it is you know my guess is I haven't done a deep dive into this my guess is the uh the uh public sector EMT providers want to make life as difficult as possible for the private ... because their competition\nYes yep yeah that sounds right so ... so who would have put this on the ballot the private folks\nLet's see the uh the yes was I'm not sure not sure if it comes up with a you know the California for emergency preparedness head and saying that he is so you know\nThings are interesting so yes ... is the free market ... says the free market yes okay wow we're is a free market for okay ah well wrap it up about twelve\n... twelve um [laughter] this is another uh this is another uh this should have designed to move more food production out of state\nThis tablets his new standards for
