time is what you pay if the checkout is going up\nAnd so this time right now is the strongest and probably a decade\nFor the argument that I may be you should buy private label or store brand instead of buying the brand name because I mean who's money isn't it's your money\nAnd so I'm very experimental\nWith private labels and I tried different ones and we accept or reject based on a basically a

[noise] so I guess my question is what do I do with this money to ...\nWhere do you do have the option of just leaving it and were those big companies small or in between that you were with before\nOkay so the one with Eighteen thousand is on I'm most concerned with a smaller company and I'm worried that they go out of business what happens to that money\nFor the money would be okay and the four oh one K. but if it's a small business there's a different issue and that small businesses tend to have very high cost for one case right\nSo I was scared at all that money out quickly and move it to one of the low cost providers and have an IRA with one of them the three big low cost providers for having IRAs are vanguard Charles Schwab and fidelity investments [noise]\nOkay than we have them and let me tell you how many do not call the\nAdministrator of the four oh one K. and say hey I Want to um move this money out and do an iron they'll say great what address you want to send you a check never take a check 'cause what they do\nIs they would subtract thirty six hundred dollars from the check they send you and send it to the IRS says withholding\nAnd you have to make up that thirty six hundred in the next sixty days or you end up paying massive tax for not being able to make that up so what you do with whoever you would go with\nIs they'll do paperwork that will move the money directly from the old employer's plan straight into wherever you're going to have the IRA\nAnd an end you recommend an IRA or the Roth IRA ...\nI'm not you have to I just I Know I hear you talk about you know I just thought\nYou said the story as you can't take money there was in a traditional four one K.\nAnd put it into a Roth without having a big tax bill because all that money they don't want him was pre tax correct so you go into a traditional i._r._a. without money not a Roth IRA okay and you can over time migrate the money\nFrom the traditional to a Roth as she could afford to pay tax on money each year or you just know you got money that they are that's going to grow over the years that you're gonna have to pay tax on Sunday so let's talk about the other one the seven thousand is that in a big employers plan or small\nIt's a very large employer or their trail the stock exchange\nSo it was a big employer the odds favor that that will be an extremely low cost plan probably lower than you could find in an IRA okay\nSo are the only exception to that would be if they have that money administered by an insurance company for them the four one K. or buy a bank\nIt's it's it's it's just through one of the three that you mentioned\nDollar and you could just leave at seven behind him move the Eighteen\nOkay and then as far as contributing to that ... then you're able to contribute straight to the IRA versus trying to go through back\nBearing in question rue great question so let's say let's keep those simple I in fact let me let me really think about this who is the company that administers the plan for the big publicly traded company used to work for\nIts vanguard so if you wanted to keep it simple um move both of 'em did vanguard in an IRA and just be done with the old employers for one\nCase 'cause it was with vanguard the costs so being low enough as an individual anyway and then you've got the simplification of just having an IRA there and then at vanguard open a raw for any future contributions\nTo you if the twenty five to grow in a vanguard IRA and then you open a new account with vanguard for Ross in any current or future contributions he may go into the raw\nOkay and then those can be so just so I'm Sorry I I'm not a hundred percent up to date on all these states that Iraq is post tax correct\nExactly yeah and you're already going to have twenty five grand that center pre tax account you want to have money in a post tax accountant or raw truly great to have a mix of both but tilted more towards the Roth\nThis will be a way for you to do it you simplify your life you just have an IRA vanguard a Roth IRA vanguard old money and the IRA new money and the Roth IRA and that would be a good way for you to build up money going

[noise]\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n\nMessaging data rates may apply matching having a master's degree from a real class go on your resume without setting foot on campus or paint anywhere near what you would expect\nWhat would it mean for your career your income your future of course the around the world destination for online education you don't have to imagine you can find out today because of course there are partners with top ranked universities to let you take a master's degree courses on line before even applying to a degree program like an MBA from the university\nAll right so let's go to the core or something and this is something I've heard from several doctors\nMan this is very frustrating to them with the with the ads for these pharmaceuticals on TV because they all have patients come in and they're already pre sold die\nI Want you to write me a script for blah blah blah because I saw it it's going to do all these miraculous things and suddenly I'm going to look like those people on the TV and addition to curing white males me and so the perspective I've gotten from physicians is that we're the problem\nMore than anything else and that we're allowing ourselves to be too influenced by these ads running on TV\nYou know I've heard the same but it's also it's important to remember that at this point in the U.S health care system it's all about turnover or Catholic Haitian in healthcare terms\nWhich means they've got to get you into the office and out of the office as fast as possible so if a patient is digging in his or her heels and said I Want drug X Y Z and I'm not gonna take no for an answer [noise]\nA lot of doctors will simply write the script just to get things moving along and that's kinda why the drug industry now puts more money into marketing does into research because they know what's affective they don't need to get everybody\nDemanding a prescription med or a brand name it what they need to get it's just a significant number\nTo make it defensible and justifiable and keep you in the brand name fold and that's where part of the problem is and let's also underline this point Clark and that is there are only two nations in the entire world that allows so called direct to consumer advertising a prescription drugs and that off\nAnd New Zealand and that's it\nEvery other country especially developed countries like us have looked at that practice has said no we see that as doing more harm than good because let's face it the decisions are meant to be made by trained licensed health care professionals and not\nAmateurs like you and me and everybody listening and therefore it doesn't serve the public interest to do that in fact the American Medical Association has called for an end of his practice because they've seen is just inflating drug prices and hearing people into expensive treatment regimens there would be\nMuch cheaper alternatives for\nSo is it best what you and I can do is we can't change that a momentum and we're not that powerful sorry [laughter] I Can't change that momentum so we've got to go\nBack to basics and that is if the core most of us are going to do just fine where they're generic mad that already exists for a condition that ails us\nI think that's absolutely true I think also people need to be more open minded to the idea that their doctor when they come back at you with a idea that\nWell there is a generic or there's an alternative drug you might want to explore this cheaper or covered by your insurance\nYou certainly want to listen because this is somebody who's read all of the academic papers and on all of the research that you haven't done so yeah you want to listen to that person and I would also encourage people to wait till they were elected representatives because indeed\nIf we do want to try to bring the drug industry focused once again on curing ailments as opposed to moving product getting rid of the direct to consumer ads would be a\nBig step in the right direction because that's\nBillions of dollars that would therefore be redirected backing to lower useful endeavors such as basic research and wouldn't require me to explain to my son what he does what or watching sports together on TV\n[laughter]\nBest thing you said was that [laughter]\nWas gosh I Can't get past you have a new explain that to your son\nThe best thing you said is that there are now spending more money on this marketing and they're spending on are indeed to actually make drugs that will improve people's lives and that is a real miss direction a national wealth\nTo have all that money going to the ads and so don't mind them change your mind don't make those ads influence what you are going to consult with your doctor about\nIn fact I don't even pay attention to those ads because let's face it they are not imparting sufficient amount of information for you to make an informed decision and therefore they're not worth your time\nFor David Lazarus from Los Angeles times thank you so much for joining us and you keep that passion and by the way how did you explain to your son when he Diaz says family radio\nWell I Would say the things that lasts for four hours probably aren't good under any circumstances [laughter]\n[laughter]\nOkay\nCorey with us on the car I Want to show oh Corey how you doing\nHi Clark I'm good how are you great thank you [noise] Corey you've got\nSomething that happened in your life it's not a laughing matter\nIt's a good matter I mean we we were able to acquire are but unfortunately a those after my wife has a my wife's dad passed away\nWhile I'm very sorry about her loss well thank you\nHow can I be of service in this situation\nBut cause us to take a look at our a auto insurance because we ah we added another car we had really looked at it in a while it kind of\nRealize we might be paying too much for auto insurance and we started looking at our policy and we're kind of trying to figure out where we can save money with where everything's set out as far as our coverage so are we are going to be adding a\nSix sixteen and Seventeen year old son onto the policy within the next six months\nOh oh oh\nOh I just have your wallet just take that not even stab your while it a lot you know 'cause that's what happens when you get a teen driver on your insurance\nYes you know we're lucky enough so that we didn't have to buy the car\nTrue so or saving money there any of the\nCars you have old enough that you can avoid taking a coalition and comprehensive on that vehicle\nYes and that's a matter of trying to sell that to my wife but that was that if one of the first stop along with um raising our deductibles\nYeah I'm a ... fan and raising their doctor moles okay and try to raise those two thousand that's usually if you're going to have any vehicle you have has alone that may be the max you're allowed to raise it to okay but that helps and you were\nFive hundred now so\nIt's a raise it to the thousand because you don't want to make a five hundred a claim on something between five hundred thousand dollars anyway no because the insurer will just eat you up on premiums so you want to avoid that and then\nHow old are your vehicles\nYeah because the insurer will just each up there in premiums so you want to avoid that and then\nHow old are your vehicles\nOur oldest vehicle as a ... for\nYeah you only want to have liability on that one\nYeah that's OK let's stick to the other two are neuro we have a two thousand you just take the car we just got to the two thousand at fourteen so\nYou're a teenager needs to be driving the oh for if your wife or permit that\nYes I don't know how much longer we're going to have the ... or but yes that's going to be the one that is going to spend the most for sure\nSo as you in this case there may be an advantage and talking with an independent agent\nOkay that you know something people really don't do any more but there are ... agents that are like free agents and they quote various insurance companies\nAnd they've been there done that for a long time most of them are older because a lot of young people have no interest in becoming\nAn insurance agent and they're very experience and can tell you based on how rates are set in your state and situations they've done with the new drivers were teenagers what's going to be the thing that will get you the best overall total premium\nOkay great sometimes\nDepending on the state and how rapes tend to be set in the state it may be a advantageous to have\nYour son is the owner of that vehicle so fair and be on a separate policy and then in other places it may be better for him to only be named an additional driver with no specific vehicle assigned to him\nPerfect that's where the independent agent becomes so valuable because they know\nHow best to quote it and they can quote from many different companies\nThere are some what are known as direct writer companies are ones that you probably see pretty heavily advertised on TV they will not commission and independent agent and said hey agent will not be able to quote those but they don't have enough\nDifferent companies they can quote to you that they'll be able to guide you best\nPerfect perfect here we've got some numbers already from friends that have gone down that path that it seems like it'd be very helpful to have some specific self us\nAnd you got to make sure they're not what's called a captive agent for\nExample State Farm and all state the agents that right for them or what are known as captives they only for those companies and independent agent is not assigned to a specific company and they can quote many different ones\nGreat sort of independent agent okay you're

are having a really hard time acquiring new customers\nThey have really spent themselves into exhaustion with various sign up bonuses trying to capture customers\nAnd the big problem for the credit card companies is having an offer that is compelling enough that you're willing to change your patterns and what you use\nAnd you'll get a new one\nThat you're willing to change your patterns and what you use and you'll get a new one so\nCredit card companies know one of the things that holds you back\nIs your concern about having a heart in Korea on your credit especially if you're declined from

risk was certain dietary supplements [laughter]\n\nFor just a moment [noise]\nThere's a new report out in the journal of the American Medical Association that a large number of dietary supplements that were subject to recall last year are still being sold on store shelves\nAnd still being sold on the Internet these items are extremely dangerous and ah in fact the wording in the journal the American Medical Association these products have the potential to cause severe adverse health effects\nI mean that's as clear as it could possibly be for somebody writing about medicine right and these supplements that are being sold that are very dangerous\nFit into three particular areas where items are being sold with extremely dangerous ingredients in them that can lead to heart trouble high blood pressure a number of things and they're most heavily\nA dietary supplements being sold to people that are trying to do a weightlifting build up muscle mass\nPeople they're trying to lose weight\nAnd people that are trying to help themselves in the bedroom and so those three areas\nWhich are that's one that's a pretty large segment those three of the dietary supplement industry and what I can recommend is what I've recommended in the past is that you buy dietary supplements that are us pi raided\nBed it's an organization that has a voluntary code of conduct in the absence of\nFDA oversight based on a law passed by Congress last decade dietary supplements industry operates removed from and protected from normal safety oversight and only after the fact that leads to recalls\nDoes the FDA have any power over dietary supplements so in other words people after suffer medical harm before there's any action but in this case where there's been action\nThe companies selling dietary supplements or like we're not going to recall um where they can do to us anyway and they're still for sale we\nAre posting at Clark dot com the list of ingredients that specifically

clock if you historically have gotten your vehicle alone at the car dealer\nAnd instead this time you get it at a credit union\nYou will likely drive the interest rate back to below what it would have been in a car dealer before interest rates rose cause the interest rate differences so gigantic between a credit union and a car dealer and significant between a credit union and a bank\nThe other thing is as you are\nShopping around for a vehicle I Want you to use the on line methods to shop for a vehicle if you're a member of one of the big warehouse cubs Costco and Sam's they both have car buying programs no negotiation and the marketplace\nSoftness is directly reflected in the pricing you'll see from those programs superior usa a member I Want you to what to buy a vehicle through their

I Hope you are too\nIs I Am thank you\nSo you've got a question for me that how you're doing makes a huge difference potentially to how I answer the question\nThey may help in the long run I was just curious about the\nQuestion concerns about taking Social Security at a sixty two [noise] and possibly investing that whole mail as opposed to waiting for the higher mount a later age I feel like the right of investment you probably wouldn't be\nDoing better off than waiting kills a sixty six and four months\nSo it seems like a whole chunk of change your government handle and you could probably be doing something with it yourself\nStunner is at what investments are in today what savings are in today it is nearly impossible\nFor someone to take early Social Security invest that money and out or in what the putative advantages to you waiting those extra for years to take your Social Security the reason is is it every year you wait\nYou get a Social Security check roughly eight percent larger and then as the cost of living adjustments occur\nYour cost of living adjustment of space for the rest of your life on a higher initial him out\nSo and also there's no tax you are going to go\nFor waiting to take Social Security versus taking it early investing the money and then if you do well investing you then have to pay tax on the money you earned investing so there are a lot of inherent advantages to wait\nAnd the most common age people take Social Security is what you're new to laying right now at age\nSixty to write my advice is when you've got to have the money is when you take it and in my case you know what age I'm going to take it\nToo late age Seventy that's the last time you can take it and get all that build up of the eight percent price my extra each year\nRight and so I'm going to a hold out till the last minute so that I can end up with a much larger Social Security check at the time I take it\nSo you gave the ah you gave the analogy of sixty two and your retirement age which you say sixty six years four months is that what she said yes\nSo if you were still doing okay financially and you didn't even need it then I Would like you to keep kicking the can forward\nI plan on it I'm pretty healthy I'm not going anywhere I'm\nStill feel like I'm Eighteen so I don't think anything's going to stop me soon so probably a good advice it just seemed like a lot of money left on the table my calculations kept telling me to eleven years to regain the money that I let go at sixty two\nThat's completely true but the big problem with um retiring\nTo regain the money that I like go at sixty two\nThat's completely true but the big problem with um retirement years is later and retirement\nWhen we may not be physically able if we needed more money to go back to work we may have more medical bills I mean the fatter check becomes more benefits now let me tell you the risk I'm taking my brother\nIn January my oldest brother it will have live longer than any mail\nIn my entire family tree and as far back as any of us know ever and he will be at that time Seventy two\nSo you know that we are not a genetically disposed to live long those guys in my family so can you imagine I'm going to wait until late Seventy [laughter] I may have no benefit I ever get out of the system\nThe mother that's over Ninety and she's still kicking so I\nWill say in your case there is a direct advantage to waiting because what you really concerned about is way down the road so I Hope that my brother ah who also\nWaited 'til age Seventy he ends up live in a really really really long time for many reasons not having anything to do with money\nNoble is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi how you doing\nThis fog or talk to them than well thank you so much Yes sir\nSo you have had a nasty gram from a credit card company why did they do to you\nSo I opened up a credit card or a store called I Know you're not a I Know you're not saying I'm a several years ago and I haven't used it in years and it's only got a limit of about a thousand dollars nothing to do or anything like that on it but I got an email saying that\nUh if I didn't use the card by December ... that they were going to close the cards and I wanted to see if it would be\nIn my best interests that I guess in my credits best interests I close the cart then or if I just let them closer or or or what we'll do that\nThat makes no difference either way but I wanted to ask you a question this store card does it have a visa and MasterCard logo on it or is it just for purchases and that store\nIt looks like it's just for purchases in the store\nThere's no real advantage to you having that if you have you ever sufficient credit elsewhere visas MasterCard's American Express discover\nOut oh yeah it's it's less than two percent of my overall credit\nAnd decided that we are I Would dump it just I'm just like them kick you the curb\nIn December and be done with them because there's no real advantage to having store credit is looked at in the industry has shrunk credit right and you're not intending to use it again so let it just walk away\nOkay it it did as a either a MasterCard logo uh 'cause\nThen I went to I Want you to keep it keep it to some purchase somewhere or whatever you know five dollar purchase somewhere just something that takes it from being an active to an active card\nPoker then it stays as active and part of your overall credit mix but when it is just a way I think is referred to as a minor line where it's just for that particular store right those you don't want to have\nAll right well that sounds great I sure do appreciate you taking me on the goal and I've been a big fan for years they\nWere your kind to say that thank you so much

[noise] so I guess the question is what do I do with this money to sitting\nFor you do have the option of just leaving it and were those big companies small we're in between that you were with before\nOkay so the one with Eighteen thousand is on I'm most concerned with a smaller company and I'm worried that they go out of business what happens to that much\nMoney would be okay and the four oh one K. but if it's a small business there is a different issue and that small businesses tend to have very high cost for one case right\nSo I Would just get that all that money out quickly and move it to one of the low cost providers and have an IRA with one of them the three big low cost providers for having IRAs are vanguard Charles Schwab and fidelity investments\nOkay than we have a on let me tell you something do not call\nThe administrator of the of the four oh one K. and say hey I Want to um move this money out and do an iron they'll say great what address you want to send you a check never take a check because what they do\nIs they would subtract thirty six hundred dollars from the check they send you and send it to the IRS says withholding and you have to make up that thirty six hundred\nIn the next sixty days or you end up paying massive tax\nFor not being able to make that up so what you do with whoever you would go with\nIs vale do paperwork that will move the money directly from the old employer's plan straight into wherever you're going to have the IRA\nAnd an end you recommend an IRA or the Ross IRA\nI'm now you have to I just I hear you talk about that this fight for this story as you can't take money there was in a traditional four one K.\nAnd put it into a Roth without having a big tax bill 'cause all that money they don't want to end was pre tax correct so you go into a traditional i._r._a. without money not a Roth IRA okay\nAnd you can over time migrate the money\nFrom the traditional to a Roth as you could afford to pay tax on money each year or you know you got money that they are that's going to grow over the years that you're gonna have to pay tax on Sunday then let's talk about the other one the seven thousand is that in a big employers plan or small\nA it's a very large employer they're trading on the stock exchange\nSo it was a big employer the odds favor that that will be an extremely low cost plan probably lower than you could find in an IRA okay so are the only exception to that would be if they have\nThat money administered by an insurance company for them the four one K. or buy a bank\nIt's it's it's it's just through one of the three that you mentioned\nDollar and you could just leave that seven behind and move the Eighteen\nOkay and then as far as contributing to that ... and you're able to contribute straight to the IRA versus trying to go through back\nIn the last year new great question so let's say let's keep this simple I in fact let me let me really think about this who is the company that administers the plan for the big publicly traded company used to work for its vanguard so if you wanted to keep it simple\nUm move both of them the vanguard\nIn in an IRA and just be done with the old employers for one case because if it's with vanguard the costs will be low enough as an individual anyway and then you've got the simplification of just having an IRA there\nAnd then at vanguard open a raw for any future contributions the if the twenty five to grow\nIn a vanguard IRA and then you open a new account with vanguard for raw in any current or future contributions he may go into the raw\nOkay and then those can be so just so I'm Sorry I I'm not a hundred percent up to date on all these states with Iraq is post tax correct\nExactly yeah and you're already going to have twenty five grand that center pre tax account you want to have money in a post tax accountant or raw truly great to have a mix of both but tilted more towards the Roth\nThis'll be a way for you to do what you simplify your life you just have an IRA vanguard a Roth IRA vanguard\nOld money and the IRA new money and the Roth IRA and that would be a good way for you to build up money going forward Chris is

financial institution you're with a credit union bank brokerage whatever and you take an electronic image of yours check your depositing and deposit it in your account\nI had no idea if they were people who were depositing and one account and then going to cash that same check somewhere else\nAnd sticking losses through the banking system well now there's new guidance issued by the Federal Reserve who get stuck with the law is the second time somebody presents a check it's now who wrote the check\nThis out the second financial institution you go to the ... the ... it's the one that you

on the face of the check you're going to deposit\nAnd that it will be something white for mobile deposit only or\nSomething of similar wording that the bank is requiring and that is\nWhat you'll have

anyway\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show\n\nMessaging ... guys this may be the last time you ever have to think about hair loss because I'm telling you bosley he's the real deal they're given men their hair back permanently there real hair all takes to get started on the hair gain train as a single text message\nAll right so let's go to the core or something and this is something I've heard from several doctors\nBut this is very frustrating to them with the with the ads for these pharmaceuticals on TV because they all have patients come in and they're already pre sold die\nI Want you to write me a script for blah blah blah because I saw it it's going to do all these miraculous things and suddenly I'm going to look like those people on the TV and addition to curing white males me and so their perspective I've gotten from physicians is that we're the problem\nMore than anything else and that we're allowing ourselves to be to influence by these ads running on TV\nYou know I've heard the same but it's also it's important to remember that at this point in the U.S health care system it's all about turnover or Catholic Haitian in healthcare terms\nWhich means they've got to get you into the office and out of the office as fast as possible so if a patient is digging in his or her heels and said I Want the drug X Y Z and I'm not going to take no for an answer\nA lot of doctors will simply write the script just to get things moving along and that's kinda why the drug industry now puts more money into marketing does into research because they know what's the effective they all have to get everybody\nDemanding a prescription med or a brand name at what they need to get it's just a significant number to make it defensible and justifiable and keep you in the brand name fold and that's where part of the problem is that let's also underline this point Clark and that is there are only two nations in the entire\nAnd keep you in the brand name fold and that's where part of the problem is that let's also underlined disappoint Clark and that is there are only two nations in the entire world that allows so called direct to consumer advertising a prescription trucks in that\nOff at New Zealand and that's it\nEvery other country especially developed countries like us have looked at that practice has said now we see that is doing more harm than good because let's face it the decisions are meant to be made by ... license health care professionals and not\nAmateurs like you and me and everybody listening and therefore it doesn't serve the public interest to do that in fact the American Medical Association has called for an end of his practice because they said it's just the inflating drug prices and steering people into expensive treatment regimens there would be much cheaper alternatives for\nSo long as it may I ask what you and I can do is we can't change that a momentum and we're not that powerful sorry [laughter] I Can't change that momentum so we've got to go back to basics and that is if the core most of us are going to do just fine\nWith the generic mad that already exists for a condition that ails us\nI think that's absolutely true I think also people need to be more open minded to the idea that their doctor when they come back at you with a idea that well there is a generic or there was an alternative drug you might want to explore this cheaper or covered by your insurance you certainly want to listen to because this is somebody who's read all of the academic papers\nAnd on all the research that you haven't done so yeah you want to listen to that person and I would also encourage people to wait till they were elected representatives because indeed if we do want to try\nTo bring the drug industry focused once again on curing ailments as opposed to moving product getting rid of the direct to consumer ads would be a big step in the right direction because that's\nBillions of dollars that would therefore be redirected backing tool useful endeavors such as basic research and wouldn't require me to explain to my son when he he is what all watching sports together on TV\n[laughter]\nFast thing you said was that [laughter] was gosh\nI Can't get past you have a new explain that to your side anyway the best thing you said is that there are now spending more money on this marketing and they're spending on are indeed to actually make drugs it will improve people's lives and that is a real miss direction a national wealth\nTo have all that money go into the ads and so don't mind them change your mind don't make those ads influence what you are going to consult with your doctor about\nIn fact I don't even pay attention to those ads because let's face it they are not imparting sufficient amount of information for you to make an informed decision and therefore they're not worth your time\nFor David Lazarus when the Los Angeles times thank you so much for joining us and you keep that passion and by the way how did you explain to your son when he Diaz says family radio\nWell I Would say the things that lasts for four hours probably aren't good under any circumstances [laughter]\n[laughter] [laughter]\nOkay\nCorey with us on the car where did show oh Corey how you doing\nHi Clark I'm good how are you great thank you [noise] Corey you've got\nSomething that happened in your wife is not a laughing matter\nIt's a good matter I mean we we were able to acquire are but unfortunately a those after my wife has a language that that's the way\nWhile I'm very sorry about her loss\nWell thank you\nHow can I be of service and the situation\nBut cause us to take a look at our auto insurance because we ah we added another car we had really looked at it in a while it kind of\nRealize we might be paying too much for auto insurance and we started looking at our policy and we're kind of trying to figure out where we can save money with where everything's set out as far as our coverage so are we are going to be adding a\nSix sixteen and Seventeen year old son under the policy within the next six months\nOh oh oh oh I\nJust have your wallet just take that now even stab your wallet a lot you know 'cause that's what happens\nWhen you get a teen driver on your insurance\nYes yeah we're lucky enough though that we didn't have to buy the car\nTrue so or saving money there\nAny of the cars you have old enough that you can avoid taking a coalition and comprehensive on that vehicle\nYes and that's a matter of trying to sell that to my wife but that was the one of the first thoughts had along with um raising our deductibles\nYeah I'm a ... fan and raising the doctor balls okay and try to raise those two thousand that's usually if you're going to have any vehicle you have has alone that may be the max you're allowed to raise it to okay but if that helps and you\nWere five hundred now so\nThe ... raise it to the thousand because you don't want to make a five hundred a claim on something between five hundred thousand dollars anyway yeah we're going to the insurer will just eat you up on premiums so you want to avoid that and then\nHow old are your vehicles\nSo our oldest vehicle is it safe house meant for\nYeah you only want to have liability on that one\nYeah that's okay I thought so I was thinking too or the other two are newer and we have a two thousand Fifteen in the car we just got his two thousandth fourteen so\nYou're a teenager needs to be driving the ... for if your wife will permit that\nYes I don't know how much longer we're going to have the four but yes that's going to be the one that he was going to spend the most time and for sure\nSo sure as you in this case there may be an advantage in talking with an independent agent\nOkay you know something people really don't do any more but there are ... agents that are like free agents and they quote various insurance companies\nAnd they'd been there done that for a long time most of them are older because a lot of young people have no interest in becoming\nAn insurance agent and they're very experience and can tell you based on how rates are set in your state and situations they've done with new drivers with teenagers what's gonna be the thing that will get you the best overall total premium okay great\nSometimes depending on the state and how rapes tend to be sent in the state it may be a advantageous to have\nYour son is the owner of that vehicle over there and be on a separate policy and then and other places it may be better for him to only be named in additional driver with no specific vehicle assigned to\nPerfect that's where the independent agent become so valuable because they know how best to quote it and they can quote from many different companies there are some winner known as ...\nHow best to quote it and they can quote from many different companies\nThere are some what are known as direct writer companies are ones that you probably see pretty heavily advertised on TV they will not commission and independent agent and sort of agent will not be able to quote those but don't have enough\nDifferent companies they can quote to you that they'll be able to guide you best\nPerfect perfect yeah we've got some numbers already from friends that have gone down that path and it seems like it'd be very helpful to have some specific style is\nHave you got to make sure they're not what's called a captive agent for\nExample State Farm and all state the agents that right for them or what her nose captives they only write for those companies and independent agent is not assigned to a specific company and they can quote many different ones\nGreat sort of independent agent okay\nYou're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n", "year": "2018",
