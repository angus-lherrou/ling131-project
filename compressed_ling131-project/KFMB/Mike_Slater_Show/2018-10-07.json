cocktail it'd be good to have a with the football games in the afternoon\nA picked up this bag of shrimp that was on sale took it up and as the associates scan the shrimp or there was an abnormal sounds a you know not the normal bleep are so I looked at the screen or the associate with looking at and it said a do not sell this item\nOr an it printed out a little ticket it said attached to the bag of shrimp and call a manager or and so the manager came over and a U.S but you know what this could possibly be and she said we really don't know we all we looked at the expiration date or wasn't expired didn't expired so next year\nI'm In and said well you know maybe there was some kind of recall a and the manager said you know that that's entirely possible or the you know at this point we don't know so I've looked Simpson to see if there was a recall on any kind of frozen shrimp in there hadn't been won in a couple of years\nI'm ... is that maybe there's a recall in process um and it just hasn't been announced yet but they would not let us buy that bag a shrimp\nBad is fascinating and it's a mystery maybe will unfold over time but that is the kind of thing that's coming is that we will before we can get out of the store\nThere will be items that are still on the shelf that have already been identified as being a risk for whatever\nOther store there will be items that are still on the shelf that have already been identified as being a risk for whatever reason and before that item could end up at home you watching football and suddenly not feeling so hot\n'cause not cause your team lost but because who shrimp or or or like a sack in your life or you\nGot sack for big big loss anyway you've never had that happen\nNo man you know I I think the manager or as I said you know I'm Glad this happened when and I didn't end up exactly where where you're talking about Clark\nWell the good thing is that whatever the issue with with the shrimp it didn't happen to you and the fact that we're going to have more and more circumstances where we don't have to worry about as much the safety of the food we eat that's nothing but for the good\nThank you very much and thanks for

dollars a month or the ice and the Internet and television and um they are finding that contact but there\nWas no way it was no yeah [noise]\nSo the association are you in a mandatory association community yeah wow so the the board of directors\nWants to sign a ten year\nFiber optic agreement they would stick\nCurrent and future residents owners\nWith an obligation we'd go\nTill twenty twenty eight or twenty twenty nine so I\nI Would never do that never what kind of penalty is there if you know the market is changing so fast right now\nI think that I can tell you\nWhat kind of penalty is there a break penalty or break the\n... the association would have to pay if waiter or the president said the new board says this is a terrible idea we gotta cancel this thing do you know what to

to go all the way\nPolitically and the other part that all\nThose are all into contact but I Hope that the contact is not assigned all that is I think they are they are today and actually that they they do like the fiber optic um they claim that\nWell you know they're doing that survey that's not really it is still the the board\nAnd um it was only thirty five percent of the ... sign up for that so they\nAll right well I Will do what I Do fast as you possibly can this is gonna sound so analog but I Would go print up\nAs many yard signs as you can and have people put signs in the yard note of

dollars or like you a hundred million dollars that sort of you have to live in independent life and be comfortable it's all about the lifestyle that you become comfortable with it so the key is a ratio is a formula\nAnd it's pretty simple you save money to the point that you saved twenty five times the amount of money that it costs to live in one year\nAnd once you hit that target whether it's in your thirties forties fifties sixties or never\nThat's when you know you have enough money built up for the lifestyle you've grown accustomed to that you can afford to live and definitely on the money you've saved\nAnd it I Know that's an oversimplification but it really is that simple as soon as he went on to say to Paula ... you need at least five or six million really you might need ten million dollars\nTo retire securely and respectfully I strongly disagree with what Suzie said there are people who easily\nCan get by for the rest of their lives when they hit the point they've saved a million dollars it means they're living a\nNot a a barebones lifestyle but they're living more careful frugal lifestyle\nBecause what you want as you want to not money saved that you have invested that you can throw off enough cash to live on each year and at the same time have the piled a stash you built up\nHave enough in it that you can earn enough on it in the years following to cover the cost of inflation but let's go to a core principle\nIf somebody is a Mac saver\nOr today a proponent of the FIRE movement and they say like a maniac can they get to a point\nYou know let's say in their mid thirties that they've saved enough money that they've created real financial security it doesn't mean they don't ever work again it means they only do what they enjoy\nYou know I retired at thirty one and here I Am working now talking to you it's sixty three\nAnd since I was thirty one I've only worked when I wanted to and doing what I enjoy because I had that financial security when I was thirty one\nSo don't let somebody tells you oh you're never going to be able to retire 'til you have twenty million dollars [laughter]\n[laughter] oh boy anyway you know that you have to have a

used on any computer anywhere even if it's not a crime but so\nThat's why the schools have been adopting a they don't have to I have a an IT department or anything like that since everything on them is Web based and you're right that to make a crumbled useful you have to have an Internet connection for most everything you would do on it\nSo it ... it would be a good question for you to ask going

them\nPretty much whatever they wanted to become the exclusive seller of tickets\nAnd hit a point of critical mass where when you wanted to buy tickets to most anything in the United states you have to go through the ticket master monopoly and with the added on has no relationship at all to the cost of the infrastructure\nIs all a basically a monopoly passed through and it's why I despise monopolies so much and you think that that would be enough\nFor ticket master to rake off out of your wallet but there is a long form story in Rolling Stone you may have heard about ... insiders\n... ticket master have\nSpill the beans that ticket master has a system operating where they manipulate the sale of tickets to get them into the hands of their own scalpers\nSo that they're making money both on the fees up front bend the fees when the tickets are resold plus the profits now ticket master denies it we'll see what goes on with that but I Want to tell you the whole system is rotten\nWe're getting rocked and it stinks and when there's a time that I can go to a box office and buy tickets directed not pay the fee I Do that but there are times I Will not go to an event

on more energy efficient no guard vinyl windows when you purchase five or more and you can also say five hundred dollars off the Amazon piano guard vinyl patio doors\nAs a metro customer you might get slow down your your priority is lower than it is the mobile customer\nWere which brings us to the most interesting to me of what's happening with the second tier and that's what ... is doing with visible at\nHow much a month for ... dollars a month now and that's rising some limited plans are Seventy five ten Ninety five dollars a month so visible is only forty dollars a month the taxes and fees included again only\nFor iPhones right now they say they're going to bring availability for androids but only for iPhones ... name has not anywhere to be found\nAround visible they don't want anybody to know that it's them not it is that is that it's their network and so it's at forty the one guy show with their forty a month\nIs that the speeds that you'll have when you're on high speed data will not be as fast as they are on parent\n... that's true uh and I've been reading some accounts and people on line they say that it hasn't been too much of an issue for them they're still able to watch Youtube videos without suffering and still able to get around the Internet pretty quickly\nBut there is that is a a compromise with this plan and also with some of the other ones you might be slowed down a little bit see one I read through the fine print to know that\nYou are paying less but you may be getting a little bit slower service\nAnd the biggest difference between the horizon visible and cricket and a metro buy T Mobile and the boost is how many stores as the Invisible Man was all they really are invisible there is no stores it's all done through an app\nThat's right you download the app you'd sign up for the service there you pay through that everything and that's really much more how cell phone service have done elsewhere in the world without a relying on a big network or stores or cricket\nIs suddenly a Eighteen ... second tier brand has now been exposed that they weren't up to the standards of the others so they made some changes\nYeah uh what cricket did cricket has to unlimited plans and there really hasn't been much of a change to the cheaper one\nIt does restrict your speeds and that's a compromise that I think a lot of people might not be comfortable with but it's a really great type price point a fifty dollars a month for one line but for for lines it's a hundred dollars a month so that's still a really good deal and it was you know drunk the so no it's all included a now they're\nMore expensive plan they used to have a limitation on speed as well but that's now been removed so four fifty five dollars a month with auto pay you're getting really fast unlimited plan on Eighteen T's network\nAnd the reason it's fifty five is there is a grudge match of hate\nBetween eighty and see and John ledger the guy from T Mobile bay hate each other Eighteen he tried to have him arrested in Las Vegas a few years ago at CBS they I mean it is like a blood feud like Hatfield McCoys so\nTeen mobile came out with the metro buy T Mobile it sixty so then cricket said well we're going to go fifty five exactly so the competition is great and you've got all this explained were charts and all that\nWe've got it all laid out so all the all these plans you can read side by side and then you can go and also compare them to the big four forest plans to see if saving that extra twenty dollars a month or so is going to be worth it for you and you can deal with some of the the gotcha says that come with all of these unlimited plants\nAnd now we moved to a marketplace where there are now three tiers of service\nThere's the second tier companies we've talked about and now there's a third tier of ultra cheap companies that come with a lot of things you've got to be willing to live with and we have those laid out for you at Clark dot com as well with those plans starting at as little as ten dollars a month\nFor bona fide real cell phone service with I'm not a huge amount of data but some data yeah well thank you and I appreciate how you stay on top of this because is there ever a week that goes by that cell phone right plans don't change\nNo they're changing multiple times a week and we're staying on top of it all its own car

actually I Am I have a favorite children and so it's hard to pick you know it's like a parent's arrest you know you got you got these these four kids which choice\nAnd so it's hard to pick you know it's like a parent's arrest yeah you got you got these these four kids which is really your favorite why don't have any favors zero [laughter] now you're you're doing that to me with\nInvesting so tell me who it is you feel like I'm dissing\nFidelity you've mentioned on your show they have to you know widely diversified funds mutual funds that have come out there's\nA ton of really low cost no transaction fee each yes I'm no minimum account minimum to start um they've really kind of blazed the trail of lowest cost in my opinion\nYeah zeroes there is such a brilliant marketing campaign\nAround the ... zeroes which have no commission and no ongoing fees that they absorb all the fees\nI think this is absolutely great what fidelity is done fidelity let me tell you why this came about ... had found itself steadily losing market share\nTo a nachos vanguard but also to the bigger player out there that most of the United states don't pay a lot of attention to black rock\nAnd so the two of them were taking all the market share their was out there so fidelity\nComing up with the new product development zero has set down a marker that no one can say they're not the cheapest 'cause obviously fidelity at no cost is offering a better deal than anybody else\nAnd so they have the total stock market index which is thousands of U.S companies\nAll in one investment at no fees at all and then the international index fund which just thousands of international stocks all free so\nA fidelity is in the game solid you know what else they've done\n\nSo Fidel they used to have relatively high cost target retirement funds\nAnd now they have two flavors up the bay of an extremely low cost series of a target retirement funds and then they have their old when that still has very high costs will not high costs but a higher than a low cost companies should be offering\nSo they have become much more aggressive on the front\nAnd so do you invest with fidelity and you wonder why always talked about vanguard or were you trying to figure between the two\nSo I've invested with LSD and just kind of comparing costs and I also kind of was invested in their ecosystem thirty two percent cash back card\nGood for you explain that\nBecause a lot of people don't know that fidelity offers one of the two best credit cards in America\nAre they two percent cash back on every every purchase he runs through my think it's underwritten by a separate bank but you get two percent cash back deposited into any of your fidelity account\nSo you can't manage that kind of account or they're going to be an IRA Rick right or a college savings plans exactly yeah so\nSo you want to know why do I always talk vanguard vanguard vanguard when Fidel that he's doing all this good stuff\nExactly on a number of calls it seemed like people were you know asking which way to go and you kind of lean towards telling them vanguard and I was just struck by that\nYeah and so uh I should not be offending\nFinality 'cause they do a great job a Schwab does a great job I mean these companies are huge companies and they've all become lower cost but vanguard really set\nThe pattern and set the tone and took the market share and that's why they are the ones that created the pressure in the marketplace for lower costs\nAnd maybe that's a sentimental thing\nBut I ... you're probably right I should be talking about that fidelity is well now offers a series of ultra cheap choices for investing\nThanks for bringing it to my attention you're listening to the Clark Howard

says manager came over and a U.S but you know what this could possibly be and she said we really don't know we all we looked at the expiration date or wasn't expired didn't expire till next year\nI'm In and I said well maybe there was some kind of recall\nA and the manager said you know that that's entirely possible or the you know at this point we don't know so I've looked since then to see if there was a recall on any kind of frozen shrimp and there had been one and a couple of years I'm ... is that maybe there's a recall in process and it just hasn't been announced yet but they would not let us buy that bag a shrimp\nBad is fascinating and it's a mystery maybe will unfold over time but that is the kind of thing that's coming is that we will before we can get out of the store\nThere
