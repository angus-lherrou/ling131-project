in this case um they're saying no no no no there's no proof of Democrats actually want to light the caravans you know he's onto something there 'cause there are a lot of going this is a crisis we're not gonna waste plus pin it on Trump here's what happened\nTrump they go Nevada rallying for Republicans in tight races and sharpening his attacks blaming Democrats without any proof for the crisis on the border the Democrat Party\nAnd it's only inviting millions of illegal aliens to break laws violate our borders and overwhelm aren't ...\nDemocrats want caravans they liked the care of as\nA so Trump once again blaming the Democrats for this caravan is that a charge unfounded as it is it likely to stay\nWell not only is it unfounded presents us with a little bit confusing on that 'cause he's also taking credit to care and saying all these people want to come the United states because they made the economy so strong five you've got that idea right there I think it's\nIt's it's it's a mix for the president on the one hand this whole issue of immigration a certainly energizes than in flames his base gets his voters and the president has gone back to the Sunday Times on the south at the same time that family separation policy is tremendously unpopular\nAnd probably feeling opposition to the president especially in those swing house districts a suburban house districts where they the opposition is very very strong so I think it's kind of a mixed bag for the president I don't think it's going to be the top issue\nGoing into this election and then when you look at our pool are ABC News poll with the Washington Post it shows that on the issue of immigration overall Americans trust Democrats more than Republicans\nSo big it was George Stephanopoulos former Clinton offered it probably still is probably still ...\nGuessing like is let's\nFace it they like this never let a crisis go to waste right it is very interesting to see the timing on caravans are middle of winter caravan now these aren't so little seven thousand plus\n\nOn their way through Mexico and and what Trump has done today is he saying listen we're at a secure the borders really use the military for ... well\nThat's not compassionate may not feel that way but it's practical I Wish\nThat a lot of the opponents without there no matter who and that's the polo see Maxine Waters would have just can't be a Gavin Newsom just campaign the wave stop trying to pretend it's what they did it just say hey we're for open borders we don't need borders\nBorders are just as saying get just so that they're so insensitive okay\nSo then you're fine when everybody ends up on your front yard and you're gonna you're gonna how is the most deserving you remember that that's where that goes I mean I'm all for compassion helping those river no way out but you can't just have everything open that's how you lose a nation\nIsn't it that so I Can't believe you said that her\nSo Trump's getting in trouble because he says listen we're also gonna start cutting aid to Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador\nYes I said that because because why because we give them a lot of money ... this is the thing this is from a lot of well presidents past including Republicans who who have talk the talk and then not done it the difference about her all the time or when I\nKnow like Mr Obama sorry Ron clip he's right there but he was in early September when he was just looking himself in the mirror and singing so in love with you I Would read it out there we're going to be ... what they ought to be done got it out and then they come in anyway translation these are cut it out that means go on them because they won't enforce it like\n\nTrump's actually saying you nations who are having this happen it starts with you 'cause you're a pressing these people you fix it or we're going to cut off your money\nWhat's wrong with that just do a little business that's all I mean what's the alternative\nWell you know the alternative is done work hasn't been working has not won eight hundred seven sixty KF it'd be am seven sixty talk and breaking news I Know you're a great driver but you hear some of the news you might go and I'm right into the guard rail it happens or you're having a great day somebody decides to ruin yours by coming along and\nGiving you a fender bender special gift that keeps on giving don't fear yeah you talk to your insurance company that's great but talk to my friends would mark motors body shop the best buddies wrap around I Know that as a fact we use them we recommended them over the years and there's alcohol and Ford uses them as well they've been around for nearly Seventy years serving\nSan Diego county people and they have free shuttle services well if the if your insurance company is in the shall we say the slow group and they say you have to go to\nOur body shop you said no I don't know that because I have the legal right to choose the best than you do so choose mark motors and me are CK\nTax rules took away some of the incentives on home buying for certain things you know segment of the population but I think the way inventories all of a sudden\nWent up because we were talking months after months and mentors are down ... down their way down compared to last year all of a sudden the past few months inventories are up there up there up and I think a lot of people kind of you know becomes a little bit of a self fulfilling prophecy prophecy too\nThey're like you know I'm getting too old for this maybe I don't\nWant to wait for the next cycle so let me cash out all of everybody does the same time doesn't matter what it is whether it's apples and oranges cars homes or goals whatever it is and\nIt has an impact and that is what you're seeing and you were saying that when seasonally you see that anyway I mean this is the time of the year you see it but you got the the big cycle and the small seasonal cycle all kind of combined together right\nNow we're on at around ... and his team there with a you know all of this we're talking about in the mortgage rates that keep doing interesting things every time the fed things about raising the other rates primaries and so forth I'm Still some opportunities what are you seeing with a mortgage rates like fixed an adjustable and so forth but it's almost like that I\nWell I tell you what's what's interesting is if you believe in free market in most of us here and I gave him be at least believe in free of charge it you know\nThat's how things work and what we just talked about can lead to a head when on the economy that's on fire and also the bond market basically react in such a way that stops mortgage rates at least temporarily from going up so\nWhen you ask me about a mortgage rates they were going up up up up up\nAnd as soon as the market to fit with the stock markets selling golf and all of that because of higher yields are and some of the economic numbers and and housing numbers being a little bit shaky and\nActually help stabilize mortgage rates believe it or not and they haven't been going out to have you been gone a hair lower or pretty much stayed about the same\nAnd conforming no point thirty year fixed mortgage rates are averaging around four and three quarters Fifteen year around four and a quarter a five year around four and a quarter let's not forget something\nIf somebody is in no mood to buy a home or they're worried about their job or they just want to wait or whatever that's a different story but if someone is looking to buy a home when they finally have inventory in the neighborhood they were looking at\nAnd now they say oh shoot but you know I don't want to go four point seven five percent look how much higher my payments are that's not real smart\nBecause you could if it really is a\nQualification or for debilitating problem than get yourself a five year seven years sometimes ten year you know the five years half a percent lower so you know you're going to have an economic slowdown at some point and you could always ... out of that into a thirty year fix so don't late don't read\nLet the rise to a recent rising mortgage rates stop you from what you always wanted to do because there's ways around it\nYeah and the opportunity time can also be out there right now with the rising interest rates are people who have a looming adjustable and they're just watching that pick up and maybe it has been great for for for years whatever all of a sudden it's payback time and it could get ugly so I don't as right and\nI had to redo mind recently and you know if you have a five year or Seventy air or ten year low as a very good ... or any kind of just the ... even a monthly or yearly adjustable you know\nThere's a there's a finite period after that five years seven years ten years a lot of these get advertised and uh\nAll of a sudden your payments are a lot higher and so you have to refinance or even if you don't have the five seven ten ... it could be a monthly could be every six months you could be every year you may have not fully seen it on your statement but you will see that the fed rate hikes\nAre going to make your adjustable rate loan payments go higher and chances are the fed will raise rates and other\nAt least one more time in December that's what we see in the market are based on the fed funds futures where people bet real money on this kind of stuff and there is a likelihood at least for now there may be three more rate hikes next year ...\nI like to say maybe not because\nIf the economy goes this strong yes definitely there'll be three more rate hike but if the housing numbers if some of the other stuff some of the scaring the stock market creates a little head when the fed could be less aggressive in raising rates but either way you're right if you have an adjustable rate loan you've been basically given financial incentives\nIn recent months they'll say you know I better get grad that fate straight because you got a lower payment\nYou got to fix payment and you don't have to worry about it going up\nAnymore absolutely matter on arming the team at around ... can help you there are also the primo experts when it comes to the reverse mortgage and a lot of great new opportunities many new improvements in that will tell you more about that later on

there's like a twenty percent chance to throw up in the middle of this interview where he has got to put a put money down this one chances of might say they're throwing up in the middle of this interview you and you're going to go because it really that bad I'm giving it a twenty percent chance\nHigher than normal sure but no I wouldn't be comfortable sitting in any sort of ... not a great chance though not not in eighty percent you sound like a definite thing ... welcome and good to see a mixed on for ... what's your title over\nSoccer city as are sitting down and murdered FSI busters and on the project manager soccer to reduce the amount spent a lot of times it has a I'm going to ask you are going to get right to it that's all right\nI'm going to ask you the first question that we asked the friends of as the su person that we talked to like two weeks ago so uh what exactly exactly is in measure the misery is a plan\nThat basically allows us to pay fair market value for the land\nAnd then to start immediately building a stadium and a river park built forty eight hundred housing unit there are two point four million square feet of office and a sports entertainment district and some hotel\n... gone yeah so when people are proving it with their approving it they're proving sale the least bill and to us at fair market value subject to the terms of a lease and one of the conditions police will be we have to have soccer for anything to happen here if we don't then the university can step into our shoes\nOr what does that was at a party a we have to have soccer so if if we don't produce the major league soccer team which we will within within a year then American say okay you guys didn't didn't deliver so now you're removed and I'm putting the university and you're really\nSick and that's like a big break the city can break or you're breaking the least I guess you can come in and sort of from you're right I mean if I see as you or not just a potential thing they could do they they would have to the university I have to pay him enough to land so they have to be us\nBasically and billboard it when they have to go through a whole nother process or middle and so it's a measure that in hard wired into the initiatives sort of gee essentially is hardwired into ... effectively wow\nYeah um which is I mean part of what we've been saying all along is look we are so confident that we are going to be able to get a major League Soccer team in delivered shore but if we don't know the city's got to be protected to need the tax base there need housing and he's all those things so here's another tool to allow you to get it\nReally okay so I'm On the no on soccer city website okay and one of them is\nA\nFs investors that you could decide not to build the stadium but could leave the rest of the land and then profit off it without ever building\nAt all so not true but okay it's like there's an awful lot of that floating around here here's how this works if we don't build a stadium we have to give back the land to the city\nI'm not in the measure in the metro got scholar revert are writing about the city has a right to decide I don't want it because you got sued and you're almost there but the but at the city's option to pick the land back at the end up seven okay um\nInside I don't want it because you got sued and you're almost there but ... but at the city's option to take the land back and said you end up seven okay\nAnd what the city that does what hey look we still want the helping ... we still need the office space where like we need all those things because they got to figure out a way to tackle or housing crisis\nSo we don't want all the developers staring at this until the stadium gets completed before they start doing anything there so you can\nWe want to have to happen right now so the way we've handled that as we said look if the city chooses to take the land back then the developers ... whatever piece of residential condos or apartments over the city full fair market value for their ground leads on the land\nUm who ... who then so whoever built the residential housing\nIt's a city full market value for the ... version of this\nWe had a private group health figure out how to leave the city's land and build stuff on it for which the city gets compensate of fair value\nSo like yet safe and that's only in the incredibly small chance which we don't build a stadium and believe us having worked as hard we're building a stadium we're going to start a soccer team like that's that's the goal of this whole thing as hardware soon as you said earlier you said one year and then he said seven years so one of those two are well so so\nHave you been shocked by a recent electric bills are you tired of

sixty I gotta believe it's Ninety percent of America Says\nMillions from Central America don't get to walk to the United states and come talk he decided immigration policy on emotion breaking news\nSaying there is a from the\nCity of a yes on what he is asking\nYou to vote as opposed to G which would be as TSE west ah aren't going to talk about us yes he was for a second so we talked about traffic job but the river park we talked about the stadium is there are all things that has the U.S criticizes soccer city for not guaranteeing and do you just described\nHow all those things are true so what does as TSE west\nPropose for measure G with those things yeah so\nLet's just take the city attorneys analysis for this because it's it's pretty rare that is an attorney is unequivocal right normally attorneys are like hedging re unclear uncertain it's rare that are like yes or no\nAh so the city attorneys announces the measure gee says does the initiative require the purchaser to build the river park no\nDoes initiative require the purchaser to build a stadium no view soccer city no of measure gee you know the the measure gee initiative the universe the city attorney has said owner quickly\nDoes not require stadium does not require a river park there's no ability to require the purchaser to do those things in the initiative [noise]\nUm so here's here's the practical reality for how this is going to work a first off the university said\nUniversity just went through in on campus expansion approval guy that started in two thousand and five ... and we just got our last round of environmental approvals in May of this year so that's Thirteen Years in the making and then on campus expansion allows for the next eleven thousand students to come on campus okay\nI'm One of the things they said in that we should come back to eleven thousand students is along runway of growth for the university but\nOne of the things they said in there at the university cannot agree to pay for parks so so there's a very intentional reason why the land along the southern boundary of the property has been left with the city\nAnd it was stated on TV in sort of an overly candid moment I think by one of the measure gee proponents who sign initiative in which he said well if we can get city funds to build a park why wouldn't we take the money ...\nThey're the initiative is designed to make the city built the parks is not the university so the big difference between an G\n... you might get a parking gee but developers backing the measure Jay initiative won't pay for it to have you will pay for it I'll go and measure the will pay for it and get a park yeah um and as we know things that the city is trying to do typically take awhile second big difference [noise]\nNone of that land can transfer we're we're currently world subsidizing Qualcomm or FTC the stadium to the tune of a million dollars a football game right now\nIf you vote for measured gee\nThe land has to go through not one but two different sequel approvals before can even be purchased a dog and a long time yeah like before the purchase before it could be ... or ... years before anything actually started happening yeah right and and let them build for perspective the approval for the on campus expansion Thirteen Years for the corporate will slow\nSix million a year\nFor a decade plus as we sit and stare at the same old parking lot and you\nCan't measure geometric e look we already have been sued and we've won on nine of the night things like let's go get sued as America everybody gets re so but but the key issues here have already been resolved by the court will start in twenty Nineteen huge distinction and and people should care 'cause that's not only six million dollars of subsidies that are going away\nBut also really importantly we're going to create twenty six thousand jobs and we're going to do two point eight billion dollars of economic impact from this and that's going to start a decade earlier last point traffic\nThe measure GE proponents and developers are very careful how they describe what will happen with traffic they say we will fully satisfies sequel is what they don't say is that secret changed\nSo in starting in January of twenty twenty remembers going to take a decade to sell starting in January twenty twenty there is literally no impact\nAt that stadium proper you could build two hundred thousand units of housing and have no significant impact on traffic because because the law is now if you're within a half mile of a transit station\nYou have by the you know significant impacts for traffic\nOkay so that that was because the love environmentalist and whatever I wanted to concentrate growth around transit centers\nAK let's create congestion around transit hubs that people feel like I'm not getting in that traffic jam I'm going to get on the force them to get on the trial on the trail of it because it's so oppressive to drive on the Fifteen though\nSo between the two misery fifty knows that the traffic improvement measure achieved very carefully worded zero dollars a traffic improvements in Cairo trap zero trip commitment\nWow amazing and and that's if anything ever gets they'll yell AT T to get out there oh and it will take you know we'll all be certainly am for for ... plus years\nSometimes I'm really talking about secret yeah cause that's one of the other no things they say that you had no environmental\nReview you you haven't done environmental review\nSo a few goal on our website called ... dot com which has been up for Eighteen months now\nBreaking secure a doctor is such an interesting conversation because of the seat and you just can't believe anything\nTo wild a time when next Tony some soccer city um so that's measured the yes on measure e San Diego state West is called measured gee\nI'm art bunch more things that we've been hearing these last couple of weeks Nick and Nick's on here from ... ... ... ah what is it ten thousand dollars how much are you guys going to be paying the city for this land that we've lost the same over a\nHundred and ten million dollars so that fair market value as fair market value for the the site which has the SEC stadium on it and a training facility so where am I hearing ten thousand dollars\nA look we ... there was a rumor for awhile jam I had said that bad Jim I realty is another one of the developers working on the measure gee initiative had said the Republican gonna do the development because they're going to do development on the site\nThat they had in twenty Seventeen said the value of somewhere between negative twenty five fifty and the reason for the negative number which is a ton of environmental pollution underneath that comes with all the apartment cleanup risk so we said okay fine we we never want to ask for a penny a taxpayer dollars if the number comes out negative will always pay at least ten grand\nSo we never take a penny of taxpayer money numbers came out a hundred and ten [laughter]\nSo when was this one was this decided years ago God da da da da da da da da and and a ten thousand dollar talking pointed like well for Wylie so ... year and a half ago you guys are like listen we don't know what the market value this land is\nIt's so full of oil from the oil drums is that what that is ... ... it could\nBe this land could be negative value meal means it means there's so much risk somebody have to pay you to take it right out and look we never want that we're we mean the we're not going to ask for a penny of taxpayer dollars things oh here's a taxpayer protection and uh unbelievable\nThat if it comes back negative we're not going to say listen taxpayers you got to get out and you got to give us money so the worst case scenario will give you ten thousand dollars will pay ten thousand dollars for the land right and if the fair market value more we're going to pay more and it came back a hundred and ten million and we're like which\nBy the way between negative twenty five and fifty a hundred and ten is like a really good answer it relative to that right so what was what was the demise range was negative twenty five to fifty\nFifty million fifty million negative twenty five million to fifty million and we were signing up for a hundred and ten unbelievable and we're still saying ten thousand dollars out like really telling lead the athletic director for the university just said on the air on Thursday hey the that number is the starting point for our discussions now we have to say no we have to figure out what works for the university\nSo I'll go there some energy measure ... doesn't guarantee necessarily fair market not at all in fact the city attorney has said definitively using the term fair market value to describe what his offered a measure gee wouldn't be misleading to the voters\nSo like they they try to get the word fair market value included in their ballot language and the city attorney neck to them and said no we can't do that 'cause that's not what you're offering to pay an ... okay so this is a letter from all this talk about the pole real quick came up in UT couple of days ago and a G. S. S. U. S. is way ahead\nAnd you guys are pretty far behind like thirty four percent yes or something like that is right now even close which in itself would tell me about double well look you can get any polling enter you what I've learned by asking the question that in a way that that you sort of feel is going to be helpful to your cause to that question there's there's a neutral would ask which is a two ballot questions that are getting post\nUm that wasn't picked anytime you're not picking the questions are solving for different answer that question that was asked was\nDo you want to this is a ... ... says you've got the weren't real estate investors to buy the land to build housing and offices and maybe river park and maybe soccer or do you want to sell the land to the university to expand its campus in for faculty house in\nLike neither ... ... that's how people want a famous but that's not the choice STDs use long term expansion either so foreign both misery and measured cheat the real choice is do you want a bunch of private developers backing measure gee\nThey get Ninety nine years of property tax breaks that article to push produce two hundred million dollars less for the city in terms of tax value and\nTo leave us on the hook for the six million dollar you're subsidy for the next ten years\nThat's the only ones that subsidy that we're currently paying six million dollars a year for six football games dot com okay a tells about what measure e is going to do for San Diego state so we have committed\n... the university will have the right to by driving it's it's it's hard wired into our initiative got his renting out so I've already down there so\nIt will it will be a part of our least terms is fully committed in the in the language et cetera\nUniversity has a right to buy thirty five acres of land from us so effectively the right of eminent domain like over the site\nThe reason to remember they've got an eleven thousand student on campus expansion which if you go by the state's numbers that last for like six or seven decades you go there's it's two decades plus lasts for a it'll take six or seven decades to get other eleven thousand students at it okay six or seven decades they'll get a laugh so do you think they just do it\nThe last four or it'll take six or seven decades to get out of eleven thousand students at it okay six or seven decades they'll get a laugh so do you think they just able to do that ... was it takes a lot but anyway that's not for you well I Know there's no blood there's no budget that's the real problem so like if you sort of cut through what's happened with over the last ten years for the university they've\nDecreased the number of California residents that are going to school there by fourteen percent because there is not the budget to be able to grow it so the friends of friends of as the as the first time we had on said something like if we can stand will be able to have more\nSan Diego residents attend college only if we can get more state funds and the problem is that the state has said hey we see a hundred and twenty five students a year as the growth for all three south coast campuses so ah Fullerton San ... San Marcos and if the issue that's what the state of saying hundred and twenty five a year and I'm\nJust we just added capacity for eleven thousand two hundred and twenty five year that's like decades and decades and decades and decades before there's an expansion okay back to the ... so you're gonna you're gonna allow them to buy thirty five acres that they have right of\nEminent domain over our site for the thirty five acres they need and they don't know what they need right now because we don't know I mean everything's shifting online right asking them for to project real estate demand you know three four five decades from now it's really hard so we said okay we're rather make you pick today you have the right to buy whatever you need on the site for like under eminent domain\nYou know in the future and that's exactly what measure gee does measure gee is just a private development which says the university you can buy this land back from um the city or from from these private developers bunch of private developers are going to come in\nTake long term grand nieces from the university the state of number is a hundred and Twenty years in some cases Ninety nine years in other cases but private development there for Ninety nine to a hundred and Twenty years which pays no property tax by the way that paper that's re interest tax and the University of ... back when the need\nFor that one out again because we had a someone on from friends of as the as he was the other day and I said I said first question I asked you what does it specifically saying measure gee disaster and see what she said ah it enables the city\nAnd the university to come to the table [laughter] 'cause I don't know what that means they just so slow to me it's just so ... what what is measured gee then don't you just described it but slow dabbling measure gee basically says\nThe university was going to buy this land in ground lease it to private developers act which ground so to private developers going to have the right to build on a chunk of the ground they are going to actively control the ground for Ninety nine years as a private development of development is okay\nI'm not the university not to university know publicly stated of the three billion dollars they think they need the universities only putting up three hundred million dollars for a stadium which by the way it just said it doesn't know where the money's coming from yet for the three hundred let alone to a to point seven billion of the remaining capital all of which is from private people\nSo as soon as he was going to buy the land from the city ground leads to a private guy sitting at least it back out to other people and those private guys don't pay property tax when I Do that because the land is still owned by the state or how do\nThey pay possess or interest acts possess re interest yeah okay and so ... wasn't the benefit of FDIC to do that as opposed to them build it up\nOn the money yeah I mean it's it's a speculative\nReal estate development right so um I kinda liked the fact that our university isn't engaging in his back let a real estate development but I just wish\nThey would look at the three hundred million dollars or having to put up and say hey that's larger than my entire and damage today why am I doing that if I don't have to I Can't I spent chunks of this money better on students and we're offering them a hundred and fifty million dollar gift and soccer city but it's what does that mean what what it wears on it for the million dollar gift so that the\nThree hundred million dollars or talking about is a loose version of the stadium costs and we said to them look you put up a hundred will put up a hundred will do all the groundwork which is another fifty so it's two hundred and fifty a total stadium extent\nAnd we will give you are a hundred and fifty million dollar investment and this and we'll stay on the hook for the operating costs for another\nThirty guys so you give him a stadium for how much for a hundred million and set up to fifty okay okay I said out of it comes to a guy a thirty five acres is that enough like how much does that put that into perspective but ah it's exactly\nThey're ask in fact so they put forward an asset to the mayor in March of twenty Seventeen saying we need thirty five acres to expand\nSo we said OK unbelievable because because like you know Steve Altman is the a and the jam center at the SUVs an incredibly long time zone or one of the Sandy sacrificed our city yeah Mike stone is a director's Kevin never another one of the soccer city guys I mean we have multiple big donors to the university on our ownership group\nAnd we care about education we just think there's a better way than by having of other group of private developers get a huge property tax break which is costing hundreds of millions of dollars of the city\nHall and then there's no I'll never forget his friend pierce yeah very first person who came out against soccer city was Fred pierce who build his business is building dorm rooms and he's one of the big donors by an FDIC\nBusiness needs ... secure networks to

that we get back to talk a little bit about the measure G to like you have any questions or anything about that we can do that um\nBut first was gets his biography so this is the man who um I think we will hurt them\nI'd have been I don't know enough about\nAnd fortunately I fortunately but I don't know enough about the man who I quoted all the time it's one of my favorite quotes is one of the fundamental quotes of the show and that is there are thousands hacking at the branches of evil for every one who was striking the route that one of our most favorite quotes that we use all the time\nBut that's one of them a little more about the man behind the quote the book is called Henry David Thoreau a life\nBy Laura Walls miss walls how are you today\nHello can you hear me yes how are you how are you miss walls I'm very good thank\nYou I'm Glad to hear thanks writing this book so ah before we get to the characteristics of Henry David Thoreau enable story with each of them or give us a little biography will background and the man\nWell of course I wrote six hundred pages of animal try to keep it quick so\nHe was born in Concord, Massachusetts which are very proudly was the site where the American revolution was born so they like to think of themselves a starting this whole American idea\nAnd he lived there in the decades leading up to the civil war we probably know invest for writing Walden for going to Walden Pond and trying to confront the conduct\nIt's his friends and neighbors and the rest of the world through the book Walden a we also know him from writing civil disobedience center they act that led him to um go to jail and write the essay in response to explain his reasoning\nAnd some of us know him as the founder of the American environmental movement which still going strong today\nA really interesting that you talked about his birth and ... so that did that truly affect him does that change his mind set his world view\nAbsolutely he was descended from people who fought in the American revolution on both sides I Would add ...\nAnd I think he was not alone in his generation to feel that uh you know they were the sons and daughters grandsons granddaughters of that generation that fought the revolution and they really felt that they needed to live up to that\nThe revolution was not done and that it was up to them to continue it\nInteresting that made him more what\nMm\n[noise] well more daring in his thinking especially as he looked around and thought that things were not going well in the America that he knew and uh so he became bold and his prescriptions for change\nA really good thing I Will just jump into the characteristics of first characteristic of Henry David Thoreau\nWilling to lead off by saying that there was a moment when he was put to it I'm here to answer a questionnaire and he felt that the questionnaire it was kind of making and put a false front on himself so he told us in his journal where he really thought was his three characteristics so I'm going to take as we'd hear what he wrote it\nYou know and these are his character is not well\nWhat he wrote about himself is is is interesting he said um that I should have told them that I was a mistake transcendental list and a natural philosopher to boot\nSo if we step back and look at what he might have been saying and our terms I'll start with the first so a mystic All right\nUm what that would mean to him was a sense of the sacred and the every day that connecting to that sacredness of the comedy world around us was a kind of spiritual discipline\nThat would keep us sane any actually uses the word sane or fears that we might be um disconnected and therefore a little insane\nUm and so this sounds kind of a high an elevator but\nOne of the things that makes him distinctive is he thought into very grounded way and he thought of this in a in a fairly practical applied sense um and then it kind of everyday sense\nTo live in California and then we ... the listeners lower the payments to pay off their standing debt credit cards car payments adjustable lines of credit where you've been finding that some extra money hunting

very strongly on both of those just said well the voter got up soon there was a mistake in it so give us a couple more days sorry uh let me share a story about Kim Irish or quick a killer of course are fearless leader in the Senate she has proposed a guaranteed minimum income [noise]\nFor everyone in the country now she's smart it's small for now but that's how it always works right so her proposal is if you make less than a hundred thousand dollars a year per household with your house to make less a hundred thousand dollars a year then everyone view your family get five hundred dollars a month ends up being six thousand dollars a year\nI'm now no chance this happens anytime soon right but that's only because the Republicans are going to keep the Senate or for a while now\nNow no chance this happens anytime soon right but that's only because the Republicans are going to keep the Senate or for a while now when Democrats take over\nThe house side of the presidency when it'll happen of course I promise you this will be there next thing right this is their next Obamacare that if they do nothing else they will do this they will force this through a guaranteed the minimum income it's going to start small five hundred bucks a month something like that but the goal is to get to a about forty thousand\nDollars a year guaranteed minimum income so that means you don't do anything you do nothing and you just get forty thousand dollars a year\nAnd no one's going to think for a second where the money's going to come from [laughter] that does everyone thinks it was just come out of thin air just like all the California brought props one two three and four\nIt was just taxes it's higher taxes their bonds rights of people don't think their taxes but they're just taxes prop one is for veterans homes prop twos for homeless prop three is for water and prop force for a children's hospital\nI don't think so those are the Hawaii So Willie ... is a Hawaiian\nSinger across as she got so it was uh the University of Hawaii football game okay maybe Google maybe get by just a couple of seconds that frightens ukulele are you in all the other unique voice now from the white very not be the beautiful\nSo I don't uh total pretty totally changed the melody how do you feel about that Eric is a singer if he totally change the national happen now that you wouldn't even recognize the song have you done as let me or even put push up as someone who has performed the national anthem in many venues including the\nSan Diego state hockey arena the great point where there was of course to fly over a little yard were just you know yeah\nUh I wouldn't do it that I think that's a bad mistake I if I think it's there you can there's a you're there to sing the song\nAnd you have to sing I mean you're there to sing the anthem\nThat you need people to recognize the anthem one for to represent something you know what I'm saying there's a lot of historical ties you don't just get to wing it\nAnd three that's like when you're going to a rock concert and you go see the guy who's played who has every smash it am fifty years any place none of\nThis well no it's three mix that's all there was no one like around the same words everybody it seems that everybody wants you to play [laughter] yeah that's right the I'm totally with you on all that I think the only asks maybe is Hawaii\nMaybe you get a little more leeway 'cause you're in Hawaii [noise] well yeah well front could you do I mean like down in the south to go away this guy was in boot out or do not go down there were no no not with the ukulele do something more southern in the south and then you do something or you're saying yeah you might as well as a I suppose\nIt is so to me it depends like if you use it like em oh you got a new lately in the background I\nSee what he wants to be able to just hours before I said my you're going to be very time they'll notice I have you\nKnow if you're using that in the ... out\nThere who wants to Puerto Rico is like my wife you know where you're trying to measure of how we're over there recently where were you wherever they call this way I thought\nWe were having some on some rather certainly\nNo\nNo but I think that's fine if you're going to like use it as like a little embellishment right rather than a piano or your standard what you would hear like in an hors ... catch parole arrangement\nThat will put up here it's Willie K. K. K. shy eyes the right guy belong big fella somewhere over ... million views\nAlums all boys yeah that's what I'm saying that right I wind voice yeah\nI have a bigger point of this so pretty show fly over some\n\n\nSo it is it's really good beer for saw no doubt about it but it's not that I read but I I give it a pass 'cause it's a it's why I'll give them a little thing right here's why I bring this up\nTo things he is wearing a baseball hat\nOh interesting when you listen to national anthem you stick out off sure if you're seen national anthem\nYou stick your head off right\nWhere they thought that it gets me more that's makes Marts at the melting because I think they do all the pan shots of the crowd\nNational anthem you take your hat off right where they thought that it gets me more that's makes you more than ... because I think they do all the pan shots of the crowd almost no one has their hand over their heart yeah I got a lot of arms crossed that\nYeah so I uh call me and I feel like I grandpa young people and you know I ... the games and ... hall games sporting event that UCSE of for a background and uh I Will say without in this uh volleyball game where there is no more than a couple of hundred people there this is not some\nPacked arena and without a doubt two three four or five people will always be sitting for the national and are you serious\nThese sort of set up don't even stand to have you think it's like a comic half or anything yeah yes I don't even know I'm not even on my ... um I think sometimes it could be I'm not from this country so I don't really care\nAnd then I think there is some call and capturing it was definitely a couple of stand in the stands out and get over yourself you're trying to accomplish happening from the section decay twenty to give you a break yep wow\nAnd you obviously you get over the loudspeaker and say oh I think it yeah and you can get up our your\nYou know you don't have to talk of the yeah\n[noise] 'cause my thoughts on the Willie K national anthem that no one was asking for a story to you gentleman here see which thing about the guys are blown away by this is I Am so proud of him gave a speech at a pro life center\nBang wow South Park oh by the U.S for that was a formal that's for sure all the all set up in the store\nPro life a banquet right at the center and the truth of the so called real choice so ... so the opposite of Planned Parenthood so it was amazing I\nAwesome so many listeners are not only listeners this was one of the weirdest I've ever had because they weren't just listeners but within minutes a guy who wrote me an email last week asking about Dodger sanity Feldman came up to me it's like hey I'm the guy we met through last week about lasik and then do you guys never we share the story of\n... and the slave who when he was a little boy refuse to steal food and the tree 'cause he was stealing from his master and stealing is wrong or ceilings wrong and I share the story and a teacher emailed me wanting to know where that story came from a central booking awesome and ah she was there\nSo I'm like I'm the I'm the teacher who emails you about the end and then do you remember we talked about Brazil a couple of weeks ago and some lady called in from Brazil\nRosa yeah she was there was a who's who and that's what was that while I'm like fighter so listeners listener\nEnvy piece Doug from a hunger rule was either no he wasn't oh he'll be there with my dear [laughter]\nSo uh that was pretty neat I was fine but here's the story it was at a a man so is that er Claremont Emanuel Baptist church that was the venue [noise]\nOne of the most beautiful pieces of land and the entire city of San Diego it overlooks mission bay so it's up on the hill overlooked mission bay a giant piece of land it's not just the church it's like\n... ... acres of land and and I was talking to soften the church was like oh yeah we go way down the hill the we own the land all the way down hill\n... hundreds of millions of dollars this piece of land hundreds of millions of dollars to develop it would kill to get this piece of land\nThey are a mission church admissions church they spent about twenty five percent of the money on missions around the world which is great I Love that I asked them you know for more information and you know we what are we what kinds of missions that are they focus on long term mission driven and when I say long term mission trips where do you think from that I think of like\nA year to Frank\nSo you've got your weekend mission trips run down do you want to get your week long mission trusting people go to\nThe DR\nYeah many republics on\nThen you got your your lawyers yeah like the guy that the person when there was reading the book imagine Jack in the history in Kenya and yeah that's right to his daughter and that's what I was kind of a big very good year too I don't know how long they're going to be a year to sign up\nThis church specializes in life time mission trip that's a long time that's your entire life specifically to places and to people who have never seen the Bible before it ever so an entire family will go to some island in the middle of nowhere make\nContact with a tribe to tribe\nWhich is a dicey game is very much they talked about how sometimes they die as soon as they show up while they get killed\nRight away right sometimes make contact with the tribe\nIdeally they get welcomed into the tribe so let's say if there's like a couple married couple goes they split you up to the man joins one of the plans and then the woman goes and joined another one of the clans according to cost him and then they later they get remarried under like ... but the tribes traditional customs right here's a great departure\nHe's tribes have no written language\nSo this couple or whoever the people from the church\nWill go\nLearn a language that we'd never heard of spoken by like a thousand people in the middle of the rain forest somewhere they'll learn the language then they'll create an alphabet for it\nTeach that people their own alphabet for their own language and then this these couples they translate the Bible into that language and then share the gospel too\nBad\n\nWhat does that out as I said how long does that take I said a lifetime\nWow he's a lifetime it takes about ten years just to get the trust of the tribes people before you can even begin to share anything from the Bible I see you're you're you're putting ten years and just to become like\nA tribesmen\nThat's also a huge responsibility because not only do you have to interpret their language correctly but you have to then translate all the biblical information correctly you have to go from Greek to\nWhatever you're on the main there are all made up tribe language\nYeah how do you do how do you do how do you do that is one of the craziest I've ever heard\nTalk about giving up your life to save it to write your given up everything you're giving up your friends or family all worldly converse all pop cultural movies and current events are given up all that stuff to go live with this trap so this church they have I think the guy said they have Seventeen", "show_name": "Mike Slater Show", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "22"}
