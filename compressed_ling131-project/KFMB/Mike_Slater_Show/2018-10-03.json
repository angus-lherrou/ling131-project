guy goal and talking about why we're pulling out of the Iran deal\nAnd of course ah he says I don't think Iran has dismantling the nuclear program were not doing regime change but this was a stupid agreement and we're getting out of it which is now that's not the new news where we're getting close to when it's time to be out of that bus listen and why ...\nWhy is that when we decided to the most

supporting local law enforcement and securing the border\nLast night President Trump nominated judge Brett Kavanaugh Senator Schumer declared the Democrats would oppose this nomination with everything they had\nThe forest single document which produce single meeting with the senator or hearing was ever scheduled Chuck Schumer the Senate Democrats telegraph the strategy to throw the kitchen sink at the judge with no regard for the practice decency or standards\nAs well that Sarah Huckabee Sanders White House press secretary and are doing that live after the a reminder that eleven Eighteen it's the test of the ... amendment emergency alert system which I guess we would\nHave an eleven twenty over time that she right everyone doubling back down again hitting Schumer who's been out there saying the president\nAre we to on that very topic I'm Sorry about that coming up am seven sixty of talking breaking news uh great to have that one of the ... with us\nA little bit ago here at the start of the show if you missed that it'll be on the podcast posted later on this morning probably after eleven o'clock and we'll ... we'll get around to your um she'll be there along with other a history making people tonight like Peggy Whitson who holds the record for most days spent in space of any NASA astronaut\nYeah even more than Scott Kelly he had that one year a little bit over a year or all at once but she's been on space more first female astronaut to command the international space station not once but twice\nSo there'll be among the luminaries tonight's legends of flight hall of fame celebration at the air and Space Museum that sold out but I just say that no way to remind you next time these events come up make sure you get your ticket\nBecause us a chance to really hobnobbing with the people who make history salute excellence yes and even some American exceptionalism and the middle of that as well\nAt San Diego air and Space Museum where you can see all kinds of wonderful things every day it's not just a matter of seeing some of the best artifacts show the aviation and space history of the real Apollo nine command module is there such a status about having fun getting kids to have fun get an overall immersive experience\nI'm In ... so if you look at the Clinton accusers they're routinely mocked they're routinely scorn they're routinely well they were described in the Washington Post as a twisted version of the last supper\n[noise] a ... a table full liar\nSo when you heat what he did not say she's a lawyer he didn't say she's a gang he didn't say he said he basically describe what it was do you know where you weren't now did you will drop you know who drop your home don't know\nBut I had one beer and that's that's accurately describing her testimony is he mocking or yes but he's also mocking the idea that we have a news media ... thinks this is an actual story when she doesn't have much of a story and at the same time\nThey don't consider it a news story the Jimmy Kimmel comes on ABC's national airwaves and suggests we slice off Brett Kavanaugh's pain is\nI'm Sorry I missed that boy that sounds like a laugh out loud fun show was that last night yeah no it's love\nWell last night he had Stormy Daniels selecting which they had a um a lineup of mushrooms and Stormy Daniels was supposed to pick which one\nWhich one was Trump's um I don't know why there is no girl though those girls ... so why\nAre they trying to be the humor police or the mockery police nobody should accept\nThose interests the narrative by me you know ... and the only time\nWe have to resist that that's why again the here's what's fake news it's fake but it's an inappropriate thing to question her story and then they've tried to turn that anybody who dares say she wasn't credible is a horrific human being how dare you\nBend your mocking so yeah so forget that no she she doesn't have a credible story Rachel Mitchell very well fed we wouldn't prosecute this we James Comey that came out and said you couldn't prosecute Hillary for the emails that was way more obviously inappropriate way more provable\nWell then there's also this cat right and there's another thing and you have this over a news busters dot org is you know Jim Graham 'cause you're the executive editor you know everything that is posted there uh there's a video and a story here about how uh ABC and their own CBS ignored\nThe story NBC and Fox has got into this the story of the ex boyfriend letter alleging that Dr Ford lied under oath\nWell you know to be fair if there is ex whatever's out there on either or either side that seems if you're going to focus on every little issue involving Kavanaugh or hundreds of the Trump\n... it's it's fair is a method to use the same standard you get to the bottom of all this to find out if there's any they're there but apparently not according to some of the outlets\nThis is what's funny and so then they say there's this guy comes forward he says I Know her she a ... I knew I dated her\nShe didn't ever talk about Kevin ... she was not afraid of flying and she coached other people and how to take lie detector tests now do you think that if you ask the average person whether they thought that was something that should be investigated\nOr something that she should be asked about well they don't even know about it because you haven't networks ABC didn't do it CBS didn't do it\nAnd let me see didn't do it and tell what Megan Kelly so I mean that the network\nAnd now works as a group or like we're news cast doubt on forward is not news and that's where everybody says that's where the fake news comes from people is that you guys decide what isn't news that's what makes you fake earth\nWell they have decided that Jeff Flake is a wonderful Lincoln asks hero for the agent was apparently here's here's eight me say a album they throw into the flame or maybe he's not but listen to the tone of this report in New Hampshire tonight the first state to vote in the presidential election stand Senator Jeff flake a hero\nI wouldn't have a real active on are there for\nA hang up depending on how you see but it was the stunning bipartisan deal they both shots to sue the nation it all revolves around these two men Senator Flake of Arizona and Democrat Chris Coons of Delaware and the New Hampshire tonight\nAs speculation grows over a possible White House run sowing seeds of a new kind of politics\nReached the point where it's not hard for me at a mailing\nWell just a little that goes back to that in a row of photo launched a thousand groans on some side of the earth flake and everybody gathered around them touching as government on friday in the middle of that that was true well I mean I heard I\nI think the important thing here is that\nThey know important they notion important vote they want to get them to vote against Kavanaugh so they're going to all honor him and if he doesn't vote against Kavanaugh votes for Kevin all this goes away\nAll vanish is the minute he votes for Kevin right he's not a hero anymore and so that's where you would wander\nAnd he wants to run for president as if he\nWants to run for president and get the media to pay any attention to him he'll vote against Kevin ... and and so I mean I think what's what's fascinating about all this again is this is how the media manipulates the process oh we'll put you on sixty minutes oh we'll hail us yeah Lincoln ask\nA last wife Susan Collins Republican in name only at times and the Lisa Murkowski also a rhino why now because of the president's mocking\nThat's a rally last night the and then they're going to be talked about that or whatever just to him again as to whether that's mayor was mocking but you can't even talk about anything with Dr forward without being chastised ... anyway uh it it gives them a chance those senators to be stars\nAnd it makes your point because they now are saying well I don't know maybe because he was so insensitive the president never mind with the FBI finder doesn't find\nI don't know because I Want to be on the right side of this whole is well this is where\nThe truth doesn't matter and that's where it's like all of you people you're you all the people that get upset over the fake news thing\nIf you don't care whether this is true or false first of all let's try you being accused of gang rape and see if you get offended when somebody suggest it doesn't matter whether it's true or false let's just say Jimmy Kimmel ... gang rapes\nAnd let's just throw that in let's put that on for forty four minutes an hour of CNN and see how he likes it\nYeah well you know that I'd go\nYeah well but I'm just saying this is that's why people don't understand the liberals and the media people don't understand the anger a of people who are saying if you believe that Kavanaugh either is innocent or that this case has not been proven\nYou could just simply believe this case has not been proven in be upset by the absolute did you know they're ... disregard of actual evidence that they're running around doing stories about him throwing ice cubes\nWell bill that is the\nCutting edge germ hard cold story back in Nineteen eighty five\nYou know my feeling was that that's how a they're real concern now is that justice Kevin novel for ice cubes that Ruth Bader Ginsburg when she was napping during the state of\nThe allies I still think here with all due respect she passed away but it really well and lay may be the semi yeah I'm not so sure about although he wakes up once in a while so I was I have never

about this here for ...\nI take my time to go and say listen to a lifeguard that's being portrayed like everything's totally out of control when\nWe're told this is not something that the president is having to activate on his own this is worth every mobile phone every mobile devices ... do we know that I I guess the mobile phone any mobile technology and\nSaying I guess you're going to end here we're all going to hear the annoying tone the same kind of tone you get when there's an Amber Alert or what have you that tone right then do we know is it a special tone\nNo I Do okay um\nSo the challenge of what we're supposed to be to break at eleven Eighteen let's see if it sounds like what the recording this or maybe we'll just take it live and\nThen there's supposed to be an emergency action notification thing that we media outlets do as well so\nEverybody's got to get a presidential alert on their phones and you can't turn it off because FEMA and the Federal Communications commission the leader and paperwork since Nineteen thirty Ford are testing wireless emergency alerts\nRemember they were going to do this a couple of weeks ago and they weren't ready one ready for prime time\nBut now it is yes it is so\nYour phone will likely sounding alarm and wonder if they've programming in a different alarm do they control that\nSome kind of a scary\nIt's always interesting when that happens like an an Amber Alert comes down and if for some some event with a lot of people in the same room and everybody's phones go off and we wonder uh under attack\nWhat is it now of

to be for what missing children kids in danger inspired by I think a real life amber on it uh was abducted and in these things I overtime\nGet used for other purposes case in point in California

political agenda implemented by Trump\nBut we find it necessary to inform you it was implemented by Bush post nine eleven and updated by Brock Obama\nThe one we've all been waiting for him so he said it's an emergency system designed to let you know you may be in danger and again I Hope that if the system works at ...

whole nation needs no right away so this wasn't\nTrump going what do I send here let's send this at all mock\nThis or that that's not what it was but the president would have the ability to do so in this isn't Trump just trying to take over and be like North Korea with messaging because it started with which forty three after nine eleven and then Obama endorsed it and actually enhanced it\nDidn't stop them from going crazy to people all day go how was that for you is it gets so on the view in the ... an hour or so before the test alert moments ago\nThey were going nuts Christine marsh over the media Research Center was tracking that's where we didn't have to have the highlights that way I Will be Goldberg Dr joy Baron sunny Huston\nAll going crazy about the emergency alert test to all Americans were smart phones that you if you have a smartphone had been the last four minutes so potentially warn of emergency events in the future but they didn't want to hear from President Trump for any reason just like the other little tweeter right\nBefore the break I don't care what he says I don't want to hear anything how can I opt out\nThese are people who would be in a national emergency oh what's the word dead\nNow may I Know\nIt's coming from the White House I don't believe anything that's where we are in America not right you see the same\nThing when it comes to the issue of a doctor foreign versus cabin our vice versa depending on the side you're on I don't care what the facts are I Believe this\nOr that\nSo we'll be Goldberg starts the segment earlier this morning warning America as the President Trump could be sending it wouldn't be sending out the first African he didn't send it as a president to alert but he didn't press the button\nAnd he wouldn't have accidentally hit reply all are sent out a\nDerogatory ... you know ramped so Whoopi Goldberg helps families hysteria saying Trump's going to do this no one could opt out of it with a look of disgust she dramatically rips up or notes on the view them co host\nPasta next extremes I don't like that I mean he doesn't have the proper phone etiquette or Twitter etiquette ... why do I have to be subjected to that stuff all the news out\nThere for the last three weeks as they were going to test this and then they didn't invested they postponed until today was hey the president's not going to be doing goofy stuff on this\nDoesn't matter those are facts that mattered interview\nAbby Huntsman is like the lone voice of reason there Jon Huntsman's daughter used to be over at Fox points out this specifically for emergencies like natural disasters or terrorist attacks but that the rest of the view bunch\nLed by Dr joy they are and they don't care what he says\nI don't need him to tell me that he is the last one to tell me who exactly the system's not going to tell you who exactly is going to tell you\nMatt Damon Harvey Weinstein Dr Ford I don't know\nIt's just strange meant to be fair there was a lot of Obama to arrangements syndrome from the far right I get it\nUnderstand that it's fascinating sometimes humorous to watch but they're supposed to be smarter than that in love you weren't there is an oxymoron smarter in the view in the same sentence [noise]\nSunny Hossam says I don't have trust in him ... remember what happened in Hawaii there's nothing to do with Trump that had to do with somebody who said soon it's coming around and I hope\nSo that was a mistake sorry they are then says he's a liar how do you believe in this is all talking about the presidential test the alert system that happened just seven minutes ago that everybody with a cell phone receive there's other debating an interview they basically fueling fake news how do you believe him he's a proven liar so obviously he'll say there's an emergency\nWhen there's not Huntsman says you guys can't stand the president\nSunny hostage there's no he's a proven liar bay I say I he fired Huntsman says you're going to lie about a terrorist attack Austin says I Would not put that passed him I don't want to be running around like a crazy person 'cause he Trump sent me something was improper phone etiquette I'm not into it\nPunishment said hey this is an Obama era policy as I said being implemented by roots back to Bush forty three actually being implemented by Trump now Whoopi said yet Obama never sent me anything oh I bet it did I bet he said I Need your money will be\nWe're the ones we were waiting for\nSo then uh Whoopi Goldberg kept saying she didn't want to hear anything from you Trump if I did I check your Twitter feed but I'm not interested in you whatever you have the tell me what about people who don't carry a phone\nAbby Huntsman says\nYou'd rather not hear about a terrorist attack Austin says I don't want to hear from him Whoopi Goldberg says they work for a TV network if there was a terrorist acts as a terrorist attack will tell you\nI wouldn't I Would trust the presidential tweet well not all\nBefore I Believe a B. C. way before I Believe MSNBC this is just bizarre\nYou know you see the analysts they had for a is Kevin Kevin ... a analysis earlier this morning which one is I had the highly esteemed correspondent and uh what do they what do they call them a guest appearances Alyssa Milano\nWell yeah a lot of credit autocrat they're\nSo Whoopi Goldberg and does the ranting segments saying this was invasive and this was early this morning before this this thing that came and went president you alert this is a test to have a nice day\nWhatever was invasive the government was already in her believed out and there are some things that she wants to keep to herself including her\nPutting her phone well\nSell that to the hackers [laughter]\nIt's just it's bizarre that people say things with the hashtag ...\nMaybe ... Rehman refresh there's very quickly and see if um if people are now saying that was okay no big deal because\nJust a ... I I think it's just yeah I guess it worked\n\nUh and and it got past the block list to all the lord said was emergency alerts presidential alert this is a test of the national wireless emergency alert system no action is needed\nSo now that's going to\nBe everybody's putting those up there they're going to start doing some different means you know how this works [noise] yes yes we do am seven sixty

reported\nAnd ... and well it depends on which network you're watching one of the stories that had some selective involvement on Fox covered it of course but a couple of the major networks ignored Dr\nFord's ex boyfriend writing a letter alleging that too well her\nStory has some issues so as of this morning ABC CBS\nOr the first two hours of NBC's morning news programs completely ignored this very damning letter isn't it that many of everything else is that\nThis is set to the Senate\nJudiciary Committee last week by the lousy forwards ex boyfriend which contradicts several of Ford statements under oath\nAn ex boyfriend have Dr fourth is raising new questions about her testimony to the Senate last week including claims that she never help anyone prepare for a polygraph exam\nIn a letter to the Judiciary Committee obtained by Fox News the man said there were a number of things for and said under oath didn't line up with what he saw during the six years they dated back in the nineties and that\nContradiction that chairman Chuck Grassley is most concerned about though is the ex boyfriend delegation forward helped a friend to prepare for a polygraph test the ex boyfriend wrote I witnessed Dr Ford helped McLean prepare for a potential polygraph exam\nA polygraph exam Dr Ford explained it in detail what to expect how polygraphs work and helped McLean become familiar in less nervous about the exam that significant because it is very different from the answer for gave when she was asked about this specifically last week\nHave you ever had discussions with anyone um besides your attorneys on how to take a polygraph\nThat it was written declaration by her ex boyfriend data for six years he knows it very well and he said a lot of what she said during the hearing he the box\nYeah ever heard of sexual assault he never complained about being close to well\nMake me which didn't that wasn't that long for me because she sat and the hearing she hadn't told anyone until she went to therapy that are higher and yeah so that didn't that wasn't an alarm for me what was an alarm as she said in that hearing Sheena scared to fly\nHe said that is baloney you've never heard of her six years that she was scared to fly she talked about needing the two front doors because she is classified actions anxiety Soviet the\nHe said she lived in a small apartment with one with one door she has never afraid of type ... wherever\nAfraid of closed quarters and I have a polygraph test\nPolygraph is the headline a sheet of ... according to one of her friends ... lawn

and that's our best\nFriend who was applying for jobs the FBI and let the U. S. right corner of health\nBut that is in direct conflict with what Dr Ford said under oath and that's why Charles Grassley has now sent a letter to Dr Ford's attorney and it says is when asked under oath in the hearing whether she ever given any tips for advice to someone who was planning on taking a polygraph Dr Ford replied never\nThis statement raises specific concerns about the reliability of her polygraph examination results exactly\nSo that's more important I think than whatever Trump was doing or shouldn't have been doing mocking during the rally stuff last night but that that's that's\nThe narrative that's kind of important if they're going back to the high school years a cabin on and he got an ex boyfriend of Dr Ford it seems fair if you're digging into both\nIndividuals and ... their stories specifically just make it fair right\nSo one of the some of the networks do they don't even report that story it was a Fox News clip on that but I'm a couple of major networks decided now we're not going to cover that instead they wanted to look somebody found some of Trump's tax returns look what he did to help his dad with tax schemes that's talking about that\n\nTimes again and then people get all confused about the eleven Eighteen a tweet like that and will Trump go set it out he's gonna\nHe's gonna shut down the press he's that people are just freaking out starting with the uh the\nHighly esteemed doctors on the view like Dr joy ... her doctor will be\n[noise] [noise] but this is how it goes this is how we are\nNow in this very partisan split up world new report out today another\n\nA survey another study about how the divided America is worse than it's ever been well\nIt's kinda bad and the civil war\nAnd its history most people unfair but this study out today is\nFrom a\n... associate professor of psychology and global urban studies at Michigan State university among the first to measure\nPolarization not only by examining frequency of parties working together but also demonstrating how they've grown more distant the ...\nWhere you can make the case that the device this isn't just something Trump did Obama did it he would do you get a split he he edited but he was the divider and chief gate open dream wrote a book on that\nHe just did emerge way he did it the way most politicians have done it he'd have other people do it for him drunk just grows whereas I found I got a tweet and I'm assuming that's going to be like the nuclear codes that whole thing the ... during the football now\nThan it was a national emergency Trump can't use this new we tested as eleven Eighteen a tweet that directly\nHe would have to have some kinds of wouldn't he couldn't do that from the you know they're sitting on the throne three in the morning [noise] ah the mind wanders\nSixty talking breaking news cross are coming up in a second hey my friends without going forward are excited about a lot of things that includes desert season back underway and nobody does like al going forward when it comes to getting you into the trucks that you really want to drive all the fun you want to have in fact\nThey have all the hard to find trucks including the foreign raptors the Rausch F. one fifty and two fifty models even the all new fantastic F. one fifty diesels at all go home\nFor that you can save some big money just in time for your dessert fund that includes on super duties tens of thousands of MS R.

chat about this idea of attacking the victim and how you can't say anything about the circumstances that accuser brings up going up a little later probably the next hour we're going to talk about how uh I Believe Dr Ford should release her therapy notes not\nTo me not to the ... to the Senate committee a an older you know 'cause I I Want to use them against her ... she ... she said that\nShe first mentioned Brett Kavanaugh at this therapy session so if that's true should release these no it's actually more why coming up at at one but um\n\nWhy is that what you know people are right now that they're out there are you a question her story how dare you prior to our personal life you must believe everything she says without question like oh\nJeeze that's so that's so wrong uh obviously you can do it in a way the proper way that that may not have been the one that you started there but that doesn't mean you can't ever questioned anything in any way so to kill a mocking bird one of the great novels in American history\nEven if you've never read it the name of Atticus Finch is the name that everyone's heard before him was written by Harper Lee a woman um I don't think they uh teach this book in school anymore because it doesn't fit the progress of narrative in a couple different ways so quick refresher a Nineteen thirties Alabama\nDeep racist south as a black man's name is Tom ah he's accused of rape by a young white woman and Atticus Finch is the black man's lawyer he did not Atticus Finch did not hashtags believe all\nWomen he defended not only the man the alleged rapist but a black man in a courtroom\nShocked to the brim with white racist all against Tom and now against Atticus Finch as well for defending him to this is the words of a rich Lowry [noise]\nA Google Rachel Mitchell five page memo and it outlines all the inconsistencies with Dr Ford's dusted by [noise] um without mercy finch takes part in her account\nIn contemporary Internet language he destroys her she brushes right by her tears he doesn't care about her feelings only the facts\nYou expose contradictions in in our story in shreds her credibility\nSo it happens it turns out that she made in advance she was Nineteen years old she made it in advance on him and then got caught by her dad so to not get in trouble with their dad for\nComing on to a black man she accused him of rape her as the cover story plot of the book\nThere yesterday we talked about the history of you're innocent until proven guilty\nAnd that's what to kill a box mocking bird is about but it's about the emotional aspect of it the idea that\nAn accusation can be false that even unpopular defendants should be defended it's about the idea that it's admirable to fight against a Lynch mob and the name of the truth\nBecause just because someone believe something doesn't mean that is true you must look for the truth\nAnd Atticus Finch is a noble man he's a revered Manny someone who for decades has been taught in schools and kids she told the look up to stand up for what's right even when it's not popular\nBut today me too me too movement would call Atticus Finch rape apologist up big it a massage therapist\nRight the women who are staking out camping out at the D.C airport to catch senators walking down the hallway and they're thrown ridiculous questions like how do you\nPromote rape do you always turn your back on women why don't you believe women\nAll the ridiculous\nRight they'd be doing that to Atticus Finch Atticus Finch one of the great fictional heroes of our culture he would not be allowed to step foot on a college campus today\nThis is not progress one out of seven sixty chaos and the one hand or seven sixty five three six to anchor funding sock Kevin lines very expensive\nTo live here in California or talking about a couple of reasons why coming up at two o'clock but ah you know all the reasons why are so we got to do everything we can't you can't just complain it's expensive here and then be wasting money\nSo if you have\nA high enough credit cards Carla other debt mortgage payment\nPut that money you can you ... you may have equity in your house you put that money to work for your call Kevin lines as the president of anchor funding\nI I I pick them up at noon he had half day and he'd run on sales calls with me and then you come home for dinner and any ... any new my kids and he knew my wife and and uh and what happened was a he started participate like like he's Thirteen he'd never carved pumpkin\nAnd so is Halloween and the ... for the first time never sat down to a Thanksgiving meal you know half a Thanksgiving meal with ... with our family or you know\nUm and then um you know we feel feed the homeless every Christmas participated with the family in in in feeding the homeless and [noise] so I I\nWorked with this kid and and um and when he was sixteen oh his mother's boyfriend who hadn't been over the second story real choking him are trying to\nKill him and\nA Willie\nOr just laughed in his face just said you think you can hurt me after all I've been through you know and anyway so he called me after that incident\nAnd um and uh my wife and I helped him get emancipated and then he was in a mass murder and then he came and he lived with us and he lived with us and\nHe finished high school and he went from high school into the army and he did six years in the army\nAnd uh and then he hangs out of out of the army and and he you know he did he worked at dish network and he was the number one salesperson nine hundred people number one sales people out of nine hundred people in a call center at dish network yeah he was he always rose to the top this guy was incredibly resourceful talented kid\nBut um [noise] there's a couple of things okay first of all\nAbout four years ago at a ... and ... and he's come to we have these family ringing ... every year he comes to every family reunion with my brothers and my sisters and their siblings and he knew he knows he's part of the family anyway four years ago at a family reunion he announced that he was changing his last name to cigarettes\nIt was last name to cigarettes oh so he's now will cigarettes and\nAnd uh you know because he you know he he learned how to take care of himself and\nAnd also the power to give away by so many people being there and supporting and this whole community you know I was just mentioned but the whole community was a love this kid you don't support him and he was he was a miracle anyway now uh he works for the state of Colorado\nOr he's in health and Human Services he's helping uh recently diagnosed HIV patients get all the um resources you know health care support groups yeah\nThe ... he's a he's a caregiver so he went from giving him carrots and now he's a professional care isn't that wild\nSo eleven years old where would you be without boys of my mentor\nWho I don't know you know he just flew out he was here last weekend for thirty first birthday he's thirty one years old so you know I've been ... these men and boys men for one that actually brings up\nOne of the day or a boy's man that I Love this is not a a let's have one big rally in the in the in the rye assembly yeah and a rod rock ... now you get an extreme example right but it's still it's consistency for a lifetime\nYou know I might we okay yeah I'm really came in in the early days and and we had a different model for boys men there but for the last eight years we've been in the schools\nAnd we started in the middle schools okay and work and and then now all those middle schools that feed into high schools were in those high school too so we are able to track these young men from middle school through high school from twelve to Eighteen years old you know from boy demand you know you know we've got that\nThat pathway is in place for the young man that choose to stay engaged and be a part of the community and and get the um you know the support and accountability and their lives to become the men they all want to be and you know what might they all want to be good men\nAnd this is what's cool wind up when we show up him and and we get some young guys that have had you know some gang issues or some some dope issues are behavioral issues you know and they're twelve Thirteen their seventh eighth grade\nWe get to start talking about\nWhat happened to you that you decided this is a way it had to be you know and they start talking about what happened to them you know and then and and you know at seven or eight you know maybe when dad walked out the door they made it they made a decision about how life is going to be and in that decision led to another decision and that ... and there was there was seven hundred and eighty five\nDecisions that got him into a gang seven to Thirteen\nTo but you know what if we're talking about it\nAnd they can raise the consciousness between what happened to them and what's happening to them than now if they connect the dots between those that tragic event and the behavior now\nThey they would that consciousness it now becomes a choice that it's not a deep fault it's not a survival mechanism they actually get to choose if they want to do something better and so we help them identify the kind of man they really want to want to be and challenge and what's one thing you're willing to do different this week to be that man\nThis is the key senators that they all want to be good men you think that's true that's been your experience ... absolutely wow that's so important [laughter] so and yeah no I just don't know how to do\nA specially especially when they're they're in an environment where they're just trying to\nLiterally ... literally survive you know idea of what these guys have ... every day and I can tell you another story about Armando you know this is itself fourteen year old kid he is six to to eighty five\nAnd he's fourteen years old he would make a great soldier and and he has gangsters waiting for him and the corner on his way to school\nEvery day he has to walk by those guys and he has to say no to them so he can say yes to boys cement every freaking day because they want him he's a perfect recruit he'd be a great soldier he's big he's\nStrong he's fourteen so if he gets arrested he just goes to ... carry the guns he can carry that do for them and and and and nothing bad is going to happen to him because he's for\nWhat he wants to be a good now I Am now have you got one you know how it's\nSo good so

[noise] that you hear that dog whistle\nFear I hear what yeah well I didn't hear it because he's not a sexist massages like miles is wow a\nBite to distance myself from betray over there\nOr you read the article and you see that the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either facts or the shoes off in the article was so wrong it presents itself they present it actually presents the story backwards reverse in cause and effect I call these what streets cause rain stories papers are full of them\nIn any case he read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story\nAnd then turn the\nPage to national or international affairs and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine\nThan the bologna that you just read\nYou turn the page and you forget what you know you read one article about something you know about\nAnd you're like well this this is a city Arctic nothing [laughter] I think as far as this person ever been to a new whatever I have no idea what they're talking about you know because you actually know the top and then you turn the page\nAnd the same people are riding on something else that you don't know about you're like oh they're the experts like none of them just as idiotic as the thing that you know about\nSo the total and complete curry from the press about Kavanaugh by the way the worst person of all of all of them\nIs Jennifer Rubin who is the so called conservative at the Washington Post we're not going to go into detail but she has been the absolute worst of his entire a capital saga alas or\nYou read the Twitter accounts from from journalists and political commentators and the and the and the major networks have an ABC News guy called Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh rapists got that's crazy\nStraight up crazy not even didn't put the word a legit or anything at all if Kavanaugh gets confirmed and there'll be two rapist stuff is really straight up the ABC News political commentary ABC News\nNBC News published three articles but one of them about I'm cabinet committing perjury then they updated the entire tax to the article but kept the headline that said he committed perjury with no mention the fact that they changed the tax\nYou can't do that we talked to yesterday two days ago about uh headlines that are completely contracted contradicted by the story so New York times wrote a headline Democrats denounced limits on FBI inquiry and in the seventeenth paragraph it says no evidence has emerged that the White House has forbidden any investigative steps so\nThe headlines I got all the graves limited Seventeen paragraph it's like oh it's not it's not limited we have no evidence [laughter]\nNBC News to that interview with the third accuser Julie sweat Nichols they mentally\nUnstable in trouble person so it's a wildly exploitative of them\nBut they started the interview saying that we haven't been able to substantiate any over claims and then decided to run by the way guys ... ah ah she's named for people\nWho are at the party mhm where Brett Kavanaugh wow that's hard to say is it yeah so ... for witness in a while there are the worst certainly helps yeah so the because outreach credible\nYeah this must be game over and so the first person says she's never met\nJulie ... doesn't know what is the second person dead\nOr do they have to say that's nothing and then the third and fourth of the way I've they haven't we don't know those people we have reached out\nSo there you go but so far\nSo good air the enemy running or the oil and when you lie detector and then on top [laughter]\nSo I've never seen Lou to see from the media like these last year he says blame lies Russia could never concoct something like that but here's why I bring this up we can see the blindingly by blinding bias here but then we read the next story and we think oh straight facts and integrity\nNo no no so let's\nTalk about real quick about this New York times piece about Trump and his dad and taxes but if you want to know great info on this story to seven o'clock segment this morning on Armstrong getting were perfect so to go to the Armstrong ... and the seven o'clock I Can't do better than that but here's the opening lines of you guys rather darkly\nUh no I have not some took it out way too long [laughter] headline Trump engaged in suspect tax teams as he reaped riches from his father\nAll right ed line already I'm like now that is so click Beatty suspects tax schemes what does that mean what the suspect taxing give me something was it fell on us or what was it against the law or was it just suspect what does that and then read to riches\nReap the riches so that line he received at least four hundred and Thirteen million in today's dollars today's hours what\nDoes that make enough terms there's there were like you said they're adjusting for inflation but you don't ever read that in article ... the reason they did that was to make it look like more money than he actually\nDodged sure right so let's say ... pesos there'll be ways one [laughter] yeah right phone run choice really [laughter] oh my God support for three billion bags or what does that I've never I've never seen that in her article the only time I see today's dollars is if you're trying to get a little context to something but the entire article\nIs written with today's dollars never seen that I've never seen that and\nNowhere in the article does it give the actual amount of money that he was dodging Thirty years ago never says you know two hundred million dollars it only says for Thirteen in today's dollars I've never seen them all life\nAnd then he decides to southern line than the opening line is President Trump participated in dubious tax schemes during the nineties Sylvia I'm Out\nOut of the rich headlines so that line first sentence what are we to what are we doing\nSuspect reaped riches today's dollars in dubious yeah this is not saying this is nothing\nIt's the same people do the same people\nGal man amnesia effect don't forget one under seven sixty K.
