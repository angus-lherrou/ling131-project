just speaking I don't think I'm Alone in this fact I Know I'm not\nBut I'm a Jew span of construction now that's his his whole deal and back in the day back in the early eighties when he bought the chargers that was a big big thing for San Diego had a lot of good years until one day Sunday and said well move to LA and will be like a team number of twelve and local interest\nWe'll see how that works out when they go share the dry Norma stadium\nBeing built up there and the scenic beautiful Inglewood\nOr when they play second fiddle to the rams and of course every other third fourth fifth day playing pedals anymore anyway uh the span hosted a lot for the community and a lot of ways through the chargers when they were here but that was then Mrs now a meanwhile we have to know is so ah Nikki Haley's right up there that's the number one\nAn sprinting topic at the moment on Twitter run Al Gore's Internet thanks alf we're creating that for us\nUh here's I'll tell you about that first of all she uh she's she's got to leave at the end of the year so she announced it today she's stepping down it's a surprise resignation but of course all the chattering classes are saying well obviously something must be\nShe must be checked the Trump whatever she made nice remarks about being thankful that a vodka and\nThat the yeah back in Jared Kushner are are there uh\nDoes that mean as they read the tea lives that means somehow she suggesting because they are the\nThe task force for good and it keeps dad who's the precedent for going out of his gourd at any given time no\nShe's resigning she and President Trump announced this today here they pay the Associated Press saying blind citing many administration officials dying speculation the White House\nBeyond about the timing of reasons for the latest Trump shakeup\nWeeks before the midterm elections first of all let me tell you this and I've known some people who have served at the un and that same post most notably and most recently there've been John Bolton who is the national security advisor\nAnd a new Jeane Kirkpatrick is well she was she was great during the Reagan Administration and Bolton was very similar to Jeane Kirkpatrick both and a frequent guest on my show by the way for those you're playing along on the whole game um which is not available in the store\nBut now she was tough she were a great book called dictatorships in double standards is still out there somewhere you can read that and of course John Bolton is John Bolton so\nIt it wears you out you go there and immediately the whole world out most of the world hate you because you're representing the United states of America now they love the money\nBut they hate you wherever you are as the representative who is the one that was there a under Obama I'm Samantha power's\nPower power power spent the power I'm\nNot exactly in the top echelon of the un ambassadors now is that just because you work for Obama but she was very big on the well we don't want to offend you because we're the United states but we're not all that great I mean that's usually what we get what you get with Nikki Haley\nOne of the most powerful Republican women

Nikki Haley's obviously running for president she said listen no I'm not running and twenty twenty and she quickly added she'd support Trump\nSo for anybody and they're over there like come on MSNBC right now any of them going\nHow do you see she's got her when she hates Trump that's not what she said\nBut this is less than a month before the elections you realize today in San Diego the ballots

and Taylor\nSwift miss represents it's not the first time it's happened in politics her record why does it matter because the Senate matters why does it matter to us in San Diego because our senators are now you know Feinstein and Campbell Harris we've\nSeen in the last several weeks with nomination to the Supreme Court another big things that have a lot of impact at your home and your family your future\nOr personal legacies it's important to to senators are not just in our state so to counter like senators you drive you nuts or drive me nuts you need people we need people like\nMarsha Blackburn in the Senate because she's been in the house doing a great job even though Taylor Swift doesn't care to look at all the facts I Love to push the Swiss music I'm Glad I'm not one of her

in in this weird parallel universe I just Lance overhear CNN has done another segment about the president's private parts [noise] [noise]\nOh is that Don Lemon either on that I Know how dare you say are you suggesting though I got on the mountains are owned Britain wonderful a tweet out about something regarding [noise] so I saw it on the Internet it must be true does it\nFeel like yesterday when they came to the East Room of the White House and had the big trample entry with the president then there was Brett Kavanaugh the new associate justice of the Supreme Court and there was the retired they're retiring lays out in ... doesn't that back in June nobody would last night they have the victory dance\nAnd it was the first time I've ever seen anything that big I think is the first time they've done it that way and there was\nA justice now retired Anthony Kennedy\nRevered by the left until he quit and it created a vacancy so cabinet could hold so remember one\nOf the things that got lost in all this stuff in the last this muck and the last few weeks was well Kavanaugh is horrible because she hates women he has more women ... works in anybody's had working for them they're now in his new gig and that's a continuation what he did and there was Anthony Kennedy there\nKevin uh clerked for Kennedy Kennedy likes them they know them and I'm sure if he had a chance to rebuild talk now that he's out Anthony Kennedy was um\n\nPlenty comfortable with Brett Kavanaugh so now the big pushes you you're not going to hear about\nDr Christine Blasey Ford she's been thrown under the ... or whatever it is campaign\nBus but people who are on our side already moving on to other things now it's like well Kevin ... not a champion for women so we need to a win this fall when seats in the house and especially in the Senate because then we can find some way Maxine Waters to\nUse the word to impeach Donald J Trump and by the same token now now they want some not all not all the Democrats but some of the fringe both parties have fringes\nThere's of course now that we've got two for the country impeach Brett Kavanaugh this is where it gets interesting if you look at the local race here like Darrell ISIS seat that had these retiring moving out to a new gig who's gonna win there's gonna be the Democrats like Lebanon or is going to be the Republican\nUh Diane Harkey\nWhat happens in hunters district there's a lot of questions and so all comes back local it's all political now\nThe Supreme Court stuff is all local impact because of all these other races to tell you more about that Tom do because I was going to join us\nDuring his political vanguard dot com coming up just a moment of former attorney general Ed Meese with us live right after eleven o'clock today\nAs well and I am

then recovered\nAnd we have lost our character on the world stage in the sense that it Obama had\nBeen battling a Samantha power's was a protest or John Kerry was a former protester and I thought in a remarkably short period of time she sat there and I know\nThis is the new\nMessage which is really the whole message from Reagan and so I thought she did a remarkable job restoring America's presence and persona and un in a in a very short period of time\n[noise] [noise] well meanwhile here in California we have you had another group so we did it again the DMV and there's motor voter thing uh\nI'm I'm losing a\nI'm lousy rack of how many ... she gave him more power\nWell it's never the end of his first of all many of us warned about this is gonna be stupid an ugly and people who shouldn't be voting are going to accidentally be allowed to vote 'em and then say okay we got it covered throw us more money will be fine here at the DMV and then you find out a few days later that they're not fine and that there was another this time around Fifteen hundred\nWho are signed up to vote in California who have no business being\nSigned up to vote in California and they say well the staffers looked at it and hopes ... food that any I'm Sorry you know Brittany spears was thinking I've ever heard of that are ...\nThat that's kind of like meanwhile where what the third fourth fifth sixth largest economy in the world and because of the Democrats [noise] we did not have a series of debates among the gubernatorial candidates and match in\nThere and not being eight get bait over whether the prime minister of Canada or\nOr England or India where they just ... now so Gavin Newsom wants to fly under the radar does not want to appear publicly to say what he wants to do because he thinks he's so far in the lead that he doesn't have to do this you will get the they had a\nRadio debate yesterday that was in\nBroadcast a rat I live in prime time or or video feed and then one step beyond that which is just incredible ... didn't do a a candidate statement it's like unbelievable he\nNever did any of the results are often motor why do you do that and how do you do that when you're running for governor really\nYeah it's like yeah he didn't do it and I ... I think it's part and parcel of his of his arrogance I I'm going to be the next governor why did he say when when you talked about gay marriage whether whether you like it or not\nThis attitude [laughter]\nWell buses on as a temp job a car with his political Bangor dot com of course they have the debate yesterday that even the Associated Press was saying was\nSo she had a press was saying was in the evening by designed to make sure people didn't notice the one and only debate was Cox and uh [noise]\nUh and do some drunk talks called us right after it by the way he told me last night ... thanks for coming on and he said yeah I did it you know I didn't have approval to do that because you know how the handlers can charge so he just called us\nAnd we got the whole Linda but it's so narrow I mean what's Gavin Newsom afraid of I guess he's afraid of people discovery who John Cox is that there's somebody else who actually did file a candidate statement that's there for you to read and the sample ballot the what an idea of somebody\nElse who has a different point of view and of course you know it's what's currently running a commercials saying we're California's number one and child poverty\nAnd what his his solution it of course this massive new government spending but I just think it's for a couple that guy who presided do or the area where you see so much poverty\nIn San Francisco and now they're saying well we have a problem child poverty really because you've been in government for ever\nSo why should we promotes you from within you know when you when you've been there causing the problem\nWell he's also a big news some is on the anti Trump thing okay so that's what they do in Sacramento I guess that that's their prerogative but that's not the ... and I uh solve things are anti Trump unless we have a disaster earthquake or fires or whatever and they go\nMr Trump Mr President we please give us money but like you right now now we have we got the money to check with the child that works pretty ... it's\nNot it doesn't actually do any thing physically good for California right all it does is promote their political career because they know they can raise money off of that it's very very cynical and course Javier Sarah is the worst of it\n[noise] well then these the current attorney general last time I tracked yeah exactly\nI of course the other thing is even in this um proposition six the gas tax repeal is another example of how this works again I'm very little party in power secretary of state gets to determine with the politicians who hold a majority in those cases the Democrats and they get to determine the wording on the ballot we've talked a lot about\nThat if you look bad if they put your little room and say here's your ballot\nYou have no idea there's no telling when you read that description for prop six that it's a gas tax repeal a a fee repeal of being raised it best you're basically leaves are like yeah like you're it it it it stopped some of these road projects it's your fault yeah yeah that kind of an absolutely\nIt does that and that's actually Sarah is on who did that and got away with it and the courts let them get away with that uh but it's yeah it's ultimate power broker move we're [laughter] we're going to lie to the voters and confuse them\nAnd uh I'm not sure I I'm not sure it can pass even though if it was properly done it will pass I'm asked to give it a shot up or I get off if you're listening to my voice please go Diane Harkey website and give her donation and and help out the San Diego Republican

he's just trying to make a list you know you know\nYeah he's a socialist and they are they're pouring money into that and you know the the problem with California losing a congressional seat says they don't come back the other way and so people need to get out\nThere and that has a bearing on the ... that's on the impeachment process people trying to impeach Trump there are those who knows a lot of children grow farther than that let's see if we win let's go ahead and tried to impeach Kavanaugh Supreme Court so that's why the local races are so very\nUm what's the thing that Lebanon does oh at

getting their balance a yes they get mailed out today I Believe so you know and get ready because it is long and lay offs and measures ruin my mailbox for\nA let's talk a little a federal fallout from all of this national fallout from the last couple of weeks and we can move on to ... so it's very clear on I just saw it a second ago and the amount of let me see uh the left hates the constitution\nBecause they're losing the game that the constitution has set up\nSo I thought oh no I thought it was on Fox they were talking about the uh electoral college that's what it was but Democrats again wanted to get rid of the electoral college um that's been going on for a long time right Hillary voters still say that Hillary won the popular vote and therefore the Trump presidency is legitimate the word you're gonna see a lot in the next couple of weeks here especially if the Republicans sold the house the Senate\nAnd twenty eight days are illegitimate you can see that were legitimate a lot\nAnd yes of course Hillary won the popular vote but that's not the game that's not how you win right it's the losing football team has more pass yard age\nOkay but that doesn't matter if the losing team as more rushing yards then the winning team that doesn't matter that's not how you decide who wins or loses\nSo the electoral college is is reg ... even though it's completely rate in the Democrat favorite but Trump and would anyway and it was that drinks that's there for the White House presidents adapt illegitimate uh the state Supreme Court has now illegitimate because there's now to\nRapists on it and now I've been reading all these things pieces about how the Senate is illegitimate [laughter] right from progressive magazines isn't such that the Senate itself is it legitimate because north nuts is a North Dakota for instance small state North Dakota they have two senators\nAnd California big state also has two senators and that's not democracy\n\nSure that's that's how the Senate works two per state but that's only one half of the legislative branch\nOf the other part is proportional noticed how the left also they never say gosh isn't it a shame isn't it unfair that a tiny state like Rhode Island has two votes and a big state like Texas has two votes\nRight that ever complain that way they only complain when it's a tiny red said has as much a vote as a big boost it never complain when it's a tiny blue said having as many votes as a big red state it'll quaint and that was the only complaint when it's not in their favor\n\nI'll use as a quick opportunity to plug the repeal of the seventies amendment which is something that would make a drastic difference in our country\n\nWe're not going to go all into this but the founders designed the constitution\nSo the senators were appointed by each state legislature so\nThe seventeenth amendment made it direct election like we have today so back in the day we would have liked to our local representative to go to Sacramento and one of their jobs would be to appoint a senator state senator should be a federal government senator to represent the state in Washington DC in the nation's capital\nThe reason this is important is because the state legislature if the state legislature appoint senators isn't that senator their allegiance is to the state legislature and the state\nRight and so a senator under that old system would be much less likely to vote for bills that consolidate power in DC and grow the federal government because they're hired by the state government\nAnd lower

I was in a bad mood all night yeah he kind of getting this morning I'll be on ... I Know the guy got to me and I am I Am sure Sherlock will call band as a sideline the whole thing and I shouldn't let it\nI feel bad about him\nSteven Crowder set up a table on a college campus with a big sign that says Columbus was an immigrant who brought much needed diversity change my mind [laughter]\nThat's a good Bye bye so they do a very very short Columbus analysis because yesterday got screwed up\n[noise] ah this ... but you know no kid zero kids are taught this in history class actually ties and what we're talking about the last segment so I Want to bring it up again a Christopher Columbus was searching for a way to get to China\nTo convince the leader of China or what is now China to convert to Christianity and fight with the Europeans against the Muslims that was that was the whole goal\nOf Christopher Columbus sailing across the ocean blue and fourteen Ninety two why did he want to fight the Muslims because for about eight hundred years the Muslims controlled Spain\nAnd instituted Sheree a law so I'm reading from a book here this is the history of Spain by Louis ... hurting Nineteen thirty forty says the Christians of Spain where mastered meaning taking over the armies of the K less\nHad massacred them burn them out and pillage them to the best of their ability\n\nThe Europeans to the north were continually at war with their Muslim neighbors so he goes on you talked about all the Muslims would surround these Christian towns and cut down all the trees and destroy all their harvests a and then just leave the city center alone right\nBut then twice a year these Muslim Kayla armies were rate and destroy everything they could inside the city and of course\nThere are churches to a new to do that just just\nJust 'cause I don't just to be mean [laughter] like we're going to torture them by twice a year ransacking them this theory of destruction and extermination was regarded as a work of piety and it was the holy war against the infidels\nNo not once on his left on turned the suburbs were surrendered to the flames harvests and all the property in the neighborhood where the rabbit delayed way striped so this is the ... this is the Muslims in Spain so Columbus said oh this is crazy we've got to stop this\n\nSo I'm going to go to China convinced the leader there to get his army to attack the Muslims from the east we're gonna attack from the west\nAnd on the way I'm going to stop by the east indies and get some gold so we can fund this whole thing\n\nThat's the very beginning of the story I'll stop there it it's interesting how our history and this is part of our history western history has been so watered down right so ah our kid a hundred years ago kids in school would learn the intricacies\nOf Columbus his motivation and the context of what life was like in Spain at that time and they would understand all the players involved tried the con of China the the the pope in Europe the the Muslim and the er the Muslims in the a\nK left in in Spain and in the Muslim world right so there's all different players involved in all the different interest 'cause he's\nSo watered down to the states is Columbus bad [laughter] I like when you can't talk about the Muslim atrocities obviously that's not politically correct but it's it's Muslim it's Columbus bad or maybe you'll get Columbus committed genocide that that's what it's all been watered down to\nNo one who tears down Christopher Columbus statues his right a single book about Columbus or about the ... not a single person\nBut no one can be shocked you know we can't obviously we can't be shocked about this because the people who's going to know the history Spain and fourteen Ninety two especially when you get articles like this from think progress or the constitution of the United states has failed\nAnd it isn't necessarily the lifetime parts assumed otherwise it would have said a specific time I\nSaw ... ignorance is a terrible thing in our country it's really really dangerous\n\nAnd this is why of course it will all repeat itself\n\nWhen a hunter seven sixty K.

Love some of the lines are so good sexuality is a deep and precious gift it is big not small so this was not necessarily Ben Sasse his point by the time they're pretty good at what we're talking about in the last hour with a Jon Gnarr we\nThe culture we've created in America the popular culture treats women as meat\n\nPowerful men treat women as meat feminists treat women as meat but it's all done in the name of empowerment so last week Amy Schumer was protesting in the capital of comedian named Schumer was protesting capital as she was with\nEmily how you pronounce his last name ... yeah I just always go Roger Roger cows or whatever so she's a model who poses naked all the time and the name of female empowerment\nRight so you get you know Nicki Minaj Emily Roger cow ski so many rap artist in ... and whatever right pop singers women women portray themselves to other girls and boys send a clear message a clear message that sexuality is not a deep impressions gift but a shallow and meaningless toy\nPopular culture tells boys or girls at sex is small\n\nAnd it's no big deal and it's something to be thrown around casually but of course it's been abused\nBy boys and girls by men

two things you can\nI I I cannot see how feminist and and progressive could think that excessive drinking and the name of equality dressing provocatively in the name of empowerment and casual sex and the name of liberation how could this amended any differently than this\n\nWomen are not pieces of meat so stop with the culture that tells girls and boys that they are and sex is not something that

tried to make give you sex [noise]\nTelling someone would not be revealing what he had done it wouldn't be revealing how deserving I was of that kind of treatment close quote\nHere what she's saying here\nThis precious young girl is with hearing and her sexual assault but there must be something wrong with her\nThat she is the kind of girl only worth being groped she's not worth being taken to dinner engaged in conversation as if she has a mind\nIs that doesn't make you cry there's something wrong with you\n\nSo I don't know this situation that he was talking about there but to me this is all the more reason why society and our culture screwed up because this perception that this woman is girl on and how old she was the perception of this girl had of herself that she is someone\nWho is to be brought to a deserted parking lot and groped that's that that that's how she felt about ourselves that's the message society is telling all girls all of them Kanye West new song uh I Know we lift off ... a lot right his new song is called I Love it\nSo it got over two hundred million views in the first couple of weeks two hundred million views huh so crazy popular courses you're such a blanking can I say Hey Joe like Santa says yeah I don't want to you got it right you're such a blanking\nWhat's Santa says I Love it that's it that's it goes I just thought that over and over again I think ... comes in and almost all of his lines are I'm a sick blank I like a quick black you just says that over here this on you\nKnow I'm a seven six why I like a quick blank that they just said that over and over and over that says only like two minutes on the ... two hundred million viewers okay what are we doing what what what is this\n\nSo they can put out whatever music they want but don't pretend to boys and girls here this stuff and it doesn't send a message to boys of yeah girls are meat and it doesn't send a message to girls yeah I Am meat\n\nCourse that's what ... what what was it a thin too young to make the difference between real life or whatever I Can't do that can't figure that out this is my dad's up to date their daughters data showing what they're worth\nEngage their heart and their soul in their mind because the world is only engaging with your daughter's body in telling her that that's all she is but your daughter has a heart and soul into mind if you don't engage in the world is going to get your body\nFor boys of course boys need to be taught how to date and that starts with husbands and husbands needed their wife is in the Boise that\nAnd if they don't see anything noteworthy and their parents dating relationship then they're going to get relationship advice from Kanye West\nAnd then this is an adult and this is Flanagan continues quote my depression quickly escalated to a point where if I'd been evaluated by a psychiatrist I Would probably have been institutionalized as a danger to myself\nI had plans for how I was going to kill myself [noise]\nI managed to make a few friends who introduced me to acid\nWhich was no help with the depression\nI sat in classes and a blank say\nSuffering quote\nOther girl about whom I Will some day I knew her when\nMy English teacher wrote in your book\nWords and then when I first read them and I've never forgotten\nOne of a blessing to have that kind of teacher [noise]\nSomeone who proclaimed to Flanagan her dignity or war [noise]\nShouted meaning into her soul\nTo the girl about whom I Will some day say I knew her when I was like as I Love the teacher proclaimed dignity worth and meaning\nIndoor so the teacher proclaimed dignity worth and meaning indoor ... one person did that and this girl was like one just one person a teacher thank God they did one person\nWe do not have a culture well let me where to Linda\nWe should have a culture we should build a culture where it's not just one person who may who maybe will reclaim a girl's dignity worth and meaning but every one proclaims\nIt's a it's a message that's proclaimed in the home of course but it's reinforced and movies and TV shows in commercials and music and we need to we need to create but instead it's garbage in garbage out to know it can be shocked that boys and men\nAct like this and then that girls and women think this way about themselves it would be shocking if they didn't it\nIt would be shocking if boys and girls got a steady stream of this garbage and and then we had proper gender relations that would be shocking politics is downstream of culture culture comes first politics is a
