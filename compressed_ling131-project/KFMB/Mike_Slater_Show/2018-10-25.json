the ability to delayed gratification\nStudy's lead authors that if you want your child to grow up to earn a good salary\nConsidering selling them than the importance of passing smaller immediate reward in favor of larger ones that they have to wait for\nThis is probably easier said than done he said as very few people naturally enjoy waiting for the results suggest those who developed the ability to delay gratification are likely investing in their own earning\nAlso some of the of the sand and package it was addressed to John Brennan\nIs not working\nExplosive device it doesn't have a a a trigger device it is\nIt is a hoax that one for sure confirmed\nSo the idea of discounting\nWhen only Democrats are targeted and they're only famous Democrats\nAnd it all seems to occur in a very short news cycle and it corresponds with an editorial by George Soros in the New York times I think that those facts and people can draw their own conclusions but you cannot\nDiscount the idea that the perpetrator of this is not in fact\nUh on the right or a Trump fan\nIt might be somebody else it may be a hoax\nHe may be a dry run it may be a terrorist no but the idea that\nTrump said fall after two months or more of Democrats encourage encouraging uncivil behavior violence against person and property a you know if the collateral damage was acceptable according to Nancy Pelosi awash speaker\nEric Holder used to be the highest law enforcement official\nIn the country encouraging\nThe tech kick 'em when they go low meaning the political opposition to it just goes on and on you know and we had a guy crazy guy with a gun was a Bernie Sanders\nIt go low meaning the political opposition to it just goes on and on you know and we had a guy crazy guy with a gun was a Bernie Sanders supporter who tried to kill a bunch of Republican members of Congress\nThe saw a ball game right yeah that is softball\nGame and it was a report it this way so this this actually just makes Americans just trust the media even more than they already\nDo in one of the cable news networks also had something like this are just going you know domestic terrorism is Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York saying oh this this is a red versus blew it said the ... like they've all just decided they don't even know that it's domestic it happens domestically you within the United states if that's what they mean just looking at the geography of it\nBut this this reminds me when they say when something happens you know I'm not just too many a cycle arsons gone into total false flag pin in tinfoil hat with no I'm just saying we don't know we don't know maybe the FBI noted ... but they don't ... I was going to say but it's like when they say\nUm seconds after the uh the smoldering SUVs there in New York and the alert T shirt bomber\nIt by saying hey that doesn't look right and about ten seconds later authorities are going this is not terrorism I don't know exactly\nYou can't say it's domestic you don't know we don't know we started telling aid if they know\nExactly the contrast is striking every time there's someone wielding some sort of weapon committing murders and they're screaming out\n... Akbar the same price that is now condemning this is domestic terrorism by reading blow\n'em or the president say no hold your horses no you can't say definitively anything ah it we we it if it's just an event\nThat even terrorism and it's interesting how the slogan airing it so coordinated you know the late night comics last night the Hollywood celebrities on their social media the panels on MSNBC and CNN\nAnd the Democrats issuing statements are all saying the same thing at the same time well ... and where are the caravans by the way does anybody covering\nThe caravan somebody did the math I think on Monday and this could be whether the perpetrator or perpetrators left or right and what have you on these whole pipe bomb incidents whatever uh someone decided um to never let a crisis go to waste and they did the math\nAs people in the messaging department or whether or not doing that anybody's directly behind any and stuff\nBut we don't know what we don't know but somebody looked at the math and said the caravans not gonna make it to the U.S border until well a long time and they're like a thousand miles away it's going to take a while it's not going to be there and time for the photo ops and\nAll the push shove and I know Madison sending down and nothing is sending eight hundred more troops to the border\nJust as a deterrent and he knows that word gets out to people coming up maybe that'll deter some of the narrative wells in the middle of a lot of people who are looking for for the best but um when you realize that's not going to happen you're not going to have that come up like\nLike the weekend before November ... then you go on to what what else is happening but let's go with this and they're very good on the left talking about this a lot they're very good on the left\nGetting on the talking points faster than those on the right there's a lesson to conservatives and Republicans because the messaging on the right as often really screwed up\nSo you you want to have the message be true [laughter] you know on one side and doesn't matter I don't think so\nNo it's not a factor these days but you're absolutely right the narrative but you know that the left because of the pop culture the left controls most of the media and and they you're right they're very disappointed when it comes to their communications date it on scoot appear mark\nThat they were prepared for this story that they had was all\nLike do you mean like I did with the uh with we oppose a candidate acts with the Supreme Court that one yeah\nReally reminds me of that and so it's just a matter of you know when Nancy Pelosi says that well if our opposition suffers little collateral damage so be it\nYeah you got something on your website James ... dot com has you know because you wrote it it's Nancy Pelosi's Olin ski approach how to how to Trump's words mean he'd smoke about unity and the latest rally which he seems to be doing like every five minutes and interesting timing pretty\nSmart but he talked about unity and then a little later on this whether he's beating up as opponents any creates this violence Nancy Pelosi speaking to a group of her buddies\nIn New York City and you have the quote on quote I think we owe the American people to be there for them for their financial security respecting the dignity and worth of every person in our country and if there is some collateral damage for some others who do not share our view well Sylvia who's her speech writer Maxine Waters\nYeah I think her speech writer is either Machiavelli or solid landscape because what she's expressing is the old adage the end justifies the means\nMeaning we should get rid of ethics and right wrong when it comes to it as long as our and our goal our objective is worthy how we get there we can use any thing\nWhich we saw the Kavanaugh you're hearing the collateral damage in the Kavanaugh hearings with a capital a family of Dr Ford\nAnd and really the system of advise you can accept the constitution so the collateral damage with the caravan\nWhich appears to be engineered if we don't know exactly who funded it there's videos showing money being handed out we know logistically it costs a lot of money it was spontaneous share harder is down there and and talking to people and yes there are people with him is Thirteen tattoos\nAnd they write and there are a lot of people who are also looking for a better life I get that but the whole or ... or how this comes together suddenly boom there it is it's not a hundred percent organic so\nWe have a death has occurred and that's what collateral damage means\nPeople are using these innocent because there are a lot of innocent family I guess I'll just give it that I don't know what the percentages are but let's for those people who are just literally legitimately going for refuge and they're being used by people who do better using them as props\nThat to me is as bad as the microwave and campaign here using Gabrielle Giffords is I think what looks like a prop to say vote for Mike Lebanon and she's I mean bless\nHer that she was able to survive the gun attack but there's a point when people look like they're being used to bring out the victim and use it for political purposes same kind of thing with a\nWith refugees who are are legit and we'll just say that's the majority I mean so much to

that'll there weren't talked ... about that after the bottom of the hour I'm but I'm sticking with the ... same Meghan McCain was just on the view this morning now in this in this new era of expanded political correctness insensitivity\nUh she was busy saying that among other things she's sorry she used the term crooked Hillary because it added to this environment\nThat's where we are going now apparently [noise] dentist thing that's\nGoing on here I mean really it's Peter Schweitzer and just a second or he's the author of Clinton Cash in secret empires he's president of the government Accountability Office in New blockbuster info about by what you call food stamps were fancier term for it now but we have to that coming up\nUm [laughter]\nThe if you look through or how this plays out and uh\nThe real reason nothing's working for the opposition here because Trump seems to have the rally scheduled every day and it's not to defend prop a hundred percent of all the time sometimes it's really tough to do especially depending on his tweets but seems like every time there's bad news something the other side thinks we got him that he's out there with a rally at twenty thousand people is that they're getting last night\nTalking about having energy for being Seventy one or seven years old that's not what Republican presidents are moving in whatever form are supposed to do\nSo\nHere's a little ... this was earlier this week this week started before some thought okay the message about the caravan that's not going to work they're going to get here in the weeks that could affect so let's talk up something else anything else\nNever let a crisis go to waste that came from a who's that run them into one of them and the Obama administration never let a crisis go to waste so they're really upset that in the middle of all this stuff Trump's approval rate and approval ratings keep growing up\nWhen you look at the top issues in that NBC Wall Street Journal poll it ... the economy at thirty eight percent of voters and that's their top issue and Republicans in this poll winning on that issue by the largest margin I think it's had in the history of the wall Street Journal poll\nSo it's a tradeoff that voters are making in their mind where they're like well he's he's kind of a jerk but he's our jerk and maybe the economy's going well I think that's the way a lot of voters are thinking about that\nThere's one other issue that stuck out to me in this poll that that I think is why\nWe had such a sense of this election being up in the air and that's the question of homes and normally in the mid term elections when you've got a new president empower the party out of power is challenging it's really windy and changing something different\nAnd sure enough when I go into focus going to ask people what are they thinking they say I I feel like I Can't keep going on like this than DC Wall Street journal poll Republicans when among those on the question of who's going to bring about change to Washington which is very strange dynamic for a midterm election like\nThis you know I Would submit\nTo the acceptance of deeply deeply deeply dishonest president the acceptance of that\nAmong people is the single most important issue of our day\nWell\nThere you have that Peter Schweitzer joined us he's the president the accountability uh well the government accountability Institute author of Clinton Cash and secret empires its mother books do you ought to be reading\n'em in the middle of all the swamp ears to swamp so many levels\nUh Peter you not have this new report out this week that involves what we would call just generally food stamps federal food stamps but it's officially the Supplemental Nutrition assistance program there's something wrong here too and this involves it's almost sounds like the Caribbean terrorism or terrorists\nYeah you know it's funny mark when people think of food stamp fraud or even the tea fraud um they think of you know the lady who's buying the lobster tails with her a food stamps and everybody gets frustrated with that um what we're talking about here is the market place\nAre they thinking one part I Need to

president of the United states I Know I'm all over the place but\nNo you're not you're injury in our hearts and minds when ... you're right where they are betraying the writer and trees to skate or been trained to come here is Meghan McCain on the viewer in trying to figure out where this goes on when I ask you also about the other may get on the news Megan Kelly\nOut at NBC maybe they got to pay or the whole sixty nine million dollars or a bad way turns into a a decent week at least on the bottom line but here's Meghan McCain McCain saying no no she regrets she's trying to add to be more civil discourse she regrets saying things like crooked Hillary adding to the polarization\nWhy they were all petrified right now in the sense that this is happening down the street from where we live and I've been doing so much full searching and my life in so many different ways right now and\nI talk to my producers beforehand that I I wanted to bring this up that I\nReally try every day I really try to come into work thinking about what rhetoric I'm going to put out in the world ... my father would have done if you don't care\nLast year on the show I said I hate Hillary Clinton and I called her crooked Hillary and it is one of the things I regret doing because I contributed on television that this is not saying that I I I agree with her political as many vast differences of opinion on philosophy an ideology and I didn't think she was a great candidate but\nHate is not a word that should be coming out of my mouth on TV about someone of a different political persuasion yeah so I Need to hold my thought to it the same standard that I Would like to hold the president and I am for everyone else in media because I think we should cop to our mistakes and I'm damn sure going to continue to try and do it my my father did now he's anti amnesty exceed\nBut I Do regret doing that because I thought what have I done\nTo contribute to the polarization in this country and that is one thing that I can on that day and I read the right person to do to say what you just said I don't know\nTo do that I unfortunately don't know if this president has that kind of character um doesn't mean that should give up\nDale ...\nWhat do you think she would be kind of joy ... or\nMaxine Waters say the same thing until he gets to that it's not going to change isn't\nOh please Megan thanks that by coming forward now that lead laps either gonna love her you know what I agree with her sentiment for me I I I don't use it a hate word because I actually don't hate\nYou can just like something that's been well I Can't stand\nTheir policies I think and I do think Hillary Clinton is a criminal I think she has committed criminal offense that um I think it\nKind of juvenile to be I'm putting you know cricket in front of people's names or you know\nDying ... year old beautiful to groups\nYeah whatever whatever it is I just think it's silly I think it does is down at places the lowest common denominator however it's been incredibly effective um\nI Would like the guy be effective\nBut fight back I mean like they I appreciate the fighting back I think they need to continue to do that aggressively aggressively defend themselves when they were attacked because otherwise they're a vacuum and whatever the Democrats say I'm just is\nIs the truth because we generally don't respond Donald Trump at the Blair right at that narrative and now we do respond\nAnd we're not going to change Donald Trump I just\nThink we're plowing hot air wasting time to even try\nWell the reason is as Anderson Cooper Cesar ... the thing is Trump doesn't see human bombs as human beings\nThe president's speaking in Wisconsin a became quite hypocritical you I I just have to say but he talked about explosive devices being center former a government officials\nMade no mention of an explosive device sent to this building behind me the headquarters of CNN News organization he routinely of\nThe enemy of the American people\nAnd yet he said it's the media's fault\nFor the kind of reporting\nMany organizations have been doing what the president said at the top of the hour about today's attempted bombing is notable for what he left do\nNamely any of the intended victims president from former secretary of state and two ex presidents or in his words merely former high ranking government officials they gave NO NAME\nNothing to indicate he sees them as individuals human beings and distinguished former public service\nFormer presidents of the United states you also may what appears to be the first attempt to something familiar\nPutting the perpetrator and victim on equal footing\nThe also made no mention either of the bombs that to the officers right behind me here at CNN\nOr say also did not take responsibility at all for any of the heated rhetoric tonight you could hear him for spreading around the blame and talking about the media there they're saying I'm a softer hostility what he's looking for is someone who agrees with him but it's not in the first amendment at all that is not our jobs quite frankly but we did not hear\nThe president accept any bit of responsibility for something that he and his supporters are doing lead the uses of only ... but he has that unique ability with the bully pulpit to um a set the tone here and we learn tonight exactly how he's going to do it but it's not what he said earlier today a call for unity\nSo Anderson Cooper events Trump does she bumped dark as human beings and then there's also a thing going on CNN Today that will Trump is not reached out to be ex presidents who have been threatened what'd you supposed to call and say I'm Sorry that one of my pipe bones you got to use that what they're suggesting [laughter]\nSo let's see clear as it is not anybody's responded if not Trump's responsibility Maxine Waters responsibility or anybody responsibility um it the actions of a nut job it's just that is the responsibility of the night job\nOr the reason they don't we don't even know where you're really pretty I\nDid that but you cannot ascribe responsibility for violent actions to somebody who ... who quote unquote unit the bully pulpit you can't do it he's not saying please go out and kill ...\nGreat I going to go through your represents our break your I Need to just your quick thirty seconds

threw abuse your employees illegal immigration will stop if there are no welfare state benefits free education free medicine cetera banned under the table java sanctioned by both parties people won't come am seven sixty coughing\nAnd breaking news [noise]\nLike on polling most flash back to two thousand six team for a presidential election\nA lot of these production polls\nYou know they asked people and they get a little kind of idea of how people are thing but then there's a final ... before they released their predictions\nAnd what they do it they try to determine\nWho is a likely voter so it's so it's not and you'll see this in the polls likely voters so the question is not what do you know hundred people thing to do a hundred people think and then how many of those people are going to vote\nAnd you can't predict that that's an unpredictable thing my especially when people whether they vote or not is a Tibetan on after rainy or not right that's how passionate or not badges that some people are about her so\nThat last step that well who's a likely voter who's actually going to go and vote that creates huge discrepancies and the numbers that ...\nThat makes sense so that's why it was one reason why they screwed up the presidential election and it's one reason why you're seeing a lot of uh protections today but who's gonna win the house and whatnot that are wrong are going to be wrong\nThey can't predict who the likely voter is and who is actually going to go and vote a policy see a lot of push polling my we're talking to the Sox the guise of the day\nAnd the question that you saw on the UT the question was uh would you prefer to have fat cat developers come in and take over the land or allow\nSTDs you to expand their amazing services to the community like oh yeah see I see that one right so you can push pull all day long and that's not accurate obviously\nA real quick spent the morning at ... children's hospital today is not the place you want to be not not the best uh you know in the morning or just totally fine we thought\nMaybe a sprained or heard his arrest\nOr something like that but I wanted to write [laughter] jak crying all night and we're like shake it off yeah I had a dog and then it was just crying in the morning so they are right I guess we gotta [laughter]\nSo we go and they do the the X. ray everyone there's wonderful nurse I've ever met up or they do the X rays jak started screaming screaming\nWe're done jumps down there's a picture of me on the wall and then walks out and I was like whoa\nWhat on an ... yeah well what is this about so they think his elbow was dislocated and in the process of getting him straight for the X rays they located the elbow back and it's by while they thing happened\nWhile he then he goes right after he sits on a charity falls off and land to go to the dollar and it gets ... and it gets back up and\nI was like you got to be can be kid\nSo it's one of those weird moments where you're like hold on we're just fed or a whole day here are all morning here and ... and ... like you kind of want it to be something but they're not going to of course you don't\nReally want it to be something but my jak\nConservative turnout hours ago here's why I bring it up I got through things real quick first of all ready soldiers amazing don't you find it very far away from\nThe highway\nOn the back side do you drive right by it every time I go there I get off the highway at them as like foreign lights and I'm like\nJeeze if I was in an ambulance or something or ... or ... here I Believe there's a lot there's a lot as he got a pretty far away from the highway I think that's my first point your second point um\n[noise] I forget my second point here's the story mosque checked us up a market out I'm leaving right to walk through the the parking garage I Try to sneak in a weird way and I come out between two cars that are part bumped rate into baby Slater\nMuch of anything um so it's weird to call them the bombs because they're over eight or ... how many other where they're eight bombs yeah I don't even know yeah and now you don't want I like\nDuty yesterday the union Tribune was like oh there's it's just in that one of the White House like will are there things yeah I read an article this morning that still talked about the UT having evacuated and there were three UPS boxes laid out there was like a pair of shoes and [laughter] so um\nBefore we get to the current situation just a little story a couple of years back uh two thousand sixteen a woman sent to the governor of Texas Governor Abbott a bomb in the mail so check out these two sentences up off that was her name puff was allegedly upset\nSo why why do you guys think she was that he's a Republican governor why would this woman sent a Republican governor a bomb so I assume didn't like didn't like his bottom vowels season the conservative policies of governor Abner ... allegedly upset with Governor Abbott for not receiving support from her ex husband\n[laughter]\nLike spousal support and who's not governor rabbit I should be aware of and I don't I mean I don't I don't think the governor even as much set set to that who is that right so a ... that first point right says a lot about\nThese crazy people who send these bombs and what we're supposed to always assume are there are deep political motivations right there's a woman is that the bomb to the governor because she wasn't receiving our spouses support [laughter] so it doesn't have to be some grand political gesture\nThat if someone send a bomb to Democrats were supposed to make grand generalizations about the rhetoric and and beliefs about half the population\n\nThis woman said to bond as one woman attacked so she said to bomb to a Republican not because she's a Democrat and he's Republican she's had to bump to Republican because she's crazy\n\nDoes he the president of CNN Jeff Zucker he said this is the total and complete lack of understanding of the White House there is a total and complete lack of understanding of the White House about the seriousness of their continued\nAttack on the media that amazing zero evidence zero proof that visit any correlation to Trump or as any political motivation at all\n\nBecause the bombs or is that the Democrats means the sender has to be must be a huge Trump fan which then of course means all Trump supporters are guilty of send murder or I'll get back to this is Liz I'm let me go to the uh the stood out in the sixteen bombings or attempted bombing to the governor of Texas oh here's the second sentence\nCourt documents say governor Abbott opens a package but it failed to explode because he didn't open it right\nIf open correctly it could have caused severe burns and death how 'bout that so you open the box from the wrong side or something so the bomb didn't go off that's how quickly and that's how close he was dead exploding didn't open the envelope the right way\n[laughter] so\nHave you seen the bombs that were sent yesterday there can be seen pictures of him not\nSee a kind of like quick shots of um yeah\nUm I think we only have that one picture I'm asking you I thought I was in the front of drugs are used to be on the front drudge can maybe if I didn't show Derek\nIt said ... it's it's a picture with\nIt I I guess you would think if you were trying to have you ever try a tortilla trip to things always get stuck in my throat ...\nIn the next thirty minutes after I eat it all means I'm always coughing after eight almonds because of all I'm In my throat like twenty minutes later\nAnd tortilla chips could be an allergy I just don't I don't think I should have\nLike a little piece get stuck in my back my tooth yeah wondering if it comes to those kind of not following it right\nYeah but I noticed you are also the ... a kind of a weird either how because you don't you don't even you don't get on a I've never seen you eat and drink at the same times\nNow a weird thing I ... it personally I maybe that's right on the water you can wash it down you know\nYeah I mean that's right that's what I'm missing but those two things I Need to watch them definitely noted I never have to the edge of the\nSt Louis\nFreeh fall unbelievable wow\nDon't usually tortilla chips\nThere were some and all and they're\nAble to go with a tortilla chips awesome and I says oh honey salsa I should just thing honey and junior honey yeah yeah yeah I was gonna say [laughter] guys checked a so you would think if you were trying to inflict damage with a bomb\nYeah yeah I was gonna say [laughter] guys checked\nA for you and say if you were trying to inflict damage with a bomb in a package you you think you would hide\nThe fact that it's a bomb [laughter] so the ... with a bomb that was sent to CNN it's an a manila envelope baggage thing and the bomb is literally twice the size of the envelope of envelope is six inches long the bomb is twelve inches long\nI don't\nLike half of it was literally sticking out of the package and it's a metal pipe with wires attached to it I Know that it has a fake ISIS sticker\nOn the type of fake flag so so what do you mean by fake or have you seen this have you guys doing diamond so there's a little flat sticker on the side of it but instead of Arabic saying whatever the ISIS flights as an Arabic it's scribbles\nAnd you know those mud flaps with the two women who are sitting back to back yes that's incorporated in the fake ISIS flag or the two civil what women and then underneath it in like an Arabic script it says get her done [laughter]\nSo we have a Larry the cable guy inspired ISIS flag sticker on the pipe bomb\nAnd this is this is the whole thing [laughter] so let me go to this is a this is Tom sour is it a few observations\nFrom a former bomb disposal officer that is me first proper pipe bombs don't have wires connected to both ends that's dumb\nTo you can find time or is there a remote control receivers way smaller than whatever that white boxes a proper timer would best be stored inside the pipe making it fully calculated the thing is just silly looking bottom line whoever made that wanted it to be painfully obvious to anyone and everyone that it is they bomb\nThis is nearly the same as a bundle of road flares wrapped together with an old time the alarm clock ticking away\n\nAnd he says hoax devices are far more common than real ones in which case we should ask ourselves with the motives of the quote bomber are and who benefits go ahead and thinking deeply and critically that's what he wrote\nAlso send mail bombs to people who have an open to their own mail in decades getting Hillary Clinton's open up all male ... ... ... goes to the mailbox\nPicks up the veil or it's way too complicated because a lot more to the story but I I have a hunch that we're never going to get to the truth because\nIt will have completed its goal of making all conservatives would be murderers\nAnd that mission has been accomplished coming up at two o'clock or I got maybe a dozen or so stories a lot like this one obviously this one's yet to be determined I could be could be it could be a super Trump supporter conservative wants to kill Democrats do there could be about a dozen or so stories of\nThings like this that turned out to be the exact opposite but not we didn't find the truth\nUntil a couple of days after the left in the media pounced and blamed all Republicans and Sarah pale and and\nAnd uh and George W. Bush and explosive rhetoric and all the rest and again mission was accomplished before the truth finally came out one hundred seven sixty chaos MB money under seven sixty five three sixty are coming up next we have some serious on air yard sale issues to take care of\nThose we should do that next so honor yard sale this is a were finishing up our fourth week we have our final grand finale week\nTomorrow or I don't know what time do we have to guess tomorrow\n[laughter] guess bumper shall we have any estimate identity yesterday at one time to get rid of all I Do have they don't want to not get rid of all [laughter] no top bulldog I forgot sorry but it's not a good thing to say well come on Erik Larson prudential made a ... a wire started they mean to\nBe a insensitive there thank you\nPick one out of seven sixty K.

over\nA and every time well let's just get right to it so read a brand and his here she's from New Orleans community so new commuters is the San Diego master plan company is that right away ... like a master planned community developer so I live in one of these I didn't know that until I met read a couple of minutes ago a forest ranch\nSo they want to build another one them off of the Fifteen till you're north of us can do in San Marcos a couple of miles north a deer springs road and there's a little plot of land right there and they want to build two thousand one hundred dollars on at a school side and all this other stuff\nUm and the golden door ... which is on deer springs road there trying to stop him\nSo let's go to Carl first Carl how are you ... you're on the phone with a Rita\nFaye Rita yeah um\nI I I live across the street from you guys I'm I'm Indian does uh-huh\nAnd as you probably know we get a large traffic already from school the door\nAnd from Lawrence Welk and we have our ah to lean over pass on that freeway\nSo my question to you as are you guys who cared to improve that or you just kind of blame that on Caltrans and let us all suffer with even more and more and more traffic with no accountability on your\nAre called don't hang up and he's going to put you on hold\nCarl thanks to that question I'm as if you followed me on the air you know that I'm a we have some some significant traffic improvements that we will be doing on your springs road ah one of our mitigation measures is to expand their springs road to four lanes and have bike lanes on both sides and an eight foot paths way on the north side\nBut in addition one of our mitigation measures that we are required to go through the process of Caltrans to recon figure those on and off ramps and to the extent that that requires because we have a four lane road four lanes on that bridge then we'll be required to do that\nOr ... what do you think of that so you're going to pick up the tab for that\nWe are going to pick up the tab for that so much between fifty and sixty million dollars between deer springs road and uh the Fifteen interchange improvements and\nSo I just tell them what one last question they're going to happen before or after the the ah project completed\nIt will it will happen before we build I think it's a hundred and three hundred and thirty homes will have to have that done that means that both if you don't work\nBill you'll and you'll ... she asked me well that's good news\nNow that's only going to be good news is if those of you who live out there I Know when a master springs road is at twenty eight feet a and no no pull over lanes and no bike lanes if if if we can hear the support 'em especially at this thing goes to about twenty twenty\nNow let me ask this question how long have you lived in ... medals\nTwenty one year along with it no matter how long they've been around ... he made meadows was delayed like take you to take care of the two guys started\nSo if the people living off of hidden meadows\nPrior to Nineteen sixty two did not want hid in meadows to be built what would you do\nA ... ... no actually it was okay because it was the middle of nowhere\n[laughter] what what is it I mean what does that mean right ... well what is your employer I Fifteen actually\nStop it your springs wrote back in Nineteen Seventy two would stop there okay\nThere was no ice Fifteen there so we're talking about you know caveman days almost\nWas new to him I don't agree with the point\nThat it will be developed at some point whether they're in Sierra ... whoever it is that's terrific but please please what is the infrastructure ...\nWell it sounds like they will but I think you get my bra appreciate the call and I ... I think you get my point right if someone called in and I didn't sixty one to a radio show and wouldn't let him know medals get built then you wouldn't be living in ... medals right now and everything that is true for every single person\nWho's anti development dollars that you are built in at some point out of golden door next door who didn't want traffic to go up a but luckily they did build it otherwise you wouldn't be living there and it's always my point and for whatever reason a number residents let's go to Peter in San Diego it's grown up here on the phone with a new in Sierra\nAnd Rita\nI'm that Eric just said okay go ahead Dr ...\nI'm ... I'm Out there I live out of what a great girl for twenty five years and I'm a contract her contractor built while California so I'm not against develop it uh I just\nWanted to make sure that it's going to be developed in the in the proper equipment and the proper way now I did just hear her say that it would be a four lane road which is sorely needed that road officer Cal State San Marcus though [noise]\nThe traffic right now back down without valley wrote down a road and lower on interstate Fifteen [noise] their\nExit or their community is right where the rapid air state fifty that\nThat that's a that's why I used to have\nThat number of vehicles leaving community at the same time that twenty thousand students are trying to get to Cal State San Marcos\nOkay so the concern is it's too close to the highway\nGot it that's one reason why will be working with Caltrans to reconsider that on and off ramp a so that the industry and you know the main entry exit for the project can have the right flow around there and once we get and Pete you're totally right today that that they're springs road\nThe and you know the main entry exit for the project\nCan have the right flow around there and once we get and Pete you're totally right today that that they're springs road in the morning and in the in the afternoon or basically used as an east west route to get to the Fifteen primarily going north so we got a lot of folks who are living outside of our community outside of our county\nEither commuting into work or comedians or go to college um so yes we will be doing the expansion of springs road all the way into a San Marcos ... valley road and making it much safer higher capacity\nRight sounds mythic building next to the highway would be the best place to build houses\n[noise] well it's it's certainly a major transit court or a with most of the traffic um from our project going in that direction will also have a a west entry exit I'm to the project main exit to the project that would do more to the west versus coming to the east or the south\nI've got a hockey stick around me to learn more phone calls so he was probably don't want to enter seven sixty KF MB one hundred seven sixty five three six to the website again new in Sierra dot com okay I Will take some more questions duct one hundred seven sixty KF and being jump shot about what a way of coming up and had like\nThat's a whore that's affordable for the county right\nWell and the only way he can really do that is what I said a minute ago if you've got enough of a density in a in a project snap scale if you if you go to the fifty unit I'm fifty unit subdivisions you're not going to be able to absorb that the prices of the infrastructure\nWhich safety home to see her home is being built on a ... ... what do you think about that ...\nI mean I I used to live down the street from camp and being one of the luxury apartment\nComplexes and it was Twenty one hundred bucks a month\nFor a closet of a one bedroom and that's why I'm afraid of\nEvery time I hear the words upscale and trendy and moderate it to me that just saying hey we're going to go to the courthouse in the late ... and we're going to charge well over market value but if they're going to be affordable housing I'm all for it I go like I said I support the free market\nBased on bridges on a ... rose who's been hanging on very patiently rose how are you on the phone with Rita from New in Sierra\nHi Lita Hi Mike listen I'm very concerned about the uh the the building that's being done that only in the area that you're talking about but I Know that the overall plan\nOf the city planners is to build thousands and thousands of more homes in San Diego and we already have a water available ... veil ability problem whether or not you want to believe it but\nWe're asked to reserve and all back and we get asked all the time when we use when they think they we we use more water than we really do so where's the water's going to come from\nRosa ... question read or what are we are\nWell roast 'em knowing the or is located in the ... district I don't know if you know that area of the unincorporated county and um every uh every water district by state law has to do what's called the water supply assessment right look at what your plan is\nA and they ... a third party wise say this is how much water on these two thousand one hundred homes will take how much have we been planning for long term because each water district looks at the general plans\nAppoint the jurisdictions whether it be the counties or the cities they serve how much do they see and their long term planning for their general plans so what what balancing this water district does as other districts do is they do long range plan and say I need X amount of water if X amount of homes or commercials going to be built so what else he was water district\nDid their assessment new ones they're an art project would take fifty percent less water than what's currently in the general plan as as a as designated that two million square feet and Ninety nine large lot luxury home\nAs they were looking around to the future and is it okay so here's what could be built here yup there's what's legal to be built here\nAnd the water's going to take you guys are coming in and saying okay we are going to build a year and it's going to require fifty percent less water than what you were already planning for\nYou know not what we were planning for but what was in the general plan designated in the water district yeah was planning for correct or potentially correct a rose really think about that answer\nI guess and it it gets a little confused about why any planning is authorized at all\nWhether it's a luxury you know executive homes built on a couple of acres or the [noise] see I just want no more no more homes built [noise]\nThey don't then a couple of acres or the [noise]\nThat would just want no more no more homes built [noise]\n[noise] I don't think that we have to sit and consider if we have this horrible you know scorched earth end of the world we don't have enough water even for the citizens that we do have or\nWe we've got to build a you know half a million units of housing between now and twenty thirty or whatever the\nCity I mean I Would argue that the problem is not housing or people voted Sacramento not getting enough water infrastructure down here I just as a manmade problem and I I don't think we need to punish all of us and new potential residents are because of the failures of Sacramento which could result\nWe are being punished\nBy the people who would be living in these communities are being punished by of you say we can't let anyone else in the same argument rose I'll long you been in San Diego\nPlenty as sort of Twenty years ago was that a lot of water rose\nDon't live here I Wish they would have more on us to tell you the truth because when we moved in here\nAnd there was a woman mayor Susan ... or something like that and there was a ... a quarterly PBS fundraiser and she ran this\nWonderful documentary and said you know what you see is what you get in in San Diego county because what what what's green spaces and remain green space then what is known for\nResidential and commercial is going to remain that and they're not going to be any more building because we love our community and the way it is we love our cities\nAway it is not that was true or not they did you'd be the last house that would be dealt\nWith the ... I I I just I I Love the the the\nThe areas that were [noise] the the areas that were known for um just to be green and to be for wildlife and to be a lot of his own for nature walk than\nThan I Am not a good job it was a robbery and maybe you can make that point about how did you you own this much land right and you guys are only building on what percentage of yeah\nOne of the things I think it's important that gets lost sometimes is that a project slide developments like new ones Sarah oftentimes will conserve significant amounts of open space and when they face concern of the one thousand nine hundred and eighty five acres\nWhere our site is new will and will preserve in perpetuity twelve hundred and Ninety eight percent that\nWill ... will provide the conservancy or the county whoever decides they want to manage it will provide them in the damage and doing it for ... to a neighbor I'm doing ... no one can come in well no not necessarily because we worked with the county of San Diego to provide trails public trials through this concerned open space\nA very specific targeted trail so that the general public whether you live\nAnd I mean could anyone coming here to do more I don't know it is it's part of the mitigation of the project that we we contribute twelve hundred acres for that I just\nGot his my argument would be you can either take bets and be like okay you guys are developing what percentage of that twenty five percent of land you or\nYou know these guys because no one has all been open space a couple of years later someone comes in and developed all of it and gives you do I say you are you take this that's my arguing a ...\nA chair roots in fall Brooke Gehring how are you sir\nI'm doing pretty good how you doing it out of the way to make about this\nWell you know if it's a little bit injunction not only looked voltage start founding fathers are one of the things that we have to take a look at real seriously\nI grew up in growing it where it was called Eighteen thousand people and I don't know if you've been Ninety One hundred and eighty thousand plus the maintenance of infrastructure cost more over the long term and agriculture one of the cost of trails potential lawsuit\nOr someone they think that a kid is thrilled to the republic wealth and goes out their trips and break cycle who's paying for it not developer bought the general public shore tax rate increase\nOur property taxes increased it if not development that often issue with the\nMouse Dempsey housing and the lack of planning and we should have something more structured mouse dumped me downtown sprawled out from there to medium dance to be an out uh\nOn corporate area ball broke a Dali center a port asking do you know it shouldn't be mowed down the drain minimum two acre lot that sort of thing uh but again the the cost of this long term we're going to be able to bird not develop I did I go and read them\nWell I'm not sure how to speak to that but I Do know that your springs road as an example when you talk about infrastructure uh ... uh the county has had that road on their county mobility element\nThat is a very long term plans on improvements to major rose they've had that on there came a Billy element for twenty some years but it hasn't been funded\nAll the while more and more traffic coming you know coming down I Fifteen and using their springs road as a cut through to San Marcos or to further west so my only counter that is we\nActually do pay our fair share we actually pay beyond our fair share we're uh we're when new and Sarah moves forward we will be providing a four lane road\nThat is currently in the counties word plan to have accomplished over the last Twenty years most uh last one here\nLet's go to Beth Beth how are you really got about Ninety seconds that uh but I ...\nI just want to say gold darts at a neighbor for like fifty sixty years and uh so the blast in is\nReally a impact the air quality uh as far as you're talking about their strength does nothing with boy that's a major cuts through much from Fifteen to get to the Seventy Sixers avoid Seventy eight interchange yup [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mike Slater Show", "city": "San Diego", "day": "25"}
