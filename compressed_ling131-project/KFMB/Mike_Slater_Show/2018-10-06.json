good just fantastic yes it's spectacular yeah fate or rent a hot up depressed there but what's going on well\nThis is on a Thursday the house passed a GOP bill to make the new tax cuts permanent permanent permanent so we know that ah\nDecember twenty fourth of last year we get to the tax cutting JOBS Act that lower tax rates F for everybody some people that are paying more taxes because of ... but I Would say the majority of the people that we have looked at are paying a little bit less in taxes\nAs you may know this new laws which the sunset generally in two thousand twenty five and this was an attempt to make it permanent at least while the Republicans are still in control I think that's why they kind of push this through quickly sir\nSo they passed it from a vote of two hundred twenty to one Ninety One now this this is step one right by then it goes to the Senate and the Senate has fifty one Republican forty nine Democrats\nAnd this type of bill actually with most types Adele these days that it's along party lines so but we do know that there's a few Republicans that kind of can go a little either direction so I I don't know whether this will actually go to the Senate or not but\nThat's where we're at right now is making this this tax law change from last year permanent one is the definition of permanent\nThat's anyone's guess the real definition of permanent is it's it's forever until they change\nIt again yeah so to speak to him a couple of other things I think when it comes to retirement plans or they're trying to get through we talked a little bit about this a couple of weeks ago\nI mean they're coming up with another stupid Myra ... plan to get access to that you know just in case something happens at the case with all the time and again yes but there's penalties I think they're trying to make it so you can get to without penalty perhaps in certain circumstances which I think is not necessarily a great idea for\nRetirement sure because if that's really what it's for but yeah so there's a couple of companion bills that there were also passed and they they're trying to get through something called a universal savings account\nBut just allows it it's a little bit easier for people to save and to an account and and a little bit easier to withdraw without penalty from a retirement account and then there's a there trying to help small businesses out so they can write off their startup expenses which you and I were talking before the show most businesses right off anyway\nBut there is a rule that startup expenses before you actually start your business are supposed to be capitalize and written off I think over five years\nA few other notes to look into\nWith stretch I raise there could be a limitation

there's an IRA Roth IRA a simple irate step IRA\nOr a sep IRA half trying to think what else there is I got for maybe a ... inherited Iraq yeah there are six six got to be a couple of more\n[laughter] Mm did you say ... I Believe in a in a simple yeah OK okay ... no [laughter]\nAnyway let's go to the bad guy I'm Tom and I have not read these anti gave me these earlier and said Joe just make sure the ... because we're gonna be taping you\n[laughter] okay I live on the air or or what I liked it better when I I I don't know what's coming yeah I'd prefer that to okay except there's one that I answer because it's pretty technical if you read that one I'm referring referring to my email I got it All right so this is\nTom from Chantilly is that how you pronounce that yeah I guess the Chantilly BA Virginia\nSo Tommy I'm he writes him to us he goes he's not sure if this is the correct way to submitted podcasts question but here goes nothing it was my understanding with the new tax law that it does not allow you to perform a ... version\nOver to a Roth IRA and then re characterize a portion or all of it to a later date what is the best strategy of maximizing your wife conversion amount in any given year\nWith not moving yourself into the next higher tax bracket good question Tom\nI got a few different answers for you but I'm sure you've got the standard\nYeah I Do have the standard that the standard is first of all time that's correct\nAnd this is with this new tax law you can no longer we characterize that's not true for two thousand Seventeen correct so if you had a rock and version they didn't two thousand Seventeen you can re characterize all the way up to October fifteenth of two thousand Eighteen which is right around the corner so you've got a few more days to do that\nBut going forward that's a correct answer so what's the best strategy is generally we're going to help people to wait later in the year when their incomes more certain because that's right you when you direct conversion it's what we call irrevocably you can't change your mind anymore\nSo you might want to wait till November and December when you have more certainty on your income and you can calculate your tax bracket with more clarity and make sure you do the right amount is also requires that you spend a little time in November or December of trying to figure this out\n[noise] so that's what the standard of out of that that's what you got ...\nWell it depends on what your income looks like if it's W. to type income you work for an employer it's not variable you know you get a one to six percent increase the cost of living or something like that take a look at last year's tax return and then you just put it in your cost of living wages in there\nAnd then if you have any interest of the evidence or other type of income it might get a little bit more complex but if it's just a straightforward tax return here's what I Would do I would look at what line forty three says on your tax return for last year that's going to be your taxable income\nThen I'm going to look at the tax tables and I'm going to say well how much room do I have in that particular tax bracket that I Want to convert so\nThere's three different strategies I'm going to give you I'm going to say the best time to convert Alan and you know this is the beginning of the year if you know get him out if you know the amount so let's say I have twenty thousand dollars worth of ruining my tax bracket last year I might convert\nSeventeen thousand dollars yeah and I a little bit lower but I'm Still going to convert in January and so explain why is it better beginning of the year because I Want to have that time for the the dollars to grow\nYeah tax rate why not you get another year do it in January instead of\nDecember exactly let's say the market performed six percent in a year well if I'm In my Roth IRA January one all of that six percent grew in my ... starting Gen one if I waited until December will that six percent is already happened per se and so I'm only going to have that little bit of growth within the rock [noise]\nSecond way to do this is dollar cost averaging into the rough IRA so let's say you wanted to put twelve thousand dollars in the rap I write put a thousand dollars per month as a conversion into your Roth IRA\nThen you can kind of gauge things for the year yeah and just as nothing and just as necessary so as the market as volatile you're going to take advantage of better pricing as markets go down as your dollar cost averaging ... none of those routes or the lower price\nSometimes you might time it wrong prices are high it will all even out in most cases in your favor so you could do it that way just dollar cost averaging but again it does take a little bit of work\nTo look at what your line forty three was last year how much that you want to convert and then you can kind of do it slowly their\nThird ways the barbell at twenty thousand dollars is the number again I'm going to convert ten thousand dollars in January and then I'm going to wait until November to see where I fall to see you know check my W. twos or my in my pay check stubs\nAnd say okay well maybe it's not twenty thousand it's closer to Fifteen and then I Would convert the additional five at that point\nI'm trying to take advantage of the time value of money to get the money into the ... as soon as possible so there's a couple of different ways the most conservative way is to wait until the end of the year to find out exactly what your paycheck is going to be in a converted like December fifteenth\nAll right so I agree with all three of those strategies with with one cabinet\nAnd that is you can't really look at last year's live forty three 'cause the tax laws difference ... so you start there correct but then you've got to look at what's going to be different for example if you're married\nAnd you got to exemptions last year that was about a thousand dollars that's got right right so right off the bat you the last eight thousand dollars direction itemized deductions let's say you've got thirty thousand by itemized deductions last year\nAnd when you look at the new rule that says you can only detect ten thousand dollars per se taxes and property taxes you might be below the standard deduction which is twenty four thousand for a couple so maybe the last six thousand their attitude together that's fourteen thousand dollars a blessed actions you would add that to live forty three to get your current your mouth\nAnd then you've got to go to the current year tables which are a lot more generous like for married couple three hundred and Fifteen thousand dollars of tax income is the twenty four percent tax brackets last year in that income level you were probably at a thirty five percent bracket when you count at alternative minimum tax write\nI thought that was pretty that was wonderful wonderful [noise] All right we've got two minutes and I think bill's question is gonna be two minutes let's go down to David shorter ones right\nUh this is David so anything we got to find out what Davis from David from Oklahoma that sounds a lot of you made that up yeah I did OK I'm sixty one year old widower or am I able to draw survivor benefit from Social Security since I'm over age sixty indifferent taking my own Social Security until my full retirement age [noise]\nAh the answer to that David is what al\nYeah you always tests beyond my knowledge I yes of course you can't take it that there will be a potential reduction from Europe\n... ... what if you take it at sixty one\nAs a widower All right so then you take All right so you can take the widower benefit at as it as early as age sixty correct\nSo if you take it at age sixty just understand here to um that you're going to be subject to the income based on so if you make more than you know Eighteen thousand dollars um it it's not going to make sense to take it\nBut you can take the widow or widower benefits early um and then you can claim that benefits and you can switch back to your own benefit on your own record at a later date if you choose to a ... a good producer in the last year was just at ... Khan conference out onto the album that I did know about that\nAnd so she wrote a little white paper here seven business lessons everyone can use from ... Khan each team\n[noise] seven businesses or you can think of eight actually there is a bonus went in there there are eight there right there you go you want to give us the highlights\nThe highlight sure I'll just I'll go through in real quickly the first one is have specific goals ... will get into it without having you know either way you can get like three than that you can go to ... right exactly right and then not make your business about helping other people don't go into it with the plan of I'm going to get rich and famous\nLook at how it is that you're going to actually serve your customer the best and still unmet needs so they got those are the first three search out find out what your competition is doing find out what the holes are in what they're doing and make sure that you are filling those needs [noise]\nWe blew it all started this [laughter] so you have this but I Know we want to know investors would go right\nUp where can people find this Andy well all of this information actually came from some of the really great influence there isn't the podcast ... and ... and the bloggers that attended faint on which is actually where money and media meat so I went to the same with the intent of finding out how to make this podcast better and how to make a YouTube channel better and I realized that that a lot of great information for everybody not just\nThose of us any financial media world so they can go to cure financial dot com slash thin kind of Eighteen to download this and it's got some pictures that I took a picture taken with just sell sea hide from stacking Benjamin and uh so yeah it's it's a it's a\nLittle white paper that's got some some of the inspirational ideas and uh things that people can\nWell what happens then if you did do that it's like an excess contribution into the ... and you're gonna be ... percent per year that the monies in Iraq\nAnd here's the rationale behind it makes sense is that if I have a hundred thousand dollars in my retirement account might December thirty first and then let's see January first because that's where they calculate the are empty chair and they're like oh okay well no just kidding I'm going to convert fifty thousand dollars and then I'm going to calculate my arm the un fifty thousand\nWell no you got to take the distribution first then you can convert so are you are correct among do their bill you're on top of it and then the last but not least um I think you've got that one backward\nYeah you do have that one backwards so in a toiletry bad belt as pretty good that's pretty good so nowadays I mean in the past you could pay\nYour IRA I've fees to an advisor and out of your trust the cat you pay it directly from your trust to cap and get a tax deduction miscellaneous itemized deductions\nThat's gone so you can no longer take that deduction you want those fees to the extent there are fees to be taken directly out of your IRA\nYou don't want to pay per se there's no tax benefits if it's in your IRA you're reducing your eye your IRA balance which then reduces your R and D so it's important that you now have the fees come out directly the area but ... in\nEssence still when you take the fees out of the IRA it's it's a tax free meant to\nYeah it's like you pay the fees but didn't pay ...\n... my I have a two thousand dollar fee in my IRA\nAnd I'd take it out of my irate to pay the advisor it's not a taxable and Ben ...\nRight so it's almost same same and say hey I'm taking the two thousand dollars under the IRA I'm not paying tax on it versus saying All right I'm going to pay you out of my my checking account the Tonight Show and the hours and all that money that I've already had a tax on and then I'll Try to take a taxi to auction the large chains they won't allow you to do those tax yeah so so I mean don't\nDo that anymore you might have a question can you in your eye or it can you pay your your trust a cat or non retirement account ... and you cannot so just have the ... come out of the accounts that they\nBelong to [noise] okay um next one is for a Mac\n... let's get Mac ... detail and we'll get to the next thing I might see India and the question so I Know what the one is a bit of the really technical on it so it's a good one I Know we'll go to Denise\nSo we were listening to your September Eighteenth podcast regarding questions from Susan of us can veto\nWhere should I follow the Social Security are also benefits in we are unclear about your answer and perhaps others are as well come on who will be unclear so we we get a second shift so we got is that what you're saying I can clear this up [laughter]\nOkay so [noise] um Susan's original question is I Am currently sixty one of my husband is sixty to\nMy husband is planning on waiting to take his Social Security at a Seventy I worked for my self enough to receive the small amount of Social Security I'm trying to decide if it is worth of turning on my Social Security at age sixty two instead of waiting till I turned sixty six and a half [laughter]\nWhich is my normal retirement age when my husband's files at age Seventeen I Believe I can then we see is also benefits which would be a combination of my current reduce amount plus the difference between my normal retirement age in the ... mountains is correct I Know I Will receive reduction on my Social Security by started he sixty two but\nAlso part of the Social Security benefits also be reduced\nSorry this is sounding so confusing but Social Security is so confusing that's a good question I'll let you answer that you're you're better known as the sun so back to I guess what the nieces question\nSo she's asking me a bunch of questions to clarify that email that I'm Susan road Susan was dead on yes I guess the ... clarify the answer I gave it was like\nAll right if you couldn't get benefit at age sixty two yes you're going to receive a reduced benefits so if you're a benefit us let's say a thousand dollars a month and you claim your benefit at age sixty two you're going to receive seven hundred and fifty dollars that is your benefit\nBut what people get confused about it and I believe this is what the nieces confused about you have to take a look at both spouses full retirement age benefits\nSo here's my example one thousand dollars is going to be Susan's benefit her spouses benefit let's call it three thousand just to make the math simple hookah so her benefit as a thousand dollars at full retirement age but her spouse\nOr benefit would be Fifteen hundred which is half of her spouse is that we all on the same page here yeah but she claims her benefit at age sixty two so she's going to say you know what I'm going to reduce my own benefit that seven hundred and fifty dollars\nSo her benefit is going to be reduced to seven hundred and fifty dollars so then now she's looking at waiting or she's got her benefit but her husband is not claiming his benefit until eight Seventy\nYou cannot claim spousal benefits anthill your spouse claims their benefit right which is a new rule which isn't new rules so they claim they're benefit well not necessarily you could filed for your benefit than suspend them you know you had to at least file but not necessarily take them yeah and the old days yes [laughter] so now\nHe's saying this is like okay well my my husband is claiming as benefits at eight Seventy at that\nTime I'm going to be at my full retirement age\nSo here's what happens Fifteen hundred dollars is what is the spouse will benefit okay\nBut her benefits she took early at seven hundred and fifty dollars so she's not gonna received the full Fifteen hundred because she took her own benefit early they will show her up her spousal benefits is not going to be reduced\nBut what people get confused as well if it's not going to be reduced why isn't it Fifteen hundred dollars\nBecause it's too benefits you have your own benefit and then they show up this also benefit and in that situation Fifteen hundred dollars would be hurt by also said she took ... early hers is seven fifty in the short would be I don't know maybe Thirteen hundred dollars is what she would receive a as a full benefits\nWould it be as simple as taking the the ... benefit two hundred fifty dollars subtract them from the spouse all\nThe Fifteen hundred about twelve fifty give or take give or take I mean in that in that ball ... yeah that's a good gauge debt and in that ballpark and and\nThat that's what's confusing is there's two benefits right there's your benefit and the spouse will benefit and when you take years you've started years when you switch to spousal you're still there's still too benefits right\nAnd the fact that you took your ... years early reduced is that part and then there's additional benefit because the spouse of but it's not going to be the Fifteen hundred because you took years early\nI'm Denise goes on in her email and she tries to give an example but the example is flawed because it's basically stating that her benefit is actually larger than those also benefits so she would just take her own benefits to the early so you're you're done\nRight oh so you wouldn't receive us also benefit so we kind of burned up the clock on that one hopefully that'll as clear as much if you have questions on that uh Kobe go at a local number\nUp we'll be

'bout\nThat stock market [laughter]\nHow do how to keep a volatile stock market from wiping out your retirement\nThey'll get a ride the way about writing that have that's catchy a ... um so are we were in like ... today uh I didn't get the memo I so I don't think so um so we're going to get into a couple of different things is that the stock market has\nThere's ... in the stock market rate normal yes right but the ... there's confusion with how people are investing I Believe\nIn there could be a sense of some one of the biggest biases is what I'm over confidence sure Kay especially after a long bull market along bull market\nAnd then when you look at let's say your overall portfolio might you might if if you were doing things correctly if you were balanced if you had money in the U.S stocks if you had money in international stocks emerging markets in some bonds and your globally diversified\nAnd we believe that that is a very good way to manage ... ... ...\nI don't want to be in any concentrated position I don't necessarily want to be in any concentrated area or sector of the overall markets I Want to have broad vacation across several different classes\nAnd it's a it's a strategy that really helps you maintain and keep what you have and then grow it in a conservative\nManner absolutely but if you look at your portfolio Alan and if it was invested that way and if I looked at my portfolio right in let's say I just invested in the U.S and the five hundred race\nAnd then I looked at my year to date overall returns and I looked at your overall rates of return I Would probably say you know what I'm a better invested than you yeah because of this year you would have done better right\nAnd I think that's a real problem with individual investors right is that they're chasing returns or the look and say oh this is a really good strategy I got to continue to go down this path\nEven now they're they're they're just continuing to ride this wave up without any really downside protection yeah and it and because I might be a ... percent of your ... your up what two\nYeah let's call it too and however if we had this discussion in two thousand and then fast

or well God comes your money and what's not calm [noise]\nWe're talking a little bit about market volatility um we haven't seen a ton of market volatility I think we've been complacent in complacency is really no\nI mean it's kind of a double edged sword you want to be somewhat complacent kinda outta sight outta mind don't be day trading your overall fun yeah I agree with that um but on the other side you have to realize and take a look at All right well what is your portfolio Jillian what are you only in what are your goals what rate of return or you're trying to achieve\nBecause there could be some over confidence that hey you've just been lucky that you've been in the markets over the last eight nine ten years\nUm and maybe been highly concentrated in us growth companies that have performed quite well over the last ten years but he ... Elena here to tell you that's not the norm is not going to continue to happen that way\nSo windy diversify out I don't I Would say now today I'm I'm not saying that the market's gonna crash what I'm saying is that you need to invest your money appropriately today given what your goals and time frames are and I think setting up that portfolio appropriately\nReally determines on that back in ... yeah I think\nSo and we'll get to that on one second but but here's here's a common situation that we see someone will have sat down at one point or another and they'll decide just as an hypothetical example I went to sixty percent stocks and forty percent bonds and they did that ten years ago when whenever the that doesn't really matter\nAnd so then the stock market has done rather well over the last several years and so now when you look at that your portfolio it's Seventy five percent stocks or eighty percent stocks because they've done a lot better than bonds which by the way is is what's supposed to happen\nBut now you're gonna retire next year you got Seventy five eighty percent in the stock market you're taking on a whole lot of risk\nAnd that's what we're talking about is rebalancing getting back to whatever that right allocation is for you and and plus the the allocation that may change if you're a circumstance change like if you're going to be retiring maybe a different allocation might make more sense for you suggest let's talk a little bit about how you kind of figure that out\nWhat a figure out how to portfolio how much money seven socks versus ... yeah I mean what what are some of the steps I think it's it's going to be different for everyone it really depends on the man of the portfolio and what the they're they're trying to accomplish but let's say in your example since you have to throw it out there this person's going to retire let's say next year re that's our avatar\nAccidents [laughter] that's a big word I notice him for ... got to think that I watched the movie [laughter] I Know and yeah it's a big blue person there is yeah it is and the yes yes so with Fox there's\nGot to tell\n'em All right they have 'em so they're they're they're they're looking at ...\n... ... as they're looking at this really good advice [laughter] what are the book the avatar A L referred holy\nBook it's alright you look at what is the demand of the overall portfolio they're looking to retire hypothetically in yeah one year so what does that mean you say how much money do you want to spend what is your goal okay I Want to spend Seventy five thousand bucks okay now we're getting so we're All right\nSo you start there then you look at All right well it next year they're going to be any fixed income coming into the household like Social Security pensions real estate income part time work whatever what do we got 'em if it's zero All right well then you would constructed portfolio certain way but let's say fifty thousand dollars coming into the ... the household\nSo for fixed income picks them up so I I only need twenty thousand for my portfolio\nTwenty twenty five thousand dollars a must tax okay plus you know then you have to take in consideration of cost of living okay so if I were that individual will twenty five thousand dollars you can do a simple rule of a ... percent rule just their first figure out how much money that they needed the portfolio center\nSo if I go four percent you divide that are multiplied twenty five thousand by twenty five that would be how much do\nYou start out a lot of numbers the twenty thousand that you need multiplies I only five thousand now you said I said Seventy five dollars in income of ... average twenty twenty five thousand at times twenty five\nOkay how much is going to try the that's easier like six hundred and twenty five thousand centered ... twenty five six fifty so they are right and it's totally fine is going to the flow math therefore [noise]\nSix hundred and sixty five there you go All right I think it'll be twenty thousand then I could easily say five hundred now we gotta make it will challenge it looks\nSo it's so see what you're saying is if I Need twenty five thousand for my portfolio should probably have about at least six hundred twenty five thousand to work\nWith I Need that as a nest egg roughly roughly depending on your age but that's the four percent ... that are keeping score and that's that's not a hard and fast rule that is to just give me an idea here in the ballpark [laughter] so\nIf I Need six hundred and twenty five thousand dollars as a nest egg then the next question is well how much money should be in stocks versus bonds yeah All right\nWhat what what I ... I assume and we have six twenty five\nYears now just assume you have six twenty five if you don't have six twenty five then you're not going to be able to do this maybe need to work another yes do or three or five or somewhere else are you going to be in a garbage can live from the earlier segment [noise] All right so in that case I wouldn't want at least ten years of fairly safe investments\nOkay so I Need twenty five grand per year ten times that is to fifty so I've so you're saying I Want to at least two hundred fifty thousand dollars in bonds or cash or something that's really um that's that's safe\nYes because in the reason for that and it depends on now in ... depend on risk tolerance yeah if you want to go a little bit more than that or if you want to go a little bit less than that but ten percent or ten years I think it's a really good rule of thumb share\nBecause if you look at the history of the markets iffy Orwell globally diversify over at ten year time period\nThe probability of you losing any money is very very low Cher sell over that ten year time period I'm not seeing stocks can't go down for ... years we saw that and the great recession the the last decade race but if you had a globally diversified with some real estate commodities international stocks emerging markets stocks well actually you did okay sure\nSo because the markets are volatile I Want to have a safe haven to grab from yeah so it markets go down ten twenty thirty percent I have this fixed income then I can draw from so I'll be I'll be taking an interest in principle from that to ship\nYeah and that's a good point I think this is where people get confused but my fixed income and it's only paying me a thousand a year how can I take twenty five that we actually taking some principle laugh and you're doing that you're taking it from those safe balance you you you're letting your stocks recover what you're\nDoing and if stocks are up there maybe I don't touch the bonds I'm living off of the evidence of the stocks that maybe I might be rebalancing and selling some of the stocks to give me ... Mac\nThe other side I I'm not necessarily just living on dividends I'm also selling some positions to pull out the twenty five thousand so so depending upon how the market's doing is going to depend upon where I take those those funds from so if I ...\nFrom so if I buy two hundred and fifty thousand is six twenty five what does that that could be probably a sixty forty split yesterday thirty five\nSix revive ... pretty close to that to have you with us or it says ... sixty four they close to that right so in that example forty percent of my ... my my portfolio would be unsafe income yeah and then sixty percent will be subject to risk yeah yeah\nIn silver that ten year time period I'm going to look in this is where I guess there's art and science to share any income\nAnd there's a lot of different opinions on how to do it\nHow we feel is that we want to take a total return approach right in saying some years you're going to grab income from stocks some years you're going to grab income from bonds\nDepending on the market and then more importantly I think you need it before you even get there you need a tax strategy to figure out where this twenty five thousand dollar coming from right is it coming from Iraq is coming from my retirement account is it coming from I taxable account\nAnd then I can manipulate my tax situation a little bit and I can take on even less risk because I'm less money's going out to to to pay I the the Iraq so it's not as simple as well you're sixty years old take your age mine is a hundred and ...\nYou know it's your portfolio stupid I don't do that you look at what is your knees what are your once what are you trying to accomplish because some years it's going to be higher some years it's going to be lower depending on what your circumstances are second you have to look at your tax situation where's your money out and how much money you have an ... versus non Robert ... right\nThen you look at All right well what's your fixed income and what's the demand for the portfolio then from there you can start constructing the portfolio in the simplest way to start\nIs right there that so much when I went in stocks that so much money on one bonds and then you start splitting up the the the pizza pie from different areas of the country and different types of stuff\nYeah I agree with that and and so if you have more than six twenty five then you kind of have a choice you can take a little more risk that extra money or you can go state you may not need to take risk\nSo it'll be safer or maybe one to take more risk because you're that type of person or maybe you're doing it for your kids or for charity so it depends really upon your own feelings if he got less than six twenty five we would tell you you're kind of in a dangerous now so you probably out of work more to to save that level\nYou can generally can't borrow against it and that's one of the reasons why people like real estate you don't have to put all your own money and you put a ten twenty percent thirty percent down payment and you get the bank do the rest and so you stretch your investment capital that's how you make money in real estate you can't do that inside inside an IRA\nThen all of the um all the income\nIs it's not as tax deferred but if you would have had it outside you had depreciation it probably would have been tax free anyway if you sell the property inside the IRA no big deal but you could sell it outside of the IRA do ten thirty one exchange no problem\nRight if you pass away and I want a piece of real estate against to step up and basis the next generation gets to ah get that assets Filipino taxing your IRA no step up\nYour kids when they get that money out fully taxable at Seventy and a half you have to take a required minimum distribution how do you do that if you have a property you can't just like take a board off the wall and say okay this is my are indeed it has to be cash so you're gonna have to sell the property inside a oh it's just there's so\nThere's going to be a lot of cash within the IRA as well as ... make it work as well as you got a million dollar IRA and then maybe you have a two hundred thousand dollar property in the house and I was liquid\nAnd then there's there's problems with you can't really do the maintenance herself because that's a that's a related party a shape prohibited transactions ... there's just there's almost no reason I could imagine wiped\nThe only reason someone who want to do it as they they are so just trusting of capital markets and they would invest either cast shore in real estate I guess maybe that person [noise]\nAnd we know who you are [laughter] really oh yeah [laughter] oh we get a lot of a real estate investor so we do\nCome through well and we would get because we talk real estate and I think it's important because real estate is a part of your finances that we should talk about [noise] I just felt like it inside\nOf an IRA no me neither [laughter] yeah I remember oh eight\nAnd we were doing these tax workshops\nAnd we would get several questions of like hey I got an Iranian my ... I got an IRA and my real estate I Am almost on the verge of [laughter] getting a little bottom you did you did did you forget your Wheaties I did something yeah\nUm how's your back is a better look back is better than if you look at it as your your day you were limping I Know I pulled her hand me sleepy I don't know how [laughter]\nHow old are you know I don't worry about what goes on in your bedroom I don't know what had happened I was watching\nAnd watching a movie I fell asleep and then halfway through it was like I couldn't live my leg\nThat's the story you tell your mom yes that is the story I'm telling my um ... ... s that is so that is exactly what happened and um [noise]\nSpeaking of do you have a list or something you talk about it I Do get tired of volatility some I'm done with this whole thing\nOkay I got a four\nFor retirement planning mistakes you probably don't realize you're making ... fifth you agree or disagree with the first one is relying too heavily on Social Security\n[noise] I agree I don't do that [laughter] that's the commentary [laughter]\nWell here's here's the problem is is for most people Social Security is probably somewhere between twenty five maybe forty percent of your income so you're going to have a huge pay cut if that's all you've got other words if you're used to spending every penny from your paycheck you don't have any savings and you're hoping Social Security will kick in\nYou're going to have a whole different lifestyle Social Security is there to keep you out of poverty\n... I mean and you still may be in poverty actually depending upon the level doesn't come in one article you read correct yeah so anyway let's say the certain check you agree with that I agree with that second one is assuming you're living costs will drop drastically [noise]\nNo I don't agree with that at all because in a lot of cases it actually goes up there I mean there's some people for sure that they're living expenses are going to go down without question yeah but that's a personal question that brings ... it's just that yeah but this\n... this is in the negative these are mistakes that you may be making assuming you're living costs will drop dramatically and and the answers yeah that's true because in many cases they don't drop dramatically and you're right the key is is your own savings fixed income\nWhat we find is those that have saved tend to spend more in retirement if they if they're able to you and they ... they based their retirement on Seventy percent of their spending and it's completely false and then at other cases people don't have any money in their their expenses are going to have to drop there is no\nChoice and I'm going to see the exact opposite of what you just said again because there are a lot of individuals out there that have saved a ton of money that are scared to death to spend anything of it\nSo I have found that the really good savers are awful spenders\nThat they spend less even though they could spend a lot more things that they're just that's how they were wired yeah that's why they had a lot of money out because they don't spend that good advice to aggregate that\nWe've seen people coming in here too that have maybe a hundred and fifty thousand dollars and they're spending a hundred grand a year that's correct we've seen that and it's like one of the second to last very long with their feathers\nThere's different degrees so there's that extreme saver I totally agree with that they're they're not they're going to spend\nProbably what they're spending which is nothing in the first place but those that are are are decent but not the best of savers those the ones that will tend to spend more because they've got the time and they feel like they've got the resources so I guess a rule of thumb that a lot of financial planners say take your your um spending\nAnd takes Seventy to eighty percent of it that's not necessarily the\nCase and that came from All right you're not going to pay FICA tax write so that seven percent right there then you're not going to probably spend money on clothes for work I'm now in doesn't do that anyway so [laughter] you know like with the gas so and we got a couple of more here\nYeah do you have to take a rag no I'm going to keep this thing going okay the third one is that not taking advantage of ketchup\nContribution who ... what does that mean [noise]\nUm that means there's ketchup and mustard and I got you got to a point when can't blame you can put more than the Eighteen five and you can put in a little bit more if you're over fifty same with your rank and put them a little bit more so it's just that catch a provision [laughter]\nI think a lot of times people want to do the catch it but the the Portland K plan doesn't tell them that yeah they said they don't they for no cause they\nYeah a lot of times we'll see people in their fifties and we asked how much you're putting in the ... the maximum and we look at their situation so the maximum if you're under fifty is Eighteen thousand five hundred and two thousand Eighteen and the catch up as another six thousand bucks\nAnd what's interesting is you can tell you you're four one K. company in many cases you want to do the maximum but you also have to tell them you want to be the maximum catch up it's a whole separate thing in many cases that actually happened to me when I turn first turned fifty it's like wait a minute I thought it was supposed to have more than that I realized oh no you have to have to tell me onto the catch up\nAlso deaf and then the last is don't forget about taxes and people forget about taxes all the time they do\nAnd we that's why we talk about it on the show and that's why we encourage you are in in many circumstances to think about Ross conversions taking money out of IRAs\nConverting it to a ... a yes you will pay that one time tax on the dollars in the um that

and see if that makes sense to me I was reading an article by a guy naturally was video\nA that was sent to me as an advertisement and the guy was supposedly an expert at goal city okay and I say supposedly because\nFirst of all the guy looked like a gigantic fat human being with fuzzy beard he didn't look professional all he didn't look like she could be what he was claiming to be said he was a personal coach any business coach\nAnd you know he had just been about goal setting now as I get into this I don't want you to get up in the fact that the call and this guy a really disgusting

some more conventional wisdom that you bring the man on a mission to retire American one person at a\nJob on the welcome\nBack to do on the radio show in the first segment we are\nTalking about goal setting in about a a video that I watch today or by some guy that just doesn't look like he's what he thinks he is a which is a personal and business coach because he's saying things like uh don't set unrealistic goals don't set to many goals less is more\nFocused important and always talking about is how to get across town for my my job today I mean this is unrealistic is what the world is all about\nYou had been given a set realistic goals from your childhood don't do this don't do that they'll play in the street and get hit by a car all this messaging you've gotten your entire life leads to a life of quiet desperation think about the lives that were told during our entire life don't play in the street\nSo you tell your kids don't play in the street and what are you done\nYou've taken away their ability to get anywhere because now they're afraid of the street when the truth of the matter is you walk out in the street you can play it at all you want as long as you looked you left to look to your right because cars only come from two directions and you watch for big noisy things coming at you then you can play in the street all you want\nWell the same thing is to take your money and put it in four one K. and put it I re because it's safe and you but what you've done as you've taken away the vehicle you've taken away the vehicle to ... to where you want to be in life to be wealthy successful financially you can't put your money in a four one K. and an IRA\nSo you've been told your whole life to do these moderately\nEasy things so you go through life you go through college because if you don't have a college degree ... could a good job so then you go and you get a good job now you're working and and you're saving ten percent of what you are in the five percent of what you earn whatever now you go out there and you find yourself a spouse\nAnd you get married and now you have to go out there by yourself house\nThis expected of using now go and spend your money on the house and the car now your card house broke and then you get yourself a baby and then you get two babies and three babies now you have a baby broke and then you're raising these kids in your life is miserable you get up every day you go to work and he was suffering you have a miserable life you come home and\nAfter the boss gave you crap all day long you come home\nThe kids give you a crap and your wife gives you crap and tells you got to do all the stuff you don't want to do and you're tired and you're busy worn out but you can't do any of it and you know your kids loved you until they get to be about fourteen after that\nThe older they get the dumber you get so you have all these things going on your life to make life miserable but every day you got to get up and morning go and try for an hour to get to work and then work all day long and drive for an hour back\nAnd all this time your money's already know money you're developing no savings or not get any closer to being retired and you realize you have to do this for the rest of your life and then it happens\nRight if you're just you're you're almost nervous breakdowns at this point what you do is you need somebody to love you 'cause nobody else was loving you and so you get yourself a dog and the dog loves you when you come home you got somebody loves you problem is you got to pick up its Kurds in the backyard\nSo he's ... crap everyday to now now you get more people give them the crap and you do this for\nThirty or forty or fifty years then you get to the end and you go I did it a couple of ...\nWhat I set out to accomplish I did what the plan was to do I got the kids through college they're outta college\nWe're empty nesters don't really know my wife anymore we really don't have any type of relation anymore but we'll we'll get it back into it back now when she's so old that I don't even really want to look at it and I'm so out of shape that I really can't do anything if I did\nAnd you know we'll get back we'll try to live sixty five years or like the next five to ten years\nOf our elderly lives\nExcept for one problem we don't have enough money to do that so I'm gonna have to continue to work part time\nOr or if we do have the money retired just barely enough and we will not be able to travel the world because we don't have enough money to travel the world we're just going to have to live frugally and go to dinner at four o'clock every day to get seniors discount right that's life\nAnd that was a well late plan that was a serious set of goals that you had for your life\nBut there are mediocre what\nGood is to set goals that are mediocre this guy is so crazy so out of it that he's teaching the same lies everybody else in life teachers which is less is more don't set unrealistic goals\nWow\nAnd by the way don't set more than one goal right like\nShouldn't have a goal that by the time and during my entire Thirty years working I could stay physically fit that I could create and maintain great relations with my spouse that I have a great set relations with my children\nThose goals are too many you can't have them all you got to get that money that you can retire with you've got to get that forty years work under your belt you got to have that big house\nBecome house poor you need two or three cars eat for college degrees little Billy can't even read or write and he's going to college because that's the goals that were set up yes my friends you have a set of goals\nAnd there will be they are realistic but boy you really want him\nJust because you can be wimpy doesn't mean you have to be wimpy or that you should be wimpy\nYes we all have the capacity to live a mediocre life a life of quiet desperation we all have that capacity but does that mean we have to use that capacity does that mean we need to live down to society's standards\nI don't think so\nI firmly believe that you need to shoot for the stars you've got to go for something big hey I'd rather go for something big and not get their missed the stars and hit the moon than to go for something moderate that I can achieve\nYour way better All right\nSo to do that we go back to the questions you have to ask the right questions how do I retire in five years not in thirty five or forty or fifty years you have to have a timetable and it has to be an unrealistic one\nAnd that's what people do when they called the last ... I'm going to retire in five years or less\nYou have to say I want to retire making more\nTaking home more cash than I take home from my job I don't want to retire because I'm living poor no I understand that I make a hundred thousand dollars a year but I only take sixty thousand dollars a year home\nThat's all it takes on that's what I live on after taxes and my four one K. contribution and everything else that comes out of my check so what am I going to do I'm going to take home sixty five thousand dollars a year of tax free income and keep it all\nThat water one sixty five thousand dollars with because I Want to do better than what I did at my job I took on sixty now want to take um sixty bucks\nSo I've got these financial goals but at the very same time I'm accomplishing these goals of the next five years I Want to lose twenty five pounds and I want to keep it off\nAnd I don't want to do something I don't enjoy to do it so I'm not going to doing starvation diet or joined up for what are you stupid diet programs\nI'm going to learn to eat the moderate way that I should to not only lose the weight but to maintain that while eating foods I enjoy now that's a good goal I'm going to learn to work out in a way that keeps me fit\nBut in a way that I can enjoy so I can maintain for the rest of my life I'm going to work in one or two date nights a week with my wife I don't care that we're so busy with our kids one night a week somebody's going to babysit those kids are going to go to my kids games\nOne and five percent return on their network\nAnd that's because they employed this capital to do something\nRight now the problem is some they might even be making deals and make a hundred percent return on a real estate deal but that hundred percent than is divided out across\nEight hundred thousand dollars with a network than it doesn't really mean anything because it's a very small percentage so they have lowered this return even though they're out there doing stuff that's very successful investments\nBut they lowered the rate of return of those investments by having too much actually\nSo the number one thing that kills an investor is dead equity that's money sitting there doing nothing what are the worst culprits the worst culprits are your personal residents your four one K. and your IRA now I Know you think that you've got\nFour hundred thousand your IRA or your four one K. I'm Sorry you don't because you have to give up half of it to take it out even if you wait until you're six fifty nine and a half you still have to pay your income tax rate on that money to get it out\nSo you don't have what you think in there so it's really kind of delusional you you're thinking wow this things making me money but it isn't\nBecause you never got it if you don't get the money you aren't earning the money this is something you have to understand in Chile you earn money and get it where you can spend it you have an ... say well it's on a piece of paper called my four oh one K. and I see that numbers on that piece of paper getting one\nFor getting larger sure and they will in 'til the day they don't and that day they might go backwards on you so you can't say well I was up to five hundred thousand down down to three hundred thousand so but I made the two hundred ... know you never made the two hundred thousand guys\nThat's the problem you're not seeing it for what it really is\nYou've got to get that personal residents which you got four hundred thousand dollars you first of all of your life savings in that house what is it are you nothing\nDo you still have to pay taxes you pay off their mortgage but do you still have to pay the taxes yes you still have to pay the insurance she asked you still have to pay for maintenance and repair yes you still have to pay them you know get to spend time and money to ... whatever that maintenance I guess all\nOf that stuff but you haven't earned a dime by paying it off none if you get sued\nAnd it's not your personal residents say it's a rental property they can take it away from you\nIt's just the thought of paying off the house is so common\nYet so ignorant in every way shape and form there's absolutely nothing logical about paying off your personal residence\nOther than this and this is the one logical one and that is you've got so much money cash to invest that you can make the income that you want to make the money you have liquid\nAnd not need the money in the house but if you cannot make with the cash you have available to you enough income to retire and live the way you want then that money sitting in your house is killing you know let's talk about guys on the radio the other day he bought nine houses over four years\nAnd turn around and look back and say wow they're all good deals ... we did really well in each one of them but for years later he's got eight hundred thousand dollars of equity\nEight hundred thousand sitting there let's do some math let me get up the trustee for here let's do some back just to show you what I mean\nEric you're making four thousand a month or a thousand times twelve making forty thousand year divided by eight hundred thousand dollars of equity\nHe's making six percent return to see what I mean\nNow what did he invested in those houses he probably invested less than twenty five thousand house will say twenty grand house times\nNine was come up with that number just show you the difference what he thinks he's earning or what most people think they're already twenty thousand times nine\nHundred and eighty thousand dollars now take the the um four thousand times twelve forty eight thousand a year divided by a hundred and eighty thousand\n\nAnd he thinks he's making twenty six point six percent return the numbers he's calculated and and the numbers he shared with us was that kind of return in the twenties high twenty returns\nHe thinks she's making twenty six percent return but in reality he's making six percent return on his family's network his network in those houses eight hundred thousand bucks\nHe thinks it's a hundred and eighty because he's not counting all the dead equity it's just like it's not even there just like you're paying for all that money is not even\nThere it's just kind of thinking guys that keep you for what I Want you to do\nFirst of all I Want you to figure out if you want to make any money become rich and retire early that's the first step but if you do then what do we need to do that we need to get on top of where your money's going to come from to invest\nOr do we have enough to work to start with without doing anything he just got money laying around we'll do that that if not where's the next easiest place to get the money that cost is the least to go get the money\nAnd we'll take a look at those options maybe it's ... for all and K maybe it's liquidate four one K. maybe it's a liquid that your IRA maybe it's refinance and cash out refinance your house\nYou got rental properties maybe refinance and political without a maybe it's time to sell them and move on to something larger like an apartment complex those are the kinds of decisions we have to make about your financial position before you even start making a move\nBecause if you start small and collect pebbles you're going to end up with a bucket full of pedals and you're never going to own a rock\nIf you want to own a rock you got to figure out how to go buy a rock and that rock may mean you have to trade in all your bubbles remember monopoly for greenhouses and then turn it over to a hotel and then three hotels yeah

pretty simple you save money to the point that you saved twenty five times the amount of money that it costs to live in one year\nAnd once you hit that target whether it's in your thirties forties fifties sixties or never\nThat's when you know you have enough money built up for the lifestyle you've grown accustomed to that you can afford to live and definitely on the money you've saved\nAnd it I Know that it's an oversimplification but it really is that simple as soon as he went on to say the power that you need at least five or six million really you might need ten million dollars\nTo retire securely and respectfully I strongly disagree with what Suzie said there are people who easily\nCan get by for the rest of their lives when they hit the point they've saved a million dollars it means they're living a\nNot a a barebones lifestyle but they're living more careful frugal lifestyle because what you want to see one enough money saved\nThat you have invested that you can throw off enough cash to live on each year and at the same time have the piled a stash you built up\nHave enough in it that you can earn enough on it in the years following to cover the cost of inflation but let's go to a core principle\nIf somebody is a Mac saver\nOr today a proponent of the FIRE movement and they save like a maniac and they get to a point\nYou know let's say in their mid thirties that they've saved enough money that they've created real financial security it doesn't mean they don't ever work again it means they only do what they enjoy\nYou know I retired at thirty one and here I Am working now talking to you at sixty three\nAnd since I was thirty one I've only worked when I wanted to and doing what I enjoy because I had that financial security when I was thirty one\nSo don't let somebody tells you oh you're never going to be able to retire 'til you have twenty million dollars [laughter]\n[laughter] oh boy anyway though that you have to have a goal you have to have a target you have to be realistic about it and you have to live your life in a way that you will accomplish that you know one of the things when a ... years ago\nMy book living large and lean times came out and then the companion book that came out later living large for the long haul as I learned so much from people\nWho had adjusted their lives to live a more frugal life and to be in a position where they weren't living on borrowed money where they were always saving money and I was inspired by so many people and so many stories\nOf people that I talked to who did change the direction of their lives and how they were living and created that independence and freedom in their lives so I don't want anybody tell you you can't do it it's up to you if it's important to you\nAnd it's just gotta be something that you don't say you actually do\nJohn joins us on the Clark Howard show Hi John\n[noise] good afternoon Clark's how're you doing better thank you\nSo John you got a question for me about your kids how old are your kids\nI've got three uh sixteen sixteen and Seventeen\n[noise] did you say sixteen sixteen and Seventeen\nAnd teen I did\nThat's a lot of kids all lumped together at one man\n[noise] that the opposite from uh South Korea and ended up pregnant with a in vitro twins boy girl so\nYou're now wow ugly empty nest to three kids and a blank\nBlank wow\nAll right how can I be of help to you because that's a lot for you to deal with\nIt is but thank you for your service been listening for years and I love your program and what you do it for the community uh three children I'm\nMoving from home schooling environment to a an elevated home schooling uh environment where they're now needing access to mobile laptops I Know you're a huge fan of the chrome book\nUh done some research have great great things about them I just don't know\nHow well they will perform and if they're designed for um a more traditional setting where I'm going to be using excel power point spreadsheets things of that nature\nUm under the additives you have\nTo be a connected to the Internet on the chrome book and I just wanted to get your opinion on that\nRight so schools have been adopting the chrome book is their computer of choice in massive numbers and the ... now completely dominate the educational environment there are still a particularly in the private school environment where\nThey're using Mac books but overall the chrome book dominates not totally but gosh it's moving that direction and Google\nHas a suite of\nPrograms that are similar many of them in nature to the Microsoft sweet you were referring to and\nFor the educational environment those are generally free and they can be used not just on a chrome book at home they can be used on any computer anywhere even if it's not a crime but so\nThat's why the schools have been adopting that they don't have to I have a an IT department or anything like that since everything on them is Web base and you're right that to make up chrome book useful you have to have an Internet connection for most everything you would do on it\nSo it ... it would be a good question to ask going from a home school environment to one that is a more traditional classroom to find out if the school they're going to be attending is a chrome book school\n[noise] okay that's a perfect point Clark or to follow that quick like um tell me about\nThe ... books ability to function and disconnected state meaning stand alone or not having access\nTo the Internet by yes okay they used to be a\nComplete door stop that if you didn't have Internet it was basically a worthless piece of furniture taking up space when it didn't have Internet connection\nNow there are a handful of functions you can do off line but then once you go on line they the items are then stored in the cloud\nAnd that's why a number of chrome books now have more storage on them but if someone has intermittent or rare Internet access or chrome book is not going to make it particularly happy\nOkay All right well thank you for the price and\nThe good news with windows computers is they've suffered so much\nBy comparison the chrome books that windows computers that are nicely featured are widely available at a hundred and fifty dollars and up now which is a big change from where windows pricing used to be\nGary's with us on the Clark Howard show hello

is different from what you normally hear on financial planning shows largely because our concepts are different\nMost brokers based or financial planning on something called modern portfolio theory this theory basically divides up your money and put it into different investment categories another word for this is diversification\nThe process of diversification is supposed to minimize your loss is if the market drops one thing that's rarely talk about is that it also limits your games when the market goes up we have a better idea what if you could participate in some of the market gains without participating in any of the market losses\nFor the fun of it let's assume you live in a modern home up to date with current building codes don't smoke therefore can't fall asleep in your bed

retirement specialist working with clients rate here and ask a needle California have you ever seen the movie cliffhanger was Sylvester Stallone [noise]\nI was just watching the movie the other night and it had the usual act and you might expect from us alone action flick\nWhat really struck me was the opening scene\nI had forgotten how intense it was such loans character was helping this female climber I Can't remember the name of the actress but she was sliding across the rope from one cliff to another cliff winner harness became an buckled and uh as as she fell out of the harness still own did\nYou know he slid across the rope and grabbed her hand right well we've all seen that I got you move in a lot of movies and it's a cliche\nUm but but not in this movie instead of rescuing the girl there's a pro long sequence where her hand begins to slip out are still owns grip finger by finger the whole time she's screaming I don't want to die I don't want to die\nThe backdrop behind her looks to be over a mile down to the valley floor\nIf you haven't seen the movie before you're sitting there waiting for her to grab her what it is the other hand are somehow save the day\nBut this movie catches you off guard unlike the typical Hollywood happy ending her hand slipped all the way out she falls well maintaining I contact with still own all the way her horrifying scream and the look on her face as she falls really got my blood pressure going\nI'm no actor but I Do say people from falling and I suspect many people listening to this program right now our clients of mine and they know exactly what I'm Talking about one likes to loan nobody's ever slipped out of my hands\nNot a single one of my clients who's ever had their retirement fall off a cliff following my advice with protected financial products\nThe stock market losses\nI bet some of you wish for retirement wasn't at risk of being dropped off a cliff at all for that reason alone now would be a good time to give me a call\nHow about a guarantee of your income account growing at a rate of somewhere around six to seven percent depending on the current rates when you call for the purpose of receiving a guaranteed lifetime income how about the guarantee that your principal and returns will never decreased due to stock market Los ...\nIf you'd like to learn more or give me a call ask for my retirement income kit uh let me talk with you and you don't see if we can be helpful my number\nIs eight for for three three seven to three three that's eight four four three eight three seven to three three\nThere are no stock market cliffs with my income planning so what did you get to lose just give me a call\nI Know some people are afraid of heights and some are not regardless what I can guarantee you is that everyone is afraid of heights if they're falling without a parachute\nI think the same is true when it comes to people's retirement and risk some people are afraid of risk and some people are not so they say but everyone is afraid when the market crashes I've seen clients with the same look on their faces the actress falling in the movie\nThey're not usually screaming but sometimes they are crying they always look at me with eyes to save save me\nI save my clients from a lot of things sometimes I saved them from having all their money exposed to market risk\nSometimes I saved them from high fees that are eating up all their returns\nOther times I'm saving them from having NO PLAN or a bad plan that uh brokers put together with no consideration for guaranteed income or the protection of their principal if it doesn't matter if my clients screaming crying or looking like they're about to pass out when the bottom drops\nAt that time everyone goes into a state of despair I can save my clients even while they're falling but what I really wish that they would call me before they start to fall\nYou can call me now or any any day of the week for my retirement and income kit uh everything your broker doesn't want you to know about protected financial products give me a call at eight for for\nThree three seven to three three that aid for for three three seven to

we can all imagine the feeling of falling in how helpless that feels imagine spending your entire life climbing to the top of mountain it takes blood sweat tears discipline and hard work to get you the top the retirement mountain where the view is breathtaking\nFinally it's time to sit down and relax enjoy the view everything your hard work and ... and brought you\nUnfortunately on top of the mountain they're all kinds of wrists you have no control over\nWhat if the mountain you climb decides to no longer be a dormant volcano for example what if Iraq from above\nBut if Iraq from above rolls down the hill and knock you off the mountain of bad weather roles in unexpected and then you get lost her exposure drains away your life or your phrase when the stock market is up the view as great a sense of euphoria sets in and it seems like nothing can go wrong\nBut just like being on top of that mountain there's many things that can go wrong and very few of them can be recognized in time to save yourself maybe it'll be fraudulent market activity we saw that not so long ago\nI don't think I've seen more articles on how the stock market as reading that I have recently maybe it'll be the act of terrorism or political instability goodness knows we understand that we certainly have plenty of that going around\nCould be another popping bubble nobody's expecting despite the obvious signs of the tech housing another bubble markets it always seems like people don't realize the bubble was popped until it was too late what I'm getting at is that you don't have to live this way what's the point of feeling good about retirement that's built on a house of cards\nWhy not protect all the effort it took to build your retirement we guaranteed results that are not subject to market risk\nThere is a better way to live that allows you to enjoy your retirement without the financial risk of the markets and the chance that you could be pushed over the edge of a cliff\nYou save up your money hoping it grows and then at the point you decided to retire you started drawing income from those accounts how much do you draw three percent four percent or ... or the amount you need and hope for the best the problem with this plan is that your hypothetical grows\nHis combined with an arbitrary spend down of your retirement accounts you have no idea of the plan is going to work\nBecause you don't know how long you're going to live if you die sooner than you thought you spent two little\nIf you live longer than you thought you'd probably run out of money before you die in order for this plan to have any chance of success you need to plan on dying by a certain age that's why we call it a plan for death do you want to plan on dying or plan on living\nIn a second I'm
