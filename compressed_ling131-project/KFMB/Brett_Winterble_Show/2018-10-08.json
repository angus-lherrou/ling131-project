I can understand why given that in two thousand Seventeen they had what one thousand two hundred and Seventy percent that's actually and then I wouldn't be surprised if they're already bankrupt ...\nLike I said I Can't find much information on the ... stock price and looking back I [noise]\nThe articles from back in two thousand eleven on Google I'm just not make much sense here that I did\nA couple of this again for a year ago October two thousand Seventeen the debt was nine hundred and sixty five million [noise] the equity is only Seventy four million that that was the climbing quickly I'm not so got kind of surprising on it but uh again do their shopping stores give those great bargains but do not ...\nThey were saying that Dollar General in dollar tree are doing great but there are much smaller footprint stores I've noticed there like a quarter sized\nAnd I think if you go back I Want to say five six years this company was doing very well um so that's why you gotta be careful and that's why every Monday we'll look at the numbers on our companies read those reports because of business can do fine and then you wake up to three or four years later like hey what happened you know so we want to read\nThat money wise article 'cause they had like Fifteen company some of the ones that we've already talked about that you know you talked about on the shoulder are in danger but there was some surprising ones in there too\nBut we'll see what it's called money wise right yeah I don't think it was that it okay thank you very much I Would want to buy All right that over the phone line one eight hundred seven six zero\nK.

E. or this might be they they might've had some write offs or something and I said they had a ... but I showed no P. E. four big fiber last twelve months again could have been due to write offs may be a present they do have a positive P. E.\nIndustry average oh about thirty one\nPrice the sales point one one well below the industry at point nine at big positive price ... book very well point six to ... the industry average of twenty nine points for shows are getting sixty two cents on dollar for those technical aspects of the company\nThat some very real estate or something like that it's really a positive if you're a shareholder\nCurrent price of gas or six point seven four below the industry average of eleven point to excuse me I choke 'cause there's just the mind boggling a dividend yield eleven point seven four percent Gees\nIndustry hours point nine eight or again they don't have any orange or last twelve months Sullivan payout ratio is not material I Do believe that as do accounting not due to business operations because they kind of get a sneak peek at the earnings estimates\nI'm also if you look at sales growth is down five percent over last twelve months I don't like to see that in earnings grow down one hundred and Thirteen point seven percent forgot to understand what happened with the counting their\nThe current ratio to point to some company has lots of liquids I Will point out however that quick ratio is just point to two\nShows that a lot of those current assets are held in inventory which is not nearly as liquid\nKnow it's funny you bring that up I just looked at that I was going to balance sheet three hundred and forty five forty six million dollars and they've been tore those are those assets\nWhich could be concerning because if they can't pay their current bills are going to need to do a fire sale to look at him and tore which means that that in tore will not be as much as it is listed as on\nThe balance sheet for not convert to cash that same way\nA return on Capitol again nothing there since uh no positive earnings return on equity again nothing there because earnings are negative\nA profit margin for last financial information is negative point three one percent receive will turn over eighty one point eight cells are collecting on the receivables quite nicely an inventory turnover is two point oh one which again could be problematic with all that in the story on the balance sheet\nYou and I looked at the uh uh estimates hearing again they close at five dollars eleven cents on friday the hype for the year is a nine Seventy five below four sixty five\nUnfortunately now only one analyst falls is company and that's very concerning because they can be kind of pump the soccer dumped the stock and try to shore to who knows but ah they he does say that uh could be like as well come December two thousand Nineteen looking for earnings up fifty cents\nSo at a multiple Fifteen ... you're probably looking at a stock price around and say eight dollars a share a above we're currently are the five dollars eleven but they're just to Maine natives here and this is where you got to understand the numbers and that's why I tell people that say oh I can do what you guys do I'll just run through the numbers of the you know seven fifty eight dollars I'll I'll I'll buy it you've\nGot to understand those numbers and and the time has come I believed to sell this business because they do have a major uphill battle here and I liked the I like going in their stores I got some good things there\nBut it's just talk with the previous caller that this could be on that bankruptcy less because they've got a lot of debt or they've got most of the assets or an image or a they\nDidn't have much cash I think I saw like two million dollars in cash and that's a promise liquidity with companies if they can't pay the bills that can be forced into bankruptcy so they make a moderate Dorian but I just am not thrilled I could I used to like it I got I got to say yeah in a big thing to\nGo to understand that accounting and what's going on with you know those earnings and why were those those big breakdowns for that company I mean that that evidence juicy but I I just don't want to drink the Kool Aid I guess until I Know more about it\nAnd this and this shows another business that ... that is what you gotta watch us up because things can change it other than you might have been investment it just means that things change in the business didn't work out the way you want\nAnd it was work out the way you want to and you got to get out of that as I was doing it just a question mark yeah that question my dad so I just looked down at the clock at age ... and thank you for calling okay refined excellent I provide our rights are yes it is a

disturbing\nIt involves a monopoly ticket\nSeller in the United states ticket master I Know they're not completely a monopoly just close but wait till you hear the allegations from insiders may have been published recently the ticket master is playing dirty pool with your wallet [noise]\n\nJust a moment [noise]\n\nI have always despised ticket master\nBecause you go to buy a ticket to something and there's this outrageous fee added to it and if you're not aware how that all came about ticket master a very cleverly but very diabolical he\nWent to promoters and Venus around the country and offered them\nPretty much whatever they wanted to become the exclusive seller of tickets\nAnd hit a point of critical mass where when you wanted to buy tickets to most anything in the United states you have to go through the ticket master monopoly and with the added on has no relationship at all to the cost of the infrastructure\nIs all a basically a monopoly passed through and it's why I despise monopoly so much and you think that would be enough\nFor ticket master to rake off out of your wallet but there's a long form story in Rolling Stone you may have heard about ... insiders\n... ticket master have\nSpill the beans that ticket master has a system operating where they manipulate the sale of tickets to get them into the hands of their own scalpers\nSo that they're making money both on the fees up front bend the fees when the tickets are resold plus the profits now ticket master denies it we'll see what goes on with that but I Want to tell you the whole system is rotten\nWe're getting ... and it stinks\nAnd when there's a time that I can go to a box office and buy tickets directed not pay the fee I Do that but there are times I Will not go to an event because I Will not pay the ticket master rip off the\nThe good news for you and me is that a lot of events don't sell out anymore that used to people or so distracted there's so much going on in our lives sports events\nSports events or even if they are nominally a sellout they're\nSoft sell out there are so many empty seats at sports events now you can buy tickets if you're willing to at the last minute often for much less\nThan you would pay if you just gotta gotta gotta be there in addition if you're willing to say like I Do and the crummy seats\nYou're going to find that you're going to pay for so many events now less\nThan face you will get an incredible deal waiting and not being choosy you'll save a whole lot of money you're listening to the cars how his show [noise]\n\nMessaging data

to let you take a master's degree courses on line before even applying to a degree program like an MBA from the University of Illinois or a master of computer science from Arizona State university\nWere which brings us to the most interesting to me of what's happening with the second tier and that's what we're rising is doing with visible at\nHow much a month for I'm forty dollars a month now and that's rising them a little bit of plants are Seventy five to Ninety five dollars a month so visible is only forty dollars a month and taxes and fees included again\nOnly for iPhones right now they say they're going to bring availability for androids but only for iPhones for arises name as not anywhere to be found\nAround visible they don't want anybody to know that it's not it is that is that it's their network and so it's at forty the one guy show with their forty a month\nIs that these speeds but you'll have when you're on high speed data will not be as fast as they are on parent ...\nThat is true ah and I've been reading some accounts and people on line they say that it hasn't been too much of an issue for them they are still able to watch Youtube videos without suffering and still able to get around the Internet pretty quickly\nBut there is that is a a compromise with this plan and also with some of the other ones you might be slowed down a little bit see one I read through the fine print to know that\nYou are paying less but you may be getting a little bit slower service\nAnd the biggest difference between the horizon visible and cricket and a metro buy T Mobile and the boost is how many stores as the invisible and all they really are invisible there is no stores it's all done through an app\nThat's right you download the app you'd sign up for the service there you pay through that everything and that's really much more how cell phone service of done elsewhere in the world without a relying on a big network or stores or cricket\nIs suddenly a ATM fees second tier brand has now been exposed that they weren't up to the standards of the others so they made some changes\nYeah uh what cricket did cricket has to unlimited plans and there really hasn't been much of a change to the cheaper one\nIt does restrict your speeds and that's a compromise that I think a lot of people might not be comfortable with but it's a really great pie price point a fifty dollars a month for one line but for for lines it's a hundred dollars a month so that's still a really good deal and it was you know drunk sees itself it's all included are now they're\nMore expensive plan they used to have a limitation on speed as well but that's now been removed so four fifty five dollars a month with auto pay you're getting really fast unlimited plan on Eighteen T's network\nAnd the reason it's fifty five is there is a grudge match of hate\nBetween ATM fee and John ledger the guy from the mobile bay hate each other Eighteenth he tried to have him arrested in Las Vegas a few years ago at CBS they I mean it is like a blood feud like Hatfield McCoys so\nTeen mobile came out with the metro buy T Mobile it's sixty so than cricket said well we're going to go fifty five exactly so the competition is great and you've got all this explain were charts and all that\nYou've got it all laid out so all the all these plans you can read side by side and\nAnd then you can go and also compare them to the big four force plans to see is saving that extra twenty dollars a month or so is going to be worth it for you and you can deal with some of the the gotcha has that come with all of these unlimited plant\nAnd now we moved to a marketplace where there are now three tiers of service\nThere is the second tier companies we've talked about and now there's a third tier of ultra cheap companies that come with a lot of things you've got to be willing to live with and we have those laid out for you at Clark dot com as well with those plans starting at as little as ten dollars a month\nFor bona fide real cell phone service with\nI'm not a huge amount of data but\nSome data yeah well thank you and I appreciate how you stay on top of this because is there ever a week that goes by that cell phone right plans don't change\nNo they're changing multiple times a week and we're staying on top of it all the time clock dot com thank you very much\nJohn joins us on the Clark Howard show Hi John\nThat color [laughter] how're you doing I talked to you great to have you\nBeen doing well I'm an avid listener and glad to be on um had a question for you though which is it seems like you're favoring one of your children are vanguard you continue to call them the the lowest cost provider the low cost provider um\nWell actually I Am I have favorite children\n[laughter] and so it's hard to pick you know it's like a parent's arrest yeah you got you got these these four kids which choice really your favorite why don't have any favors zero [laughter] now you're you're doing that to me with investing so tell me who it is you feel like I'm dissing\nFidelity you've mentioned on your show they have to you know widely diversified funds mutual funds that have come out there's a ton of really low cost no transaction fee each yes\nI'm no minimum ... minimum wage to start um they've really kind of blazed the trail of lowest cost in my opinion\nYeah zeroes there is such a brilliant marketing campaign around the fatalities zeroes which have no commission and no ongoing fees that they absorb all the fees\nI think this is absolutely great what fidelity is done fidelity let me tell you why this came about ... had found itself steadily losing market share\nTo a nachos fan guard but also to the bigger player out there that most of us in the United states don't pay a lot of attention to black rock\nAnd so the two of them were taking all the market share their was out there\nSo fidelity coming up with the new product development zero has set down a marker that no one can say they're not the cheapest because obviously fidelity at no cost is offering a better deal than anybody else\nAnd so they have the total stock market index which is thousands of U.S companies\nAll in one investment that no fees at all and then the international index fund which just thousands of international stocks oh free so\nA fidelity is in the game solid you know what else they've done\nWhich\nSo fidelity used to have relatively high cost target retirement funds\nAnd now they have two flavors up them they of an extremely low cost series of\nA target retirement funds and then they have their old when that still has very high costs will not high costs but a higher than a low cost companies should be offering\nSo they have become much more aggressive on the front and so do you invest with fidelity and you wonder why always talking about vanguard or were you trying to figure between the two\nTo five invested with ... and just kind of comparing costs and I also kind of was invested in their ecosystem thirty two percent cash back card\nGood for you explain that because a lot of people don't know that fidelity offers one of the two best credit cards in America\nAre they two percent cash back on every every purchase he runs through I think it's underwritten by a separate bank but you get two percent cash back deposited into any of your ability account\nSo that he has managed to account or they're going to be an IRA right or a college savings plans exactly yeah so\nSo you want to know why do I always talk vanguard vanguard vanguard when Fidel what he's doing all this good stuff\nExactly on a number of calls it seemed like people were you know asking which way to go and you kind of lean towards telling them vanguard and I was just struck by that\nYeah and so uh I should not be offending\nFinality 'cause they do a great job a Schwab does a great job I mean these companies are huge companies and they've all become lower cost but vanguard really set\nThe pattern and set the tone and took the market share and that's why they are the ones that created the pressure in the marketplace for lower costs\nAnd maybe that's a sentimental thing\nBut I ... you're probably right I should be talking about that fidelity is well now offers a series of ultra cheap choices for investing\nThanks for bringing it to my attention you're listening to the Clark Howard show\n[noise]\n\nShe's in the midst of [laughter] [noise]\nDetails here thirty five years strong we had the experience to do it right and we would love

no matter who is going to vote\nHow what was going to happen [noise] I just\nI just I I look at this and to watch the hand wringing that's going on and and admittedly most of it Ninety percent of it is from the activists class\nThe other ten percent is from the let's get on the bandwagon and be upset about something this week class or your viewpoint on MSNBC everybody's just upset\nAnd it was a joy to behold I watch it from the moment they gambled out the moment that my parents got about a of of of that session are calling the vote\nAnd announcing that Brett Kavanaugh was now a Supreme Court justice of the United states of America he's not going to be impeached he's not going to be removed from the court\nThat's not going to happen because what people forget is shore the Supreme Court is is subject to the same sort of impeachment proceedings as a president is ... and and as as a member of the Senate can be expelled and all that kind of Oh yes absolutely but if you think for a minute\nThat anybody sitting on the bench is going to allow in twenty Eighteen a judge to be removed from the Supreme Court that is the most dangerous precedent imaginable\nWere get us is setting aside the fact that you need to you still have the numbers in the Senate to do it you would set such a bad press in such a horrible precedent but but there are these people and the stories that are out there\nThat are just a Larry's here here's one for you okay this is over an axiom and this is a website I don't take all that seriously but I use it as a barometer sort of is a really what it is a

socialism\nCommunism it all ends up at the same thing prison camps armed guards keeping people hostage and the system fact\nByron York with a great observation didn't Jean mayor Ronan Farrow and Michael ... give Trump is biggest victory yet I say yes they did a lack of contemporaneous evidence was always the greatest weaknesses Christine Blasey Ford\nBiggest victory yet I say yes they did\nA lack of contemporaneous evidence was always the greatest weaknesses Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that at a high school party in Nineteen eighty two thirty six years ago when she was Fifteen a drunk and Seventeen year old Brett Kavanaugh forester onto a bad guy joined dresser and when she tried to scream covered a mouth with his hand\nBut the second biggest weakness in Ford story was that it did not appear to fit into any pattern there were no other allegations that Kavanaugh had done anything similar to anyone else\nAnd that'll tore us hash tag ... on the past year which all involved powerful adult men like Harvey Weinstein Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose and not adolescence like the cabin uh Nineteen eighty to demand abused a number of women it was not something he did once and then stopped\nBut at the case of Kavanaugh forged alone along that is until two stars of the New Yorker Ronan Farrow who wrote the key expos day of the meat to scandal and Jane Mayer\nWho was attacking Republicans Supreme Court nominees when federal was in grade school published a story of Deborah Ramirez Ramirez claimed that some time during the Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty four academic year Yale when she and Kevin our Eighteen year old freshman\nThere was a small dorm room party which Ramirez drunk on the floor foggy and slurring her words remember Kavanaugh exposing himself to her\nShe admitted there were gaps in her memory because of the drinking suggested as recently a few weeks earlier she barely remember the alleged incidents if at all and it was only after six days of carefully assessing her memories consulting with our attorney that she recovered enough recollections to come forward\nAnd to that Michael ... whose hours of appearances on CNN MSNBC bashing the president touting his client porn star Stormy Daniels gave him a following among\nThe resistance that exposure also served as a base\nFrom which ... now exploring a democratic run for president but shortly after the New Yorker story broke he came forward with a new client named Julie sweat Nick who said that in Nineteen eighty one and Nineteen eighty two when Kevin was sixteen and Seventeen she became aware of efforts by Kavanaugh to spike the punch and house parties\nShe attended she also witnessed efforts by Canada and mark judge and others to cause girls to become an ... and disoriented so that they could be gang raped in aside room or bedroom by a bunch of boys you know the allegation by now\n\nByron York notes that I agree with him the ... sweat next story represented the moment when the anti Kavanaugh forces jumped the shark\nThe allegation was off the scale serious who knew Brett Kavanaugh was a high school Bill Cosby but sweating it produced no witnesses to the events
