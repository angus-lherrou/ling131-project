F. M. B.\nThat's one eight hundred seven six zero five three six to will chase we've got uh some of the things have been coming out to next week's of big week for earnings are what we've seen so far and things have they been actually pretty darn good\nAt I live in a looking pretty strong in the in the financial came out they look fantastic um you know that ... interest mark and has been expanding um the loans are still maintaining themselves I mean that's kind of one of the concerns about banks says you rise and frustration too quickly while I was kind of a catch twenty two because the banks are making more money on an interest spread\nLess people are barring because interest rates are going up\nDid he rise interest rates to quickly while it's kind of a catch twenty two because the banks are making more money on an interest spread\nLess people or barring because interest rates are going up so there's kind of that fine line between you want interest rates to be high for banks but not too hot right so we're kind of ... I still think in a in a very clean area for those banks where they can still make money and grow over the next few years because I think the loan demand will still be strong real strong economy\nSo you know financial reporter quite well\nAnd that's from other companies have done well airlines or another one that I have looked to be doing well so far this quarter\nYeah ... and a lot of companies doing very well and one thing we encourage people to look at is that they may miss the estimate by penny or to a bone you look at how they did\nYear over year I'm just kind of going to you know some coming earnings coming out and just on Tuesday a light like shove mc Donald's of three am\nArise and caterpillar all these companies\nAre well above what they are in last year\nAnd as your business goes that's what you want to have the you may miss the estimate for whatever reason by a penny or to uh the guidance is one thing we talked about as well because they're not kind of ... you know what's gonna happen would be\nInterest rates or what's gonna happen would be trade a talk so we ... we always mention here [noise] um so they might be a little bit conservative on the guidance\nBut still look at how that business is doing and again always come back to what are you paying for those earnings\nI was just going to say I agree that it's good to see her earnings up you want to make sure you're not paying for those earnings going as Netflix you know they they were put in a great quarter right mhm\nI think the earnings are up you know I Want to say something like a hundred percent but the ... or in eighty nine cents for the court I mean I still not that much money\nAnd the thing he looked at with Netflix and uh it's pretty crazy I mean they had subscriber growth which is what that stock seems to trade on his just subscribe regrets it doesn't matter what the earnings are doesn't matter the sales are than an hour cash flow as it's just how how the subscribers to right and that's the sole thing that company's trading on\nBased off of what I see because I mean if you look at their cash flow I mean we we we took a look this the other day I mean it it's just ridiculous\nThey're free cash vote for the last quarter\nNegative ... negative not positive native eight hundred and fifty nine million dollars and sound funny we put a chart out on our show from you if you want to see that again or go to our Facebook page\nTheir cash flow is going down and their stock prices going up to the castle is getting more and more negative and their stock prices going higher and higher ... it just doesn't make any sense and I just pulled up their capital for a year to date\nSo we get free ... cat from operations and capital expenditures that's about a negative one point five eight billion dollars that they burned so far this year and ... it doesn't sound like a very good business in my opinion\nYeah and what they had them because they talk about the earnings and what they have done is they've actually change the way they advertise for the earnings as opposed\nTo a and and the shows they do it really stretch it over ten years so the earnings that their expenses are much lower so therefore their earnings higher but to really understand that you look at the cash for like you said the cash was negative\nAnd I'm just looking at their their debt to actually right now it's a hundred and sixty six versus one twenty four for the industry so again we keep talking about the debt\nAnd they keep borrowing money to make more money ... and I also wanted to and I think we looked at this before that is out talking about worldwide\nYou know getting more people overseas and so forth [noise] they're not getting the same price that they get here in the U.S I mean people in India are not paying twelve dollars a month for Netflix but they just they don't talk about that they just talk about all we got six million more subscribers you're not looking what you're getting foe subscribers\nAnd the concern I have as well as I don't understand and you know we don't know own Netflix we don't know the ins and outs of the ... the numbers don't look good so it's not worth our time is I don't understand how they\nConvert the language barrier and the cultural burial barrier because I mean shows here in the United states are different from shows and you know India I mean you're not going to have the same type of a lower to the same type of content so I don't know how they adjust for that if they have to pay more for content\nIn other areas of the world to kind of fit into that that culture\nAnd if that's the case I mean that's again going to burn cash flow and the thing that I was concerned about with Netflix and their cash cash burn is it's not like a airline when their capital expenditure is a big plane\nYou buy that plane that's a big burden for you know one year right\nContent you have to keep relevant all the time and since they don't get big box office hit\nThey're going to have to continue to burn castle on content forever mhm\nSo I think they'd have to have every personal all subscribe to Netflix before the cash for positive I mean that's a course a hyper ... but it it's you know kind of a just a thought that I mean how many subscribers they have to get to match that cash flow that they're burning on content it just doesn't add up and mathematically\nYeah and and again I talk about right raising the prices and so forth [noise] I I just don't think they're getting that and also we we've talked about uh sharing or do we do that posts yet we were we talked about it to where how many people are actually sharing the Amazon primes the Netflix's and so forth so that when they talk about all these people doing it\nWell a lot of them kind of sharing with two or three other people so they're not getting as many subscribers so I think\nThe amount subscribers that they show is the amount of paid subscribers but I mean that limits the pool of how many more people are going to buy yeah because it's I Know my mom and dad have it are my brother has it\nSo you're just share it as a family or even friends are funny to\nThe article it talks about even there's a one night stand that happened the guy came over and uh put his Netflix password and the the the woman kept it on there never saw her check it out as fast so you know you never know where the uh the Netflix password they're going to come from their shared out there like like crazy\nAnd he just got to be careful as high flyers and stuff and uh\nUh that's what people get birds I get to a motion too excited about things and again I I think Netflix a lot of people like I mean you can see a lot different things it's streaming how great that is\nBut you gotta look at what you pay for that business and also to the debt of the business which keeps rising and rising and eventually I talked about this many times before I called the house of cards we keep building building an everything's okay but it gets weaker and weaker as they build it and eventually at the whole thing caves and\nAnd and and Netflix will be around for for many many years to come but the stock price is not justified for its paying\nThat and I'm curious when the debt maturity or because I mean if they don't have cash for I'm guessing they have long term debt I I'm not sure how much of the short term um but if you know that that's ten years out I mean I don't think they'd be at risk of falling bankruptcy for about ten\nYears so I mean they they could have you know this debt go on for many years but ten years down the road they could hit the big problem watch like crap we don't have the cash flow to pay off the debt right worn a big big problem now especially content or a\nCompetition coming on as well\nAnd they do have been pulled up but their debt to equity a hundred sixty six point for that is a long term debt belong to that's more than it was only a year or longer so it could be two or three two or three or note\nThat could be coming up so you got to dig deeper to understand that so ...

[noise]\nToday's car courageous moment I have an update for you on the Facebook data breach and what you need to know the Facebook data breach numbers have been all over the place so wait is released from Facebook\nReduce now this is the reduced number of people whose information has been compromised in different ways on Facebook is now down to thirty million\nBats progress forget the last estimate was fifty million but that tells you how difficult the forensic research is following a data breach as companies scramble and a data researchers security\nResearch is following a data breach\nAs companies scramble and a data researchers security experts try to drill down into who's affected and how they're affected\nThe other part of this is not the good news the good news was the fifty to thirty the really bad news is what the crux God is much more\nThorough than estimated before it's considered to be the worst breach ever\nOf the Facebook social media platform\nAnd the crux have a lot of stuff like they might have your contact information like your phone numbers\nAs they have for a many millions of people somewhere Fifteen twenty million they have information on your email address potentially what computers phones whatever you're reaching Facebook from a your gender\nWhat religion you are at which people can figure out a number of different ways um they know what things you've been searching on on Facebook but last physical locations you've been out\nDetailed profile information they did not get\nYour password at least this time there is no information that they have your password or credit card information but one area where I Do urge real caution with Facebook is that you do in fact change\nWith Facebook where you no longer use Facebook as a way to sign in two other accounts you know how often you'll sign up with somebody in one of the options sell off for you is to use Facebook as you're signing putting too many eggs in one basket there and I don't want you to doing that anymore\nAnd when you do get involved with social media\nKnow that the information they are creates vulnerabilities that go much deeper than you might have imagined including potentially rating\nYour money if you have it and whatever brokerage accounts investment accounts or bank accounts you have\nTo be careful you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\nMessaging date rape may apply imagine having a master's degree from a real class go on your resume without setting\nFoot on campus or paint anywhere near what you would expect\nAnd make a home much more robust\nAnd\nCase in Florida we were you a part time and a beach community in Florida and our next door neighbor as well as about oh about a dozen homes in our area are built using a new construction method\nWhere the homes are built like and I think this is the one in Mexico beach was the same kind of idea built with concrete and know sheet rock yet\nAnd the homes are built to withstand a cat five hurricane plus and the windows may not survive they may blow out the home itself is a hundred percent structurally sound and\nAll that has to be done is it supposed out there is no issue with mold and so the reason I bring this up is we in America face an increasing problem with flooding from population growth um increase rainfall it's we're in a cycle of that\nAnd much of the United states and there are so many techniques that can be used\nThat will make homes and people in them safer make the structures more solid I went and toured\nA neighborhood in Holland is a an area is subject to flooding a lot of Holland is below sea level and they now have these homes for flood flown error prone areas that I went to see that the homes rise with the rising water\nFlown error prone areas that I went to see that the homes rise with the rising water\nAnd the cost of constructing them no higher than normal construction it just re thinking how you build for circumstance we in the United states tend to after a flood or disaster to rebuild exactly as we did before\nAnd a lot of these things if we think about how do we prepare for\nThe unexpected a lot of these things don't cost\nIn many cases any more money\nOr just little amount photo incremental amounts to make a structure much more robust make it safer\nAnd eliminate the thing of wash rents and repeat where property gets destroyed and then you have to rebuild and then another uh act of nature happens you have to rebuild again on and on there's no need for us to be fatalistic about this\nThis is an area we just need to be practical\nRalf is with us on the Clark Howard show ... Ralph\nHello cart thanks for taking my call absolutely how you doing I'm doing great we uh recently moved back for a living\nOverseas for many years and he appreciated oldest saying that you have to say to make out to the integration little cheesy area because so many things have changed and very grateful total lie see it's given us so thanks for that\nWill give it a little back story where have you been living in for how long\nA first lifted the u._k. for about five years studying Switzerland for seven um but in Hong Kong for two years\nMy goodness and do you have kids that speak like twelve languages now\nNo kids so [laughter]\nHow about you have any language is do you speak at this point\n[laughter] well three fluently and to a little bit so\nFantastic [laughter] and uh I speak English and enough Spanish to be able to find the bathroom [noise]\nPolicy that's all you need you just need to be able to or the food and drink in line and then you got to go [laughter]\nUm one thing I'm curious about after all those years away did you have a hard time re establishing a credit score getting um auto insurance anything like that worry those areas difficult for you when you re integrated now in the U. S.\nNo because we we have an address ... thanks very good friends of ours and we also had a home outside a plan to a lake that we kept so we never from that point of view we didn't leave [noise]\nWell that's great because you know the financial reintegration can be really difficult for people who are gone for a number of years but how can I be of service the today\nWell the last thing that we wanted to do is we purchased the crow look and to do our banking and financial unless you have some ... and I did some research on your website on that as well but\nI'm not quite sure whether I Need to set up a new Gmail account all the way that I can use social Jews and access to well to get the going\nWonderful question and when you're starting from scratch using a segregated computer\nUsing chrome book for financial\nIt is recommended that you set up a separate Gmail account with not integrate because you know with Gmail with the Google accounts\nWhen you sign into a computer it just kind of automatically populate everything from a prior went on and so having that separate the male\nIs the best idea you can do to protect yourself and protect what you do elsewhere how much was the chrome book he bought just for financial\n[noise] uh I don't know I've folded fully or service Salter no\nWell happy anniversary I'm sure she's very little money\n[laughter] I'm sure she didn't because she listens to you too of course a\nPerfect so with the chrome buck the whole idea of a crime but where Raul and I are talking about is they are ultra inexpensive right now routinely available at a hundred bucks for new ones not ... or anything like that\nAnd they are not prone to the same problems with viruses that can happen to a windows computer or a Mac and so using chrome book for financial only know Web surfing no email nothing no social media just\nThey'll pay banking brokerage those kinds of things creates an additional protection for you from people who would try to mess up your life\nBy creating financial chaos emptying your accounts or whatever and so chrome books are the safest\nWay I Know to do that stuff and having a separate one just for financial is something I very much want small businesses to do to protect themselves because where we as consumers have a lot of protections under the law if we get hit by a hacker\nBusinesses generally don't have those same legal protections which is why also in addition for businesses I recommend that you get um\nInsurance to protect you from data breaches from hackers and having this kind of coverage is something very few small businesses have but if you got wiped out at your small business\nBecause of a hacker what would happen next that's why having the insurance is so key\nChris is with us on the Clark Howard

called the state the insurance and I said that's a great idea so I gave them a call ... after a few departments or later I finally spoke with somebody in in the lady said that she can almost guarantee that that wouldn't happen\nThere's nothing in the law that prohibits at at this time so there was a law passed a decade ago fit for him it'd your DNA from being used genetic testing from being able to ... be used for health insurance\nSo that for him it'd your DNA from being used genetic testing or being able to ... be used for health insurance but since then as more and more\nInformation has become available through genetic testing and how easy it is for people to do it the law has never been updated to cover\nLife insurance long term care disability insurance and so this is an area that the feds need to be all over in the Congress and not permit genetic discrimination\nSo I don't know I don't know anybody doing it yet just like you were told by the person at the state insurance department emphasis on yet\n... because of that I had actually called the last ... says he said it was a note for genetic test shore and I think the lab and stayed in construction to do that I Would

feet higher he's talked tough and a lot of different ways well now's the test Mr President now is the test you're talking about wanting to send the military to the border you can't send the military to the border\nFact of the matter is you have to send the military in to Mexico\nAt a buffer zone point fifty or a hundred miles south of the border with the United states and you need to coordinate this with the Mexican government to let them know we're going to do the heavy heavy lifting we're going to do the interdiction we're going to do what it takes but damn it we're going to send a brigade or better down there\nTo do this this is the first time American sovereignty has been substantially challenged on the southern border since poncho via came across and shot up Columbus New Mexico in the run up to World War one this is what we're facing\nAnd the president wants to go to rallies and he wants to talk talk on the border and I want to see a response I don't want Jeff Sessions and I don't want Kirstjen Nielsen and I don't want idiots in a restaurant yelling at administration officials you know what I Want to see American military might\nActing in conjunction with Mexican allies

F. M.\nB. reputable show [laughter] covers thing was making the rounds over the weekend and was talking about how on the back end of this election the president of the United states if the Democrats take over the house of representatives is going to say that the elections were elite jet event\nSeriously that the president was going to call the the midterms illegitimate\nIt it is possible you know to critique the outcomes of elections Carl without dot creating some weird constitutional crisis\nThat you guys are desperate to have everything turned into and I think that's the problem it's progressive it's by and large I don't usually have them in my barbecues or might get togethers one they tend to be very humorless people too\nThey tend to really take things and fly off the handle oh you're saying you're angry that energy blows you use the new speaker you're saying you're angry that Hillary Clinton is the president elect in twenty twenty you're angry about these things but no I'm not I'm critiquing on I happen to think that if Nancy Pelosi ends up being\nThe speaker designate\nThe progressives are going to be in for a very ugly reality\nBecause I happen to know what the very first issue of Nancy Pelosi's agenda is I I Do she said as much today interviewing a being interviewed by Dana Bash\nOver to CNN and she said her number one issue H R one coming out of Nancy Pelosi's house of representatives\nNot saving Obamacare is not some kind of a minimum wage hike it's none of that stuff it's getting the money out of politics HR one will be getting the money out of politics is that what you people are out there\nThat beating up conservatives in restaurants over is that while you're cracking heads are you ... because are you shooting congressional members over there at the at the ball field because you want the money out of politics I Would have thought you'd been motivated by something much more much more granular like free stuff\nI don't hear Nancy Pelosi ever mentioned DACA recipients for dreamers or spark of divinity MS Thirteen members I don't ever hear her mentioned them but she's going to take some money out of politics well before\nAny of that happens they're gonna have to deal with this migrant caravan mess that's moving up through Mexico and the president's going to have to show this he's the president of the United states he's the guy who said he can talk tough on immigration he's the guy who points to the Democrats and says they are the reason why the board\nBorders are porous and we can't enforce the laws well do what you can do utilize which you can use the bully pulpit\nAnd whatever force you have this commander in chief to secure the American homeland which you can do Mr President not encouraging you to do that Dave is in valley center starting us off today on this caravan day welcome to the program what's on your mind\nThat right yeah um well the caravan again you know it's like how convenient that it's you know two weeks before the election and it puts the spotlight on Saturday\nAnd again you know it's like how convenient that it's you know two weeks before the election and it puts the spotlight on our president but maybe that's a good thing you know maybe it's just as well because it's going to focus again on this whole board on that\nThat hasn't been addressed Congress hasn't really appropriate at the money for the wall right you know this was dragging on for two years now the thing is it's also convenient for the Democrats the spotlight this\nYou know and the thing is what we do care about or people that aren't coming in you know refuge I mean that's all right but that seems to be complicit in it and that's\nYou know I I'm just wondering how it's being orchestrated right without really hearing the facts about who these people are\nNo idea yeah yeah I mean I met and took care of it but\nIt's hard to know what I mean you've got these organizations like a poet lessons but I'm telling us that it's
