it's not the city how do you strike that balance in terms of\nQuality of life flight paths those sorts of things in in in are facing with the county\nYeah this is a really big conversation as blown up over the last year there isn't a tooth and paying attention to this for well over a decade and I would say that just looking back in our past\nYou can see past chemical in the Nineteen seventies when we and at the airport and the crowd that has been working on this problem how do we have a ... table when it comes to county operations on his airports shirt very long time so\nIt's not just the quality of life issue it's also a property issues that we need to be the best advocate that we can for our residents and that's something that over the course of maybe\nThe last couple of council\nAdministration we had a net same level of advocacy as we did back in the Nineteen seventies on a conversation was also a hot topic so the striking a balance at this point is there any at the council to go into closed session and talk about our ... county has taken an aggressive approach to\nUh the biggest option the biggest expansion option and I'm looking forward to having a conversation with our council members as well as our community members\nOkay let me let me pivot you over to somebody that's a that's a hot issue everybody no matter what no matter where you're running it's going to be an issue that's like quality of life crime things like that\nWe know there are a large number of of license plate readers that have come on line in the city of Carlsbad manhole pointed to the

entire community are girls back\nWe had two conversations around that is the first lesson expansion of a smaller program at the beginning of two thousand steps ... Seventeen and then the most recent conversation was even further extension of that program so the first decision that was made\nI had to specific objection to moving forward with the program the first was we need to prioritize fully staffing or public safety when it's fully prior full\nFull implementation of all of our public safety staff so we're down\nProbably about nine public safety officer sworn officers we were able to tackle that in this last cycle partially by adding five sworn officers [noise] the second part of my first suggestion was privacy\nSo when we're taking a look at whether or not is personal information and whether we need to actually ask permission from our resident we didn't proactively think about them\nPractically think about them that first which is how the PR leaders were going to impact our staff to get in so much data um didn't really properly plan for that but the other piece of dirt residents\nAgreed to having every single one of their license plates photograph right\nIt's not just photograph it's a larger a portion of the car that it's a crash and are they okay with that we didn't ask permission to other cities ...

always my great friends to restructure the officer down to everyone\nTo be like and that is because he is the brains of the operation out here that's for sure but I got Larry out here and Larry first question for you is how you doing doing great Ryan how're you doing I'm doing wonderful excited to be out here with you all doing the show this week we have a lot of fun doing the show and talking to you our financial family out there across the airwaves\nAnd one of things we always focus the vast majority of our time on I Would say every time we get on the air and every time we can get\nYou know in front of a group of people is really talking about income and talking about how to how to generate more income inside of the financial markets and one of the things we always stress and I and I know we'll spend a lot of time on here today is how to really get that consistent growth that consistent income in the markets\nWhether the markets are going up and whether the market's going down with the market's going sideways and and that's really the the key is because there's three directions and and it's individuals were very comfortable with the buying hold\nKind of bullish mentality of you know we we invest into this we invest into that we hold it for a long time and and hopefully when we hit retirement it's just worth is worth a heck of a whole lot more\nNow what are the things I Want to get some feedback on it's always a fun show starter is really the consistency side of things because really if we're going to have consistent growth in the market we can't be direction ally dependent and what I mean by that is we can't\nOnly profit if the market goes in one direction I don't I don't know about you but one of my favorite things when I teach a half day classier it on a train economy one of my favorite things it's really work with the class and get them to viewed down markets as opportunities not just bad things you know so many times the down markets are viewed as\nThat's so bad 'cause people are losing money and all that is true if we're just in that bullish biased as markets are going down\nWith the right knowledge of what the right skills those can be viewed as as great opportunities to make money I mean if you go back through some of the major\nCrashes that we've experienced and you can you can find the ... of the world the pulses of the world and you can find the the word billionaire next to their name at the end of a lot of these crashes and so it's always interesting how how how maybe millions are made on the way up the billions are made on the way down\nAnd it really just boils back to consistency we want to make money we want to make money on the way up and we want to make money on the way down but what are some of the things you guys are working on with the students right now or some of the some of the new tools you and your instructor team are are are laying out there right now I help people become more consistent and less rationally dependent instead of the market\nWill this last week it's been beautiful I mean everything we've been talking about on the show together I'm Talking about this for weeks now waiting for the opportunity to see the markets correcting come back down and as a result what happens starting off at the end of last week into this week as we got everybody's wish that\nWelcome back and if you're just tuning in give us Larry Jacobs director of instructor development and top instructor it on a trading company really shed some light on consistent returns in the market is one of my favorite topics so talking about consistency in the market so many times I'll I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had some success they've had some success in\nThe market but they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key really in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently actually make money over and over and over\nAnd the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach being able to make money as the markets are going up being able to make money is the markets are going down and also being able to make money as the markets are going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time talking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in\nMaybe your first time listener may have been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come I learned a lot of our listeners like we're talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you can even call it maybe that's that supplemental side that you're talking about a few minutes ago and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental and be their primary source of income\nAnd I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call you know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys work with students on who are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this is the primary source of income is a great\nQuestion right you know what I find that a lot of our students they first come into the academy taking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for is freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have over ... thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to the Haitian people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they lose their jobs if they even took the day or two officer we're living in this constant stream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students come in thinking they want to make a lot of money\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny I got him Adam was one of my students\nAnd he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work and he finally got to a point we could trade and actually go into his boss and say I have enough\nAnd I had enough think about that to be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bringing you one really profitable to trade wouldn't it be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nYeah absolutely just kind of chicken things out and seeing what it can do for you and that whenever we talk about the half day classes whenever we talk about anything even have to have to class we always talk about risk versus reward and\nReally specifically when you ... back to the half the class you know they have to take classes or three hours long and say if you end up winning a set of tickets to one of the easy really investing three hours worth of your time and what if what if that three hours worth of your time was able to show you how you really could replace your income or how maybe you could raise your income by X percentage so that you could have that financial freedom that Larry it was just talking about that's really\nKind of the key to all this and you know what you were touching on was was\nThe freedom side and and really those conversations go go fairly deep within with individuals one on one where you say you know what are you looking to accomplish this I go I Want to make an extra thousand bucks a month\nAnd that's a pretty quick conversation but then you say why\n... why do you want to make an extra thousand bucks and now that financial freedom conversation starts where you know you it's a it's a nice detailed process of well you know what my kids do this or I Want to do that and there's all these goals that they want to start accomplishing and part of what you need usually to accomplish those is a little more time one of the ways that helps you have a little more time is to have income coming from somewhere else having a supplemental\nSide of income you know where there's lots of different ways where we can build out the supplemental income it can be through a passive channel that could be through an active channel it can be through commodities it can be dropped as it could be their stocks\nOne of the things about it is is we ... is one of these you always talk about I guess I should say Larry is is how multiple streams of income are are really kind of crucial throughout this whole process and you know the the average millionaire I think has has five or greater\nStreams of income and so when you think about it like that that is that those those pieces supplementing each other one goes away it's really no big deal you just get strategic and you build out another one now it's also one of the reasons why the the word job Jay obese stands for just over broke because if we just have one stream of income\nAnd it goes away well we're we're in her city right we're in stress city we're we're we're scrambling hopefully we got a little savings to buy a little time but it ended up being that kind of that that that downward spiral or even just stuck in a rat race so to speak of well\nIf we lose our job hopefully we have some savings we use our savings while we find another job and then we just getting another job doesn't the cycle probably just continue building out these multiple streams of income or or something that seems to be ah not something that seems to be something that can create that nice safety net Annette nice piece of stability\nAnd you know as you're thinking what you're saying and you\nKnow most people coming into the academy and you might be listening right now I'm thinking the same thing which really amazing to me it's like the story of the frog and you're gonna laugh when I say this but with the fraud if you have a frog that can jump very very high but you put them in a box and you've covered the box a couple of times the frog hits the top lid\nAnd he just that little way they still can't jumping the higher the way the lid was\nWe don't realize it subconsciously that when we get a paycheck were being defined or at least thinking or just definition of a self worth is by the paycheck that we receive\nAnd what a lot of our students really have that a ha moment is Ryan is when they start to make more money than they're making at their job so for years imagined you couldn't make any more money you've talked yourself into this is the most I can make\nAnd now not only able to make more than that but you don't have to take the time away from family loved ones even things that you're really looking to do to get a second job which is taking more and more freedom away from you\nYeah absolutely it always boils down to the financial freedom and doing the things we want to do rather than the things that we have to do I one of the things we can do to help a few people get started kind of down this path really raise those skills ... raise those skill sets and start generating a little more income\nIs give away a few more these passes we say let's do it right now he's happy class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to generate more income inside of the market whether that's passive income whether that's supplemental income whether\nIt's active income with us or commodities whether it's through stocks doesn't matter it's all about generating more income and we always talk about risk versus reward and your investment is three hours of your time half their classes about three hours long and now you're looking for that great ward and that reward is how you could generate a better stream of income or get better rates of return in the markets well\nIn just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half their classes to get your phone's writing if you're driving now is a great time to pull over including with your passes are professional insiders kitten other kids packed with lessons from some of our top constructors lessons on topics like enhanced the retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional inside of kept makes it so you can get started right now\n... century twenty when he did a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight six six six three zero eight seven to three that's eight six six six three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that his up at free OJ class dot com and see if you can see where some passes there\nNow as we're kind of going down his income conversation we were talking about supplemental income in primary income we've talked a little bit about multiple streams of income was kind of that that that that starting point what's that combined message no matter what direction down the income past somebody's looking to go to you and your instructors we like to start\nOff with well it's funny 'cause most people don't know where to start all the time and it was ... said as you don't have to be great to start but you have to start to be great so many people think that by trading they have to get rich really really quickly vote on it all in fact\nMost of our instructors will tell our students is I Would it's not about quitting your job it's about finding a job that you love\nBecause if we put our job straight out right and they were giving up one of our income streams right you don't want to do that because we're looking for multiple income streams but at the same time you've heard just expressing our whole lives right don't work hard work smart well that's not how people who make a lot of money thing\nThey're not working hard they're not working smart they're learning how to work right and what working right means is they're following other people\nIt means is they're following other people who are successful in generating money that's one of the things that\nAre students learn how to do they learn how to make money without getting a second job because let's face it nobody out there is on their deathbed going man you know I Wish I could've worked just one more day that would have been excellent no they're out there saying I Want to spend more time with the things and the people that I Love\nAnd so I think about it just because you're going out and setting a second job yeah you make it a couple of extra zeroes at the end your income\nBut if you know how to start managing your money properly and dealing and what we call risk management\nIs going to have more zeroes on the end of your expenses so a lot of people are miserable they're out there thinking they've got to work even harder and harder with teaching students how to work right and that's simply means coming in and understanding how you could create more freedom for yourself and hopefully we'll listening right now can see how could they could create more freedom\nYeah and it's all about generating that skill you know you're you're talking about people coming in and looking to make money out of the gates and just you know I Want to I Want to take this dollar turned into a million dollars by went by tomorrow it's like okay it's not very realistic right but so one of the things we always like to bring that up is it's all about generate generating skill building the skill and the money comes after you have to have the skill first just like in any other\nBusiness than any other walk of life the skill is something that we that we really have to at first and I always tell everybody if you're looking for a a get rich quick program then the happy cost probably for you and really the financial markets probably aren't for you and that's that's just being real because we have to generate the skills to be able to generate the income\nAnd building any skill usually isn't an overnight process it's usually something that takes a little time also said to add to that because I Love what you're\nGoing you also can't be someone who doesn't take action you don't want to get to stay stuck where you are right now and you're not ... those are definitely things that are not going to work out for you but if you're somebody who really is interested in learning a new skill that can ultimately benefit you in the long run and this is an excellent opportunity for you\nYeah if you're looking to build some skills in the financial market and learn how to generate a greater source of income\nAnd you're willing to put in a time as Larry says well then I think you may be our next caller to win a set of these passes but first I've got to get Larry submission to give away let's do it All right right now I've got a half day class coming up in your area and a half the classes where you'll see exactly what it takes really generate that extra source of income really built out those multiple streams of income side of the financial markets\nBut the thing that I went through with my father about a year we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about dropping accounts and and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account and\nThey lost fifty thousand and they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value is that fifty thousand that happened in one year here that drop happened I think it was fourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take that average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous and let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web\nThat ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we're talking about was how long does it take the average person surely even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and saying yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again it's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves instead of taking this big roller coaster ride and think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight\nIf you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit and then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could've been one of the greatest time of your life right now so we got a three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nYup absolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify where to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow as you get them out to one of the half day classes you ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half the costs are we going to see exactly that how to generate more income how to keep that retirement account growing\nHow do I identify these turning points up down or sideways\nSo you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could you could go back to the old know when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of the conversation on just a second you have a chance to win a set of passes or one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving\nRight now is a great time to pull over including your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit that is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors the professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is eight six six six three zero eight seven to three that's eight six\nThree that's eight six six six three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at free OJ class dot com and see if you can score some passes there now Larry I always I always said everybody when ... and I tried to stayed on the show as much as I can have two dollars or two million dollars would that be classes where you really get to\nSee exactly what it takes to really get that money working for you and you were talking about it earlier as far as having our money working smarter for us and that's just doing the right things with our money\nYou know we've always also been talking about the market's being an all time highs and the risks that we have in there and then my dentist office I bring this up a lot on the show but it just it's so true inside of the financial markets that might dust off as a kid shout out to Dr are buckle there's a plaque on the wall and every examination room where it says\nFor don't worry about your teeth and they'll go away you know being that same situation here that unfortunately has been proven true time after time it's don't worry about your money don't worry about your retirement account and they'll go away\nYeah well let's just think about what people are doing right now in this moment we've been told that every two weeks is supposed to be investing in Iraq or some type of retirement plan which is great nothing against that\nBut what people are not paying attention to is where they're investing that money and for the last two years people investing all time highs and so think about it you're an all time high\nWeek after week that's when you invest in your money and all of a sudden the market corrects well that correction is going to impact the first amount of money or the last amount of money that you basically have invested into\nSo now you've put majority or money in the market the last two or three years when it's been higher and higher and it takes a tremendous fall and this is why we said earlier the market falls three times faster than it goes up\nAnd as a result people see that fifty percent evaporation of wealth\nAnd that immediate sea of seeing that freaks out now let's take it a step further\nWhen the market goes down that dramatically like it didn't two thousand eight what's next the loss of jobs the forfeiture isn't housing dividend cuts devastating cuts so all these things have a greater impact than most people believe and yet there are people out there that continue every single day to roll the dice and take a chance and say this won't happen to me\nYeah there's a huge risk out there and not a huge need for multiple streams of income and not just today but multiple streams of income throughout our life throughout every stage of our life\nTo create that stability and one of the things we can do to really help people get kind of jumped started\nEnded his multiple streams of income lifestyle is to get 'em out to one of the half the classes we still got a few passes here we can give away let's do it right now I've got a ... class can up in your area\nThat day classes where you'll see exactly what it takes really keep that retirement account
