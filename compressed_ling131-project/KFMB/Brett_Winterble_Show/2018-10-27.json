investment advisor enjoy the show [noise]\nWe'll go to the show as your\nGoing to have you as always my great friends directly with just about\nEveryone\nTo see like and that is because he is the brains of the operation out here that's for sure\nBut I got Larry out here and Larry first question for you is how that you're doing doing great Ryan how're you doing I'm doing wonderful excited to be out here with you all doing the show this week we have a lot of fun doing the show and talking to your financial family out there across the airwaves\nAnd one of these we always focus the vast majority of our time on I Would say every time we get on the air and every time we can get\nYou know in front of a group of people is really talking about income and talking about how to how to generate more income inside of the financial markets and one of the things we always stress and I and I know we'll spend a lot of time on it here today is how to really get that consistent growth that consistent income in the markets\nWhether the markets are going up and whether the market's going down whether the Mark Twain sideways and and that's really the the key is because there's three directions and and as individuals were very comfortable with the buying hold\nKind of bullish mentality of you know we we invest into this we invest into that we hold it for a long time and and hopefully when we hit retirement it's just worth or just worth a heck of a whole lot more\nNow what are the things I Want to get some of your feedback on it's always a fun show starter is really the consistency side of things because really if we're going to have consistent growth in the market we can't be direction to lead dependent than what I mean by that is we can't\nOnly profit if the market goes in one direction I don't I don't know about you but one of my favorite things\nWhen I teach a half day last year it on a treaty academy one of my favorite things is to really work with the class and get them to have you down markets as opportunities not just bad things you know so many times the down markets are viewed as well that's so bad 'cause people are losing money and all that is true if we're just in that bullish biased as markets are going down\nWith the right knowledge and what the right skills those can be viewed as as great opportunities to make money I mean if you go back through some of the major\nCrashes that we've experienced and you can you can find the ... of the world the pulses of the world and you can find the the word billionaire next to their name at the end of a lot of these crashes and so it's always interesting how how how maybe millions are made on the way up billions are made on the way down\nAnd it really boils back to consistency we want to make money we want to make money on the way up and we want to make money on the way down but\nWhat are some of the things you guys work on what the students right now or some of the some of the new tools you and your instructor team are are are laying out there right now to help people become more consistent than less rationally dependent inside of the markets\nWill just last week it's been beautiful I mean everything we've been talking about on the show together I'm Talking about this for weeks now waiting for the opportunity to see the markets correct and come back down and as a result what happens starting off at the end of last week and to this week as we got everybody's wish that\nSeven six K of envy [noise]\nWelcome back and if you're just tuning in give us Larry Jacobs director of structure development and top instructor it on a trading company really shed some light on consistent returns in the market is one of my favorite topics so talking about consistency in the markets so many times I'll I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had some success they've had some success in\nThe market but they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key\nReally in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently how can we make money over and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach being able to make money is marked going up being able to make money as the markets are going down\nAnd also being able to make money as the marks or going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time talking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in\nMaybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners like we're talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you can even call it maybe that's a supplemental side that you were talking about a few minutes ago and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental and be their primary source of income and I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call\nYou know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys work with students who are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this is the primary source of income is a great\nQuestion right you know what I find that a lot of our students they first come into the academy taking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for is freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have over four hundred and fifty thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to take a vacation make people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they'd lose their jobs and they even took a day or two officers were living in this constant stream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students come in thinking they wanna make a lot of money\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny I got him Adam was one of my students\nAnd he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work\nAnd he finally got to a point we could trade and actually go into his boss and say I have enough and I had enough think about that to be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bring you one really profitable to trade wouldn't it be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nYeah absolutely just kind of checking things out and seeing what it can do for you and that whenever we talk about the half day classes whenever we talk about anything you have to have to class we always talk about risk versus reward and really specifically when you ... back to the half the class you know the classes are three hours long and say if you end up winning a set of tickets to one of these really investing three hours worth of your time and what if\nWhat if that three hours worth of your time was able to show you how you really could replace your income or how maybe you could raise your income by X percentage so that you could have that financial freedom but Larry it was just talking about that's really kind of the key to all this and you know what you were touching on was was\nThe freedom side and and really those conversations go go fairly deep within with individuals one on one where you say you know what are you looking to accomplish this I go I Want to make an extra thousand bucks a month\nAnd that's a pretty quick conversation but then you say why\n... why do you want to make an extra thousand bucks and now that financial freedom conversation start where you know it's a it's a nice detailed process of well you know what my kids do this or I Want to do that and there's all these goals that they want to start accomplishing and part of what you need usually to accomplish those is a little more time one of the ways that helps you have a little more time is to have income coming from somewhere else having that supplemental\nSide of income you know there's lots of different ways where we can build up the supplemental income it can be through a passive channel that could be through an active channel it can be through commodities it can be dropped it could be their stocks but one of the things about it is is we ... is one of these you always talk about I guess I should say Larry's is how multiple streams of income are are really kind of crucial throughout this whole process and you know the the average millionaire I\nThink has has five or greater\nStreams of income and so when you think about like that that is that those those pieces supplementing each other one goes away it's really no big deal you just get strategic and you build out another one now it's also one of the reasons why the the word job Jay obese stands for just over broke because if we just have one stream of income\nAnd it goes away well we're we're in her city right we're in stress city we're we're we're scrambling to hopefully we got a little bit of savings to buy us little time but it ended up being that kind of\nThat that that downward spiral or even just stuck in a rat race so to speak of well if we lose our job hopefully we have some savings we use our savings while we find another job and then we just getting another job and doesn't the cycle probably just continue\nYour building out these multiple streams of income or or something that seems to be\nAh not something that seems to be something that can create that nice safety net Annette nice piece of stability\nYeah and you know I was just sitting here thinking what you're saying and you know most people coming to the academy and you might be listening right now I'm thinking the same thing\nWhich really amazing to me it's like the story of the frog and you're gonna laugh when I say this but with the frog\nIf you have a frog that can jump very very high but you put them in a box and you cover the box the couple of times the frog hits the top lid\nAnd even if that little way they still can't jump in the higher the way the lid was we don't realize it subconsciously that when we get a paycheck were being defined or at least thinking or just definition of a self worth is by the paycheck that we receive\nAnd what a lot of our students really have that moment is Ryan is when they start to make more money than they're making at their job so for years imagined you couldn't make any more money you've talked yourself into this is the most I could make\nIt's when they start to make more money than they're making at their job so for years imagine you couldn't make any more money you've talked yourself into this is the most I could make and now not only able to make more than that but you don't have to take the time away from family loved ones even things that you're really looking to do to get a second job which is taking more and more freedom away from you\nYeah absolutely it always boils down to the financial freedom and doing the things we want to do rather than the things that we have to do I one of the things we can do to help a few people get started kind of down this path really raise those skills ... raise those skill sets and start generating a little more income\nIs give away a few more of these passes what he say let's do it right now I have a class coming up in your area in the happy classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to generate more income inside of the market whether that's passive income whether that's supplemental income whether it's active income whether it's through commodities whether it's through stocks\nDoesn't matter it's all about generating more income and we always talk about risk versus reward and your investment is three hours of your time half the class is about three hours long\nAnd now you're looking for that great ward and that reward is how you could generate a better stream of income or get better rates of return in the markets well\nIn just a second you're gonna have a chance to win instead of passes one of these have to classes to get your phone's reading if you're driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluding with your passages are professional insiders kitten other kids packed with lessons from some of our top constructors lessons on topics like enhanced the retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional inside of kept makes it so you can get started right now\n... century twenty when you did a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight six six six three zero eight seven to three that's eight six six six three zero eight seven to three if you're gonna be an colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that by his up at free OJ class dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nNow as we're kind of going down his income conversation we were talking about supplemental income and primary income we've talked a little bit about multiple streams of income what kind of that that that that starting point what's that combined message no matter what direction down the income past somebody's looking to go to you and your instructors we like to start people off\nWith well it's funny 'cause most people don't know where to start all the time and it was ... says you don't have to be great to start but you have to start to be great\nSo many people think that by trading they have to get rich really really quickly vote on it all in fact\nMost of our instructors will tell our students is I Would it's not about quitting your job it's about finding a job that you love because if we can put our job straight out right and they were giving up one of our income streams rapid don't want to do that because we're looking for multiple income stream but at the same time you've heard just expressing our whole lives right don't work hard work smart\nWell that's not how people who make a lot of money I think\nThey're not working hard they're not working smart they're learning how to work right\nAnd what working right means is they're following other people who are successful in generating money that's one of the things that are students learn how to do they learn how to make money without getting a second job because let's face it nobody out there is on their deathbed going man you know I Wish I could a worked just one more day that would have been excellent no\nThey're out there saying I Want to spend more time with the things and the people that I Love\nAnd so it's about it just because you're going out and setting a second job yeah you make it a couple of extra zeroes at the end of your income\nBut if you don't have to start managing your money properly and dealing and what we call risk management\nIs going to have more zeroes on the end of your expenses so a lot of people are miserable they're out there thinking they've got to work even harder and harder with teaching students how to work right and it simply means coming in and understanding how you could create more freedom for yourself and hopefully we'll listening right now can see how could they could create more freedom\nYeah and it's all about generating that skill you know you're you're talking about people coming in and looking to make money rather the gates and just you know I Want to I Want to take this dollar turned into a million dollars by went by tomorrow it's like okay that's not very realistic right but so one of the things we always like to bring that up is it's all about generate generating skill building the skill and the money comes after you have to have the skill first just like in any other\nBusiness in any other walk of life the skill is something that we that we really have to have first and I always tell everybody if you're looking for a a get rich quick program\nThen it costs probably isn't for you and really the financial markets probably aren't for you and that's that's just being real because we have to generate the skills to be able to generate the income and building any skill usually isn't an overnight process it's usually something that takes a little time also said to add to that because I Love what you're\nGoing you also can't be someone who doesn't take action you don't want to get to stay stuck where you are right now and you're not ... those are definitely things that are not going to work out for you but if you're somebody who really is interested in learning a new skill that can ultimately benefit you in the long run and this is an excellent opportunity for you\nYeah if you're looking to build some skills in the financial market and learn how to generate a greater source of income\nAnd you're willing to put in a time as Larry says well then I think you may be our next caller to win a set of these passes but first I've gotta get Larry submission to give away let's do it All right right now I've got a half day class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you'll see exactly what it takes really generate that extra source of income really build out those multiple streams of income side of the financial markets\nAnd so if we come to here we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal but the thing that I went through with my father about uh we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about drops and counseling and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account and they lost fifty thousand and they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value of that fifty thousand that happened in one year\nThat drop happened I think it was fourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when\nThey take that average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web that's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we were talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated\nAnd so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again it's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves\nInstead of taking this big roller coaster ride\nAnd think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit and then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could've been one of the greatest time of your life right now to leave at three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nYep absolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify where to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow as you get 'em out to one of the half the class is ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half the costs are we going to see exactly that how to generate more income how to keep that retirement account growing\nHow do I identify these turning points up down or sideways\nSo you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could you could go back to the old know when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of a conversation\nOn just a second you have a chance to win a set of passes or one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving right now is a great time to pull over including ... year passes it's going to be our professional insiders kit that is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nTo professional insider kitten makes it so you get started right now\n... we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is eight six six six three zero eight seven to three that's eight six six six three zero eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that by his up at free OJ class dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nNow Larry I always I always said everybody when and I tried to say it on the show as much as I can whether you have two dollars or two million dollars adapted classes where you really get to see exactly what it takes to really get that money working for you and you were talking about it earlier as far as\nHaving our money working smarter for us and that's just doing the right things with our money\nYou know we've always also been talking about the market's being an all time highs and the risks that we have in there and then my dentist office I bring this up a lot on the show but it just it's so true inside of the financial markets that might dust off as a kid shout out to Dr are buckle there's a plaque on the wall and every examination room where it says\nFor don't worry about your teeth and they'll go away you\nKnow what is it being the same situation here that unfortunately has been proven true time after time it's don't worry about your money don't worry about your retirement account and they'll go away\nYou know well let's just think about what people are doing right now in this moment we've been told that every two weeks is supposed to be investing in an Ira or some type of retirement plan which is great and nothing against that\nBut what people are not paying attention to is where they're investing that money and for the last two years people investing all time highs and so think about it you're an all time high\nWeek after week that's when you're investing your money and all of a sudden the market corrects well that corruption is going to impact\nThe first amount of money or the last amount of money that you basically have invested into so now you've put majority or money in the market the last two or three years when it's been higher and higher and it takes a tremendous fall and this is why we said it earlier the market falls three times fast and then it goes up\nAnd as a result people see that fifty percent evaporation of wealth\nAnd that immediate sea of seeing that freaks out now let's take it a step further\nWhen the market goes down that dramatically like it didn't two thousand eight what's next the loss of jobs the forfeiture isn't housing dividend cuts David and cuts so all these things have a greater impact than most people believe and yet there are people out there that continue every single day to roll the dice and take a chance and said this won't happen to me\nYeah there is a huge risk out there and that is a huge need for multiple streams of income and not just today but multiple streams of income throughout our life throughout every stage of our life\nTo create that stability and one of the things we can do to really help people get kind of jumped started\nInto this multiple streams of income lifestyle is to get them out to one of the happy classes we still got a few passes here we can give away let's do it right now we've got to have to class can up in your area\nThat big classes where you'll see exactly what it takes really keep that retirement account growing make sure we have income for today income for tomorrow and really generating and focusing on building out those multiple streams of income when the second you're gonna

[noise] so I guess my question is what do I do with this money that's sitting\nFor you do have the option of just leaving it and were those big companies small or in between that you were with before\nOkay so the one with Eighteen thousand is on I'm most concerned with the smaller company and I'm worried if they go out of business what happens to that money\nFor the money would be okay and the four oh one K. but if it's a small business there's a different issue\nAnd that small businesses tend to have very high cost for one case right so I was scared at all that money out quickly and move it to one of the low cost providers\nAnd have an IRA with one of them the three big low cost providers for having IRAs are vanguard Charles Schwab infidelity investment\n[noise] okay than we have them and let me tell you how many do not call the\nOf ... of the four oh one K. and say hey I Want to um move this money out and do an IRA they'll say great what address you want to send you a check never take a check because what they do is they would subtract thirty six hundred dollars from the check they send you a and\nEver take a check because what they do is they would subtract thirty six hundred dollars from the check they send you\nA and send it to the IRS as withholding and you have to make up that thirty six hundred in the next sixty days or you end up paying massive tax for not being able to make that up so what you do with whoever you would go with\nIs they'll do paperwork that will move the money directly from the old employer's plan straight into wherever you're going to have the IRA\nOkay and then you recommend an IRA or the Ross Iraq\nI'm not here but you know I just want to hear you talk about yeah I just thought you said the story\nIs you can't take money there was in a traditional four one K.\nAnd put it into a Roth without having a big tax bill does all that money they don't end was pre tax correct so you go into a traditional i._r._a. without money not a Roth IRA okay and you can over time migrate the money\nFrom the traditional to a Roth as you could afford to pay tax on money each year or you know you got money that they are that's going to grow over the years that you're gonna have to pay tax on Sunday so let's talk about the other one the seven thousand is van in a big employers plan or small\nA it's a very large employer they're trading on the stock exchange\nSo it was a big employer the odds favor that that will be an extremely low cost plan probably lower than you could find in an IRA okay\nSo are the only exception to that would be if they have that money administered by an insurance company for them the four one K. or buy a bank\nIt's it's it's it's just through one of the three that you mentioned\nEarlier and you could just leave that seven behind him move the Eighteen\nOkay and then as far as contributing to that and you're able to contribute straight to the IRA versus trying to go through that\n... a great question so let's say let's keep it simple I in fact let me let me really think about this who is the company that administers the plan for the big publicly traded company used to work for\nIts vanguard so if you wanted to keep it simple um move both of them the vanguard and an IRA and just\nBe done with the old employers for one case because if it's with vanguard the costs will be low enough as an individual anyway and then you've got the simplification of just having an IRA there and then at vanguard open a raw for any future contributions the the twenty five to grow\nIn a vanguard IRA and then you open a new account with vanguard for raw in any current or future contributions he may go into the raw\nOkay and then those can be so just so I'm Sorry I I'm not a hundred percent up to date on all these states but a raw is post tax correct\nExactly yeah and you're gonna have twenty five grand that center pre tax account you\nWant to have money in a post tax accountant or raw truly great to have a mix of both but tilted more towards the Ross\nThis will be a way for you to do it you simplify your life you just have an IRA vanguard a Roth IRA vanguard old money and the IRA new money and the Roth IRA and that would be a good way for you to build up money going forward\nChris is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Chris\nHey Clark thanks for taking my call\nSure you've got a puzzle you want to see
