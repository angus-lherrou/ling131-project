a great profits being posted but you've also got rising interest rates\nAgainst that backdrop we know that there are real internal pressures inside of China\nHow can the president go about exploiting some of those internal pressures obviously the raising of rate that has an impact obviously the the the terrorists impact the ability to purchase goods and services inside of China and most Chinese people\nAre there in the country but I Do not have available cash reserves or access to credit like we do so so what about exploiting that to try to get cheated come to the table\nWill certainly I

for\nChinese engagement some extremely dangerous tactics crossing the ... of the USS Decatur I'm within forty five yards [laughter]\nI'm clearly the Chinese are are trying to drive us out of the global commons we can't prevent that\nBecause the south China Sea is part of the\nInternational aerospace and international water 'em and China is using very aggressive tactics and unless we want a very different world world very different from what we've been putting together after World War two we need to push the Chinese back\nThe Trump Administration is starting to do that that's a very good

I mean you know there's\nJust there's a lot going on here a lot going on here ... I Want to talk about the show the story\nAnd here's my perspective on the show we did a horse race we didn't do the president calling a Stormy Daniels horse race last are you still want to weigh in on a horse race and horse race gate\nAnd ... then you're more than welcome to be a part of conversation I still think it was very effective use of communications to call her horse face\nThat's number one number two we've got this ... thing happening after the show they think I'm gonna talk about Elizabeth Warren a little bit but on the show the thing here okay\nUm I feel like this is one of those things where the press is telling us we have to care about this or else and I also feel like the press is desperate for Donald Trump to jumping in the middle of this and say\nThe Saudis didn't do anything wrong with the Saudis law there's no evidence the Saudis the Saudis are alright\nMom it's been so long salaam alaikum lock them a NBS a he's a great guy you guys don't know what you're talking about I got a good relationship with so much weight a pretty smart he's like you know what we don't know what happened they say they didn't do it they should maybe it was rogue assassins maybe it was something like that but he has staked out a position defending\nThe Saudis and that's making people go crazy\nLike I watched over a a warning shots favorite channels as MSNBC and like they did not know what to do with just because the president had not staked out an affirmative position defending the auto correct that is a NBS a\nBomb had been salon or a ... and so we don't know what's going to happen here but we do know the press is desperate for you to obsess about the show ...\nAnd I think part of it is because they're sensationalism in the fact that he was murdered in an embassy\nAdding another part of it is the fact that the Turks came out today told the Associated Press we found evidence that there was a murder inside that embassy like as a part of it I think a part of it is there's this possibility that he was by dismembered while still alive and that is apple I watch was recording the whole thing and feeding it to his fiance\nThat's one story that was out there banging around\nBut for whatever reason the press is desperate to get us like all agitated and upset now listen I been mad at the Saudis since September the eleventh two thousand one when Nineteen hijackers attacked\nUs on nine eleven and they were funded and supported by the Saudi forces fact\nAnd George W. Bush helped a bunch of high levels Saudis get on planes and get the heck out of the United states the next day when every aircraft in the world around the United states was grounded right we've got the Saudis out we let them get out we let them skirt let him skate get on back home because it's going to get hot\nHere these were these are not good guys\nWe have a strategic interest in working with them because we prefer\nYeah these were these are not good guys\nNow we have a strategic interest in working with them because we prefer the Saudis to the Iranians the man that is a tough tough choice\nDifferences the Saudis have not developed a nuclear weapons program that they have threatened to eradicate the Israelis in the United states with the\nIranians have done that the Saudis do not run this apocalyptic jive scam the Iranians\nHave gone apocalypse though that's their that's their selling point so of course we turn to Lindsey Graham a hero of the conservatives not two weeks ago defending aggressively defending judge Brett Kavanaugh\nCalling Diane Feinstein out to our face calling the Democrats on that committee and the Judiciary Committee out to their faces for their their miss him out and non seasons as it related to Christine Blasey Ford and sweat Nick in Ramirez and the whole cabal\n\nSuddenly Lindsey Graham comes out and it feels to me like\nHe may have discovered some John McCain lollipops in a in a drawer and his Senate office because suddenly he sounds a lot more like John McCain the only thing missing from Lindsey Graham as my friends my friends my friends my friend and he said I have loved the sound I Love the Saudis not defend the Saudis I stand with the Saudi but NBS as bad guy\nTo celebrate this massive event route from five hundred dollars off your home solar system do things [noise] [noise] that's five hundred dollars off through Thanksgiving I'm can hardly CEO of some power but still or solar Biden you'd take advantage of this offer a stellar solar dot net that dollar solar dot net [noise]\nDid you see the car you rather do that then yeah mom it selection party lacks a mixture of don't ask for them can be that I Know mom let slip the fifth time what no I I'm just you know they\nTo have such a brilliant brother I Am an incredible and he told me that you don't know what I'm saying the six year and let me get my wine\nAnd compromise on the campus I can yeah years those that between about ... pounds back twice reflection that for young adults and if I get you a yeah I don't think ... is a word mom look at what they talk to your brain surgery school missed out on him in medical school\nCommuters make your mom I'm proud within the L certified ... says Carlsbad and enjoy peace of mind with a six year unlimited mile warranty that's right unlimited money [noise]\nPlus two years of complementary me same today ... largest selection of el certified Lexus Lexus calls then it's up on line today as much as it's called ... dot com [noise]\nImagine Pecker parked filled to capacity then imagine you have the microphone you have the chance to tell them all why they should do business with you you don't have to imagine anymore\nSeven sixty KF MB am reaches hundreds of thousands of listeners each week that's right I said hundreds of thousands of potential customers that could be yours if they only knew about you how could that impact your bottom line why do they return month after month well it works several our clients have been with us for decades ...\nAudience sports are sponsors enabling us to continue to bring you live in local programming\nThat matters to San Diego and\nHere's the best part it's more affordable than you might think\nOur experience team can tailor a campaign around almost anyone's budget\nTo put the power of am seven sixty can be to work for you today email Brian Busta at ... at ... dot com that's B.

question I'm going to give you my thought and then you tell me if I'm writing tell me if I'm wrong\nHere goes if if if\nElizabeth Warren wants to go down this road with the president can this be a good and for her\nCampaign she out Trump Trump because it seems like she's trying to play the act\nShe's trying to do the Trump act from twenty sixteen she's trying to show up loud and proud and she's ready to fight and she's going to give it to him and she's going to do this tank she'd pull that off what American politician is actually even able to try to pull that off\nEverything starts to look at a pale imitation\nIt's like oh you're just trying to be the female Trump you're just trying to me that here's the thing\nI don't know I'm trying to think of all the politicians\nOut there who could go that route that the president goes and be able to pull it off they are who they are few and far between\n\nThey are few and far between I'm just trying to think like [noise] ...\n[noise] what\nWhat is the the winning hand here so if you're going to go run against\nPresident Trump you're going to have to have a superior plan\nIf her plan is to offer socialism if her plan is to offer more control the government if her plan is more government in your lives like that's a dog right out of the box that's not going to work you're the Dow uh five forty eight today you have seven point one million unfilled jobs that are out there you have more openings than people who are sitting on unemployment\nThink about that um you you have a growing economy okay the interest rates are edging up a little bit but at some point Powell and the federal Federal Reserve are going to decide that they want to keep jacking up rates\nUn record receipts coming into the coffers but when you have an inability and an unwillingness to reduce the spending right\nElizabeth Warren is not going to reduce the spending she wants free college for everybody she wants open borders she she wants a a student loan forgiveness she wants a higher taxes on the wealthy higher taxes on producers higher taxes on stripers\n\nSo um ... what are we doing what are we doing what's the plan what are we doing\nWhat is the plan seriously I mean I'm I'm sitting here\nTrying to figure out what it is you're not going to be able to out Trump Trump\nJust couldn't\nJust like Reagan couldn't be al Reagan and Clinton couldn't be out Clinton um\nBig\nLarger than life personalities it doesn't work it doesn't work and in this day and age\nEverybody who tries to do with like ... trying to do it a little bit more is trying to do it\nI'm Cory Booker is trying to do it Spartacus trying I mean it it comes up short there's one van Halen okay\nThere's one van Halen you\nReally try to be van Halen there's one Metallica you can go trying to be Metallica but what can happen if people look at these originals and they go there and you try to be Metallica you sound a lot like Metallica is that a lot like van Halen you sound a lot\nLike I mean be your own sound be your own thing do your own thing the reason why President Trump won the election in twenty sixteen was that because of rude comments\nIt was because she went out there and work hard and spoke plainly to the American people had been left behind look MSNBC right now is John K sick he tried to do the crude crass act and he got shut\nDown he got shut down\nSo Elizabeth Warren's gonna come out now and say oh he's a second generation tax cheat and you're a you're a liar and you go back on your on your vows and you do all this kind of stuff OK\nWell right how'd you get a beach you you're not going to be trumped by trying to beat Trump\nYou say that again you're not going to beat Trump by trying to be Trump just like you were not going to beat Obama in two thousand eight by trying to beat Obama\nKnew you were going to need to fight that out differently\nWhen you get these sort of being shown gee politicians that come onto the scene and and let's be awesome and I'm not an Obama fan I wasn't a Clinton fan but they were new types of politicians and now you of course you have with with President Trump a new type of politician\n\nAnd the guys in his
