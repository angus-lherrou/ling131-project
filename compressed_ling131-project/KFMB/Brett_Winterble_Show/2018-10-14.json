properties for nearly a decade experience grows he uses that to help his clients so young and old become successful investors themselves\nJoining us now is Philip Becker realtor and founder of Becker properties in San Antonio Texas in two thousand fourteen Philip perceived to pursue just thirty under thirty award from any are and among his investment properties is one in the U.S Virgin Islands Phillip welcome to real estate today\nThanks rally David it's great to be here\nWe're delighted to hear and by the way good choice on where to locate your investment property [laughter]\nNot not a bad place to be beautiful son and Sandy beaches\nExcellent so Philip how old were you when you started investing in real estate\nWell and I bought my first investment property Steven I was twenty four years old wow it was a piece of land outside of San Antonio Texas what I did is I bought the land built a house on it and turned and sold the house and made about eighty thousand dollars profit\nSo filled up you also help your clients invest in real estate does your personal experience really help\nOh yeah absolutely especially with novice investors are people that a lot of people think you have to be cash heavy to get into the investment game and you know when I first started I wasn't they might my first investment was an owner finance deal and I bought that land with just ... percent down and\nSo I help a lot of investors especially being younger myself I'm thirty two now but I was twenty three when I got into real estate in two thousand nine\nAnd I have a lot of younger people that are able to help with investments and it's great to show them how\nYou know things like solar financing and even use responsibly financial products such as hard money alone can really help younger people build their portfolio\nI see no one at twenty or thirty something comes to you and says they want to invest and they have no idea how to do it how do you help them\nI think just with every other Clyde it starts with you know a buyer counseling session\nAnd one of the big things I tell my client is don't be afraid to invest outside your market you know even for people that are just getting started especially if there are a little bit low on cash they might not be able to afford their first investment property and the market where they live and that's why\nI mean getting involved with the national association committee such as the unprofessional network has helped me grow realtors that I trust throughout the country so a lot of times we send our new or investment clients to other markets where we have a great a referral partner that can help them as well\nSo here's a question of all the young people who you help become real estate investors how do they tend to pay for these places I guess\nKind of range across the gamut but it reminds me of one specific young lady that I help she was about twenty four years old when she came to me winds by her first investment property she did not have\nAmazing income but she had a fantastic credit in her case we did do the hard money route we bought the property for about sixty nine thousand dollars\nAll and we were in for a total of eighty seven and she was able to turn that pain or for a hundred and twenty seven thousand dollars make him about a thirty thousand dollar profit after closing costs on her first investment\nWhich was for her about an extra year salary at that time\nThat is amazing and fill up you just mentioned getting hard money loan which is a private individual or a private group who fund a mortgage without the requirements that a major national banquet half so tell us how do you find a hard money loans\nWhile they're there actually are lots of different hard money lenders and for the audience out there that's not the only way to accumulate properties outside of the traditional financing there's also portfolio allows but as far as hard money loans it's really just about networking and\nFinding other people that have done it we started group called the broker underground and the San Antonio area and it's been a great resource for over two thousand fulltime agents and brokers that share referral such as\nHard money lone individual so we've got an entire list of different people as well as feedback from ages good or bad on how\nThe experience was for the consumer and for the agent working with that hard money lenders so again I think networking is is so key for trying to find these individuals that become your business partners and and can help your clients\nFill up that is such great information so let me ask you if someone starts investing in real estate in their twenties what's that going to mean to their life and their financial security in the years that\nThey're simply ahead of the game you know there's that old Chinese proverb that says the best day to plant a tree was Twenty years ago and the second best day is now\nWith the people that are older you know what I mean for the people that are older\nIt's not too late but those that got started in investing in their twenties there simply ahead of the game and they're going to be able to stop working for money sooner so that their money can start working for them\nNice I Love that will fill up by really appreciate\nYou joining us on the show today and sharing your strategies your

instead of luggage essentially\nYeah so when I fly on\nOn one of the deep discounters which we have three in the United states spirit frontier in the region they charge you know the way the business model works is they may sell you a ticket for twenty dollars one way but the baggage charge will be more than the cost of the ticket even for a carry on\nSo there are now a variety of sellers selling jackets clothing items\nThat you can stuff with um close in them and you know or whatever electronics chargers whatever and nobody charges you for wearing a jacket\nSo are there is the biggest seller of the\nThe one that's best known as Scotty vast S. O. S. C. O. T. T. V. victory E. S. T. Scotty vast dot com\nAnd the cost of their items is really expensive but I only buy from their outlet where they're getting rid of the things that were slow sellers\nAnd they sell vast jackets pants I'm a variety of clothing items that inside have all kinds of pocket you can stop it and I have a puffer jacket that I bought from their outlet\nThat had nine pockets inside that I can ... a ton of stuff so um last flight on spirit I flew with the big puffy jacket and this micro carry on I have that I got a Costco that costs go sells for twenty nine dollars\nAnd so I had no baggage charge it all\nOut and all that work to tear up and out of the international as well oh yeah All right\nYeah so ah people stopping stuff in clothing is something Europeans have done for as far back as I can remember because there's a giant airline and Europe historically it's been one of the most profitable airlines and the world called Ryan air\nAnd Ryan ... was the one that originally came up with the idea of charging people separately for everything and so Europeans have been way ahead of us on wearing clothing that you could just stuff everything in the pocket so you wouldn't have to pay baggage charges\nSo that's great well thank you very much and I'm going to check out the website and of course their outlet store\nYes or anywhere else you should buy other than the discount you can get cars Scotty best normal prices bay or some serious prices and so the only way I Would ever buy one was something that had been a failed it was on the outlet\nI Am cheap sometimes aren't and Scott's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Scott\n... thanks for taking my call how you doing today I'm doing great thank you hope you are there some do and getting a little rain here from the store with Ellen through [noise] oh I'm Sorry I Hope not too much\nTo show my question is I I own two duplex in upstate New York and I have runners that turn over every couple of years or so I'm very frequently but my question is um who would you recommend a for to provide a service for doing background checks on potential renters\nWhile I'm going to suggest a couple of sites that have grown up since the real estate bust since so many people farmland orange now owning from typically one to five properties and it's hard to know how to do the background checks how to collect and all that and I lived\nOn the Internet and there's a lot of trouble services out there that want to charge anywhere from you know Nineteen dollars to you know upwards of fifty dollars\nSo sure well let me tell you about several first cozy CEOs the why have you seen that one cozy dot C. oh\n\nGosh when people use something other than dot com they get so confusing but it's ... CEO and cozy is set up specifically with an entire suite of services for independent landlords their number one thing is doing rent collection for people\n[noise] where the whole idea is that your tenets pay electronically through their platform and if somebody had entered paid on time their system automatically nose to build them whatever late fee is in your piece\n[noise] service charges they typically charge\nKind of a lot of the stuff they offer is free it's one of those premium business models like a lot of apps on a smartphone and they don't publish their\nPriceless are the things that they charge for\nBut if you'll let them [noise] bother you from time to time was so stunning emails you put in your email address and they'll send you a priceless for the things they do charge for ... you were allowed on a background check you charge the tennis for that\n[noise] right and if it only do\nSo these services white cozy dot CEO and another one I'll mention that's owned by trans

application fee and that applications the\nCovers the cost of you running the background check than what you'll find as you look through different sites if you want to find a list of a lot of them probably you could look at ... dot com which is kind of a clearinghouse of information for landlords\nBut the what they consider to be a background check varies from site to site like some of them all they do basically as a simple credit check where others will do a more thorough background check to see if somebody has been in trouble with the law and that kinda stuff\n[noise] so what what level would you recommend as far as going how deep would you do a background check a potential to\nThat is impossible to answer and I think it depends on your experience as a landlord what areas have been traumatic\nFor you with tenets that there have been any I mean if we're really\nFelt for a lot of landlords the only real issue is ever been to somebody pay on time and in that case\nIf that's been your historical pattern doing a traditional credit check is all you need to do on the other hand if you've had problems with tenants\nOf skip to maybe have done the illegal activities and one of your rental properties or anything like that then ... really based on that experience would want to do a much more involved background check to jazz of a\nCriminal background check as well\n[noise] I I've
