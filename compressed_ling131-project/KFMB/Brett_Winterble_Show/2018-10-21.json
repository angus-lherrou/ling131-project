of all how's business\nBusiness is great right now the economy's doing very well if there was more inventories would be even better\nI see So Peter let's talk about investing with the goal of setting us up with a steady income in our senior years now you said a great example there because I understand you own fifty two apartments in Massachusetts and fifty properties in Florida Peter that's a lot\nWell I've always been involved and investment in commercial real estate and I really like numbers and calculating and it's one of the fastest a real estate that you can get to do that and being able to calculate numbers and whatnot you look at some of the deals that\nAnd they realize that this is how you can make money and you're really using\nTenants and what not\nTo pay the bill when did things work out practically\nOh I Love that because you have a mortgage on the place might as well let someone else pay\nIs so what happens is that you've got a property let's rent it out and you know you do have expenses and whatnot but if you buy properly or your comics feature expenses\nBut because of the tax code in pre shake the property which helps self employed people on the church so having said that you get to the pre she ate on your tax returns now which again help self employed people and then you get to use the property\nAnd the cat shelter and then you have income retirement so that

such a great plan So Peter I'd like to ask you how one of our listeners would get started but first of all let's circle back to something you just said which is planning it out so that you buy the property earlier in life and then it's paid off the day you retire\nThat's the ideal player than when I have a new raging there somebody comes into real estate school and asks us you know what to part of what I teach somebody to do is is that it's almost like a life\nPlan this is how you do your business to pay your bills and keep the lights on to feed your family but it's how you build towards

R. E.

R. E. S.\nBasically means that you take an education and the training to work with seniors at different ages and nobody wants to be called older except for like the four year old or wishes he was\nFive years old [laughter] but so the designation kind of runs from baby boomers I Need a little bit earlier\nPeople who are just thinking about things like downsizing all the way up to folks who are almost a hundred years old there's a lot lower planning family conference saying things like that that go on them and the typical sale and there's a big need because sometimes people are taking advantage of\nI see now according to its very definition the seniors real estate specialist designation is meant to help people fifty years old and older\nWith all their real estate needs as you said so one of those needs may well be investing in real estate in your later years so tell me is that a smart idea or is that something you're better off starting\nIn your twenties thirties and forties\nMy opinion is is better off starting it early\nBecause that's the real estate basically asked for different areas of possible gain\nThe first is appreciation property obviously rises in price over time as area around it does as well second profit center is that the tenant increases your equity by essentially helping you pay your mortgage three is cash low\nRent better bigger than ... and depreciation so in order to put all for those to work you really want to get started\nEarly mhm to be a first time in ... in real estate as you get older I Would say hesitate or perhaps a look at things like reach real estate investment trust that you can basically purchase through an investment advisor more like a a security than a real estate purchase itself\nBut that makes a lot of sense because after all a real estate investment trust is more like buying stock and you're not a landlord and you don't have begun sees you don't have to qualify for a mortgage it can make a lot of sense no matter what your age is\nAbsolutely it's kind of one of those things that if she believed that real estate boats appreciation generates cash flow which it tests historically done that's a great way not to be\nThe only one on the hook you know being an individual owner of real estate has is kind of a yeah you're the person in a ... year spread out what's hundreds of other people buying\nBlocks investment property and professional property management\nI see so that's good advice here if you are already an older person it might not be the best move to start real estate investing at your age but for all those people who might be a little bit younger than that it can reap great benefits in the years ahead\nAbsolutely interesting fact the last forty years appreciation and least January has averaged about three percent per year coincidentally or maybe not the wage growth in our area three percent a year\n... so if you believe that our economy is strong enough to keep wage\nGrowth unemployment on track

home so with these people do is they guarantee lie in the case of open door and\nIts competitors they guarantee you that they'll they'll evaluate your home they may come in and they'll do that on line they may come in and do an inspection\nAnd then they will make a firm offered to you to buy your home and then with the idea being that you've vacate really quickly typically within a month can be quicker but\nThey just buy it and they charge you roughly the equivalent of a real estate commission do what they charge you about six percent\nOf all I'd say just for argument's sake they said the house was worth two hundred thousand they would pay you like one eighty eight somewhere in there and you're out and you're just going\nTo the question with any of them oh and the reason they do that is they believe that they develop systems open door and his competitors leave they develop systems\nWhere they can properly price Waterhouse [noise] get it I'm dressed up however they need to end the landscaping or inside\nAnd get it sold quicker than you can with you going to a traditional real estate agent and having them market the traditional way whether or not these things are going to\nStand the test of time the market will decide the weight you get out of it is you're just done if you like the price\nStand the test of time the market will decide the weight you get out of it is you're just dont know if you like the price they offer you ma'am you're out no questions no ifs you know you're done you don't have to worry about showing the house or anything like that\nI see okay and you also have to decide the price that you were offered\nTo you think they're low balling you or do you feel like it's really a decent offered they're making\nFor your house all day does that make so\nYes yes it does I just wanted to have an idea what they're about whether or not you know they were\nTotally totally legit\nNo doubt that this is a a a real thing and the company's doing this I think another one is offer pat I think is another one and there's another one called knock\nAnd so these companies they're learning how to price they're learning how to market their learning how to sell\nAnd then they add cities around the country very heavy emphasis on the south south west and west and the reason those areas because those are areas of the country that developed along the automobile have a lot of suburban housing a lot of ... a a subdivisions and developments\nBuilt with very similar\nHousing plans and looks so they can more accurately price to house they're not interested\nIn really high end houses 'cause they don't know exactly how to price them and how easily they'll sell and they're not interested in the houses that tend to be a neighborhood so I said there in transition that maybe had been rough neighborhoods trying to get better or something like that\nBut it is the real deal\nAnd Tom is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Tom\nHi how're you doing stuff that corporate thank you Tom how can a medium service\nWhile about a year and a half ago I got us will stay so the mail for a credit card from a small business and I thought well let me go and sign up for this 'cause it never hurts to have a backup card Kay she made it\nSo I I when I got the cars started isn't that because it actually had a better catch that war than the one I was using this way so that was going fine one afternoon I got an email from the credit card companies saying well we've got your address change which obviously was a mine so I called them\nStop the stuff's card you know sent me a new one the whole smear at that point I threw the cart into the to my file and started using my original heart again and last September this last September I got the same message from the credit card company so I called them\nThey went to the old and so they sent me a new card and then it happened again and October ... three times as happened it's been a different addressed it by mail and then the car too so I talk to the company and they sent me on the frog department and the whole thing I did ask them I said no other cars I have\nFor a second level security where they would ask you a question like you know who's your favorite rock group ... year old um entry school\nWho is your art rock group called the purple okay now I Know the code to get any of your credit [laughter] I'm not allowing gay [laughter]\nBut they said they are or they said that they they they gave me some lame excuse to say well people can guess that well maybe that now but it's still a ship that level of security they should offer\nLike there's an issue though that I Need to point out to you the reason the card issue or may not care as much with a business credit card\nIs business credit cards don't enjoy the consumer protections then a consumer card does under pre existing law and the card act was passed after the banking scandals\nSo the Congress carved out exception to consumer protections for business cards so as an example\nLet's say a criminal did run up a lot of charges on your car and if they were successful you able to take it over and run up charges their credit card company with a business card can say oh well\nWe don't think that you time took good precautions and so we're going to hold you liable for their charges our wedding which they cannot do want to consumer car so I don't like even if you're using a card\nFor business purposes I like for you to get a consumer card and just use it in your business and pay for it from your business [noise]\nOkay so is it less course apps and then there's this does have this account close you know\nIf you've been hit three times by people attempting to take over the account and divert the bills so that you don't know that false charges are being made I Would say three strikes and they're out", "show_name": "Brett Winterble Show", "year": "2018", "city": "San Diego", "day": "21"}
