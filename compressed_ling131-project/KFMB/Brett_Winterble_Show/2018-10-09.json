radio coming up in the next hour we're going to have radio crochet and then um we will be making sugar cookies and the four o'clock hour and then it will be painting with ...\nOr so there was um there was Cox and knew some now here's an email to tell the difference Cox has a very nice voice very smooth very polished very money some people would say\nAnd then you've got the news some kind of talks like this a little bit he's like hey let me tell you something I was doing and into some anytime you name it day or night night or day handed out heroin needles slip it on ...\nYou name it San Francisco is a great town with great values that we are going to impose on all of you know he was ... before the boy\nOne twenty five okay let's let's check in here let's hear a little excerpt from this debate that happened in the last few hours\nThis is er Cox the new some new somebody Cox go far enough job\nAs lieutenant governor you have a difficult relationship with Jerry Brown at the beginning you tangled publicly with the state Senate president pro tem over\nGun control I get along extraordinarily well with the legislature currently I get along and got along very well with most of the members of the San Francisco board of supervisors but\nOf course you do its majority Democrat you get along with everybody I go ahead\nI'm interested in change or you know changing the order things as difficult some people have different points of view\nOf the speakers of different point of view on single payer financing or members of the San Francisco board of supervisors at different points of view on homeless strategies and different points of view on healthcare strategy so look I'm In a certain myself I'm going to be bold are not many people came to my defense when we advance same sex marriage you didn't include that you should\nBecause the overwhelming majority of Democrats in this country some of the most uh I think well known democratic leaders were very very critical publicly uh my willingness to lean into that I took on the national Rifle Association or they weren't police or by\nUh those efforts to require background checks not just for gun purchases but now I mean there's some purchases so if you're looking for timidity I'm not your person if you're looking for someone to be bold and courageous lean into issues change the order of things I'm committing myself to that causes the next governor\nYou think though that you can be bold a and not timid without getting in fast\nWith your eye on the periodic look I've been doing this for some time and there's there's areas of disagreement and\nSome I come from the private sector where I have to work with people and get things done and achieve results and I've done that for forty years and not everybody in my team agrees with everything that we have but we what we got to do is we got to get people allied around common goals and try to figure out the way to reach those goals and I think that's what I'm gonna do is go to\nOur and for you I have a question about values you started off your political life as a Democrat\nFor life as a Democrat you ran in Illinois to be a delegate to the Nineteen Seventy six democratic convention here then he became a Republican you ran for local office in Chicago and then the U.S Senate from Illinois guy named Brock Obama won that and you write for president in two thousand Seventy thousand eight\nAnd I just wanted to read refresh some of the points you made during those times you said oh we need a federal marriage amendment to keep same sex couples from marrying you said we have and I'm quoting we have a problem with transvestite teacher she uh you said that if we don't use common sense we will quote open the floodgates the polygamy and best ...\nUh and all kinds of other things and you know I could go on but I'm I'm guess I'm asking is what does what does that say you've got your values and about your um your kinda governor you\n... your ... specifically referring to uh you know the issue of gay marriage and others well maybe so but you know the fact of the matter is that the those were many many years ago I have a ball done those issues and frankly just like a rock Obama and Hillary Clinton\nWho both opposed gay marriage are very strongly for a long time they've all may change but you know I think the the thing to take away from all that is at all the way through my efforts be in the past\nI've been fighting against the establishment about corruption or you\nKnow my mom was a Chicago school teacher that's what led me to want to fight corruption is the corruption of the special interests that are making California too expensive and too on equal for people and that's what I'm going to attack and California's\nOkay so\nI mean what I'm discerning from the debate here is\nGavin Newsom like man I'm old school communist socialist Democrat man I I redefine marriage I took I tried to grab people's guns I did all this other kind of stuff and then the cake you read the moderator there are a William ... William ... linguine spine uh he says uh\nHey you know some nuts you kind of nuts but the only way nuts I mean you were\nAll against like this other stuff that was where you were trying to make you look nuts or you know I'm not nuts John Cox says I'm not not some of the whole thing we've all we've all avant\nCould have just please talked about taxes because we have talked about split property tax rolls do we have talked about say creating a climate for business so we have talked about banning straws but allowing heroin needles to lay on the streets of San Francisco\nHonest honest to goodness must\nCheck out the last uh Ninety seconds and that's got a hold on I'm going to take a break I Want to get shot at it in here with an update well finish up with these two are individuals who want to be the governor of the state of California eight hundred seven sixty KF MB\n... whatever we'll show him seven sixty talking breaking news just shut up until it is a major oil companies shut down production of two of its offshore drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico and are evacuating staff as a precaution ahead of hurricane Michael storms expected to make landfall along the eastern Gulf Coast as a category ... storm on Wednesday\nSupreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh sought to put a bruising confirmation battle behind him today at a White House ceremony but President Trump declared cabin on innocent of sexual misconduct and apologized for the heated process months after leaving the White House Hope Hicks will head to Fox\nTo become a new chief communications officer Hicks served as White House communications director and director of strategic communications for the Trump Administration until she left in April of this year [noise] you're never more than Fifteen minutes away from the top stories of the day on the ... winter will show camp seven sixty talk and breaking news\nTells you about it that we talk about it I Am seven sixty talk\nAnd breaking news\nSeven sixty tried to get a free way South Bend in Adams avenue and accidents are a little bit earlier left side of the freeway affected Seventy eight three way west ... wrote in San Marcos an accident taking of two lanes for quite a time it has cleared but just pulled off the road recently ... going to get by Fifteen funnel arms gonna get any tomorrow morning sometimes they'll than a name seven sixty to support sponsored by the California earthquake authorities\nOnce again for another am seven six feet tall\nFor me to grab a taco with your favorite post at five thirty PM then listen to the talk of seven it's tacos and talk tickets sold out keep listening\nPresented by west automotive roof October twenty third of the movies are listening to with seven sixty talk to you is\nThis is Kyle crashed Cooper John Reeves with ... point real estate friends there was never been a better time or should I say more important time to call my friend John ribs\nIf you're thinking about selling your home you know the market has changed and it's slowing down dramatically reading here inventories up one hundred percent in homes available on the market has doubled since July so it's critical that you work with an agent that you can trust and want to actually guarantees your success every time in writing\nDon't risk letting the market dictate your home sale called John Reeves today he's the top Egypt in San Diego he understands this market and own ready has the buyers in fact if you're home doesn't sell at your agreed upon price John Will buy it guaranteed in writing\nListen John already has the buyers and he'll show you his entire database over four thousand ready buyers looking to buy right now so your own good already be sold called John Reid said eight five eight eight hundred home and start packing that's eight five eight eight hundred home\nTermites are swarming don't like termites kick you out of your home if you suspect your property may have termites stay home and call the orange oil exports ex termite\nGive us a call and talk to details corporate sales consultancy eight five eight five seven one thirty one hundred or email as a business that\nDetails as dot com da T E.

... house majority leader Kevin McCarthy will introduce a bill this week\nThat will fully fund the president Donald Trump's plan to wall along the U.S border with Mexico there by setting the mid term elections up as a referendum on immigration policy this according to Breitbart News\nOutgoing Speaker Paul Ryan hinted at a post election border wall funding fight on Monday we intend to have a full fledged discussion on how to complete our mission to secure the border and yes we will have a fight about this rye instead of the wall fight that looms\nAt a news conference on Monday\nNow Breitbart News Ken exclusively report exactly what's expected to happen in the lead up to and immediate aftermath of the mid term election first McCarthy his office confirmed to Breitbart News will introduce a bill this week that includes the full funding for the border wall about twenty three point four billion dollars\nMore than what has already gone to the wall effort as well as several other enforcement measures that have already passed the house of representatives Congress has already directed one point six billion to wall funding in the omnibus spending bill for fiscal year twenty Eighteen that just passed\nThe Congress and McCarthy's new bill titled the build the wall enforce the law act would take the wall the rest of the way\nIn addition to providing a variety of enforcement measures\nQuote for decades America's inability to secure our borders and stop illegal immigration has encouraged millions to undertake a dangerous journey to come here in violation of our laws and create a huge loophole the legal channels to the immigration process where America welcomes immigrants to our country\nPresident Trump's election was a wakeup call to Washington the American people want us to build the wall and enforce the law maintain strong borders is one of the basic responsibilities of any nation for too long America has failed and its responsibility\nEnforcement measures expected to be in the wall funding legislation include among other legislation case law enforcement bill named ... who was killed in San Francisco and the lead up to the twenty sixteen presidential election case law\nPassed the house to fifty seven oh one sixty seven last year\nAlso included will be a bill the house has already passed targeting sanctuary cities know sanctuaries for criminals act which passed the house last year to twenty eight to one Ninety five the criminal alien gang member removal act which passed the house last year or two thirty three to one Seventy five will be in the bill\nAs well to house resolution on immigration that passed the house this year one up holding an honoring immigration and Customs Enforcement officers the other admonishing illegal alien voting in a number of American cities\nMcCarthy's forthcoming bill though will not deal with DACA the illegal\nExecutive amnesty program that former president Brock Obama implemented\nGranting temporary status administratively to illegal alien use or obese or programs in other words the bill will be enforcement and security only dealing only with those more contentious immigration policy matters in future legislation after the wall funding is secured\nAnd enforcement of immigration law strict\n\nMcCarthy's bill and the introduction comes as he travels Wednesday today no tomorrow to the U.S border with Mexico where the wall will be built to meet with border patrol agents while on the border and McCarthy will receive an operations in threat briefing from the border patrol\nGiven that the new bill comes from majority leader McCarthy and this bill contains several other measures already passed by the house with high margins of success\nThe prospects for passage of promising and the Senate however a measure like this faces grammar prospects as Republicans cling to eight fifty one forty nine majority and would need sixty votes declare a filibuster hurdle on a cloture vote and less Senator Mitch McConnell the majority leader in the Senate changed the Senate rules something he's resisted doing a made enormous pressure\n\nRepublican Senate reinforcements will not arrive until January twenty Nineteen when the new Congress has sworn in so that means whatever the house passes and late twenty Eighteen for it to become law unless the Senate goes for it this year we need to be
