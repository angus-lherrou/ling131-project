U.S President Trump is calling us in a salt on our country\nI think Democrats something Democrats\nRepublicans were young\nAnd the individual the second or known terrorists that try to in our country illegally every day seven sixty talk\n\nTo somebody and suspected or known terrorists to try to get into the country every day\nTo day no good to know Sarah on a cell kicking us off hello sorrow welcome to the program what's on your mind\nHey how're you doing I'm All right that's\nGood and so\nI I when I woke up this morning and I was hearing about these things and I the the packages being sent\nSomething didn't smell you know I Lived in New York during nine eleven and and my government building was shut down and so I remember what it's like to go through terrorism and this is not it and it just didn't feel right they didn't feel like some ... ... right winger to head\nAll the sudden coordinated all these bombs to go out especially with all of the discrepancy is within the packages and so that we're hearing about and you know the the Democrats are losing the argument though\nThey had they no longer have the caravan because you know there's all this reporting about how you just play the sound bite their Sanders talking about\nHow there are known or suspected terrorists in that group and you have people literally on TV saying oh you know coming here for work and literally in the brain is that guy affected them tear it yeah it is they're just in that argument at so\nAnd they lost the cabin argument they nearly lost that and they are the ones perpetuating mob rule right now and so what do they do they want to say well you know maybe they just like I don't know that it\nStill so plan but it certainly is designed I think ultimately to create the idea that there's also these radical right people that are just out to get them I mean it's just I just do\nIt do what do you what do you do you think is responsible for what has happened today but what's your what is your spite essentially\nFighting and said that the the in the but I don't know that that that\nThe the little far fetched right given that is we're talking about for our president you know and I don't do that at the end it really can hire somebody like you know that it would go that crazy but it certainly\nAnd that like your idea about it for an actor and um you know that perhaps if there's Russian involvement or Chinese involvement in that and they don't care about you know putting one as a sacrificial lamb out that they could have the desired you know that they want\nThey want to stop Trump because he's about to say no to the uh deal with Reagan and garbage out about that in the armed and you get totally tear that sucker out that he is doing all the things that terrorists and they don't like it and so the only way to stop them and that they can control something\nSee I see I see okay and the huge huge possibilities right I mean we just we do not know ages either is any number of possibilities\nBut what I think it's so curious is that there's this hyper focus on the tone the president is using at his rallies in speeches and things like that and they're saying that that is the core problem that is the fundamental problem rather than them looking inward and saying what have we done in terms of creating a culture in this country that there is such massive distrust\nThat there are at least half the people in the country thinking the DNC would execute an attack like this and vice versa that they are\nResponsible like neither political parties wanting to have that conversation and said they want to attack vague things like the tone which is weird but\nI mean when he came out very strongly today again I mean\nWell they say they had CNN came out and said well no he write it off of a teleprompter which\nI it's stupid I mean they're they're they're they're they're picking nets and they are splitting hairs and they are they are looking for the most ... reduced argument possible\nAnd the reality is we have a lot of work to do as a people in this country and we are the only people that can fix it we should not ever rely on cable talking heads to try to fix it because it's not going to happen for\nPeople like that and I'm Sorry for Arnold often but it is higher than the other hand if they're going to is I'm Sorry but in the mirror would you like the hotter the cattle which one\nOf you know when you're talking about Trump rallies they certainly try to create and foment this idea that there are these right radical at a rally us by having people hired it go and create crop is a very differently from what you know feeling is rally here in California yes there's\nYour ever forget when it comes to me saying we'll\nDo that and so that was all pay people\nAnd those were people who are out there at literally making trouble I appreciate your call center and I hope you call back again 'cause you've got great insights on this stuff\nShe's a ...

has a wonderful Twitter thread oh he has\nA bomb disposal experts\nHe said whoever made these bombs which is a joke or there's wires on both sides are why are they reading the press nearly suppose an active\nPipe bombs or we don't have any sort of post markings as far as where they where they were sent from when they were sent 'em there is not a lot of evidence here to show number one that it was a Trump supporter but number two that it was even a serious attempt it's more like a whole\nA and that's really what I'm ... the prevailing theme here is that\nBecause of the construction of the bombs and I would say bombs loosely sure odd that you know how how can you plant so many bombs and none of them go on a you know that that seems more of a hoax than an ... a a true attempt\nIn creating carnage uh and and so we have all of these\nAnomalies of course that the press is completely ignorant to because they would rather as you say quite a victim\nCard because I've never seen so many people within the Democrat Party wanting to be victims ah whether you're victims of the patriarchy or you're suffering from ... to arrangements syndrome\nOr ... you know these types of manufactured psycho Steve because of Trump's election\nOr you're suffering from trying to arrange and then drop a ... you know these types of manufactured ... because of Trump's election has now kind of manifests itself within the mainstream media and they are nothing but extension of the Democrat Party\nThe other thing that strikes me is what is and I know we can what if a lot of different angles here but you know what if we get to this place where it turns out this was a foreign actor undertaking this\nUh some lone wolf some want to be some some person decides they want to be an ISIS person or they want to be an al ... a person or there are Russian it's looking as so troubles\nDuring our campaign I mean we we harking back remember in the immediate aftermath of the electorate inauguration of President Trump's\nAmerica was Bush sat with an epidemic of anti Semitism remember the epidemic of threats to Jewish centers around the country and it was all attributable this anti Semitism even though President Trump was was one of the most vocal advocates\nFor defending Israel working with Israel moving the capital of Jerusalem suddenly anti Semitism was the order of the day only to come to find out that the anti Semitic threats that were being called into\nThe temples and and to schools and to a community centers are those were coming out of Israel by somebody who is who is getting their Jollies calling via Skype to call in bomb threats we\nDon't know what's responsible for this and the idea that it's all Donald Trump's rhetoric driving it I think is absurd\nIt's absolutely absurd and then of course we have another bomb that supported by the gateway pond and seemingly market was or a sticker or\nOur eyes ... rice and there are multiple foreign actors here I've got a Democrat keep telling us why aren't you interfere in the near term so why why are they not applying\nOdd that same type of you know quote unquote logic I had that type of interfering in the mid term election we're going to have to ask ourselves\nTo benefit from this ah chaos normally create chaos who are alive on chaos in order to ... create fear\nI and I said to you before now say it again the Democrats rely on near in order to notice a air base\nThe fear is that very much for them and if you have a ball or manipulating emotion I it's easy to manipulate\nA fear it's easy to manipulate and to control and so again who knows something to fear well I Would\nReport that the Democrat Party and so as I I Believe that this type of hysteria\nOr it can create a tool in order to try to regain whatever blue wave
